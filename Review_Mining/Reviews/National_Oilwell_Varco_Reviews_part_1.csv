bad,"The company is very badly managed, performance and commitment are  not rewarded, employees are not respected and not valued. There is a culture of bullying and intimidation that is not acknowledged and no action is taken to improve the work environment, there is no leadership and no vision ... laziest and worst employees get rewarded while good employees are overworked and underpaid"
bad,Very bad management. Do not care one bit about employees. Constantly reorganizing and churn. Everyday you thought that u were going to be let go. Couldn’t leave there quick enough.
bad,"This is by far the worst organization I have ever worked for. I left this place without having another job to go to( Not Wise) but it is that bad there. I was blessed to find a REAL job working with REAL professionals and people that actually went to school and were and are qualified to do their jobs. There are racist of all kinds there, HR is an absolute joke to the point when the young lady gave me her card if I had questions, I tossed it in the parking lot. You will not grow nor develop,you will work among very ignorant people, and you will feel as if you are in the 1950's. The only words I can use to describe  some of the people and most of the management is sick. Remember folks, this place was ran buy the same guy who shot at the cops and wanted them to kill him, he was all over the news. I remember this guy walking around with another idiot ( BM) and were two of the dumbest individuals i have ever met."
bad,Company will take your best years and replace you was done to me and seen it done to others. NOV is more adequate as a training ground than a company quality has gone down the drain.
bad,"Gestão horrível, mandou funcionários embora por conta de afinidade, cargos dentro da mesma são através da famosa peixada"
bad,Pay is low compare to other company. Managers lack management skill. It’s a good old boy system for advancement. If you want advancement you’ll have to go somewhere else.
bad,Only if your related and white they'll help you even then they still back stabb each other for job titles. Only people you kiss butt move up to tell someone that know s more than them what to do.
bad,"They bring you on and give you one day of training and then send you on your way to process invoices. God for bid you don’t understand something that they already told you and you have to ask them twice. And NO mistake are welcome. They load you down with work of invoices and emails and then you get in trouble if you over look an email. Promised to get hired on after the hours are met then once meet they tell you that your contract is for 6 months so they are going to wait. Heads up, when they start giving work that they normally give to you to a new person then you know your days are numbered. And their utilities, are their hot item, have to paid right away, I get that! But they are all over the place, bills are sent to the locations and you have to wait and beg them for the copies with coding and approval then explain why the payment is late. They work you to death and don’t appreciate you."
bad,Work environment is hostile. There is no room for advancement. No raises. They will use you until it no longer fits there need. They don't appreciate their employees or the work that they do. Management is horrible the micromanagement everything.
bad,"Given the years and amount of effort put into the company I’d warn anyone NOT to make a career choice of NOV. "
bad,"No one help everyone fight for keep the job almost all personal don’t have study and certification and are team leaders also no education "
bad,"NOV Brandt in Conroe,  TX has grown accustomed to constantly laying off employees.  So much that they actively avoid making new employees feel welcome or wanted there.  They will constantly change work hours to accommodate production needs."
bad,"I worked hard for nearly 5 years, dedication committed to deliver exceptional results always ready to support and help people in other areas of production"
bad,"The manager was unprofessional and had his favorites.  I overheard gossiping between the manager and other employees.  I would not work here, it is too chaotic."
bad,"There is poor management and to much hostility"
bad,upper management will tell you one thing and then do the exact opset they cover their own self are out for themselves look for reasons to downsize very high turnover rate
bad,"The most greedy company i have ever seen in my life.  Company cares more about if the managers get their bonus, and will work the hourly people to death to meet that goal.  Staff can go years without a raise, and the company healthcare continues to get worse and worse."
bad,work was good just the branch that i was at was a little too small home town. It was very political and all about who you know. Would like a job with more movement up.
bad,"Management is not professional, job was disorganized, after a two weeks I had not been trained for the job.  Slow at everything.  Discouraging.  Unfair. The company should train managers on how to treat employees.  "
bad,"The credit department where I used to work has been  demolished by a woman who became the  director two and a half years  ago. When she took over the department, there were 24 employees, only three of those employees remain with  that department."
bad,"terrible shop to work for due to management issues, technician get horrible treatment even though they are the back bone to the shop. unapproved time off requests constantly."
bad,I worked there for 3 years if you apply with ANY company trying to better your life they will fire you. worked long hours everyday and missed out on so much home life with the 2 weeks on and 4 days off.
bad,Non structure environment with lack of leadership>Very racists environment with forced overtime. Team leaders lack the experience and knowledge to be respectful to their co workers.
bad,"Not kept clean, Staph Virus is everywhere. Managers are slave drivers. Would not recommend working here ever!  Overly strict on everything. Get in trouble for clocking in 1 minute late but only have two clocks for the WHOLE warehouse!"
bad,"The plant that I worked in operates 7 days a week, and if you miss ,even on the weekends, you will face disciplinary actions. There is no time for family or any kind of life, as you work 12 hours a day too."
bad,"Manager and employees do not show up for work. "
bad,The work was not bad i would always have something to do work wise. The people where not bad is was the lead and the favorite ones that i dont agree with but the facilitys was not bad at all.
bad,work in really bad conditions and never get moved up in the company because of favoritism and who you know. if you speak up you get less hours and irrelevant job duties till you quit or get laid off
bad,"conroe plant He will not give employees proper raises and treats the employees unfair due to all the advancements going to the ""friends"" of the boss."
bad,"I wish that it was possible to stay. Economy went down as did oil prices. All of my co workers were great to work with.  Management was great, co workers were amazing."
bad,Management has very poor employee relationship including communication skills. Poor planning skills. Leadership skills are not in the range of nonexistent.
bad,"great company to work for. while oilfield was booming, the pay was the best. company has great benefits and your duties and work ethic is noticed and praised. great supervisor. overall, the best work years I have had."
bad,If you love to kiss up to management for low pay and below industry standard benefits then this is the job for you. Management in Canada likes to keep you down and there is  no room for advancement. At the first sign of a drop in the economy they lay you off immediately even though they may have 10record years in a row everyone is disposable. It is a toxic work environment where if you don't agree with management then you will be let go. Other divisions within the company seem ok but stay away from downhole and distribution.
bad,"I wish I had never worked here. On a positive note, maybe all of the knowledge I acquired myself (because they offer no real training) will launch me into another O&G career"
bad,I was a Level 1 NDT Technician thank the Lord its over terrible pay terrible work life balance terrible management and NO advancement
bad,"Horrible work experience, management was unprofessional, they would come to work in reef shoes and a mouth full of dip.  Dip cups all over the office, and most workers would come in with dirty shirts and wrinkled clothing."
bad,"Machinist, (former employee), provo,Utah"
bad,"horrible place to work, horrible pay,"
bad,Nothing good about here no time off lots of overtime. managment dont care about employees unless your in the group!
bad,"the worst management ever.   They have lost mostly all of their clients and employees.  no leadership at all, no communication and miserable salaries."
bad,"1.Daily I am mainly working for variance control."
bad,You work 4 ten hour shifts. The pay is low for the work we perform. Treated me with little to no respect after i mentioned to them that i was from North. When i went full time i recieved $0.50 less than the employees going full time. and on top of that i got thrown onto 2nd shift without notice and was told to quit if i didnt like it.
bad,Company finds any reason to deny your expenses as a field tech. On call 100% of the time and management will not have your back. If you get hurt on the job they will put you under a microscope and write you up for anything and everything.
bad,A typical day at work is me arriving a six in the morning and arriving to start a line on production. bad management  and horrible ethnic  culture supposed to be cultruly appropriate but nov only hires spanish speakers.
bad,"Management never seen, supervisors who barely speak to you and don't know the tools, only in a supervisory position because they came from a company that was bought over. No direction or leadership, can do what you want. Not treated very well, no infrastructure to help you do your job. Never seen a place where everyone is out for themselves more than here. I have always heard terrible things about NOV but didn't believe it until I seen it for myself. Please take my word, do not work for NOV, its reputation for treating staff bad is well merited."
bad,"I'm posting this because I just heard the same radio ad which had me apply for a job with NOV and thought I should relay my experience and thoughts of them. "
bad,This is a dead end job. There is no room for advancement. I was there for 5 years and was underpaid by $3/hr. Not once did I get a pay raise not even one to help with cost of living in California. Management is pretty terrible. Everyone expects you to do the workload of 3 individuals and then gets on to you when you don't complete it all. Pretty hostile work environment. Co-workers were jerks. If you have a company vehicle they take money out of your checks to pay for them. Not a very good thing when you're getting underpaid. They act as if your sole purpose in life is to work for them nonstop with no breaks. Terrible safety culture almost non existent. If you see an opening run the other way.
bad,"Coworkers are amazing, thank god because you couldn’t make it thru without them! Management is a JOKE! If you want to work at a place where if you do a good job then you are expected to do more and do others work and do not EVER expect a “pat on the back” because it will never happen.... Exactly why the turnover rate is thru the roof..."
bad,"The management in Abu Dhabi is horrible. Terrible working atmosphere , no backing from the supervisors and if anything goes wrong the full blame is on the Mechanical Technicians who go the field . Too many relatives working in the same company and backing is just for them"
bad,Company's new upper management is horrible.  They are very unconcerned about employee's morale.  Not suitable to run a company as large as NOV.
bad,"Sugarland plant very un - organized low pay, buddy system, management have no clue what ' s going on....Human resources is not for the employees very racist I would'nt recommend this job to my enemy stay away far away from this place....."
bad,buena relación con los superiores reuniones en sala de juntas para ver dudas y recomendaciones para mejorar el entendimiento y saber que se necesita mejorar para un mejor desempeño
bad,"Check up the personnel and operation.Take sample of cuttings and run retort to get %age of oil on cuttings.Write and send daily report.Attend morning and evening meetings.Supervise those working with me."
bad,"Comprised of 100s of companies forced into one due to M&A, NOV lacks a single culture that resembles the body of its workforce. Leadership has continuously failed to properly integrate new businesses and form a single work culture that thrives. Too much autonomy creates a work environment where employees are battling each other, not working with each other for common goals."
bad,"This place will give you high blood pressure , working atmosphere is very pressure able, they will make you clean floor too .................................!!!"
bad,"-inexperienced managers given leadership roles. Not earned by ability. "
bad,poor leadership. Poor training. Bad behavior is often rewarded. Long hours benefits are good but that's the only good thing i can say.There are few good people but not enough
bad,"Initially the job started ok, but after a few months I found that there were many  very abusive agents and managers who would purposefully try to undermine any efforts to do my job.  Once I tried to discuss any issues then it became apparent I was marked and any future was limited."
bad,I wouldn't remend this job they lie and dont give u what u deserve in pay...also they work u to the bone and expect u to work 80 to 90 hrs a week....in Odessa they put to many guys in apartment and some guys have to stay in closet its ridicules no reson for a rish company to do this to there employees they need to treat them right....and pay them what they deserve.....if u want to move up this is not the company because nothing will happen as far as raises go.
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for. No support from management, they wont fight for you unless you're a friend. Just garbage of a company. Get experience and move on."
bad,No local office management. The manager that was there as well as the other employees absolutely hated their jobs and were envious when I obtained a new job.
bad,Poorly organized with no attention placed on the value of employees relocating to area. Employees on 14/14 rotation are scattered in several locations causing unnecessary delays and costly Travel Time which the employees must absorb out of their own pocket.
bad,"If you don't want a life and want to bust your butt for a little bit of money and a lot of over time with no time off this job is for you."
bad,"National Oilwell Varco is a fast paced environment that does not properly promote safety within the workplace. Once you reach the goal of management, they do not feel it is enough and ask for even more. They do not accomodate to students and the workplace can be hostile at times."
bad,company has no direction and is managed poorly.  the sales and marketing division runs the engineering group and their decisions.  it is not uncommon for them to try and sell a finished product THEN engineer it correctly to comply with safety regulations and correct hydraulic design.
bad,"If you want to be forced to work illegal hours every day in a high stress environment this is the company for you. They will work you to death and hide it from safety. The supervisors will belittle, threaten and torment you. They are miserable degenerates."
bad,Stressful place to work. Very little training provided. You can learn a lot if you catch on quickly. Manager need skills and compassion for employees.
bad,"Poor work environment, no room for advancement or promotions. a Typical work day for me is clocking in weed eating around the building and then walking around picking up trash. Walking around finding work to do until its time to go at 4:30."
bad,"Poor management, no chance to advance, low pay scale and high turn overs"
bad,Worst experience of a jobi ever had. Management was horrible. Made unfulfilled promises. No promotions. No raises. Never again. Stay clear of this company.
bad,You only stay at this location for a while if you’re related to managers or if you’re buddies with the managers. Nothing was merit based or based on job performance and ability. They make the process take too long and then complain because of how long it takes to do a job.
bad,Management are lack of good management is why I have decided to leave NOV. Management in place cares absolutely nothing about there employee's.Moral is at a all time low in the 17 years I have been there.
bad,"Worse manager I haven’t ever experienced."
bad,"Job completely hinges on the price of oil day to day."
bad,NOV is top heavy and most people of authority lack the skills needed for the positions they are in.  You move up at NOV by who you know not by what you know.
bad,"This is a big company and I have no idea how it remains so. The management has no idea how to manage. If you are not on the buddy list, you will not go anywhere."
bad,"No daily production or training meetings. I learned how not to manage a team of inspection personnel and a business in general. The management team was picked from who they knew. The General Production Manager has never been in a leadership position in his career, but he knew the regional manager. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the inconsistencies of the management team and how they dealt with our customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I turned in my resignation."
bad,"To be fair not all of NOV is bad. some departments of NOV just have a leadership problem. It might be a decent place to work if you were not bullied into working 7 days a week by your supervisors with losing your job for not working 12 hrs a day everyday, unrealistic schedules, poor planing and organization, the lack of leadership and positive motivation is dreadful. You could ""easily be replaced"" is the culture around there. Job comes first and your health, family, personal life and education come last, as it was so coldly put during a one on one with a senior supervisor. That's the motivation you get there. Be happy you have a job. now get to work!"
bad,"NOV has a reputation of a great company it might be but, my experience has been different I work for the Benefits side of the company and Management needs improvements (Mary Burke & Jamie Lelz) they are not professional, the level of micromanagement goes beyond legal. HR never helps (Karen Kramer) the employees, HR allows management to do illegal things to employees for example:: Allows managers to call your personal Doctor and tell them that He/She needs to release you from whatever the OW reason might be and have you attend to work the next day. or layoff employees for medical reasons and tell them that they are been let go do to absences even when there is the proper doctor's notes stating the condition of the patient."
bad,Woke up at all hours of the night for service calls. Reguardless of hours work prior. Long hours service due to lack of dispatchers information and knowledge. I Learned to count on myself and always stock service truck for any situation. Loved the travel all over california but dreaded the work hours. (most days 24+ hours)
bad,"I’ve been a devoted, quiet and hardworking blue-collar employee for many years now while simultaneously attending a local university. Now that I’m nearly finished with school, I can’t get out of my surroundings to save my life despite the fact that I’ve proven myself time and time again, and I have the intellect, the attitude, as well as the education to back it up. I’ve applied for more jobs within this plant than I can recount at this point, and not one has landed me a single interview. What I’ve learned about NOV and their slogan “One Team, One Dream”, is that it only really has any meaning to those who are on the other side of the fence; Those who hold the higher paying white-collar jobs. I have personal friends all over the company who span a wide range of professional positions. This includes managers, as well as various other office personnel, and I’m learning very quickly that once a person has been on my side of the fence, one of the blue-collars, it’s extremely difficult, if not impossible to move into a real “professional” position with higher pay and higher dignity & respect. I’m learning that NOV poses as a “family company” while in reality, is just another soulless cooperate beast run by lying double-talking, back-stabbing people. There’s definitely a caste system within the company. Top tier Boy’s Club/golfers = Plant Director & The Chosen Department Managers. Second Tier = Other Managers who don’t make the Boy’s Club cut. Then on down to the important office personnel in our main office bldg. To the not so important office personnel spanning the rest of the plant."
bad,Great benefits bad management. I worked there for 3 years no advancement good old boy mentality shop the brown noses are the only ones to get raises
bad,"The oilfield business is very volatile. At NOV you don’t know if you have a job until you walk in each morning. "
bad,"from my experience the only way to succeed at this company is to have no idea what your doing at your job. management at Dundee once all made car tires at the same place over the road, some very nasty vindictive senior management in that particular office dead set on ruining anybody that dare to question there knowledge or ability."
bad,"this the worse place I ever work,,,no safety,managment no experience,, big mistake working there,,,treat people like garbage"
bad,Crooked management with no vision or leadership skills.  Good ole boy system only rewards those that are within the inner circles and promotes those that are highly incompetent.  Terrible work life balance.
bad,"run away!"
bad,"i am a family man, i have 2 great kids and a loving wife, working here has eliminated all my family time, i work 7 days a week 12 hours a day, we get paid for all the major holidays but still have to work them including Christmas. In the small amount of time i have been here i have watched well over 25 employees come and go due to the poor management and working ethics."
bad,Changed mgmt over and over
bad,"Poor management.  They will come up to you talking big saying were gonna work 18hrs a day for the next few weeks, get ready to camp out at work. We work one day late, 10-11hrs tops from normal 8hrs and then back to 8hrs rest of the week.  They have no employee appreciation.  They dont care about their employees at all.  I worked for 18months due to it being less then a few miles from my house"
bad,"Oportunidades laborales escasa"
bad,"From the payroll manager to the people processing, it's all about stepping on the back of anyone in front of you to try and make yourself look better and the HR manager helped foster this atmosphere at every turn. They did not ask questions, they accused you and then did not apologize when they were wrong. Typical oil and gas mentality."
bad,"Was made promises by management that were always broken, full of lies. Unexperienced management, poor leadership. Very bad experience. Money decent."
bad,The job itself was easy! The co-worker from different shift are horrible! They would hide job router and no one was accountable for there error (NCR) ALOT of favoritism. The so call superintendent was beyond horrible! Tools were never calibrated. Machinists were force to do own QA. Was told that employee can not transfer to other NOV division which was a lie! This is one of the worst place I ever work but due to the pay I was able to last 2 1/2 years at this center! Grass is not greener on the other side!! Worst ethically. Management will LIE to your face!
bad,A great company if management showed more respect to workers.
bad,"Although there is a good variety of work the facility I worked at had an absolutely foul atmosphere. If you were not an original Elmar guy you were nothing. A bit of bullying and backstabbing went on."
bad,Management and local HR are horrible and extremely discriminatory. This part of my career was theabsolute worst. The only good from this was I was able to pay bills.
bad,"I had no guidance whatsoever in learning my job. I was forced to speculate on what was correct and caught continuous grief for such. Others don't talk to you in a proper manner. An unethical workplace remains that way, until acted upon by proper authority. This is not a place I would recommend to others."
bad,"The training was good and it help me add to my work experience, but they did not gave the opportunity to advance. No open door policy. They took away benefits."
bad,"I learned a lot about downhole drilling tools and directional drilling in general which was vital to my career advancement but it was me educating myself, not NOV training me. The salesmen gotall the training. I managed one internal account, Schlumberger, so I was never treated like an asset. I will never work for them again by choice."
bad,Great place to work - until you step on someone's toes.  Don't trust management.  They smile to your face and stab you in the back. Don't believe when they tell you they value you.  Will turn on you in a heartbeat. to Upper management you are just a number. If you work 10 hours a day - it comes to be expected.  Someone wants you gone - and believe me you are gone - in a heartbeat
bad,"I worked for this company and gave it 110%, I was let go because the General Manager (DL) did not like the fact that I was asking for raises for myself and my service technicians,since raises had been frozen for more than 4 years and the service technicians were leaving to find higher paying companies. He and HR made it their mission to relieve me of my position and had no real reason so they removed the position of Field Service Manager."
bad,"Poor management, they belittle you, discrimination, racism, harassment"
bad,"work ebry day 12 hauars ."
bad,I have worked at this location for over a year and a half and in the time I have seen numerous people come and go. Lost some good machinist because they do not want to give raises. Management is a complete circus. Communication between departments is poor and if you are not in with someone you are screwed. Constantly changing our schedule and quick to write someone up over small things. Basically a daycare for grown ups.
bad,"Meus dias de trabalho sempre foram bons"
bad,"My advice to anyone working as a temp, if they don't hire you after 90 days quit... My supervisor was incredibly unprofessional. She would cuss and yell at employees. Talk about getting drunk and having inappropriate relationships with coworkers and customers in production meetings. Drive the company truck drunk. To make things worse for me on the shop floor, I had to work with a complete idiot with no shop or overhead crane experience. He almost got us both hurt several times. Of course they showed him  favoritism because he brown nosed them... The company I work for now has many former NOV employees and not one has anything good to say..."
bad,"Thank you, I love my family, I want to keep my family happy, I love my mom very much and my father, I was five years old in the office boy in Saudi????"
bad,Nice to place to work ver[y friends;y people and they are a very organized company and they have good benefits when you get on permanent other that its  okay
bad,I was an Intern here. They didn't have much for me to do. On a typical day i would come in and help other employees out with their duties. Overall i wasn't needed.
bad,If you are looking for a well paying position in the oil and gas industry look elsewhere. NOV has very limited advancement opportunities and the pay scale is at the very bottom of the industry standard.
bad,"they want u to work, work, work, and they dont want u to have no life outside of work. so if u dont want a life this is the company u want to work for"
bad,"Worked here for years, never a raise, no bonuses, empty promises long hours no home life , busted my butt for this place with no return on your pay or time off."
bad,Na área de tratamento de cascalho com equipamentos sucateados ao estremo.com mão de obra reduzido.
bad,good company just not so good management overall i give it 1 star company does not care about there employees would rather work for a company who cares about itsemployees
bad,"A typical day would be very routine, even though the job has considerable amount of things to learn seems to become fairly routine after a few months. Management is based on the hierarchy system, although co-workers deal with this situation it never seems to be tolerable. My co-workers keep the place from collapsing on a minute to minute basis only never being rewarded for their efforts. "
bad,you are replaceable and they waste breath reminding you everyday
bad,hardest part of job was showing up! was named enerflow industries prior.
bad,"A typical day at work was very chaotic, and unorganized."
bad,"Hostile, noisy and hazardous work environment. Very mom and pop Run. Incompetent supervisors. Negative environment bordering on racist. Constant fumes and noise."
bad,"They hire Philippians and pay them a very low wage. When there is a mistake made because lack of training, the yell and scream like junior high kids. If you book a vacation in advance you really need to remind them or each boss will come see you, Then ask why you were not there during your vacation. The management here Is ridiculous. Id rather go and watch my kids run a lemonade stand so I am not disappointed."
bad,"Just easy the management here live to work you to the bone they always want you working while they take their weekends off and when they are at work they just stand around and talk and do exactly what they tell you not to do and they also take 2 or 3 hour business lunches (which are paid for by the company and they get paid while on lunch) when the employees have to clock out for lunch and ask permission to take a hour like a kid, also they don’t care for your family/home life my wife was in a car accident and management told me to make a choice my job or my wife. That is all!!!!!"
bad,"There is a very poor relationship between the employees and the company. The company does not value the employees, and they run the company as if it is a privilege to work for them."
bad,"At the location I was at, my manager was always in a sour mood, unhelpful. Did not train me properly. Unhealthy environment for me. Rude and unprofessional. I have a very positive attitude but the work environment that I was in made it a very stressful and unwanted place to work."
bad,"I have to to say there are truly some great people who work here,and then there is everyone else.I've never seen such discusting work environment. You have people that sit and start rumours,and lies,and thier weak management keeps them Around although they know it's going to create issues.News flash,hire someone that knows that job,or actually train then,something NOV is know known for(not training)and rid your self of these disturbing individuals who go Around claiming GOD is protecting them and spit out words of hate about everyone including the very people she works with,and this manager does nothing.The HR department is a joke, they lie act like they want the best for you,but all they want is info so that you can burn your bridge so that you can get the classic no rehirable speech for your new employer. When I finally walked out that door and got home and washed the filth that place produces off of me I felt At peace,I felt great,I felt awesome. "
bad, Facilitate weekly dependent certification reports.
bad,"I really wanted to be there, but work enviornment was not the best and I was not comfortable, so I could not be the best I could be."
bad,"Hourly pay is not competitive at all.  There are no raises given whether your job performance is excellent or not.  Management is lacking, there is no backup or support.  There is also no job training.  You are left to figure out everything for your self."
bad,"Management is promoted based on their experience being similar to others in the company, not their actual ability to lead or intelligently conduct business."
bad,"No balance between your work and life. This is the job for you if you do not mind spending every day working. Pay was okay and benefits but other than that, miserable."
bad,Salary is rubbish and so is advancing through the company. No progress anywhere so you’ll be stuck in a dead end job until you decide to leave. Would not advise working here.
bad,My manager was very controlling/ micromanager. Also favoritism is showed amongst the employees who would kiss up to my manager. My manager would also make racist comments and seemed to feel comfortable doing so. Also didn't receive a raise after a year due to us having two bad quarters. We stayed very late during month end most times till 10:00 PM or later. The work environment was very stressful and didn't provide a challenge. Working in a environment full of women also provided a toxic work environment lots of catty disagreements.
bad,I was with this company since it was a small one owner business.  I watched is go from a one owner business to owned by Drexell corporation which was then purchased by Tuboscope which was purchased by Varco which merged with National Oilwell to become National Oilwell/Varco.  This company would not be where it is today without the input from our engineering group.
bad,"Management seemed determined to hold you back and refused accountability for their own decisions. "
bad,I wouldn't consider this a good company for a woman to work at especially if you have a family. Also the insurance provided was extremely expensive and did not cover much therefore employees are still paying large out of pockets sums.
bad,"Poor management"
bad,I was laid off because of work force reduction. And the lady sleeping with the new manager wanted me gone. I was brought in to make changes and had no support from management to get them done in fact was harassed everyday.
bad,"Lots of classroom training.  Too big of a company to be noticed for hard work.  Do not consider it a long term place, just a stepping stone.  Decent benefits."
bad,"If you were smart you left yourself set-up to begin work as soon as you came in. The lazy worker will goof off until 1st break before beginning work. I learned racism is openly practiced just not discussed. Managers seem to be 'sneaking' around trying to 'catch' people. Every job assignment is 'HOT'.  Hardest part was wondering when you were drawing the short straw for layoffs."
bad,"Hardly any training and if you had a question, you pretty much had to figure it out by yourself without any help.  Rude people to work around also."
bad,"The senior management team is disconnected from what the middle management is actually doing.  The middle managers drive the supervisors to the point of quitting and continually tell the supervisors that they do not do enough to ensure that the shops are running efficiently.  This is after working 10-12 hour days 6-7 days a week.  middle management turn over is so high that the supervisors and worker continually have to change direction. (example- one shop had 7 different plant/general mangers in a 2-1/2 year period).  The upper management brings these guys in and says they want them to change the culture, yet gives them little to no latitude to make the necessary changes.  This makes working in their manufacturing facilities extremely taxing on the supervisors and workers."
bad,"Decent bunch of co-workers, horrible upper management. you are not a person but a number. the suck ups move up. all about the bottom line. lowest paid in the industry. layoffs when oil prices drop. lots of overtime when oil is up. if you hurt yourself, you hurt their numbers, not good for you. summary they will suck your soul out and discard you when they're done."
bad,"Poor management and there's a lot of favoritism. Horrible place to work and there's no chance to move up within the company. I'm currently trying to leave this company to move forward to better and a greater work place I can be grateful to work at, and feel a part of."
bad,"Good company to work for but has the worst HR and worst management.  Way too much favoritism. Only way to move up is by who you know or what you'll do to move up. HR will completely lie and coverup things just to backup upper management even if they know they are in the wrong so never fight upper management because you will not win. Very unfair company.  Theyll let management treat you horribly, discriminate, belittle and humiliate you and still defend management.  Going to HR is completely pointless."
bad,"treat employees like scum"
bad,"a typical day at work involved either working at a store location with a requirement of product needing to be built for the day for the customer. the other involves getting the order of products to be done for the day for the location you were assigned permanently. I learned how to assemble various brands of BBQ grills, riding lawnmowers, push mowers, wheel barrows, furniture, and anything else that needed to be assembled for display or for a customer. I had to types of management one was the store for the customer i was assembling for and the ones i had my reports and paycheck info sent to everyday. my co workers were spread out through towns and different store locations i would meet them when i visited them to help assemble product for if they had a large order for that day. the hardest part of the job is meeting the customers requirements in speed and how well the product was assembled. the most enjoyable part of the job had to be putting the products together and having the feeling of accomplishment when it is all done."
bad,"My job consisted of sitting and waiting for someone to ask for help, but hardly anyone in the organization knew our group existed. We were tasked with helping other business groups with process improvements and cost cutting ideas; the best budget improvement I could recommend would have been the elimination of the Corporate Process Development organization and funneling the yearly 1.5 million + dollar budget back into the production facilities that were falling apart."
bad,High sales pressure to achieve sales goals
bad,"When you interview with them they will promise you all these good things that NOV did. When you start the guy who hired and interviewed you ""leaves the company"" and your new boss says nope its none of that so you go to night shift working 6pm to 6am, 6 days a week with some of the shadeiest people in the oilfield. Everyone complains about everyone and everything. The shift supervisors pretend to be your buddy just to stab you in the back to save their own hides. The shop manager was or is a crazy old crow without the slightest clue but all the bosses shd so idk"
bad,"This company is only for entry level people seeking to join the oilfield. Once you have mastered operations and your position, it is best to find a new company to work for. They will not increase your pay and be competitive with other companies nor do they wish to. You will work long hours and long days just to make ends meet. If you show any sign of intelligence they will try and move you to a salaried position with less pay and more responsibility. Look to join this company if you have little or no oilfield knowledge as they will more then likely hire you. Be aware that the job you are hired for may not be the job you end up doing."
bad,"Management was difficult and would rarely give concise and clear instructions as to what they wanted to be done."
bad,"I worked in IT. Management and upwards is a joke, severe backstabbing in the department. Management loves to play favorites. The lying is intense, one manager specifically told me he would screw me over on purpose, so always get his agreement in writing."
bad,As a union shop the atmosphere was very stressful.  The union ruled the facility.  It was difficult to get any programs started or performed by associates.
bad,"As I worked for NOV, I got to see the benefits and culture slowly decline.  Part of this was due to a new CEO, and part of it was due to an industry downturn.  The new management has no clear strategy or leadership, as they barely interact with anyone but themselves."
bad,"Well, when the oil price is up everyone is happy and marry. With oil below $60 it's not happy times at NOV. Non stop layoffs and very low employee morale."
bad,"Excellent products.  Some great folks that have been in the field for years.  However, once you get into the management side, it is definitely cut throat and non-flexible. They bring in kids that have never worked in the field and play favorites.  Particularly in the corporate side of the business.  Most of the managers need to be culled. They do not respect older employees, I've noticed."
bad,"It was a great place to work until few years ago. Many restructure in short period of time wasting money and getting rid of people who actually did the work. Heavy top management and buddy system is in place in order to have raises and benefits such as stock options etc."
bad,"depends on the oil price, clock at 6:30 clock out at 3:30 if you do 40 hours a days at 7:00 if you do 12 hours a day."
bad,The IT department was ran by a racist bias narcissist that bullied his team into submission in the Houston Corporate office.  He made the work place very uncomfortable and blatantly made differences among team members
bad,"Too much time spent on correcting internal mistakes. Management ignores obvious pitfalls. Daily, hurry up and wait for last minuet theatrics from management."
bad,I have worked with this company for 4 years the first manager was the greatest.  Then I seen 4 more not one new nothing about anything no help for the employees. HR the most horrible ever.
bad,"Senior Management did not know how to run the company, nor what they should really be measuring.  Plants are now shutting down.  It will take at least a year to turn around."
bad,"you can be the dumbest person in the world and hold an assc. degree in art, and work as a H/R specialist, as a Engineer, etc. when the company was started, before NOV bought them out the company was making progress opening a new mill every 2 years, up to 6 mills operating,  National Oilwell bout them out, replaced management and the company lost many sales, resulting in mass layoffs,  when i left the site only 2 mills were running. every 6 months we get a mass of new people getting hired and 4 months later they all get layed off, My dept. was recommended as one of the best depts. due to service ,( helping out others)  distribution, and technical knowledge of the different machines,.. as soon as new management  we went from a 3 man  assisting 6 mills to a 6 man team assisting 2 mills. "
bad,"Should be a great place to work but the bully boy tactics from management and the rule of my way is the only way from them holds the company back. 90% of management only got job because of who they know and not what they know, this is how so many mistakes have been made and the company suffering."
bad,former CEO left company in ruins.  current CEO is having to clean house.  Sr VP's are high school graduates when we need businessmen
bad,"The Money is good if you are ok with not really having a home life. Job security is ok, if you are good with social politics. Immediate management is good, corperate is not. Job Culture is trying to be turned around, but is the typical we good job type kudos."
bad,"Projects were always behind and employees were expected to take up ""the slack"""
bad,I worked out of the Odessa store for IMO techs for a year and let me tell you its very different from the rest of the company.  The management is absolutely TERRIBLE.  One manager can't make a decision without holding the hand of the other.  Once again this is a great company to work for as long as you don't work out of the Odessa IMO store.
bad,"This place is very clickish. If you have any ideas about process improvments, or cycle time reduction, please keep them to yourself. Managments attitude seems to be, ""if you dont like the way things are, then there is the door""."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy all day long.
bad,"In my nearly five years' experience with this company, I learned that it is ""who you know"" over hard work and qualification. I learned that inter-office politics, back-biting, petty jealousy, intimidated co-workers and inferior minds can shape and change a person's career here. I learned that the management's goal is the all-mighty bottom dollar and will use up subordinates, discarding them once they have squeezed all they can out of them."
bad,"the hardest part of this job is to get motivated to get up and go there day after day knowing that I could do the same o same for the next???? years without ever having the opportunity to move up the ladder.iI have learned some about pumps,work with a great bunch of co workers.the management is very non-progreesive thinkers.The upper management would rather lie to you,than tell the truth,when the truth sounds better.a typical work day for me consists of me going in and cut,clean,fit-up piping &componentsand then weld them out.and possibly even installing pipe spools too.the enjoyable part of the job ....the end of the day,go home to my wife."
bad,"Good benefits and vacation time, but this does not add up to a higher paying salary or a clear career path. Too many ""good old boys"" and people in higher positions with no management or leadership skills."
bad,"My plan is to have something else after the first quarter. I have wasted 4 years here. The managers have no respect for their employees.  No one feels appreciated.  Turnover is high, this should be a company you come in and want to retire from. That's not the case. The managers do not encourage, they dont  motivate there's no coaching they mostly intimidate the employees."
bad,"Good company to work for but needs work on communication between upper management and people in the shop floor. "
bad,"The company is up and down with the oil and gas industry,  to many white hats, watch your back because theres people in higher positions ready to throw you under the bus to protect their own backsides "
bad,"Was not happy or satisfied being there.not the type of job you want to be when everyone has an ego problem, selfish attitude and ignorance. Employees  who are men are worst then women when it comes to gossip and they do not work as a team. But are more two face employees and negative. "
bad,"This place was fun for a while but when management changes, then the rules change.  The rules are different depending on who you are and who you know."
bad,"not a good place to work. Management just push employees for production without taking considerations of Hazards. Continental shift is not good for family. lots of hazards that is not taking care of. if you are a hard working guy, they will put more load on you and if you a the Lazy one, they wil just give you easy job with same salary as the one working hard."
bad,"Good company to work for basic standard benefits, management varies but definitely a dead end job for certain departments. There is no growth potential unless you are favored with a certain profile. I’ve see multi-employees moved up with less skills but they were rewarded with management positions.  Company offers incentives to volunteer in helping others but not to the extent of over doing your time away from work."
bad,I was there for four years and no raise. They even took the Christmas bonus away and even that was very little. If they continue this trend great employees will leave and find better paying jobs
bad,"To many Indians not enough Chiefs. Management, to much competition. Hectic workplace. Hours were always being dropped from 12 hours to 8 hours. Hardest part of the job is instead of working as a team, everyone would work against each other, I am a team player not trying to throw anyone under the bus."
bad,Every employee here basically complains because the pay scale is not competitive with other companies and they do not believe in raises. Management is subpar and really isn't aware of everything that's going on!!
bad,"I worked there thru the force layoffs and retirements. they lowball you in on salary, saying look at the overtime you get. then you don't get a raise."
bad,"The corporation does not value or reward individual effort and often rewards connected people over skilled people. Salaries are on the lower end of the competitive scale, with little financial or positional advancement opportunities over the years."
bad,This was a great office environment to learn about the oil and gas industry.  I worked with very talented people and learned a great deal from my co-workers.
bad,"Unprofessional, High School level mentality. Few processes or procedures, the few that exist are not followed. Favoritism is awarded over merit. Poor advancement opportunities."
bad,"Terrible compnay to work for. Growth zero, development zero, overworked and underpaid, Too too tooo much netoptisim."
bad,"Most employees are great, but good managers are few and far in between.  Wish there was better training and a clear path for career advancement.  It's very difficult to get a pay raise."
bad,"This was a really good company before the downturn - not any more."
bad,"Working with all of my co-workers and being able to assist them with all of their needs from personal issue to benefit questions.  From the very beginning, I was there 1st contact with the company.  Hiring them and then orientating them and being there for them on the job. They were the best co-workers and they appreciated everything that I did for them.  "
bad,"Nice place to work however, they need to think about their employees more.  A typical day at work included the first aid equipment and training the employees to do their job safely."
bad,i would work from 11-7. its a okay place to work place to work. i would splice the rope then coil it up an wrap it then ship it to offshore companies
bad,"Lots of opportunity to learn, and work on various projects.  Management does not change often, and advancement is limited."
bad,"As mentioned above long hours of work with little financial benefits, The company provides good training, but oil price is unstable at the moment. There is no job security."
bad,"Productive for my part, but management was lacking."
bad,Not the worst place to work but not the best either. A good place to learn and get your foot in the industry but a hard place to stay in the long run.  Good benefits and lots of hours but low overall pay.
bad,"As a oilfield service company, you go where the work goes, until the oil prices start dropping. You will work on average 87-98 hours per week, you work 2 weeks on, 1 week off. Biggest problem with is company is Management, very little communication between everyone. They will NOT provide anyone of its field technicians with proper equipment or tools to fix any broken equipment, nor provide any of its employees with proper PPE (personal protective equipment), to have a job in the oilfield requires you to wear Fire Rated Clothing which the company is supposed to provide, this company doesn't, FR clothing is very expensive,for example, a quality jacket costs $200 dollars. This company offers a ""retention bonus"", if your happen to mess up something (small or big), they hang that over your head and tell you, you might lose some or all of your bonus. If you have to travel in excess of 6 hours to get to your Location, you will not be paid for the extra time traveled over that six hours."
bad,"This company is not family friendly, the management hires family and then gives them special treatment. This company is about WHO you know not what you know!"
bad,Performed a wide variety of daily required  duty's  with  main  emphasis/focus  on  customer  relations  and  total    satisfaction.   Provided    24 hr.   service   to    oil   company’s    (company reps.)   utilizing   (NOV) Inclination /Azimuth  electrical  equipment  for the purpose  of  directional  drilling  saving  both  time and money.  Daily operations included sales/service/accounts payable/customer relations.
bad,"Working as labourer is not that great, but working in offices or as engineers is much better"
bad,"Although NOV is the 3rd largest oilfield services company in the world, The NOV/Brandt division in Ray, ND is very dysfunctional and poorly managed."
bad,"Cada divisão da empresa funciona de uma forma bem diferente. Os times costumam ter pessoas que trabalham de forma colaborativa, mas infelizmente o salário da maior parte dos funcionários é bem abaixo da média do mercado e sem perspectiva de crescimento. Existe uma alta rotatividade em grande parte dos cargos."
bad,A job that is impossible to take seriously because management doesn’t care. Culture is very toxic and breeds lazy workers. Maintenance is a never ending issue. Only pro is the pay/benefits are good from the start but there is no opportunity for advancement or raises.
bad,Extremely long hours for very little pay very poor management always running out of material poor supervision management always clashing with each other instead of leading
bad,"A day in this production plant consist of welding, fabricating and possibly changing prints with the help of drafting. At this Location it is possible to learn anything in the fabrication field, from running machines, welding, and the operations of heavy equipment and over head cranes. the management is average and usually leaves you alone to finish tasks. there is not much room for advancement due to the longevity of the in place supervisors.  the culture is oilfield base and can be rough due to language and differences in personal cultures. The hardest part of the job is the fact that when busy, there is no family time, the hours can range from 40 hrs a week to 7-12 hr days without time off. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the fact that I was able to learn several aspects of different jobs, to include assembly of mobile drilling units from start to finish."
bad,"Working here is only good if you don't like money or time with your family. But this does change a lot based on what facility you work for."
bad,"enjoyed working there."
bad,"Too many lay offs. Management was not concerned with anything that employees had to say. Poor equipment that was not well maintained. Good pay, but that`s about it."
bad,"This pertains to Tuboscope and not NOV as a whole."
bad,With the drop of oil prices NOV started layoffs as expected. Remaining employees were asked to stay past regular hours with no compensation and no expectations of raises or promotions. Then another layoff would happen and more work would be piled onto those remaining still with no compensation or expectation of raises. On top of this management was not appreciative of those who stepped up to carry the load.
bad,"Really enjoyed my time working there, I learned a lot and valued my time there. We all worked extremely hard to please both customer and management, It would have been nice to receive the pay we were told we were gonna get, and would  have been nice to at least get a thank you."
bad,"Good place to have a steady comfortable job. Don't stay here if you like to be challenged. Engineers, perfect place for you if you don't want to do engineering. If you do however, it would be career suicide."
bad,It was a good training experience. You learn to improvise and hold tight tolerance with worn out equipment. Not a very secure company to work for.
bad,"Operated trackhoes, bobcats and KSW water and peanut pumps. Cleaned docks and tanks."
bad,To much favoritism in many workers the manager didn't want to give raisis only for his friends.
bad,Good company good money its just the normal wear n tear of working in the oilfield and the normal stress of working a 9-5 but u can make alotta money within your first year in
bad,"The company overall is good, but the industry is going through a downturn at the moment and works are not sure if positions will continue to be cut as they have been."
bad,Not a bad place to get some experience. This place was very physically demanding and they made sure the got their moneys worth out of employees. It will make you appreciate your next Job.
bad,"Good place to start a career but not to stay,  NOV does recruit College graduates regardless if they have experience in Oil or Gas,  Pays more for a degree but I would expect the company to do so,"
bad,"Decent pay, excellent benefits. work schedule subject to change at any given time, sometimes with little or no notice. Some departments work better with employees than others."
bad,decent benefits. no work/home balance. management lacking people skills.  wouldn't recommend to a friend to work there.  grateful for the opportunity.
bad,"The facility is filthy, unsafe, low wages and a poor Management Staff. The best part of working there is that in 13yrs of employment with the company I was able to learn many positions and advance rather quickly. Otherwise, it was very stressful dealing with personnel issues due to poor management. The company didn't pay well and people wouldn't stay because it was a nasty job with harmful chemicals."
bad,"Very good benefits and ok pay. Most of the shop employees are great to work with. Many get work due to ethnicity and cheap labour. Highly micro managed, lead hands are not left to lead their teams. If this would change, it would be a great place to work."
bad,"good and interesting job.busy for your full shift which was good.poor organization which meant you had to leave one job and start another.management was friends of friends,some which had no engineering skills and were out of their dept.highly skilled workers badly let down from above"
bad,"Buys companies to eliminate competition.... Can't compete with U.S. standards of quality, so they buy the competition and close the facilities.... Has no loyalty to it's customers or employees. Local management is excellent, but corporate leadership is unable to compete with American Standards."
bad,"I have been working as Systems Engineer on advanced state-of-the-art drilling control systems projects. "
bad,"It was good working there for the year and a half.  Management was bad, but they were never there so that sums it up."
bad,"Trabalho era ótimo, ambiente de trabalho quando no Technical College não muito legal, por conta deu a supervisão não ser tão acessível."
bad,Staff had no direction; not interesting; data entering all day; i learned pivot tables
bad,"I have never worked with more unproffesional people in my entire work history. Profuse use of vulgar language in the work place by employees and Supervisor' s and Management. The "" Good Ol'e Boy"" system is an understatement. A lot of relatives and cousins in the work place. I would never go back to work there. The pay was very poor and the work environment was even worse."
bad,"Although I placed significant efforts in this in my role, overall training and mentoring is weak. Employee development and pay is below standard. Overall top management and resulting company stock performance does not promote a sense of success and employee morale."
bad,The job was easy as a service tech and they had great benefits but they was very little opportunity for advancement and they do not like to give raises.
bad,"work is outside in the elements. rain, sleet, sun and heat. work is usually steady with incoming deliveries which include but not limited to  receiving, labeling and stocking."
bad,Facility was under new management but everyone seemed clueless. Poor planning which then made everything on the shop floor urgent and rushed everyone on the floor to get the product out.
bad,"NOV is a great place to work for a younger crowd with young families. They are very flexible with scheduling and hours. "
bad,"I thought I liked the people I worked with. I thought all was going well. My work was presented in meetings and applauded. I met deadlines. My monthly reviews with my supervisor all went well. He never said anything negative about my performance. Then at the end of my 3 mo contract, instead of getting picked up for a permanent position, my recruiter shows up to escort me off the property. They told her I wasn't doing a good job, but no one ever told me what I was doing wrong. I'm still angry about this."
bad,very hard to work when there is no communication with employees from management. Not knowing what is going on and working each day as it is your last.
bad,they bought out our company for one of our products then shut the doors down on our facility. seems to me as if they are not too concerned for the companies they are buying out.
bad,"Management and corporate is getting crazy about money."
bad,If you are a black man or white man this is not the location for you they only hired Mexican they only hired black man and white man for their quoted after 1 to 3 months they will let you go the because you work to slow
bad,"Organizar el puesto de trabajo, organizar el archivo, verificacion y la contratacion de personal, pausa activas, trabaje con buenos compañeros. lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue el conocimiento que adquiri en los 6 meses que duro en la empresa."
bad,"I am a former Employee,"
bad,great place to work. you learn a lot about mud pumps and how parts are assembled. the environment is great. just one very big glitch is management. they give empty promises and they are very judgment.
bad,"no raises, no compensations, management lies, no growth opportunities. company is cutting back on everything and trying to minimize expenses and paying employees."
bad,"NOV Tuboscope are and will always be the worlds worst OCTG Inspection company. No or very little quality in there day to day activities, clearly things have never moved on over the years with them as they still are working as a max profit no quality get it in get it out work ethic !"
bad,NOV was a tough and very dirty place to work. I am not against physical labor but NOV was very different. A very unsanitary facility to say the least. I realized that this field was not my future and that I want a job that I can turn into a career.
bad,"The business unit of NOV I worked at, AmClyde was a fun, friendly, stress free environment where you felt like family.  I worked there 18 years."
bad,Poor medical benefit coverage. No annual appraisal and increment. Good work/life balance. Lenient on office rules and regulations. Good working culture.
bad,"very long hours and hires in bursts to support the current workload, competitive pay and good benifits but when the oil field goes down thier quick to let thier people go, or buy out other companies and let all the employees go instead of continuing operations and keeping people employeed"
bad,they have lowered all pay and make us work to all potential. Their are weeks with no toilet paper and soap. it just the worst place i have worked in my life period.
bad,"It needs better leadership, it just seemed as if there wasn't any."
bad,i love welding but the pay is not good many of the guys are nice but there is lots of politics and back stabbing going on
bad,I learned that you can not trust anyone. True backstab. People will do anything to get ahead and use anything said to do it. At least at Aircenter facility. Would not recomend that location to anyone.
bad,"NOV has shaped me into the business person I am today.  NOV's managers care about their individual contributors and care about keeping their employees challenged, engaged, and driven. For that, I'm extremely grateful. "
bad,"Fast-paced, busy warehouse which entailed construction of shipping crates, packaging of parts, loading and unloading trucks with forklift.  Also responsible for cold storage and rotation of rubber stocks used in drill making process. I was also sent to classes to become certified in HazMat. A job like this makes the day go much faster. Management was available to respond to questions and problems."
bad,"They don’t care if your a good worker, they laziest people get rewarded. When you have an idea, it gets shot down and say that we’ll never work here.."
good,"They don't care one bit about the employees. You'll work weekends, holidays, you name it. Meanwhile the front office personnel will be at home. Hate it"
good,"Management let you down couldn't progress tried many times worked every weekend cos the other ones wouldn't, few clowns work there some haven't got a clue best thing I done was to leave"
good,Come in early in the morning and get a new job assignment from supervisor. Return to warehouse dept. To allow them to bring you parts and equipment for the job. Assemble the required job and test the equipment upon finalizing the assemlby. At the end of the day you are allowed to stop the assembly or testing fifteen minutes before clocking out to clean and maintain work areas.
good,Muy poca capacitación y escasa oportunidad de crecer profecionalmente.
good,"The management at Cedar Park NOV needs to heed their own advice. They have an initiative called ""Gung Ho"" and the staff is everything but. Management lies to you constantly. HR will lie to you and push things under the rug. Upper management goes out on the manufacturing floor and tells secrets to ""special"" employees and gets rumors going. They allow hostile employees to remain there and cause problems for entire departments with virtually no disciplinary actions. You will be more likely to get somewhere if you are friends with the right people, or related to them, otherwise you are probably not going to get far. They expect you to do your job and any other job that isn't getting done with no thanks or appreciation.  They keep simple minded people in positions of power so that they can be controlled. Management only cares about making the metrics look good. Maybe they should give actually changing things and correcting the problems a shot. If they did the wouldn't have to ""make"" the metrics look good, they would on their own. If you enjoy working yourself into an early grave for a company that cares nothing about any of it's employees I highly advise you to go to work for NOV in Cedar Park. You can be a part of the biggest farce I have ever seen in my professional experiences. Some of the Focus Factory Managers don't even know how to use Excel effectively, but they are the big bosses. Those managers in particular keep their jobs because they have the right friends. Such a shame for a company with such potential to be hindered by their own blindness to the management problems."
good,"Unless you become a favorite or know someone there is no chance that your career will go anywhere.  There is no loyalty for anyone but management, and to themselves."
good,"Stay away, horrible management, current layoffs most people leave in first year to two years.   No raises or training, the rest of NOV is a good company.   Corporate needs to come in and clean house.  People overworked and do not smile."
good,Management was lacking in the rope access division. We worked long hours and lived out of a hotel. It was good work experience. The management was not present.
good,Tive momentos maravilhos e momentos muito ruins trabalhando na NOV. Talvez os problemas tenham sido do mercado e não da empresa propriamente dita.
good,My personal experience with NOV was that they over-hired too many people and then once they couldn't find enough work for everyone they started getting rid of people.  NOV is a big enough company that has great benefits and the atmosphere changes depending on which service and location you work out of.
good,Upper management have no true knowledge on managing and lack expertise to effectively run their departments. Region VP only comes into office once per week if even that. Managers have no direction.
good,"Tive oportunidade de conhecer mais sobre peças de perfuração, tive a oportunidade de receber treinamento sobre inventário em Houston. Sempre muito agitação, minha gerência sempre disposta a ouvir e a ajudar. Colegas de trabalhos uns difíceis de lidar mas nada que a velha diplomacia não ajude."
good,The shop that i had transfer from in PA. had good management i was brought here to open a new shop and train a new manager.After they let go the 2nd manager the shop had no manager at the shop so i had to fill in .
good,A vast majority of my time is wasted addressing infrastructure issues.  Sites being down.  Lost repositories.  Slow network responses causing build failures.  IT rules prevent development as external repositories are not accessible and internal repositories are purged due to space constraints.
good,"When employed from 2007-2013 it was a good place to work for (Machine Shop)"
good,its very stressful and we are very under paid its a good company but the pay isn't enough for your families are anything. the work is decent but the job isn't stable enough nor is there any room for advancement.
good,70 hours a week with low pay.  The chances for advancement are routinely held-up because of them wanting you to stay where your are.  I graduated in October and I decided to move on.
good,Built skids in a shop that NOV rent out. The purpose was to send overflow work to our shop to help NOV get order finished in a timely manner. The only NOV emplyee there was the forman.
good,The hardest part of the job is the lack of direction. Directors do not know what managers are doing and managers do not know what supervisors are doing. All of this trickles down to the workers which leads to confusion. The medical benefits used to be one of the best things about NOV but that has been cut severely due to the downturn of the oil market.
good,"You will work over 120 hours a week, will not have time for family and will have to travel at any time of the day, and you will be needed at every time of the day"
good,Some locations are much better than others. Pay is decent but not overwhelmingly great. Management issues need to be addressed. Lots of overtime more than you could ever want.
good,The work place at NOV is not as great as it may look. You will work crazy amounts of hours due to management promises to the customers. Not enough family time.
good,"There were many positives company wide but not in the business unit I worked in. Very cut throat and ""in"" group.  Lots of nepotism and friends first culture. Some groups are different."
good,Great place to learn drilling equipment. Not a good place to work with current offshore drilling market. Wait until conditions change to consider working for NOV.
good,Work for alot of nice people. Met some guys whom I still keep in contact with. I enjoyed the work that I did. I gained alot of experience working here.
good,"A tough company to work for with the current climate. Poor management and little room for progression, salary is a little below competitive."
good,"Was a excellent place to work as Ameron International. Once Merged with NOV everything changed management no longer cared in the work or the employees. Gave false hope about job security that just lead to negative attitudes from employees. Quickly after merger, all local plants were closed and moved out of country"
good,It was an excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways. My previous roles were not customer-facing so it was great to have the chance to develop this area of my experience.
good,"Job summery verses actual job tasks and responsibilities are more than what you sign up for. I understand your roll increasing and growing but the responsibilities added throughout become enough for more than two employees. Management is not really approachable, and HR is their best friend."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was getting along with all my co-workers, satifiying the costumers, and I trully enjoyed my job. I learned from managements problems on how they treated people, on my own I decided to treat every person with dignity and respect that they deserve, no matter their apperance, culture, religion, or race.  The hardest part of the job was to deal with new managers, they do not trust an employees experiance, rather they belittle them. Many co-workers liked learning, but left afterwards caused by constant management problems."
good,working nights was the worst. The day shift would blame the night shift and vice versa for problems and management would do nothing to bring the two groups together. The older employees would not help out the new guys if we had any questions for fear of losing their positions.
good,"Well we would work 12 hours shifts 7 days a week for 4 weeks in a role some times there was two people per shift but most of the time it was only one man per shift . We had to monitor maintain all equipment are only down time to fix stuff is when the rig stopped drilling . "
good,"Nice work place at national oil well varco     "
good,"- No training to assist in the growth of personal goals."
good,"Many great people work at the company, but it is led by big egos that are slow to react to market changes."
good,"I personally wouldn't work for NOV again.  I had a great manager, but he was the exception, not the rule.  The work/life balance was ok (mostly due to my good manager), but there weren't opportunities for advancement."
good,"Meet and greet visitors"
good,"There are multiple levels for various job titles; however, it is difficult to advance to a new position. Overall, the company provides a stability and good benefits."
good,"We worked hard, long hours, rotating shifts. not a lot of time to spend with family at home. All I can say, I made a lot of money there, when I worked there."
good,The peers are great! There are some great team members there are only a small group of folks who carry the load. The pay is sub par. Sales professionals are not compensated for out performing others. Management is terribly disconnected with what is happening with their teams and the battles they face in market place. It is very hard to advance since the change in culture. Senior management has more concern on internal politics than supporting client needs. The under performers and treated as equals to the top 1%.
good,Good place to work if you have a family and are looking for a great work life balance. Management does not a put a lot of effort so it is not a great place if you need a lot of guidance.
good,Management need help. No room for advancement. The good ol boy network. A good company to start with right out of college
good,"They never really paid the most, or even average, but they had great benefits.  2016 brought a benefits overhaul that resulted in a regression to the industry average.  "
good,Productive place/POORLY managed. Most active shipping/recieving hub in the area. Management does poor job of managing work load and work hours.
good,"Although I was exposed to many knowledgeable individuals, management lacked vision and strategy. Due to this, there were no growth opportunities as the development of immediate direct reports was not a priority. "
good,Oil and Gas industry is a stressful industry when oil prices are down.  When I started w/ the company I dreamed big dreams only to find that once hire as a permanent employee they would not increase my pay. People here get cost of living raises and not performance raises so employees become complacent and just don't put forth any effort.  The AP department is always under staffed and over worked.  Instead of purchasing providing all the information necessary to pay a vendor they provide a portion and AP has to chase down the rest. For the most part the company is run like a small business about to fall apart instead of what you would expect from a massive industry giant.
good,"Manufacturing job, with not much room for advancement. Poor management. I learned how to operate a lathe machine and follow paperwork."
good,"es una empresa la cual tiene muchas oportunidades de que uno pueda crecer profecionalmente, pero NO economicamente,"
good,"Hardest part- 12 hr days plus the drive. No set schedule , worked as long as 60 days straight with no days off in the heat. When things are calm and the schedule is set and consistent-not  so bad."
good,"*Na TELENGE trabalhei no ano de 2004 ate 2006. Exercendo a função de Líder de Equipe (ENCARREGADO) e prestando serviço de: Manutenção nas redes de Tele comunicações, Instalação de Linhas e Leitura e Interpretação de Projetos de Telecomunicações."
good,Performed all aspects of job from locating parts to laying them out to installing and packaging finished product for shipping. It was nice to know what you were doing each day. I trained contractors to assist in other areas or other projects.
good,A good company but bad management. Some supervisors Yael  and degrade the employees in front of others. To many friends and relations for a place that has no nepotism.
good,Good company to work for not family oriented. Not good managing its for people who doesnt have a family or a normal social life. when you work for NOV than NOV is your life.
good,"Poorly prepared, too frequent business meetings (off shore/out-of-state by phone... without visual!) Was laid-off abruptly without notice after my annual performance rating which was grossly unfair having designed and engineered power and controls cable routing for there various drilling control systems which were under extremely high industry safety requirements."
good,Not a terrible place to work. But very unstable job security due to the market. Pay and benefits are great for the area. Learned very valuable skills during my time there and built very strong relationships.
good,"If this is your first job then NOV is a good starting point.  They will not advance employees without a college degree and will NOT compensate employees for added responsibilities and/or workload.  Whatever your starting salary is, it will also be your ending salary regardless of how many years you’ve worked there. The days of hard work and experience do NOT account for anything with NOV."
good,There is lack of communication between management and also between field workers. A typical days work is working 16 hours per day. Unorganized in the office and it reflects in the field on getting the job done in a timely manner.
good,"Management is  poor/ the people are rude, training is very bad, they have no knowledge of the ERP systems."
good,"if you like to be political then this is the play for you.  if you like to come to work and just work they will never look at your for a promotion.  they have lied about giving raises, but it's just inflation pay and it's every 3 years you get 2%"
good,"Before merging with a larger entity, it was a great place to work, with paid lunches, incentive bonuses, and annual safety bonuses and raises, with advancement opportunities. Since joining Rig Systems, all bonuses have been stopped and there was a 4 year wage freeze, preventing employee advancement, with zero cost of living compensation. Paid lunches were also removed."
good,"Not a great place to work no time to plan your day or any training for the job,also very long hours as to meet monthly targets was near impossible, on the flip side working at that level was a good learning experience."
good,"Would recommend as an employer, I learned a great deal.  Worked with intelligent, helpful people who always worked as a team with the exception of a few."
good,"As soon as the oil price dropped, they closed our entire site.  Lots of people left looking for a job.  I worked for a company that survived for 20 years as a small, private company.  After 4 years of being purchased by NOV, the doors were closed."
good,"This job did not offer me advancement kept me on as a temp for many years.  The manager was very rude and disrespectful to the employees, but I stayed as long as I could until I realize I needed more."
good,Professional employees.  Good safety.  Worked at manufacturing site.  Good environment and culture.  Helpful people.  Provided independence in assigned work.
good,"it was an ok place to work until there was a change in management. when to company was busy, it had more good moments the bad. but at the end they started making too many changed that only benighted the company"
good,A typical day at NOV was me asking my supervisor for work to do and I'm not sure why she wouldn't give me work to do in order to help her. On days that she didn't give me work I would try and find things on my own to do.
good,worked at nov got lots of experience and learned a lot about the oilfield. started off and took the technical college. advanced on the top drive and cranes
good,"Low pay is not balanced by job security.  Management does not necessarily have customer's best interest in mind, especially smaller customers who are, comparatively, not making large orders.  Internationally, NOV will cut out middle man, if at all possible, regardless effort and ethical issues."
good,"The Plant Manager was a tyrant, who would yell and scream in your face."
good,I love working for the company except that you are required to work too many hours. There were days when I would work more than 24 hours with no time to rest. There is very little job security. The good boys club has a lot to do with promotions in the company.
good,"NOV is a very large company.  As such, I have noticed the tendency to make the individual ""specialize"" in one area of their job.  This is especially true for Accounting/Finance folks.  As a financial analyst prior to acquisition by NOV, I saw all financial performances from all business entities.  After the acquisition, the focus was much more narrow and became even more so as I moved up in the organization.  I often experienced a lack of communication from superiors regarding organizational changes that caught me completely off guard.  I realize this is not unique for large companies."
good,"In a typical day you are under pressure from your managers constantly to work hard and fast, with very little gratitude.  As a 10 year veteran of the company I was treated as if I did not matter at all.  In those 10 years I received only 2 raises, the first of which was within two years of originally being hired."
good,"good job in a very safe working area making oil pipes in a very close tolorence.I WAS 12 hour shitfs and we were in a high production area because these pipes had to be threaded on both ends because there to be cnnected one end to another.I learned how metal pipes can connect tightly with out using gasket materal,we all worked together working from shift to shift."
good,soportar el estrés de otras personas y tranquilizarlas. y tiene una mala administración gerencial
good,"Lots of overtime when oil prices are high"
good,Amazing place to work with good colleagues that are always there to help you. It's a massive company but surprisingly the opportunities to grow are limited.The company follows a reference base culture in order to promote.
good,"high pay and long hours in a unforgiving atmosphere. the oil field is no place for the faint of heart, most of the guys are felons or think they are just a bit better than you. you better leave your feelings  in the truck."
good,The lack of training will leave you high and dry when situations arise. Supervisors will not back you and will state that if you have questions that you need to ask.
good,bad management. They do reorganization all the time. The managers usually do not know much about what they are doing. They just want to get things done and get promoted.
good,"As a project engineer, I had up to 16 projects to manage every 3 months.  These were large pieces of equipment that included trucks, trailers and welded skids.  I worked directly with 6 other engineers and had 3 mechanical designers in my immediate group."
good,possible redundancy's so mixed views at moment given only starting with the company at the start of the year though the training given was superb
good,This company made promises of raises and promotions but in three years never delivered. I had a Bachelor's degree in Business Management when I hired on and was never afforded the opportunity to function in that capacity. The management harassed employees and constantly threatened employee's job. My co-workers complained about the lack of raises and promotions. The environment was negative filled with constant criticism of supervisors and lead men. The most enjoyable part of the job was my resignation after three years of broken promises and blatant neglect of promotion request.
good,"This was a good company to work for, even in the short period of time I was there.  People were all polite and helpful. There was definitely a lot of information to absorb while working here."
good,At the time the company ran lean so a heavy work load was needed.  Management was non-existent.  Poor leadership and no work/life balance.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of conducting daily inventory cycle counts, pulling customer orders, loading/unloading freight, and building centrifugal pumps."
good,you get told you are up for advancement when reality your not
good,good place to work. after 15.7 years was laidoff boss did not like me
good,Oil Company Expanding and National Oilwell is becoming a industy leader
good,"There was always lots of work to be done, which i liked that part becuase im a person that likes to stay busy. They do not deliver on their promises to raises or advancements. discriminating."
good,"employees were never appreciated,no matter what kind of record month they had it was never enough,raises were hardly ever given to people who deserved them,it wasn't what u knew, it was who u knew, long shifts,very poor wages,screwed up management..."
good,I was promised a promotion with this company but they did not supply me with the tools I needed to do a good job. Because of this I was not promoted or given a raise and left at a low paying job despite my qualifications. The managment is poor. They require long hours which leaves little time for a personal life.
good,"The company doesn't care bout how many hours you work, or  that you even have another life beside work. The other workers there are keww tho. The pay is decent but not good"
good,When you get hired they try and pay you as little as possible. I know of 3 different people with a journeyman ticket with the same amount of experience and there is a $3 difference in pay.
good,"This company used to be a great place to work, until it merged with the national part of the company, now it’s all about what the company gains, screw the employees they’re dispensable , it’s what can you do for the company screw what you need, and most of the management are out for themselves only, they’ll lie cheat and ignore just as long as they still have a job"
good,"NOV offers great work/life balance. Yet, pay is on the low range, compared to other company in the industry. Many organizational problems limit personal and career development for employees."
good,Started off as a good job. Plenty of work and hours... Then the lies started soon as local management and a new department manager came in. They also created a hostile work environment with their constant threats and treating all employees like trash
good,The company has changed from being dynamic and flexible to rules driven and bureaucratic over the last three years.  Outside hiring over promotion from within is also occurring.
good,"It was a great opportunity. It was good to work here. There was a change in management, not a good one, and it ultimately let me leave the company. That is all i have to say about the company. it was a good experience overall. I dont want to bash the company. it was a great opportunity."
good,"It was fast pace hard work driven place. We work 12hrs a day 6-7 days a week. The pay rate pretty much stay the same, so the only way to make sufficient funds is to work the hrs. They provide great benefits that's really all about it. Now depending location will determine how you get treated by the staff."
good,Management doesn't want to foster growth within the company and plays favorites. Compensation is hard to come by but instead expect high level of work with out any acknowledgement.
good,"14+ hour shifts, sometimes overnight. benefits include: pay for drive time and company pays for housing when working, life, vision, dental, and health insurance with 401k plan. Lots of variety on jobs"
good,"The organization is locked in an old school mentality and treats their employees like they are lucky to have a job. Everyone is underpaid, women are not given equal opportunities, and management talks about employee engagement without doing anything to actually make it happen. NOV needs to adapt to current market and employment conditions in order to attract and retain talent."
good,They expect you to work 16 hrs everyday. Not the best organized company and seem to be going backwards as far as keeping up with inventories and billing requirements/procedures.
good,"Very 9-5, make sure you show up ready to work a solid 8 hours, as we all should."
good,Weak managers. Very cut throat environment. No compensation increases. Bonuses have been stripped from employees. Turn around rates in this particular facility is high.
good,i learned alot at NOV. When i first started it was fun and i was happy to go to work everyday. The people were willing to show you everything there was to learned. The chances to move up was based on how quick you could learn the job.
good,"The shop and field work are good, but not enough overtime and pay is below average for oil & gas industry. Due to the current downturn jobs are far and few between and the ability to move up in the company is nill."
good,Your experience at NOV totally depends on the division and business unit you work at. Mine was very poor with low salary and no opportunity for growth. Compensation largely depends on a significant bonus that often does not materialize when the market is down.
good,"San Angelo (factory closed)"
good,"A family atmosphere and dedicated workers."
good,"For it being a company I worked for for over 10 years, once the management changed, I could not see myself with National Oilwell any longer. My management spoke to everyone like we were dogs. It would make me sick just pulling in the parking lot for work. There was no talking to his boss about how we all felt because he was best friends with his manager. Not a very enjoyable place to work once management changed. Was laid off do to ""reduction in force"" but I know my name was at the top of the list because of our personality conflict. Regardless that I was the top revenue producer in the Houston Downhole division."
good,"Control system software type work; PLC, HMI, interegration; Not very good management; co-workers are friendly; Helping field service technican some time could be very hard; Test code and prove it works."
good,hard working lads but management needs an overhaul. A complete change in structure is needed for the company to progress
good,"The division I was in had recently bought another company and the merger was slow and unorganized but the people I worked with I really enjoyed, the VP was great. The company that NOV acquired was behind the times in regards to technology and efficient so it caused a lot of problems on orders and project management."
good,"The management of NOV in my division was lacking and needed to be revamped. There wasn't much room in promotion.It was somewhat of an easy job, unless you knew a lot, and due to mismanagement of employee skills you did not have a lot of responsibility."
good,My co-workers at NOV were very helpful and supportive . The work was varied and there was very tight deadlines .  There was no typical day
good,"Starting my career in the oil and gas industry was great, until the crude oil dropped and the next gen program will be shut down."
good,The only thing I did not like about this company was the management. I think it was an poorly ran company therefore there was a lot of overtime and plenty of 12 hour shifts.
good,"extremely overworked, often 6 to 7 days a week, excessive micro management with very little guidance. Senior management often tries to complete employee;s job instead of their own and individuals are not allowed to grow through trial and error."
good,there was never a set schudule or how many hours worked for the week it was a manufacturing shop so we built mostly the same product on a daily bases
good,Management needs improvement. There all about numbers and profit  instead of the employee. But are willing to train you in other trades within the company.
good,not a great place to work but it will pay a few bills. no raises or advancement in the work place. You will be worked to death when there is work. There isn't any work right now and its very depressing.
good,"This company has a culture of favouritism. The efficiency and the productivity of the employees is not appreciated unless you know someone higher-up in the company. The HR always favor managers in any dispute. In hiring new employees, mangers can hire people that they know previously. The performance review process is also flawed. Even speaking up and healthy critism of the managers or company policies is not tolerated."
good,Stressful place to work. Poor management. Women are treated differently than the men. Flex hours are a plus. Training is poor. Turn over rate is too high. No room for advancement.
good,"Company pays for training and examination fees towards certification."
good,"coworkers ok"
good,not bad conditions and good workforce but let down by senior management who's philosophy was DO AS I SAY and take the blame
good,"This job consisted of preparing shop drawings for pipe manufacture based on the plans and specifications.  Management is usually OK and co-workers were great.  This work is considered by many to be boring, but there is a certain feeling of accomplishment when the drawings are correct and complete."
good,I spent most days calling on Land Drilling Rigs in southeast Texas.  I really enjoyed learning the ends and outs of how land rigs operate.  Management really left me alone as long as my number were up which they always were.
good,"Excellent company to work for if you are already well established. Great opportunity to learn and get exposed to the oil and gas field. Enjoyed working here, but the pay is not adequate for the amount of time/work put forth (you will work weekends 70-80%of the time). Don't work here if you expect to spend much time with your family. With that said, it is a very good company with good benefits."
good,NOV does not help you with very much. very little training and they don't seem to care.
good,Good opportunity for learning experience
good,it was a decent place to work for a bit the job security sucked though you never know when you will be next.
good,"A lot of driving from rig to rig. Rigs are anywhere from 30 min to 4 hours apart. Some coworkers have bad attitudes and are lazy and not team players, and managers will not do anything about them. Get to work by yourself a lot. Often very long hours and not able to have much of a life outside of work. Days off are not guaranteed, will sometimes get called in on your days off."
good,"constant and fast paced workload, can be stressful at times. The supervisor very willing to help train and help with workload. Cross trained in all departments to be able to cover when an employee was out."
good,A good company to work for when the economy is strong and a republican in president. Volatile when energy sector is decreasing. Layoffs are plentiful when market is down.
good,"Challenging and sometimes stressful. A lot of on the job training. I f you are proactive and willing to put times in learning new things, pick up new skills, you will survive."
good,Within NOV there is a fairly large disconnect between upper management and the lower levels where the work is performed. Management of Change tends to not be well thought out or poorly executed from the executive level. New rules and processes are often rolled out from the corporate level with little to no consideration as to their potential negative impact on facilities globally.
good,It was a temporary job. The co workers were good to work with. I learned alot. I became a crew leader. I supervised 5 guys. We did go some overtime but not alot.
good,"I really like my job. But, I applied at T3 which was purchased by NOV. The changes seemed good in the beginning but with the down turn of the industry,  I believe it would be better if I looked for work else where."
good,"There was both good and bad... Typical of almost any company."
good,"NOV is not a place to advance your career, information is consistently withheld. Management looks after themselves which is unfortunate, there is no team building or communication. Other than that NOV is a great place to work just don't expect to move forward in this company."
good,Good work environment. Mostly good people work there. Not a lot of team work goes on there. Very stressful not knowing if you were going to get laid off at any moment.
good,"Not a bad job but you recieve little to no notice before being called on a job, and you will travel 80-100% of your assignments. Management is not very considerate of your home or family life. This job pays decent but still lower than the average offshore technical postion. The company has continuously taken more and more of the once given bonuses and incentives."
good,"management is very poor, management careless for there employees, always accused of not doing enough, pretty much employee is just a number, doesn't matter who does or works more, the one that works more always will work more with a general pay raise, plant manager careless for his employees."
good,"Maintenance Technician with knowledge in trouble shooting control system,pneumatic and hydraulic system ,etc..able to work under pressure and flexible"
good,Overall its a very good company to work for. the ability to maintain employees during a oil depression is a very positive attribute. ability to work most the hours you need or want depending on job.
good,Certain members of management are excellent while higher management is absolutely terrible with hardly any room for advancement. Nov rolligon does not offer a good workplace for development
good,"12 hour work days monday thru saturday. You literally live, breath, and eventually die for National Oilwell Varco. No life for yourself outside work. If you are married and have children this isn't the company for you."
good,Great employees that were under appreciated. Also had to many changes in management causing direction to shift all the time. Good benefits such as vacation time.
good,You show up to work and you run your operation as fast as humanly possible without sitting ever. You do all of this without complaint for 70 hours per week. Take some time off if you dare.
good,Très Peu de perspectives d'évolutions dans le design
good,Upper Management needs to be overhauled at the corporate level. There are still good people but the future of the comny needs to be adjusted.Store managers need to be helprd by listeningt them...
good,company is big enough to offer many different opportunities and experiences.  Good place to work to gain valuable experience and exposure to the many facets that make the oil field a challenging and opportunity rich workplace
good,"It was a great transition job for me.  The pay was off the charts good, however if you are looking for a 9-5 job this is not the place to look.  you are on call 24/7."
good,"Really tough to move around, they do not focus much on employee development. Benefits are great, but not good enough to keep people happy. Morale is very low and everyone feels underpaid."
good,"I came to work, and talked to the previous shift, and went to work.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make small  parts in tolerance that the machine was not capable of because it was meant for larger parts.  They treated me well until my job was gone because plant was closed.  I lost my job after 30 years.  I did nothing wrong.  I miss it very much. Trying to start over. Co-workers and benifets and supervisor was great."
good,"I travel around 75% of the time, mostly international sometimes lasting 3 months or more working 7 days a week. For the amount of hours I work, I get 0 overtime pay, and this is unacceptable."
good,"flexible workplace, too many changes in management and decisions , no clear system, need a lot of work, wages not within market ranges."
good,"I initially enjoyed working for the company. Since the downturn in oil and gas, a lot of true colors have surfaced and there is just no where to grow in the company."
good,At NOV you get the opportunity to take on great responsibility not matter what your age is. A great place to learn and be challenged but to contribute as well.
good,Had a 12 hour work shift while working there and was always scared of getting fired after the first month due to seeing someone fired and replaced every week.
good,do the same thing everyday. you have about 5 different bosses watching you all day. alot of favoritism shown. no raises for about 2 years. no personal life.
good,Long days with decent pay. Average 100 hour weeks. Lots of drive time from rig to rig. Required to work on all NOV product lines. Little time off due to 24 hour on call.
good,"Yearly Performance review that doesn't make sense."
good,"Great place to start your oil and gas career, pay is horrible.NOV is known to be the lowest paid oil and gas service company but the experience is Goo"
good,"The internship was good overall, but the oil and gas industry is very radical now. You never know how well the industry is doing. They've stopped taking in accounting interns because there is not much money anymore. They will not give any compensation for housing even if you were to relocate to where the job is! Overall, the employees were nice, and the culture is good. You learn a lot, but when the oil and gas industry is down, there is not much work to do. In fact, many factories are closed. They'll cut on costs by laying off more people and not hiring people at all. I do not recommend working in the Oil and Gas industry. I'll never do that again!"
good,I enjoy many of the people I work with. I have about 28 employees that depend on me for support from day to day. I assign duties as needed and make changes if necessary.
good,"Typical Day at Work: Balancing office life with shop work"
good,"Very stressful due to the unstable market.  We have had 5 layoffs in the past year.  I am the only Buyer left with exception of my supervisor.  A lot of extra responsibilities have been imposed on the remainder of the staff."
good,"Due to downturn in oil industry, I lost my job.  I enjoyed it while I was there.  Wish there were better training procedures, but all in all, a good experience."
good,"Great for a work life balance, with plenty of opportunities to take training classes to enhance your portfolio. However, the lack of oversight from upper management creates an atmosphere of laziness and incompetance"
good,"I was expected to keep myself busy without much help from management. As the number of drilling rigs to support declined, I tried to keep busy with make work, but even that became nearly impossible. The projects I was working on were very important for the companies' future, but were progressing very slowly due to the downturn in drillin"
good,My group used to be great to work in. Management changes and market conditions really gutted the core talent out. Group has a high turnover rate.
good,Hours we long but this job ended up not being a fit for me. It started out being decent but I ended up being laid off during the economic down turn.
good,"mye å gjøre"
good,"Meu estágio na NOV em termos de aprendizado foi xcelente."
good,"My 8 1/2 yrs at NOV was a pleasant job, I came down from OKC to open up the NOV shop and trained all the workers that were hired on."
good,"Really not the best place to be employed. Surprise how this location was to allow to operate. At the end of the day the , all that matter were  the numbers. Quality was an after thought, quality of life was non existent, and accountability  was frivolous."
good,Was a very slow working environment .  Benefits and salary were good.  The people were very nice and the location was very good and they supplied parking
good,"This can be good and also bad. Strong growth through M&A's, but companies are ran largely how they have always been ran. If you like to keep your head down and go along to get along then you will be fine. If you like to question the status quo then if you question the wrong process or common practice then you may not last long. Management ranks is very political. Thus, you have to do a lot of faking. Lack of diversity in upper management. Senior management , director, executive level in ALL business groups."
good,"En trivelig arbeidsplass med spennende prosjekter, hvor forståelsen av regelverk og gode interne prosedyrer er nøkkelen til et suksessfullt prosjekt. God kommunikasjon mot kunde og tredjepart er også avgjørende for at prosjekt skal gå så smidig og kostnadseffektivt som mulig. "
good,"Not the best management in the world, they never really understood much, was not a family friendly, didn't really care about employees that much. Everyone was out to help themselves and don't care who heads they stepped on to get there"
good,It is very gratifying to work in this company with very supportive management. My colleagues are open to help you grow and learn from them. The management is pushing you to your best of ability and challenge you to step above.
good,NOV is a great company with excellent benefits.  Working there though takes a toll on your personal life.  Limited days off and long hours.
good,The best thing that I can say about this job is that I have gotten to learn and experience a lot in comparison to my peers. I've gotten to travel internationally and work with many types of drilling operations. Most of my learnings have been through failed projects due to poor management and lack of organization. Learning what not to do and how not to do it is more important than always succeeding.
good,With the oil and gas being were it is right now we are not as secure about job status. I start work at 6am and do not finish till 730 or 8pm some days.
good,"Aprendi muito na GE Celma, tínhamos um bom ambiente entre os colegas de trabalho, mas passamos por muitas crises e os gerentes passavam todo o stress par aos funcionários, não sabiam reter."
good,"This is a great oil and gas company to ""get your feet wet"" but that development comes with a price.  NOV pays around the 45th percentile of industry, meaning that if you're expecting compensation structures similar to that of the big O&G players, you're coming to the wrong place. "
good,"This place needs to change the culture and management style. Good old boys club. There is no career advancement with this"
good,"Job Work/Life Balance:"
good,"The job varied from 12 hours a day to 26 hours.  Lot of driving to location to middle of nowhere.  Co-workers were great, management needed help in people skills.  Good balance of being on my own and working with a team.  Worst part of job was insufficient training and locations of oil rigs.  The location meant you often were without cell service and if you needed assistance it was difficult to ascertain.  Pros of the job was working with very hard working and determined co-workers and really feeling like you got a lot done."
good,"Fast, continuous growth by aquisition has created a chaotic, disorganized environment."
good,"Worked 12 hours shifts 6 days a week. Time always flew by due to being busy. Lacked on being responsible on ordering supplies. Co-workers all ways got along. Management was not always available. Nothing was too hard on the job, just needed patience and team effort to finish projects."
good,"Too many power hungry, and abusive personalities. Interdepartmental Communications is about 15%. VERY POOR!!!"
good,Not the ideal place to work if your looking for structure. The benefits are great and pay is lower than average for work performed.
good,"NOV is a overall a great company, there is great potential for growth if you are willing to relocate."
good,Adhere to all aspects of the oil and gas industry daily and meet customer and management expectations.
good,Working at NOV has been an excellent learning experience. I have had the opportunity to learn every down hole tool that we have in our fleet. I work with an incredible team of Field Engineers that are always ready to share information and knowledge whenever needed. The hardest part of the job has been its instability as far as days worked vs days off.
good,"I enjoyed my time at national oil."
good,"moving parts, getting employees line up for the day."
good,Using fork lifts and cranes while working on coiled tubing. While it was a new learning experience I felt it had a few to many danger zones. Management was not as aware of problems but co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of the job was being lifted in cranes using safety harnesses to secure tubes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 14 day work schedule.
good,12 hour shifts the pay is not that great but the benefits compensate where the hourly wage lacks. I've learned to be proficient and to be safe (safety is very important) management is not all that great in order to advance in the company you have to be with the company for some time (6+ years)  or know somebody. if you want to transfer to a different NOV location it may be a little more difficult that you would think. the hardest part of the job is much like any other job just politics and the long hours. most enjoyable part of my job is gaining experience and knowing you are working for a large company and you may eventually be able to advance and make great money.
good,"Typical day at work was unpleasant."
good,"Productive and fun place. I attended many traning course in Finance, accounting, safety etc. helped me perform my duties well."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job has been the experience of interacting with customers and the different levels of management.
good,Average day consist of working with a router/traveler and blueprints.
good,We seem to do an awful lot without ever releasing products or making money. Morale has been low because of financial problems and management issues.
good,"Great employee perks, horrible compensation! You will stay busy throughout the day. You get every holiday off, but you'll be a temp for a very long time!"
good,This company is not about what
good,"Management isn't very organized. Your hard word definitely goes unnoticed. No one gets raises and there is not much room for growth. Health benefits are great, so that's a plus."
good,"Started Great then they reduced personel. Pressure from the customer combined with pressure from NOV by not having enough personal was extremely stressful. Suppose to be a 16 hour limit to working a day but constantly went over and was never held back. Would be on weekends by myself because I was a good tech and had to cover 14+ rigs by myself. They have been working on new inventory billing and job tracking system for years and it is still doesn't work great. I watched a good business model be destroyed in 3 years. I was there for 6 could be a dream job for techs if it was ran right from the Top. Store managers are pretty cool, but goes down from there. Talk about bonuses but haven't seen one in years."
good,"- Work life balance is good"
good,NOV provides the employees the ability to branch into many different parts of the oil and gas industry.  NOV gives the employee an opportunity to network with many other organizations within the oil and gas industry.
good,"Coworkers were second to none and always available for assistance."
good,"National Oilwell Varco was a good company to work for, but like any large company customer sales are the driving force. The oil business is too fragile."
good,"My time at NOV was a learning experience everyday. My managers were very supportive and flexible when it came to personal  home life issues. The one thing NOV needs to work on is the pay structure, they tend to underpay their workforce. The company is also to top heavy."
good,"As a machine operator for NOV, safety co concern is neglected until its too late. Quanity is pushed over quality. Machines have poor maintanance and are under constant down time."
good,"If your not part of the ""Click"" or old timers it is very hard for you to do anything there. Management will hold you down at all costs if you do not fit their agenda."
good,"It's oilfield life, can't expect long term out of a lower position. If you are in need of a quick penny, they are good. They train and usually keep good hands busy. Make a good hand and while they have work, so will you. Nest egg, when there is a hiccup, you will need it."
good,"Sounded great, all the standards flaunted but management and customer relations below levels expected. "
good,"Overall it a good company to work but it always there some bad influences that  become a problem, when you give monkey the leash to walk the dog what happens."
good,Rig comes in gets prussure washed top to bottom rebuild parts that r wore out or broke and fix anything that needs fixed put back together sandblast everything and paint
good,Great company that started off with a great work culture. They paid well and took care of the employees in that aspect. Management could have been better about listening to employees and helping to fulfill the needs of those employees. Field supervisors were given too much leniency even when they were doing things against company policy. Things brought to the hire-ups attention tended to be swept under the rug and not discussed and fixed.
good,"This work was very high paced but not stressful."
good,Long hours are required sometimes 12 to 16 in one day schedule is a bit hectic at times for a career advancement must undergo lots of testing in red tape just for a few dollars shop is hot during summer time freezing cold during winter time but you do get three breaks two 15 minute and one 30 minutes lunch
good,NOV là công ty dịch vụ nước ngoài chuyên cung ứng nhân lực cũng như thiết bị phục vụ cho các dự án khoan thăm dò và khai thác dầu khí. Môi trường làm việc chuyên nghiệp.
good,I would not recommend working at this company. The management was not up to par. The office was laid back but not a healthy environment to work in. The job itself was not difficult and the people were friendly for the most part outside of the management.
good,This is a great place to work if you don't mind nightshirt 12 hours a night 5-6 nights a week. There is plenty of room here to make a difference and suggestions I have made are honestly and impartially considered. My direct supervisor is a great man to work for and that makes the job much more enjoyable.
good,nice company to work for just not much room to advance unless you graduated from A&M or have family that currently work for the company. Still have a great rapport with colleagues outside of work.
good,"I like working there and with some of the guy's but management is terrible and the no incentives, no raises, no reason to work hard and no loyalty to the employees. They want a lot from us but don't want to give to us."
good,"Under the correct leadership NOV was a great place to work. However, as the industry and leadership changed so to did the loyalties, priorities and opportunities."
good,In a production facility I had to cover issues myself with no help getting the same issues fixed permanently.  It was very difficult trying to get work through the shop.
good,One of the first place i worked and enjoyed working... I worked with excitement and gave it all. Knowing that i have professionals that were ready to teach and put me through in every aspect of my field.
good,working on oil rigs very messy. rebuilding of oilwell exploratory and maintenance drilling rigs and equipment.hydraulic systems and cable drums lots fire hazards and oil
good,"This isn't a place to ""make your mark"". If you want to go with the flow and not challenge the status quo, it is a great company. Benefits are wonderful."
good,"Good place to start your career. You can be exposed to a lot of products and engineering. However, Employee development plan is poor. Working culture can be competitive."
good,I have worked for this company for over 10 yrs.  They have good benefits and I have learned a lot in this time.  I have had some great managers and some horrible ones.  The hardest part of the job is going to work everyday knowing I am underpaid and watching money being spent on cosmetic items and not the employees.  This is not company wide just the group I am currently with.
good,"fast place to work management like to play fav. alot, no time off alot of hours. "
good,"I worked at NOV for 12+ years and had a lot of positive experiences and opportunities over that time.  Unfortunately with the downturn there was a lot of restructuring, and a new management team that came into Houston decided to shut down our engineering office in Edmonton.  Overall it was a good place to work, but a lot of questionable decisions were made over the last 2 years and I can't say that I liked the direction the company was heading."
good,"Begin shift with operations in process, check the machines job board."
good,"Manufacturing of oil and gas products."
good,We were bought by NOV about 3 years ago. Changes started after about 6 months. The place was re-modeled to make room for more work. They shut down a larger facility and moved in new equipment and work to Claremore. The employees busted their tails to get the work out. Then the work slowed down and orders stopped coming in. We could see new orders were being placed with other facilities in the UK and Canada. One morning we were all called to the break room. We were told to go home after the meeting and take all our personal belongings. They were shutting the doors. This company had been there for 30 years until a multi-billion dollar company came in and bought them. It was a sad day to say goodbye to the people that had devoted so much of there lives to this place.
good,"NOV - typical oil and gas company.  When the markets good your job is secure.  When it downturns you are out of a job."
good,"Empresa não muito organizada e com ambiente de trabalho regular."
good,Use to be a really good company to work for with great benefits but has really turned when the new CEO took over. During the downturn they really take it down to the bare minimum
good,"I have worked on the CNC lathes and Maintenance, being involved in projects in both parts of the job to introduce 5's and PPM into maintenance as well as designing and manufacturing test pieces, to help improve job times and efficiency"
good,"A busy working environment on the machines, coming into contact with a number of different jobs on a daily basis. Interesting and sometimes challenging work."
good,I had the privilege to meet some awesome people while be able to hone my communication skills.  The culture and work atmosphere was a great experience.
good,"During my years working for NOV, I have faced many challenges. While I feel that my opinion was heard and appreciated sometimes putting ideas into action is difficult. I have learned creative thinking to find solutions to problems that did not require extensive changes."
good,"NOV is a great place to work. Different every day as far as the requirements of the job. Most of the people you work with are honest and are willing to work with you in a team atmosphere to accomplish any given goal."
good,"The Job is consistent of being a production shop , it pays well and the benefits are good , besides the uncontrollable lead machinist , its alright place to work."
good,"This job was the first as a bench tech when I got out of school. I really liked the opportunity they gave me to put my new education to use. Working with R&D helped my even more, I will always be grateful for the education they gave me."
good,NOV is a good company to work for. They do take care of their employees but when oil is down things can get bad. You can count on it to be layoffs.
good,"my typical day in the office is always busy, but fun with my co-workers after the days task fulfilled."
good,This is one of the biggest company in oil and gas industry all over the world. But it has a lot of problem on management. New employee couldn't learn the company culture. They work separated in group and less interpersonal working together.
good,"open warehouse, do morning inventory, prepare orders for shippment , recieve incoming freight, take care of incoming customers needs, do daily reports to empoyees"
good,"great benefits"
good,I was unable to attract or kiss enough but to get noticed for all my hard work. Aggressively applied for many vacant positions. never to get an interview
good,NOV will give you the opportunity to learn other positons/ machines. I enjoyed the veterans at my location. They were always willing to teach. Good people.
good,"Just a OK company to work much bigger than the Employees that help build the company, management can be much better when it comes to lower level employees"
good,"A typical day involved getting up around 6 and driving out to the site about twenty minutes away. We then had a cross shift meeting and took over the sit for the next 12 hours. The job was to unload vac-trucks full of drilling mud over shakers and take the remaining fluid and process it. I was responsible for moving heavy bags of chemicals up onto tanks, mixing them in, and taking samples to ensure it was safe to re use the reclaimed water. I also transfer the mix to different tanks through the process and was also responsible for maintenance and site tidiness."
good,"Star of the day is base on Safety, fun working with my co-workers sharing ideas and goals. Excessive amount of favoritism among appointed  leads and lack of support from Management too much politics.The learning came mostly as travel knowledge instead of set Training."
good,NOV will train their employees and give them a false sense of security.  NOV prefers to lay off their employees instead of reallocate their resources.  I worked for this company for 6 years and was laid off last week without any reason.  They simply took my equipment and escorted me out.  NOV is a horrible place to work.
good,"no communication, everyone is against each other instead of work as one,  very little improvement, great opportunity to advance, good benefits"
good,There's not a whole lot of team bonding here. It seems like an apathetic place to work and everyone is watching one another.
good,"It's ok, not all what people may think of it as cause it's nothing like the working offshore the money not there cause I have a friend work offshore and the money is great and benefit out there."
good,"Working at NOV for 7 years allowed me to grow as an individual, learning how to properly use power tools, gain organizational skills, as well as enhance my computer skills. Management begin with great culture, but after a change in management the morale between worker and management begin to decline. The fellow co-workers were outstanding, but because of the high turnover rate, many did not last. the hardest part of the job, was dealing with verbal harassment on a daily basis. The employees, the truck drivers and the venders seemed to ease the stress, and made it easier to work."
good,I deal with customers from all over the world while handling the F.A.T for my Shift.
good,"The field service tech is always on his/her toes because he/she never knows when a service call will come up. It's definitely not a job for the ""normal"" 8 to 5 person. One must always be available to work 24/7. The management is just okay. The company seems to focus more on keeping the upper management happy and the people that actually do the work are expendable. The people one interacts with, i.e. the customers and co workers, will be some of the most colorful and great individuals one will ever meet. The hardest part of the job would be the toll all of the traveling takes on your personal life. Ironically, the travel is very enjoyable as well. If the technician is lucky enough to work in such exotic locations as China, Spain, Africa, etc, the travel is definitely something to treasure."
good,"Great culture and good benefit"
good,I have been with National Oilwell Varco for almost 10years. I have worked myself up to learn all aspects of the company.  I know that I would like to advance more but are limited because of location.  I was raised in Weatherford & my children are currently attending school in Weatherford.  I'm linked to this location.  I have been in the management role and it was a learning experience that I was not given excess amount of time to turn around the facility.  I was re-directed to another location.  I have proved myself as an employee because of my knowledge & loyalty to this company I was able to continue my current pay.  I am bless that I was given that opportunity to learn & i want to continue to learn.  The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people.  The hardest part of the job is the oil industry comes & goes.
good,"Ambiente con una rutina mayormente establecida, he aprendido a saber cuál es la utilización y funcionamiento de las diferentes herramientas utilizadas, para la perforación de pozos de gas y de petróleo, he recibido curso de API, con conocimientos en realizar ensayos no destructivos, con tintes penetrantes, con partículas magnéticas secas y húmedas, he participado en la pruebas de hidrostáticas con presiones de hasta 10.000psi. En el ares de Gator Hank, pertenecientes a Nov. Tengo conocimientos en todo lo que es mantenimiento,...E participado como tornero por mi empresa en el área de producción Pluspetrol, cuando se estaba poniendo en prueba la planta Malvinas."
good,"NOV has the ability to be a great company but the unfortunate side is the job I, and many others like me, were hired to do is not the job we are currently working. Most all Techs and Operators are now garaged at the company shop making less hours and much less money. I hired on to learn the oil field and rise to the top of my game but not to be a full-time shop hand. For this reason alone I am seeking a position in similar fields where I can learn, grow, and become the best at what I've chosen to do."
good,Fast paced environment where processes change all of the time.
good,"although i loved working for this company and there was plenty of work to do, i dont think they can be loyal to their employees that are loyal to them."
good,Overall typically an easy job if you have common sense.And able to work without helper
good,•Analyze and audit cost reports; oversee quarterly budget •Construct spreadsheets to create mutual windows to target at risk accounts for the company and identify ways to increase revenue and decrease expenses
good,"Poor management, poor financial practices. The schedules for field specialists was extremely erratic, as we never knew when we would be called out into the field."
good,"It was a job.  Same as a lot of others.  Some things were good, and some weren't.  The pay was good, the benefits were good, and the time off was good."
good,"It started off great , I got to travel to places I’ve never been and learned a skill I’ve never done and the money was good until they wanted me to relocate to west Texas , with a family I couldn’t do that ."
good,"I enjoyed my time at NOV, but raises are few and far between. There is high management turnover. In 9 years the shipping department went through 7 managers and the plant went through 4 general managers."
good,"Se realizan muchas tecnicas de trabajo para diferentes tipos de tuberia, cualquier persona que se quiera dedicar al ambito Oil & Gas, es una buena empresa para adquirir experiencia en los procedimientos y normas."
good,The immediate management and staff were impeccable. Unfortunately the oil and gas sector is in an economic down turn and restructuring /  down sizing starts first with the companies #1 asset.
good,"Opportunity for internal growth during the down turn.  I have been at NOV for a short time and I've seen lots of changes, support from management, and HR.  Due to the changes it has allowed internal employees the opportunity to expand in their career at NOV."
good,Not good working environment/Less benefit/Management not good/No career development/No friendly collouge/Salary pay not good/Not proper training development program
good,"Day usually starts at 5 to 7 am. "
good,Aprenderás mucho pero debes tener encuentra que es muy pesado el trabajo en el que te desempeñaras.
good,Downturn sucks.  Seen a lot of good people come and go.  a lot of worthless people still here getting promoted.  The pay is good but not great like you would expect.
good,Lots of family connections. Wrong people in positions due to their connections and not experience. No standardization of procedures. HR info spreads quickly.
good,The job was ok. Just got tired of going home every day covered in graphite. The pay could have been better but it was fairly decent for an entry level job.
good,"I don't have much to say, because baught out the company I was working for, and that's one of the reason I left ..it became so different after they took over . We used to get 1500 bonus for Xmas but when they took over they didn't give us nothing"
good,"Decent place to start your career, as with this industry oil and gas is constantly up and down. Co-workers are polite and welcoming, systems are up to date."
good,Always a full day of work and I like that. Day starts with SCRUM and sprints planned in JIRA. I like being able to balance my projects or better use of my time.
good,Great place to work and good leadership. Learned a lot once my career advanced after I gotten the opportunity to grow within the company. opportunity to take personnel advancement classes for promotions and positions.
good,"Top management tends to forget about employees that perform for the companies benefit."
good,Very fast-paced environment.  Lots of overtime.  I learned a great deal about welding and fabrication.  Lots of lifting and working in heat due to welding.
good,"A typical day at work starts from 8 am to 5 pm."
good,"unfair to long of hours for short amount of pay,  i watched the store manager get demoted from his position to parts runner and i watch people with 17 to 18 years take an early retirement package"
good,"I honestly do not have much to say about this company, as I was not wit them for very long. Other then I did like who I worked with. It was am easy job"
good,takes too long to fix machines when broken and order of equipment needed also takes too long to order. No bonuses nor commisions when reached our sales target.
good,"Was treated quite fairly, lots of room to move up in the company, a few bad eggs CAN spoil the bunch, but if you can avoid them, everything is good as far as I'm concerned"
good,It is exactly what you would expect from a large mult-national corporation.  There were many opportunities for career growth as well as the downside of kingdom building.  The corporate environment was amicable but not particularly empowering.
good,good compamy poor management at times alot of turn over the employees are good to each other they keep the work place fun modt of the time. no bonuses for hard wok
good,need better pay. need better work/life balance. need better direction. good place to learn new jobs and skills. great employees work here we just need to be appreciated.
good,"Prior to NOV merge or buying T3 Energy Services, the sales for OEM and after market services was high. It was after the merge that the sale went down due to limitation on agreements and legalities."
good,Costing was processed every Friday and every other Monday after payroll was run.  The rest of the week was used to prepare for Journal Entries and Account reconciliations.
good,"Been at the company for many years & have been treated poorly. It's all politics. Not willing to give someone within company with a lot of knowledge any new opportunities, would rather give jobs to kids right out of college with no experience & not knowing the how the company works"
good,"NOV is an adequate place to work.  Base pay is not necessarily the best but bonus, when paid, and potential for stock retention make the overall benefit package more attractive than some other companies."
good,"Was extremely physical job.  Very long hours, at least 16 hours a day.  Comp and Benefits were ok but cost of living in Texas was astronomical so it balanced out to a regular job.  Management is young and inexperienced."
good,"If you are looking to work in the oil and gas with little to no experience, this is a good place to start at. Fair pay and good hours. It gives lots of opportunity for growth."
good,This location is a branch of NOV. Business has been slow for several years hence no raises. I’m secure in my job as I’m the only one in the position. Unfortunately there is no advancement unless my boss dies or leaves company. There is a strong divide between upper and lower management. The “Good Ole Boys” club is very intrenched in upper management and I have yet to see someone cross from lower management to upper without a connection to this club. The atmosphere is very relaxed as long as you get your work done. This year will be 10 years for me and id say ive been here for the medical benefits for my family and job security over the pay.
good,"working at NOV is a great place to work, there is a lot to learn about the equipment, parts, processes, and systems.   I really enjoyed the day routine at NOV because, every day there was something to learn or teach others.   most of the time i would come home and just laugh at the different situations i went thru that day"
good,Small segment and great people to work with. The only downside is management is hesitant about hiring more people when we have too many projects going at the same time. They compensate pretty generously for your time but work life and personal life is hard to maintain with this type of busy work schedule in the small team atmosphere.
good,Work at national oilwell varco as a shop welder fabricator in California . It was a good job that I enjoyed doing. Orders would come in form customers with specifications of what they wanted built and we would build it.
good,It is a fast paced industry. Dealing with the ongoing changes of the oil and gas industry. I have had plenty of different responsibilities in my last 6 years employed by NOV. I have worked on the shop floor and have done multiple different administration tasks.
good,"Productive, good, fun, amazing, fantastic, excellent, cooperative, wonderful, comfortable, nice, cool, family-oriented, good leadership, supportive work place."
good,"Good job experience over all. It is a good company to work for, and the people are great. The job is rewarding and fun. I would recommend people to work for this company."
good,"A really friendly, relaxed but busy office consisting of 25 people mainly male."
good,"-Sempre trabalhando no limite"
good,"To acquire employment with a company that has growth potential, as well as benefits. I am seeking a company with the opportunity to utilize my skills and experience as well as the opportunity to develop new skills."
good,I work at National Oil Varco Company from 2013 to 2017. It was a good experience . I work as a machinist running the machine for the Company and i also know how to drive a forklift
good,My evaluations had a performance of 4 out of 5. I did not receive a raise with in the three years that I worked there. I was always working out side the box
good,Clock in check work orders check machineget pass down from 1st shift make sure work area is cleancheck and make sure i have materialfor the day start prepare my machine start my day
good,"The NOV I was at was forced to relocate. The time I spent there was not bad, I just had a few bad encounters with the manager. Altogether it is not a bad job for someone who likes to work long hours like I did. Benifets are really good, but they pay was not the best."
good,"thumbs down. The company fosters a supportive environment which lends itself to a spirit of cooperation and great teamwork. Colleagues and managers with many years of experience are very receptive to sharing their knowledge and continuous training is offered. The opportunity to spend down time with co-workers after business hours is available, with office lunches offered several times during the year."
good,"I enjoyed working at NOV, It was a good overall experience but the employee management style was not as effective and did not have a clear career development path. "
good,Allows employees to grow and develop their careers. Some senior managerial team changes made and creating a level of difficulty for low associate members. Overall some divisions are stronger than others and pay scale reflects.
good,this was an ok company to work for. they had good pay and benefits. to much politics do get anything done for a customer or for the branch you worked at.
good,Fast pace workplace with daily challenges and opportunities.  Job stress can be very high at times but that is also coupled with rewards and new opportunities.  Company culture provides avenues to learn many parts of the business as well as develop careers within multiple functional areas.
good,"Good place to work, strong since of community, willingness to educate staff and opportunity to grow. "
good,"Good company but I will say this, they will work you to the nub. No time off at all almost. The hardest part was as hands they used temps which makes it very tough."
good,"Set work schedule.  Learned to MIG weld.  Good benefits. Enjoyed doing inventory control.  Operated forklift, and overhead crane. Performed hydro testing on pressure vessels."
good,As a field service technician you basically don't have much of life outside of work. Being on call really hinders your ability to enjoy life. I was able to make the best of it and enjoyed my job and travel.
good,The company is a very well-known pipe yard company has a lot of competition but other than that the company is very fair lots of benefits and a very workable schedule work schedule.
good,"There are some great people working here, but they're stymied by a executive management team that believes they can cut and re-org themselves into profitability instead of focusing support for core products and defining a clear development strategy for the future."
good,"Management was adequate and gives you little guidance or support. The people were nice but creating their own job."
good,"OK company bad benifits hard work lots of employees Ok environment.likedd different job experriences. went to different locations. mexico, gulf of mexico"
good,"Most days were laid back here, and I was learning about how things operate out in the field in the oil industry.  My boss was a relaxed person except when it came to getting customer orders done in a timely and correct manner. I loved the people that I got to work with that made most days enjoyable.  I think the hardest part of the job is feeling like the outsider in not coming from a long time of working in the oil field and having to learn things that others have known for a long time."
good,Most days were challenging because of the many competing priorities with less than full management understanding of these challenges.  I learned several mods of Oracle that I did not know as well as an MRP system named Glovia.  There was family atmosphere most days with everyone trying to do whatever was needed to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job was completing every request of the warehouse to meet customer expectation with multiple departments sharing this resource.
good,The workplace was rigid and the environment was with many changes and the roles was with constant changing that created an uncertainty of the organization future in the months ahead.
good,Of course much of this had to do with the oil price falling as much as it did. This course many lay-off and the company lost most of its regular daily business.
good,The supervisors were flexible and accommodating with their employees. I learned a lot of great skills of the trade by visiting and working on different work sites.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at NOV and will be sad to leave as the company is downsizing and relocating back to America."
good,"Workday started at 5;00am with a toolbox meeting."
good,The company is okay for initial training but there is no room for growth or professional development. Poor management.
good,"Profissionalmente devo tudo a NOV. Cresci como Profissional, tive experiências internacionais e pude crescer como pessoa"
good,"Management often has no plan when dealing with issues, preffering a more off the cuff approach that always wastes more time and money than if they had approached with a more structured mindset"

good,Manage all aspects of repair of pressure control equipment.  Typical hours 0630-1730 hrs M-F with weekend work as need based on priority.  Good working environment.
good,Management is not good at NOV.  I noticed it's mostly family and friends that work there so it does not give you a fair chance to move up.
good,The people at the individual locations are great people but the changes that has occurred at corporate has lost sight of the employees as people instead they are listed as a number.
good,was a good place to work until the work go slow and then the dept was changed around and moved to different location.  learned a lot working in the field and working with different ppl.
good,"Good place to work, pretty stable job, family oriented, but not many job advancement opportunities. Hard to advance unless you are willing to relocate to Houston"
good,"a good place to work if you are middle management, the salaries and compensation are good but management does not know the first thing about what they are making or their respective field the are in"
good,Good place to work and to retire if you are a machinist.  Decent pay for the job you do and the work environment is good to work in.
good,"Could be better organised, too many people in wrong positions (particularly in management)."
good,"I worked on a typical day. Simple as that. I don't exactly have a social job as a CAD designer. I did learn some of AutoCAD Plant 3D and a little Inventor before I was let go due to economic concerns. The management was pretty good overall. I did feel appreciated even in light of the market downturn. My coworkers were generally nice. The most difficult part of the job was when I wasn't given enough information, which does happen sometimes. The most enjoyable part was that I got to create. That's why I like what I do in the first place, anyway."
good,Great time as a field engineer there learned a lot about the oil and gas bussiness. Loved traveling all over the world for work.
good,Nice place to work. I didnt care for my manager which caused me to leave the company. Very low pay compared to competitors
good,"Good co-workers, management needs to be looked at"
good,"Everyday started with the unit you were assigned to starting off where you had left off the previous day and getting as much done with the best quality possible."
good,pay was decent hours changed constantly due to the lack of market. management couldnt up hold promises or lied about bring on full time . lack of communication as well between different positions in the company
good,"Un-load products from supplier trucks to build pumps"
good,Worked for good people at National Oilwell Varco. Would be given job by engineer and would create location plans for various equipment such as junction boxes. Would also create detail drawings of these junction boxes.
good,"Good place to work just a shame about the down turn in the market and cuts have to be made."
good,NOV as a whole is a good company but our branch could be better. Starting from management down to the supervisors and leadmen.
good,A very fast paced and demanding job. The typical day involves order processing and expediting with vendors. Management is somewhat supportive when they want to be.
good,"Learned the downstream business in Oil & Gas, how rigs drill and how our Power Sections fit into the drilling and intervention process."
good,"it was good just needed a change in career"
good,This company is a great company to start of in for receiving experience and knowledge in the oilfield.  I never knew how the oilfield worked until i started here at NOV.
good,As with the nature of the business has turned so has the moral. Lack of management is key to playing a role in this. People are getting moved up who should get moved out.
good,great job great work place great management honest people give you a chance to learn training programs bonus every quater
good,"Get there at 5:45 start work at 6 clock into a work order and start assembly of draw works. I was taught how to build draw works which are huge winches that pull pipe out of the ground for oil rigs. Co-workers were great especially the team i worked with. The job was very hands on, lots of physical work which i didnt mind. Id say the hardest part was learning how to build each type of draw works because you might build 1 type for a week the another type for 8 month then the type you built for a week would be thrown back in so I would rely on the experienced workers to guide me through those times. I really enjoyed my team id say we were on of the best! Also when oil was up work was there, we did 12 days strait usually averaging 135 hours which was awesome and then we would get a weekend off. So 2 weekend off a month and plenty of work in between."
good,"Work at NOV is good, it's a place where you can learn a lot of different things welding, painting, assembly and a variety of manual and cnc machines"
good,"Prepares work to be accomplished by studying assembly instructions, blueprint specifications, and parts lists; gathering parts, subassemblies, tools, and materials."
good,24/7 on call. I learned a lot of skills working hand in hand with some great technicians. The management worked hard and was always there to hear any concerns you had. Good camaraderie amongst the technicians. The months being away from my family was the hardest part of the job it was like being on deployment in the military all over again. Working with my hands was the most enjoyable part of the job and meeting new people every time i went to a rig have not been to yet.
good,"Culture is good.  Management is good.  Direction is good."
good,"National Oil well Varco is a good place to work for, You have two 15 minute brakes and 1/2-1 hour for lunch. The people there are friendly and  great to work with."
good,"It's a good place to begin a career as an Engineer, but there are no clear career paths. Easy to get stuck in a position for many years."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new techniques to a particular job."
good,"Used to be a stable firm, but low oil prices shut that down. Very good management and employees.  Great bonuses at the time."
good,"National Oilwell Varco is a good place to begin your career in the oil and gas equipment industry. There are many levels of management and organization charts are difficult to figure out, but overall an average to decent place to work."
good,National Oilwell Varco is an extremely large company that grew quicker than its management.  It is currently in the stages of getting practices and work flows compatible with its company size.
good,"Business was dependent on sales people, and competition was fierce between companies.  Job required employees to be on call 24 hours a day, and most calls were in the evening and early morning hours."
good,I would start the day with reviewing emails and start working from that point. Management is good with the exception of a few.
good,"Processed payroll and settled escalated payroll issues, typical work day was fine. However, there is no set procedure to process anything. Information is relayed differently from one person to the next."
good,Good place to work although pay was not as good as I had hoped. When Oil prices dropped there was not enough work to go around.
good,"For the first few years it was great, loved working there. Then they replaced our manager with a new one and at first seemed really good until things started to go down hill. After new management took over I saw no room to grow any more with in the company. Time to move on."
good,"A National é um empresa gigante e mundialmente conhecida pela sua qualidade de produtos e serviços."
good,"Productive, good work environment, good people and safety oriented. When oil prices are good work is good. When oil drops work slows down."
good,"A empresa é muita dinâmica devido ao seu ramo de atuação."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company as a whole, but there was no room for advancement. The company did not pay as well as they should of considering the size of the company. The company did have good benefits."
good,There is no room for advancement if you are in certain jobs unless your manager leaves. Does not adapt and accept change.
good,good company to work for if you want a decent pay check you can really get your hands dirty. Typical day I set up the press machine and worked it for 12 hours a day 5 days a week. The lunch breaks were 1 hour a piece and the management had its good days and its bad days.
good,"It's an ok place to work. It could be a very cool job as its not hard at all and at times fun but management feels it's necessary to flex their muscles and be total dicks for no reason and talk to you and treat you like a child. Other than that it's a pretty good place. GREAT benefits. Pretty good pay. Kind of the typical oilfield job security type thing. Never know if you're just gonna get fired for no reason. Also doesn't seem like there is much opportunity for advancement. Kind of good ol boyish but not in the backwoods redneck sister banging kind of way. "
good,Great place to work. Decent people. Management is clouded with politics. One of those places you need to know someone to get things moving.
good,This company was very involved with the associates and maintained a great work/life balance.  They were receptive to employee feedback and were involved in employee development.
good,"Company makes a lot of money because of oil, but their management and departmentalization make it a very convoluted environment to work in."
good,"Please review Resume' sent, I am a Senior Designer by trade, Land Rig as well as Offshore. I have managed, Designed and have worked all phases of design and construction. At this phase of my career Design and working with younger designers would be enjoyable."
good,"Nice co-workers, busy days, day goes by fast.  You will never be bored at National Oilwell Varco. They will always make sure you have enough work on your desk to keep you busy for the next 200 centuries."
good,"Prestar suporte à expatriados, em sua iniciação no país, assistência prática em todos os aspectos de realocação."
good,"Local agradavel para trabalhar, pessoas tranquilas, bom relacionamento com todos."
good,"Temporary position, good start when trying to get into the oilfield."
good,"M/S Money Managers engaged in dealing with Share market, Investment, Mutual funds, Government Bonds & Insurance. Started career as an Accountant & learned many things with this firrm related to Stock Exchange."
good,"Typical day at work included clocking in, going to work station, setting up material to be welded, grinding, cutting. Management was on the low end in terms of communication, effectiveness, and commitment. Every coworker was a joy to work with. dedication and commitment to completing jobs were number one priority. Biggest let down of the job, The Company needed a weld test completed by myself, training was offered, training was given by coworker but was not completed due to Management informing my coworker of the production that needed to be completed. therefor training was halted and not completed. The weld test the company needed completed by myself was given and was not passed due to lack of training and time given to train by management. Management informed myself that there was plenty of time given to train , and plenty of opportunities given to complete the training. There was no such training given to myself due to management not allowing it. I communicated with other management about the training issue at hand and was informed that everything would be okay. No further training was given and the weld test needed by the Company was not performed. Most enjoyable part of work was the welding that needed to be performed."
good,"Fairly relaxed environment to work in, but when the jobs are hot be ready."
good,Good place to work. Very educational. Management is helpful.
good,"NOV is a great company, but the division that I am in is a revolving door at the management level. About 20 different managers have come and gone over the last 20 months. Outlook of the company is positive due to their size and capabilities, but there is not an employee-friendly culture at my location."
good,"Conhecimentos adquiridos na Tuboscope;"
good,Very high paced work environment with minimal supervision.
good,"Actually as an electrical engineer I did not got much benefits, but as an electrical engineer I could benefit my work a lot using my engineering skills."
good,"Great people to work with. People are very friendly."
good,I loved everything about this company from people to the work .
good,"buena empresa en control de sólidos, actualmente certificada ante la norma iso 9001 2008 de calidad, cursos, difusiones continuas."
good,"nice place to get your feet wet in the industry, but plan on going out to get better pay"
good,ok place to work but made a management change that I did not agree with
good,"very good place to work, very helpful employees.  safety is very important due to the large assemblies that had to be picked up by crane"
good,"Night shift management not so good ,re-pairing other co-workers jobs,the hardest part no suport in working in heavy fab. by co-workers or lead men."
good,Good work experience for me. I learned a lot. I had some great coworkers. The hardest part of the job was learning some of the engineering of the oilfield equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the creative freedom and design work I was able to do with the literature and illustrations I wrote and published.
good,"In the oilfield we start early in the morning and work in to the evenings. NOV gives you an opportunity to advance within the company quickly. I was promoted by the end of my first week. Management was great until our boss left for another job for more money. In the oilfield you have people from all different upbringings, with that being said everyone is usually pretty professional. The hardest part of the job is the rural location, the long hours, and the below average pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is the knowledge I have gained."
good,"long hours, a lot of employees, not a lot of room for advancement"
good,"It is a 12 hrs day, you do maintenance to the equipment because of weather conditions, freezing temperatures or extreme heat and you deal with water , mud ,chemicals,hoses,pumps and valves to acomplish your goal (Dewater)to reach the mud api,for drilling.In addition you manage your time ,chemicals, safety conditions in general plus comunicate whith the company man and co-workers any alteration of the mud and inform cost of chemicals used on the day. ( bill statement )"
good,High turnover rate due to failure to pay their top performers.
good,"work outside, in weather, management was good, co-workers are cool, the weather conditions, most enjoyable part of the day was when it was time to clock."
good,"Operações com roscas,secadora de cascalho,e centrifugas."
good,Typical day at work:
good,I have experience significant growth during my 5+ years with NOV and am very appreciative of this.  I am looking to further grow my skillsets as a finance professional.
good,"Friendly environment days and nights shifts, do your job management wont bother you. If you have family problems management won't give you trouble to take time off. Family comes first."
good,"It's an okay company to work for the money could be better ,but is not so bad either , I would recommend it to anyone ,but I'm not sure I would go back ."
good,NOV is a great large company to work for and the company can provide great training and opportunities for its employees. The company doesn't make its employee's career path and growth a priority.
good,Fast paced work enviroment. Learned to work with fiberglass materials in which lead to other work related fields. They have good equipment to keep clean air for working enviroment in which is a big thing in fiberglass industry.
good,"I worked at NOV in the past before I was laid off. During this time I never job searched management wasn’t great but it wasn’t bad. Example... I was on a site one day. My direct boss showed up with a driver didn’t say two words to me even though I did see him arrive & left. I understand being busy but seriously. He never returns calls. My past boss wasn’t always pleasant but he was forward & I always knew where I stood. "
good,"National Oilwell Varco is a ""Stepping Stone"" in the Oil & Gas Industry. This place is great for starters wanting to get their feet wet but the real money is paid in the offices and not out in the field. You can learn quite a bit here and if you make the right acquaintances then you're on your way if you impress or catch the eye of the right people here. The downside is the lack of pay for the real workers within their organization, you'll never become a millionaire working here."
good,"PLC programming Solving problems regarding the project"
good,"It is a good starting point for your career but if you are not part of the right workplace clique, it will be very difficult to move up or get raises. I felt like the salary was on the low side compared to others in the same industry but they did offer good benefits and possible end of year bonus."
good,"Great Company. There is a lot of scope to develop and the company provides support to the employees to develop. "
good,The working environment was not bad at all but the pay could have been better. At NOV their is no room for growth and advancement. I learn a lot from trial and error than hands on training. The best part of the day was breaks because I enjoyed the time spent with coworkers.
good,this is a good place to work but if your looking for good pay this is not the place for you if its job security then your in the right spot. plenty of hours. and some supervisors make you use your vacation days even when you don't need them just a heads up
good,"I started at National Oilwell Varco when i first graduated high school. It was a great starting place for some who was just ready to go to work. After 3 years there i have found out that the management there is a complete joke. Once my family got started times were getting hard and it took over 3 years to finally get a raise. Some good things about working at NOV is that they have awesome benefits including, Health insurance, Vision, Dental, 401K, and days off. I work a 14 days on and 14 days off rotational schedule. The hardest part of the job is that when you are offshore and the drilling rig is drilling out cement and you are going into cutting boxes and you have to shovel the box to level it out."
good,"NOV has recently moved all engineering departments from various mergers into one building.  Therefore, most people are sticking with their own groups and creating a very quiet atmosphere.  Hopefully, this will get better with time."
good,"Start my semi-truck, do a pre-trip inspection on the truck. Check my load and my paper invoice also with my oversized permits for the routes and drive to the places that the tanks needed to go. In Texas or in other surrounding States. Good management and good benefits.I really enjoy the work there."
good,NOV is the typical large oil company in Texas. Do you enjoy working in a cubicle for 10 hours per day? Then you should work here.  It was not really for me.
good,"The job is okay, but as of the schedule being changed an hour before the shift is over instead of letting staff know a week in advance. The work is easy to do."
good,Good work/life balance as an individual contributor. When in a management position the work/life balance was difficult to balance during the good times.
good,"The job is very fast paced, with a lot of work to do, and very long hours. The company pays well, with good benefits. The people were friendly."
good,On a typical day of work I assemble items either for stock or for orders that are going out that day. I've learned many things while working for NOV but I am willing to learn a lot more. Management is alright but the communication between managers and employees if really lacking. It is frustrating for me when I'm giving false communications or there are miscommunication. I feel that in order for employees and managers to work well together there needs to be  communication between employees and managers. If the managers are told one thing we employees are told another or the information doesn't get to us right away. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my co-workers.
good,"Target culture is a little hard to get use to, they do try to help you, but there production ratio for there case pickers is totally not up to par. i think they need an engineer to do a time study cause it is not right. there breaks are off too.in an 8hr day you get a 10min break and 20 min lunch and thats it."
good,"Great job as long as you do not cross a manager. Coworkers were great, and management was not willing to help out if you were not one of their favorites."
good,"NOV is great for entry level person new to industry, to learn about the tool's used to complete job in the oil and gas field. They are one of the biggest service companies in the business."
good,"NOV is a good company, but very reluctant to change and advance in technique or technology. They are grounded and locked into the methodology that has been used for decades, and management only knows those methods. The tried and true is the only option."
good,"12 hour rotating shift "
good,Design and maintain product line on the daily bases. Learned more of onshore drilling and their products.  The most enjoyable part of the job is designing prototypes and building it.
good,This is a job I will remember. I have learned a lot about how different divisions are all tied together.  This is all I would like to say.
good,"A good company which had challenging projects, but due to oil prices being reduced now getting less competitive. Good company but poor decision makers. Decent amount of politics. The most enjoyable part was working with my team. helped me to learn a lot in the go and more on how to be professional."
good,It was easy to work with those people coming in from other companies to work with us.  My coworkers were easy going and were easy to get along with.  Upper management was very transient so I would get a new boss with new ideas and methods which sometimes made it difficult but they would be flexible.
good,"The place is an old building. No elevator. Working culture is average. every few years, there will be a down turn and many employees will be laid off. Safety rules are getting worse. Steel toe boots and safety glasses are required even thought a person who is not working with heavy machine."
good,It was a typical large company to work for. They had really great benefits and the pay was decent. Not much else to say about this office
good,"I received excellent work experience while working at NOV.  I enjoyed working with the employees, as well as meeting different people coming into the office from different countries.  I was offered different opportunities to take on interesting projects from all different departments within the company which kept my job interesting and challenging.  All in all my job was enjoyable, although there were not very many opportunities for moving up withing the organization if I wished to do so."
good,"Typical day consists of hours of 8-5, You learn from others (training is pretty much non-existent) co-workers are OK. The hardest part of the job is actually receiving the proper training to do your job. Those who know everything seem afraid to train correctly due to being afraid they're going to lose their ""importance""."
good,"Ótimo grupo de trabalho, o aprendizado foi excelente, o grupo de trabalho muito bom, com pessoas discretas e dispostas a ajudar."
good,good place to work but oil&gas is not good at the moment and permanent hiring is freeze because oil & gas market is not good.
good,"NOV provided me the opportunity to learn many downhole tools, their use and servicing requirements. A typical day for my position (Service Quality) included supporting each location service quality representative, and their understanding of the quality management system. I provided direction for continuous improvement, including looking for KPI's, non-conformances on the shop floor and implementation of Lean practices. All of the people in the organization are positive individuals and are willing to improve. One of my biggest challenges was changing the culture to a quality oriented outlook. This included helping all shop hands understand how their actions affect tool performance and resulting customer perception. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing individuals become convinced and practice good habits relating to the quality management system."
good,"As long as you show up on time and do your job, you will stay employed as long as you want. If you're looking for advancement, you will have to stay awhile. It's not a bad place to work"
good,"Large, impersonal, Good benefits and salary, job security. sometimes lose sight of ultimate goals of customer service"
good,"National Oilwell Varco is a big company, where shops vary depending on location, at least that's what id like to believe. the location where I was working had a difficult rotating schedule where it was only 36hrs one week and 48hrs the next, add that to the repetitive routine and it boils down to a disproportionate balance between the company and the employees"
good,The hardest part for me even though i wouldn't really class it as hard is the sheer volume of work that has to be processed on a daily basis. Even though everything does get done it can get really tiring and you become very drained.
good,You work 12 hours on 12hours off for two weeks. You drive home on your day off and go back on your day off thats how you get five total days off. great health care and 401k dental.
good,"Buena administración, agradecido por la oportunidad de trabajo con la empresa."
good,"This job is pretty layback, but management needs to improve and be equal with everybody. Two face Management and also favorable."
good,"My typical day to day activities include managing my staff of 12 employees, monitoring productivity of incoming items from suppliers, doing quality audits, over seeing all first article inspection reports, training staff to follow NOV QA procedures. Also taking care of our gauge calibration system globally using CribMaster and JDE. Generating JDE reports for managers. Have taken a few performance management courses within NOV.  Due to the fact that we are constantly dealing with different drill products from manufacturing to turn key products and being able to overcome all these challenges on a daily basis makes it much more interesting in my line of work."
good,"Is a freindly place, the day goes fast working with others, i was working as labour to became a journeyman welder with help of my company maneger and others.working with nice co worker always is fun and i deal with non happy worker but when i see what i build! i really enjoy my job ..."
good,* VERY Busy
good,"Every day I came to work I learn a lot of things like a new procedures, machinery, languages system and etc .because I'm working with different Nationality"
good,Was the best employee there had spinal cord surgery and had to go on disability.  After coming back from disability I was let go no real explanation was given.
good,Most positions have very little space for growth unless you have a four year degree. Some certifications will help with advancement. You will need to be patient.
good,"Check in inventory, pull parts for floor. Keep inventory stocked and avabble. Shipped over stock to other locations."
good,My biggest knock on NOV is that they are not very competitive with their pay and there does not seem to be any room to advance within the company as each branch is separated so much from each other that they are almost treated as separate companies
good,"I don't have too much remembered about NOV. Nice co workers, employees seem very happy and very loyal. the company is kind of generous for the hourly employees."
good,"NOV is a decent place to work with low salary, but potentially high bonuses. The biggest problem with NOV is a lack of procedure in place to advance/promote employees. There is no set raise per year (for inflation) and no competencies/markers to hit in order to be promoted/get a raise. Therefore, the employee must take it into their own hands to obtain a promotion and this is usually dragged out for sometime."
good,"Es una buena empresa en general, ofrece estabilidad laboral y hay un buen clima laboral. Ofrecen entrenamiento hasta nivel intermedio, pero poco a nivel avanzado. La gerencia no se preocupa mucho por el desarrollo de personal, de modo que la parte más difícil del trabajo es el desarrollo de carrera. No existe una evaluación objetiva del empleado."
good,"I was good and fun to work when I was still in the Mission department. We often had free lunch and learn, my supervisor always helped and passed over his experience and knowledge to the team. But when the company changed the new management and I got moved to different department, the new manager was kind of discrimination to the minority, specially when the Oil and Gas industry was in the downturn."
good,"i got laid off . lost almost every thing..........................................................................................................................went gas prices drop , there is in work for the men on the shop floor there for managemnt decides who has to go , that is the had reality about manufacturing , , it is a very hard life , it an individul, can figure out how not to get fired or laid off it can be a prospress blessing"
good,"Although the environment was stressful due to the need of some individuals to feel powerful, I enjoyed working with the floor personnel.  We had a strong commitment to a safe work environment throughout the floor.  I was trusted and respected."
good,"Good environment but lacks a true identity.  Advancement isn't based on job knowledge or education.  More predicated on ""who you know"".  Compared to other service providers, the pay is on the lower end of the spectrum.  Offer good benefits compared to other employers.  There was a sense of job security, even during the downturn.  Lacks career advancement in my area of expertise."
good,"I started as a helper at Petrex, they merged with NOV. I learned to read blueprints and how to fit and weld here. Had great hours, over time was there the whole time I worked"
good,"Like in all companies it’s who you know that moves you up the ladder of success and not what you know or done for a better bottom line."
good,"Laid back place to work, always meeting new people on deliveries. The people were easy to get along with, You would be driving most the day and in the warehouse the other half"
good,"Company was working in Oil& Gas industry,"
good,"Daily tasks would be production of drawings for manufacturing."
good,"Good Company to be employed by, many opportunities to move in the right direction with the company. "
good,"Positives: high management with open doors and learning environment, exposed to multi-cultural and friendly people. Work times respected. "
good,"I have been with National Oilwell Varco for a year and a half. I had the opportunity to start with the company as an Executive Assistants to one of the Vice President's in Rig Solution Products. During that position, I focused on expense reports, routing sales emails to the correct departments, coordinating conference rooms/luncheons for business meetings as well as booking travel for my direct report as well as 5 other managers. I thoroughly enjoyed this position because I felt as though I was exposed to the materials needed to follow my dream career in sales or business development. The most difficult part of this job was piecing together information for events. Though this seemed like a challenge, it actually taught me how to work with the materials you have. "
good,"Demanding, but relaxed work environment. Management is lenient, and employees can decide how to spend their day, for the most part."
good,"A typical work day at NOV was busy, busy busy.  Too many accounts assigned to the CA portfolio, over 1000. Great great benefits. The hardest part about the job was not being able to contact every account assigned to your portfolio."
good,"Started most days meeting with customers in their office. Drive to our location to fill orders and deliver that afternoon when needed."
good,"My day starts with a safety tool box talk among our cell team, followed by distribution of work load, then acquire all PPE and tooling for the job and begin the task following blueprints or troubleshooting diagrams breaks are two ten minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch with a ten minute grace period normally work OT sometime six days a week."
good,"Good company, great place to work. I was laid off due to market conditions. Not much diversity in the upper level management so you will need a plug in to advance."
good,"I was a contract employee so I didn't have company benefits. Thanks to contracting with National Oilwell Varco I was able to get my foot in the door to Human Resources, they gave me the opportunity to be more than just a file clerk."
good,"Gained skills in the general fitting including inspection & report writing, also used various CAD skills"
good,"I loved it until they closed up shop and moved the jobs to Houston, "
good,"The company is world wide, there was alot of opprotunities to learn different areas of the business and advanements. Although the benefits are great the pay was mediocre. There is more job stability."
good,"Procurement Dept. employees have full purchasing power and autonomy on their decisions. "
good,"The company very challenging multi task, had opportunity  to learn about oil  & gas drilling operating big rigs for drilling oil and gas, and the danger of it as well but fun and good company to have and work for 5yrs."
good,most enjoyable job I have ever had I experienced a lot and even had my own office. but the pay itself was not that great and the hours even worse
good,Good people to work with. Make rigs and parts for the wrong country. I think you should sell at 3 or more countries is more of a safe zone. Than just one. That country backs out and you get laid off like me.I worked here 6 months and a lot of others the same day.They say it is the gas prices. But it is much deeper than. But hope the best NOV. I have friend that was laid off 4 times and called back for less money each time. The last he went into truck driving. No more lay offs. Jest a penny in your ear. Hope the best for all.
good,"(1) The ability to bring a great amount of technical experience to NOV and train others with state of the art machinery."
good,Very stable company.   Almost no risk of loosing your job.  Development tends to be very slow for new product design.  This slow development process has merit due to the tremendous risk associated with a rig down or rig safety environment.
good,"I was the only clerical personnel in this office. I would check on jobs that had come in or were going out.   Inventory equipment that had come in.  Invoice customers, scan invoice and e mail to the Lafayette office, answer 4 line phones. Payroll was done on a weekly basis.  Check with company man  for use of rental equipment out on their rigs.  I was responsible for getting everything ready for cooks we did for charities and rig locations. I had a great working relationship with my boss and with the 12 men I worked with.  It was a very relaxed atmosphere. The hardest part was leaving this job and saying my good byes to people I had worked with for 20 years. "
good,"You can not base a review on National Oilwell Varco based on one location, due to the fact that there are several different locations.  My experience is only based on the one location I came from.  12 hour nights with a monthly schedule of your work days predated.  Two shifts from 6 to 6."
good,You career advancement is dictated by your manager just like any company.
good,"If you do your job they leave you alone. Extended holiday time off, company party and gives away great gifts. They cater multiple times a year for everyone. Trained me on how to weld."
good,I loved it here great work environment a lot of overtime Fair managers and supervisors always had work steady Pace not a lot of hard work not a lot of heavy lifting forklift and overhead crane experience is a plus
good,My job had its advantages and disadvantages. The opportunity for advancement in my field was very high. The travel and on call 24/7 was the on aspect that begin to get to me.
good,"Admin clerk, filing, invoicing for shipping and recieving, type reports, portals , front desk answer phones ,close reports, research, help others, any other duties as assigned"
good,"Pros "
good,"NOV is a huge corporation that needs to re work some of the smaller local locations. Managers are lackluster with no trust in employees. Managers also have no care for outside individuals and only care for themselves. You have to be in the ""cool group"" to get anywhere. Pay was good, benefits were good but slowly increasing in price."
good,"I only left because of my meager hourly rate.  I feel I should have recieved a raise when I asked for one. My manager ,who no longer works there was great."
good,Management allowed freedom of exploring various business ventures. Flexible time schedule allowed for family obligations. Ability to contribute at the plant level or at the corporate level.
good,"Great exposure to oilfield; rough market and conditions currently.  Currently we are selling products that are not yet designed in an effort to accrue more chargeable work, however this creates a dynamic environment with unattainable deadlines and high levels of stress."
good,"Do your work and everything else falls into place. Be on time, keep your head down, show up for work, and work hard! If you dont know something or if youre not sure, ask!"
good,A horrible case of mismanagement and putting the wrong people in the wrong places after 10 years it has really taken a 180 it has turned into a miserable workplace and morale is at an all time low
good,"NOV was a good place to work until the decline of the Oil Industry during the beginning of 2015. "
good,This was a fun place to work. All of my co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. The management was fair and they were always available and easy to talk to.
good,"agradable lugar para aprender y trabajar, con equipos de trabajo fácilmente adaptable, debido al tipo de negocio, uno aprende de materiales y procesos petroleros de una manera didáctica. excelente sistema de ventas, administración de materiales avanzado."
good,"Aprendí a desarrollarme en puestos administrativos"
good,NOV is a good company for young professionals who seeks decent life style with unstressed work environment. Not high salaries for oil and gas and work environment is okay.
good,"Ambiente favorável no trabalho, pessoas comprometidas com o desenvolvimento da empresa, todos trabalham em equipe. "
good,"This is a great company to start out with as it allows you to explore different fields within a large and diverse company. The people you work with are very nice and helpful. You must show initiative and work with other departments to get things done. The hardest part of the job was working with people who aren't familiar with marketing and its benefits. The most enjoyable part was working with various people, at all levels, including executive leadership."
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits, good balance of work/ life balance, there is a lot of great opportunities to learn with a lot of training's, but the company is terrible about giving raises."
good,"Job place is clean and HSE environment is positive. Equipment is well maintained and ever evolving. Depth of employee years on site is long. Opportunity to travel is always a possibility. Added learning, ie: joined an engineering team in writing product documentation, and providing feedback on new auto driller."
good,"(Only based Mud Pump assembler employee point of view not as company as a whole)"
good,"National Oilwell Varco probably has the lowest paid Millwrights in all of edmonton.  The journeyman rate is well below industry standards."
good,Have enjoyed my 15 plus years with the company but feel a need to move on and work more towards the payroll side. My co-workers are very nice and I get along with just about anyone.
good,"This is a very fast paced place to work,It was great all the guys were very motivating and respectfull"
good,I was contracted from another company to help NOV. Co-workers were amazing but a lot of the leadership was not to par nor listened to the guys on the floor working. Other than that it was a good job and place to work.
good,"Average Place to work, it is stressful and face paced but the benefits were great until a few years ago, now just average benefits and average pay maybe low end pay for oilfield."
good,"The work culture at NOV is great, when the industry was booming NOV allowed for employees to expand their knowledge by taking different training courses. They encouraged their employees to learn and advance, but since the industry downturn anything, but mandatory training has been taken away.  "
good,"good people around you to make the day go buy faster, you stay busy if you want managers leave you free with your task aren't constanly checking up on you or breathing on your neck."
good,"started in inside sales and was able to advance to outside sales then promoted to production sales manager after 1 1/2 years on the job"
good,"NOV is a great company, with solid benefits, advancements, and a stable team environment. The only downside, as a field service technician, you can be expected to work 70-100 hours per week. EVERY WEEK. NOV expects you to put the company first before anything else."
good,"typical day at work:dirty"
good,Create manufacturing drawing from engineering documents. Procure components and material from vendors for buyers. Update and maintain documents to latest revision.
good,"So far working for the company is good on our department side keeping our injuries to a minimmum, but other than that is not good."
good,Lots of overtime and great benefits 12 hours a day work co-workers very friendly and shop is A/C.
good,"Great people to work with, good benefit for families and a good place to build your career. Will work there again if I have th opportunity to. Good team members"
good,"Great company to work for if they would not have moved their operations across and out of country. Organized with great management meetings. Upper management listened to all ideas which made production and progress requirements attainable. Everyone got along even with the long hours sometimes required. Benefits and health insurance is top rated.Important resources at hand, if you needed it they had it. Being a part of upper management meetings helped me to see the big picture of our industry with pre-planning and implementation according to completion requirements. The hardest part of the job was finding qualified personnel that did not need constant supervision. Seems that the construction industry is losing it's work force to the higher waged petro/chemical industry which is paying up to 10$ more an hour compared to the oilfield construction industry. What is happening here is young workers are coming into the oilfield construction trade, learning the trade then quitting to work for more money in the chemical plants. I have been in the construction business since 1975, and it has treated me well. Started at the bottom like everyone else, learned to fit pipe/structural, weld. Moved into supervision in 1992, Construction Manager/ Inspector and Quality Control."
good,"Good, i have been able to develop my skills."
good,"Fast past. Pay could have been better. Nevertheless, you do learn valuable information on shipping and receiving that can be used anywhere."
good,"fabricate draw works and top drives for the oil field, elevated gear boxes"
good,"Excellent company to work. NOV give us a opportunity to growing as a professional with total support  and the manager is always there to support us with everything we need. The work atmosphere is very comfortable, we are able to develop our job showing the best of us. The hardest part of the job is when you want to achieve your goal, and sometime it doesn't happen at the moment that we want, but when the achievement comes true , it is the best feeling because the management recognize your effort to achieve it."
good,National Oilwell Varco is an excellent company to work for that specialize in production mobile oil rigs and outsourcing material in the us and worldwide to its many vendors.
good,"I worked at NOV for 23 years. I started working in the shop and worked up to management. There was alot of travel during my time there. Holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries were all missed. There were some perks to working there."
good,Management is disfunctional and they have no skill or leadership aptitude.  The work it’s self is fun and interesting but managements refusal to be forward thinking causes more problems than it has to.
good,"Once upon a time, this was an amazing company to work for, but with all of the changes in management the company has lost focus of what made them successful in the first place. People have become expendable and during times of oil price slumps the treatment of employees is terrible."
good,Work place has good people but like any other oilfield job it requires long hours and can be stressful. District Manager slipped through the cracks to get where he is and plays favorites with technicians.
good,"p/u,m/u core tools rih and take core sample pooh l/d core and coreing tools complete logs and invoice"
good,"Work 12 hours everyday, plenty of work, poor management."
good,"great company as a sales organization driven, not a good environment for engineering in some of the company's divisions, some divisions rarely promote training and career development programs for employees, although the management is great. work place culture is great."
good,"Managing deadlines and many tasks at same time while goals could  change daily. project focus was continually changing. Our team was continually learning and meeting new people. The ability to influence change with in the company and train new incoming team members was a plus. The role was very difficult, knowing that we were able to help customers in real and effective ways made it rewarding."
good,"The people I work with are great. Sometimes there is not enough work to fill out my day and it is no longer challenging for me. I have been a part time temp for over a year now and they still will not hire me. That means I get no benefits, overtime, vacation, sick pay, and ect."
good,"The company worked like a family until they were bought out by larger companies, the last one being National Oilwell head quartered in Houston, Texas.I learned lots of varied technical information, New Programs, and all about deep water Oil Drilling equipment. I liked working with the shop people. There are problems with management as they are often promoted to manager without training."
good,"A typical day was clocking in, answering emails, Working up expenses for techs and invoicing for the jobs. The end of month was always a crunch time when we billed the most jobs. They offered overtime to complete all billing."
good,Its nice working here with nice management & great colleagues.  Very co-operative management & appreciate hard working employees. Give proper training also for any required jobs.
good,Company has potential to keep growing. Some managers need some improvement. Great freedom but too much work sometimes. No great balance. Pay is reasonable.
good,"Monday thru Thursday morning entering the invoices to be paid on Thursday check run.  Due to increase from layoffs worked nights to make sure all invoices were entered.  Thursday did the check run with printing the checks, getting them signed to stuffing in checks and taking to the post office. Fridays were clean up and catching up on emails, answering vendors questions, reports."
good,"Meetings, meetings, meetings.  No time to get work done.  Often times the meetings would not stick to the agenda, running off in many different directions."
good,The past 2 years has been hard to enjoy work due to the down turn in the oil market.  I currently manage a tam of 40 employee's trying to maintain and grow market share in the international market
good,Lack experience in management positions; causing a less competitive edge in regards to R&D and other oil and gas service/rental companies. Overall it is an average place to work when discussing job satisfaction.
good,The oil industry in general has its crazy ups and down but the down side to this company is that when the going gets tough it doesnt matter how long you have been here or how hard you have worked no one is safe.
good,"NOV is a well trained, origanized company. 10hr days order pulling and packing of materials was fun"
good,A good challenging and fast paced place to work with different tasks to do each day and a large squad working together on large projects which was rewarding to see completed at the end.
good,"Working with NOV is really very great and you get to meet different nationalities, but there is not much increment in your salary as compared to the market value. Get less opportunity to grow in one department."
good,"I loved this job due to the OT and it looks great on my resume."
good,"I had set tasks to do every work day, consisting of checking warehouses. Making sure certain doors were locked and patroling the surrounding areas. Also ran the main two gate entrances, Making sure only workers with a badge of National Oil Well Verco could come in."
good,if you like working 80 to 96 hours a week with only 4 to 6 days off a month this is the job for you. if you enjoy spending time with your family then its not. like a said 16 hour days for a 11 and 3 schedule
good,National  oilwell various is a great place to work.  With  the way oil dropped  over the  last couple years layoffs  were unavoidable.  Good people with a okay management.
good,"A lot of Politics in high management level. When the market is down,  terrible decisions will be made by those people. And most of time those people have no idea what's going down to the floor."
good,NOV is a great company to work for when the price of oil is in the 75 - $80 range. I would work for NOV again if the opportunity was to come around again... Great Ride for the pass 11.5 years of service
good,good place to get your feet wet and learn a lot but this is a huge company and it is very hard to move around and move up. You have to be willing to play the politics game to move up.
good,Company was good to work for had the chance to work overseas in Kuwait. I was able to work in two different departments and grow. Down side was company went under and closed down.
good,"When the oil business is booming National Oilwell is a great place to work for. when I first started they had really good benefits, Employee appreciation Dinners, Safety awards, Incentives, and they would pay for your safety glasses, work boots, and offer free CPR/First Aide res-ponder classes. Now with the price of oil so low, we are lucky to have jobs. Tensions are high, we've had a first wave of layoffs, and even had whole divisions shut down. Overall I Learned a lot with this company, if I had any complaint if would be with the plant that I worked in and the lack of management."
good,"The time here was a wonderful experience, most of the people are willing to not only teach but are also willing to learn from you. The Engineering staff I would consider the best in any industry.  All of the engineers were willing to listen to suggestions and were willing to try new or different ideas."
good,"national oilwell Varco is a good place for a young person looking for experience, but has no allowance for advancement, I worked 14 years in the fab shop as a welder,i wanted to advance but couldn't because once they found out I was good at what I did that's where I stayed.i worked next to men that had 25-40years in the same place same positions.people in lead positions were the flunkies of the company because they didn't have skills to make the company money."
good,"National Oilwell Varco is a great company to work for with a fairly good work enviornment.  Most people I work with want to be there and want to contribute to overall success of the company.  The benefits are great, with rrsp matching and dental, vision and medical up to 80% with a 600 dollar year health spending account.  However, since my time here (3 years), management has changed three times.  They dont seem to be advancing the right people for the right positions.  "
good,"The actual work is great. Lots to learn, and you stay busy most of the time. But then there are times when there isn't anything to do, but the all-seeing cameras are still watching. And if you're caught not doing work, even when there IS NO work, you're still threatened with being written up. "
good,"Responsibilities Handled"
good, Good company to work for if your single and without a family. When you work for NOV then NOV is your life.
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and non-stop.
good,My objective is to learn and attain as much knowledge as I can on all points of the job. If the job is too hard I will seek help and learn the steps I need in order to succeed.
good,Minimum 40hrs a week no matter what. Low hourly rates. I did not get my first raise until about 4 years into my role. No room for advancement as no body ever moves up.
good,"This was a tough job that required a lot of physical labor. If that doesn't deter you, then you will greatly appreciate the compensation, even if you have to work over-time."
good,"Urgencias diarias, cambio de giros en los servicios."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at NOV. When the industry was in full swing, my position allowed me to take care of my customers with the company's interests in mind. it was a a great learning experience. i cannot think badly of the company, even after i was laid off. I miss it, the work, and the people, both internal and external."
good,"I worked for NOV for 22 years and they closed the branch that I worked in,.  That is the only reason for leaving. I had worked with about 5 of the individuals for at least 18 years.  We worked well together.  We built a good friend relationship,.  When they did the reduction in force 35 people were released."
good,"Providing analysis for customers and communicating with operations to ensure engineering solutions are utilized in a timely manner. I have learned a great deal about production engineering and design optimization. I have learned a lot about NOV Tuboscope's product lines and how they can benefit our customers. Management within Tuboscope is strong. Most have a good vision for improving the company. Most are also close to retirement and adequate replacements could be getting better training. Workplace culture is good on a personal level and great people. However, there are many that are happy with the status quo. Little is being done to motivate employees to do more and change the culture to retain the best employees. The hardest part of the job is being on call 24/7 for our customers and struggling to find a quality work/life balance because of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving customers problems and seeing the solutions succeed. It also is enjoyable to work with the vast majority of the coworkers."
good,Good place to work.  They don't have enough people to get the job done. The management could be a little inexperience.  They didn't have enough knowledge to help with problems.
good,It is very competitive atmosphere where an individual is not successful or will not advance if they do not acquire compounding Job responsibilities & requirements !
good,NOV is a training centre and there is no restrictions.Management is not supporting the bottom line employees. Senior positions are filled by relatives and close friends .there is no scope for a career growth those who doesn't have a god father.
good,Robotic Arc5 welding does not require much physical labor. NOV even paid for my CWI courses and allowed me to explore the job market without re-payment.
good,"It was a great place to work. Lots of potential until they shut down the facility. Other than that, there was lots of room to advance and learn different machining operations."
good,"I was hired on before the down-turn in oil, I have since been transfered throughtout many divisions. When i left, I was in a very bad place, with an even worse manager. There is nowhere to go within my group because the manager is paranoid that everyone is out to get his job so he constantly nit picks employees and writes them up for such minor offenses. "
good,"excellent teamwork"
good,"This has been a good place to work for the last seven years but a downturn in business has seen many changes, my colleagues and managers here are fair and treat all staff well."
good,"You will learn at most 2nd year millwright experience, but its a good place to start out."
good,"Throughout my apprenticeship it has been a good place to work although with the downturn in oil happening it means there is now no job security. "
good,A typical day at this job consisted of checking on how many completed units there were and then washing and steaming the units that went out first.
good,"The people are the best part of the company, very friendly and willing to teach. The downside is that the kind of work isn't very challenging for a second year apprentice"
good,"Oil related, 12 hours everyday,or they don't need you at all. Learned several new things here. The company has older employees that will teach you new things.The hardest part about the job was being away from home and family for long periods of time."
good,"Enjoyed job but did not like location in the Texas panhandle."
good,"I called on Oil & Gas Company drilling engineers.  The best part of the job was finding an engineer that will communicate and work with you to find a solution.  The most challenging part was overcoming the perception that the company products were somehow inferior to competitors.  Management or field personnel could help or hurt you on a given project if it was or was not as high a priority to them as your customer deemed it needed to be.  This criticism could be said for any service company.  Given the challenges of a fast paced 24/7 industry, service to the customer was satisfactory over 95% of the time."
good,work day is 24/7 on call. Has a wide variety on things to learn. Good company but it is hard to move to a location you want to work at. You have to be willing to go where they want you to go.
good,"empresa dinâmica, porém está em um mercado muito competitivo, onde apenas as melhores conseguem firmar o seu espaço, e no entanto precisa melhorar no quesito motivacional em relação aos colaboradores."
good,"A typical day at work when I first started a NOV was full of work from the time you stepped in the door til the time you clocked out. I went into the company as a temp to hire with no experience whatsoever, but learned quickly."
good,"Troubleshooting electrical and mechanical components, balancing, aligning brakes on whinch system for retrieval if drill bits, reading blueprints and electrical/hydraulic schematics, the typical work day consist of 12/hr shifts Monday through Saturday, in extreme weater conditions."
good,"In the oil and gas industry, projects may come and go. There are times that we are so busy and need to work 12 hours Monday to Friday and 8 hours on Saturday to catch up the deadlines. There are times that we have nothing except to do yard clean up and organize raw materials.  It feels bad to see co workers gone (laid-off) because of the situation, like no projects. When this happen i always ask myself why do they have to let the workers to work hard for a few months or years for them to be out of work when they're done. Something is not right. I've been in this company for more than 7 years and the trend of the production are always the same, up and down. We are lucky if the projects could last for 2 years before it slows down again. In spite of all these, i did enjoy working with them. Its fun most of the time. I was laid off twice and come back to work  because of the challenges ahead. I love to learn new stuff  this is where i enjoy experiencing them. When they give me this new challenge to Lead one section of the production line, at first i got scared knowing that i have to deal with the management and group's expectation. But i passed the challenges, i survived and still on my position as the Lead person. I'm glad that i have work with people that understands me and the way i lead and make decisions. Since then everything went well and production did goes high and surpass the management expectations and in return they are happy for us. I just hope that i wont be laid-off again since we are currently under no projects / slow down time. My group including me are now temporarily"
good,"I had to get all welders perameters to make sure they was with in the range or wps,Lots of problem solving keeping a log on all welders. Read blue prints,work with upper mangers and engernieers and other QC. Sign off on fittings and final work to assure customs was getting the best quality. The hardest part of the job was getting ebody started and log work keeping up with work orders,the best part of the job was not making a mistake."
good,acredito que no pouco espaço de tempo que fiz parte do quadro de funcionários da empresa a convivência foi pacifica e produtiva. concluindo assim que se trata de uma grande empresa.
good,Excited to arrive everyday. Atmosphere was pleasant and the people were friendly and professional. Amazing to interact with internal and external employees. Holidays were all good.
good,"Organized chaos that seemed to work well.  6am start, then you work until you require help, get help and continue.  Not too stressful as long as you try and get your task completed."
good,National Oilwell Varco provided me the freedom to explore design ideas to present as possible solutions.  Ideas were not dismissed until the proper pro's and con's were discussed.
good,"Great place to work and to develop your skills. Good management, great positive culture. I'd happily go back and work there again. OT is available, good rrsp plan"
good,"at NOV there is plenty of work and overtime opportunities, but the promotions to new job titles never came with a raise or increment pay."
good,"Good learning environment, with a lot of moving parts. Never a dull moment. It is a very diverse environment only second to my experience in the military."
good,I had great time working there at nov one of the west experience working for oil fiel industry.the only reason I leave from nov was went oil industrialist went down for few years and oil fiel work got really slow
good,NOV was an interesting place. The Saint Paul office kind of felt like it was the step child of the company.  There was a distribution warehouse located there for some reason. There was a great deal of collaboration when it came to problem solving.
good,"Good training ground,Job stability, Multicultural"
good,"NOV provides a good working environment with training and personnel development. It complies to health, safety and environment policy. It has a better benefit for its employees and provide opportunities to work around the globe. Recreational activities in Halliburton is poor and there is no room for table tennis, swimming pool, football field."
good,"Overall, my time with NOV was positive, however, that was before my current company spun-off. From what I recall, more focus was put on following process and working towards plans. Good company with good org structure."
good,"Empresa com estrutura de 1ª mundo, ambiente agradável, porém de difícil crescimento, pois não possui plano de carreira."
good,It was good working there.A lot of overtime.  Good benefits.I would go back to work there again.  Meet a lot of good people.  The managers was good. They also work with you if you were in school.
good,Nov is a good and stable company to work for. My business unit just recently became a bit more enjoyable due to management change and re-structure. There is plenty of work here and that is very enjoyable to me.
good,"Management was difficult to understand"
good,"O dia a dia é muito gostoso, já que estou aqui praticamente desde quando tudo começou na NOV Flexibles, conheço muita gente, e é muito gratificante ser reconhecido pelos colegas de trabalho e supervisores, seja como pessoa ou como profissional, aprendi muita coisa aqui na empresa, enriqueci muito profissionalmente."
good,"The hours are long but the benefits are phenomenal.  The oil and gas industry, much like it's product, is volatile.  Your hours depend on the market and if crude prices go down so do the hours."
good,"Daily work is very demanding."
good,Great place to work. Learned some new things. Benefits are decent and the work/life balance is good here. Could always use a few more vacation days though.
good,"I started in the warehouse as a material handler. I would check parts that came in to make sure they were not damaged, counted, put the part numbers and quantities in the system, and place in location in warehouse. I would also pick orders for the assembly department which included different parts that varied is sizes. I learned a lot about the quality of the parts their junctions, how important it is to handle them correctly."
good,"Easy place to work. Learning and growing is simple, and fast paced. Friendly management, good benefits, and work/home life was well balanced. Would have stayed but the other job opportunity was too happy at the time."
good,It is a really nice company but the oil prices are downsizing their capabilities
good,I was tasked with the maintenance of the facility and given wide ranging authority to ensure steady daily activity in a oil rig manufacturing facility
good,"responsible for many aspects, given full support and guidance, always a good place to work tons of growth potential and the scenery changed a lot for me"
good,"Good reception on my first day at work , gained a lot of experience , management was good , good working culture , hooking up the string to the customers unit is the hardest part of the job , controlling and rolling the string to reel is using remote control is most enjoyable ."
good,Treated me well the vast majority of the time I was there. Paid for all of my qualifications throughout my apprenticeship and helped me to progress. Unfortunately I wished to progress even further by doing a degree and they could not guarantee me the time off I needed so had to part ways.
good,"No organization from management. "
good,"Very political, lots of buddy, buddy incestuous hiring practice. Qualifications are sometimes suspicious as well. Overall company portrays a positive image."
good,"if you dont have anything going on in your life and you need a job immediately, then i do recommend working here. Depending what your position is you will work up to 72 hours a week. Paycheck is good, but you sacrifice half your life."
good,I was nailed to a desk. I did not like the impersonal atmosphere. The company was too big and they were growing everyday. We got new office buildings and furniture instead of getting raises.
good,"The are very productive, very fast. Taking good care all their staff, good benifit. A good management skill, have a competent workers and they are very realiable in all aspect."
good,I enjoyed the job. I got laid off but I would go back if it'd be offered. They gave me a $1000 when they let me go. There would've been chance to advance.
good,Fun workplace for new hired and excellent for gaining experience in oil field industry especially for rig-up or college tech students who were still in training
good,empresa boa de trabalhar.empresa que preza pelo bom relacionamento entre os colaboradores.
good,The layoff procedure was done poorly but my immediate VP of manufacturing was the best one could ask to have. Plenty of notice for overtime and supplies readily available upon request.
good,"basically just stood in front of my machine everyday following blueprints to thread piping"
good,"every Monday morning we had a safety meeting, always had to work outdoors, they provided tool and really good source of bottles of water. Management was good for the past 9 years until the President of the site retired new Management came in and everything went downhill, they really don't have the knowledge of the work we were doing nor the knowledge of the Oil Rig. The hardest part about the job was knowing new comers were making a lot more money than me. ."
good,"I did not have the chance to experience everything I wanted to with this company due to a layoff that cut me short. I moved to this company because of the layoff with Schlumberger. NOV I could tell was going to be a great company to re-start my career with. I fit right in with all the other employers and took on a lot of responsibility  very quickly. All in all, I am very grateful for my time with NOV."
good,This was a great job until the price of oil fell.  My management levels were all very compentent and easy to speak with.  The facilities and equipment were either new or in good working order.
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay is a little less than others. The company has enormous integration problems. Lack of advancement and lots of layoffs due to oil and gas
good,"Good workplace if you're in the right department. Some of the supervisors in particular departments weren't qualified for the positions the held. Simply had them due to tenure. "
good,I found the salaries were slightly lower than similar companies but the work-life balance was outstanding. I had a flexible schedule as long as 40 hours were put in each week.
good,An employer that is committed to providing a safe environment to work.  Management focuses on employee development and creates a learning atmosphere.  The best thing about the job is the people.
good,"Culture continues to decline. It gains growth through acquisition more so than engineering services or product supplier. "
good,"Mulighet for utfordrende oppgaver; har fått mange muligheter som har gitt ulike stillinger over tid."
good,"Hours on a typical day could range every day was different. I learned a great deal over my 8 years of working at this company. A few would be Maintenance, shipping and receiving, warehouse, stock room, and many more. Management was closely knitted and kept to their kind really no room to move up at all. my Dad has been working in the same position for 20 years. They people work beside you are great people. Hardest thing about this job was the pay and the benefits are lacking. Most enjoyable was the people."
good,"I learned a great deal working at NOV Completion Fluids."
good,"Safety comes first always make your day, by working and the day will pass by fast. Hard work was an all day thing. Success was a goal at the end of the day."
good,It is a ok workplace but very bad at organising jobs. Bosses are not at good management standard and can be blamed for jobs which can be not your fault entirely e.g. incorrect tooling provided ect.
good,I really enjoyed working there. if the oilfield would not have slowed down and wouldn't have gotten laid off I would probably still be working there. enjoyed the people and manager.
good,Pay is on the lower end of the scale but the work is interesting and management doesn't rush you too much.  You have the opportunity to travel after you learn the product line and prove you're competent.
good,"Most days are and products are pretty consistent. I learned a lot about welding here, with a variety of metals and alloys. There is a lot of managers walking around. The co workers take pride in there work. The hardest part of the job is with standing the heat. Most enjoyable part of this job is how safety is paramount."
good,"Successfully planned, coordinated and managed all phases of multi-million dollar projects while ensuring reliability, quality and delivery. Closely collaborated both with customers’ and corporations’ senior managements, project managers and functional managers to plan and develop multi-dimensional business. Achieved multi-million dollar sales targets through successfully planning, implementation and analysis of business strategies. Established and administered Business Development Analysis Databases of Russia, CIS and Turkey region.

good,"Varies depending on location."
good,I started out as a field hand in 1993 working in south Texas. I worked my way up into management to become the Operations Manager for the Permian Basin / New Mexico area.
good,Working for NOV helped me apply my engineering skills on an everyday basis. The momentum program is extraordinary educational and great experience. One of the best companies you could work for coming out of college.
good,oil business is in a slump hopefully can improve in the near future as many have been hit with redundancy and there seems like nothing positive at the moment
good,I worked at this facility and it was bought by NOV and everything changed. We no longer got raises bonuses and we continously had our schedules changed until we were let go.
good,a typical day at work would be driving out to the rigs. checking in with company man and resolve the issues or problems. do billing and inventory on rigs.
good,It was a good experience to learn something new and to see how production works. The people are nice and helpful. Good place to work.
good,Internship for the summer. Learned a lot but the company was on a hiring freeze when I graduated from college. Got the opportunity to learn transfer pricing.
good,"Usually, each day is spent sitting down at your computer. As an engineering student at first, I learned a lot about my field but my interests have changed since then. I have also learned I need human contact on a daily basis in order to be happy in my job. With the hostile market right now and just the office environment, no one really talks to anyone. I can't handle that. But it's a quiet place to work if you like that."
good,Contratar mas personal para dar el descanso necesario k necesita un trabajar para dar un buen rendimiento
good,Worked with some really great people. My job kept me at a very steady pace. The pay was great. The benefits were very good also.
good,"starting out day by performing walk through plants checking on plants,equipment and machinery.check in with supervisor to see what was on schedule for the day.Everyday was a new task, challenging your mind and ability. Enjoyed working with all the co-workers.Some of the hardest parts of the job was tasks that had to be performed from being on top of the roof to the bottom of the autoclave pit."
good,"Learnt a lot working within the company, they are strong beleivers in teaching employees to have them move forward within the company."
good,"A fun workplace for me being able to grow and learn on a daily basis and exceed expectations. also, having the same gold as everyone else which is to represent that company the best way possible."
good,"This review will be sad. Beginning of last year I saw myself working for this great company for at least 3 more years. I've had great success in my field. And well this year is all going down with the downturn."
good,I loved  the fact that I worked along with little supervision .Management  was great in the department I worked in . My co workers and I got alone great .Great benefits and two weeks vacation when hired on with company .
good,"I've worked at NOV for quite a while. I've done day shifts and night shifts and I believe I'm quite versatile. I had to get along with people at work for the sake of working, but they weren't all that time cooperative, but I made it work. I've enjoyed my stay at NOV."
good,I learnt a lot!  The recent oil slump got us retrenched but the experience was well worth it. I had fun! I hope to go back and work there again someday.
good,"Its a busy day all day long, i occurred great experience through work and practice at management. coworkers are great and the hardest part of the job was not having enough time in the day."
good,"Arbetet var intensivt men roligt och intressant."
good,"1). 5 day working, which is rare to find in India."
good,"Sales driven company. Must excel at crisis management and be multi dimensional. Schedule is different everyday, which definitely does not get you bored."
good,"professional ,and willing to train anyone who works for this company but you you 12 days straight and get 2 days off not good for a family man but if you are single and want to make money this is a great company to work for"
good,When i interact with my team and share each others problems with the project.
good,"I only spent a short time at NOV, but during my internship they showed gave me a good understanding of the company. It was a great learning experience."
good,There was always work to be done and knowledge to gain about the industry. There were opportunities to cross train throughout the warehouse which was a plus.
good,In my time of employment I was able to take in a lot of new information about the oil and gas industry. There was always a lot to do in a days work from cleaning to stocking new parts in the warehouse. Safety and security were our first priorities at the facility.
good,Very productive and get the job done accurately is very important to me and also enjoying what I do. I enjoyed working as team which is very important when it comes to accomplishing company's goal.
good,"NOV has a good work life balance. It is uncommon to see people spend more than 8 hours at the office. There is never a ""crunch time""; the workload is pretty consistent."
good,"Hands-on and theoretical work, decent to strong support from management. Pay/promotions highly dependent on industry as a whole. Salaried for 40 hour weeks, but typically work around 50."
good,NOV is a large company made up of many small companies acquired over the years. Has a small company feel with a great work environment. As long as you work your 40 hours and get your work done its a great place to work.
good,"Very effective Software for the oil/gas rig real-time physics, geometry simulation, Internet GUI for rig control. Sophisticated assembly of C++, JavaScript, Java and HTML"
good,"Cultivated key business relationships within an assigned territory to call on regular and prospective customers and solicit business    Maintained good rapport and informed customer of value adding products and services  "
good,"A typical day at work: Running production meeting in the morning, getting feedback and giving feed forward to project engineers ans sales engineers about their projects.  Scheduling and rescheduling jobs with MS projects to archive delivery dates and smooth work flow."
good,En flott og spennende arbeidsplass med store muligheter for utvikling og læring
good,Good work life balance but the pay is not up to par. Oil field is down and morale is low. Good job to have but not right now. I would recommend the company to job seekers.
good,The people are very nice and there are also advancement and growth there. Just not a organized as a hospital should be. Very nice to work there.
good,it's always fun to work with hydraulics and something that could potentially kill you if you don't know what you are doing. management is good but of course every company has it's own complications. Awesome co-workers who understands having fun and work at the same time
good,"National Oilwell Verco has great teamwork skills, functional, and good company to work for. Mangement is one of the best one i've seen so far."
good,"Every morning before our shift starts, we have a tool box/ safety meeting. We go over certain criteria, and different safety procedures. After the meeting, everybody gets to work. Throughout the day, my co-workers and I do several inspections that pertain to each part of the shop. We work together as a team, so we can be more productive. Different managers walk through out the shop making sure everyone is following the proper procedures to be productive in a safely manor. Just like any job, you always have your ups and downs. When things are going good, it's challenging but fun. The down side is when it slows down, it makes it hard for certain people that are busy bodies."
good,"Great place to work, I enjoyed all 7 years of working here and love to go back some day. They take good care of you and the customers. They work with your schedule and also help pay for your schooling."
good,I enjoy the people that I work with and the environment.  I mostly enjoyed the industry knowledge from self teaching and research.
good,"Good company systems and practices are being reviewed to make them more competitive. overall going in the right direction"
good,I wish I was still there but trying to find office work like what I was doing or something similar to it.  I am a dedicated employee.
good,"The pressure control group once called Shaffer, can be a lot of fun to work in.  Fast paced environment whit a managerial staff that encourages rather than stifles. However they are a very conservative company and if you don't fit into their idea of a team player you will not progress. they tend to promote from within and do not have a real review process.  A lot of brown nosing goes on there and if you are not the type you will be overlook."
good,"shipping  parts out to oil field"
good,"Et godt arbeidsmiljø, kolleger med variert kompetansebakgrunn. Til tider utfordrende arbeidstempo. Det var stort fokus på kunnskapsutvikling og kursing. Varierte arbeidsoppgaver."
good,Safe and clean work environment. NOV provides numerous learning and training opportunities. I enjoyed working with high energy and productive colleagues.
good,Great place to work at but hard to advance.  They seemed to work on the buddy system when it came to advancing. However the company was always more than fair to all employees.  I would be happy to work for them again.
good,"Work was fine, but once they began pushing to keep going, you are Pushed to the point that it wasn't enjoyable anymore. It was unfortunate as many employees had left because of it."
good,"Very large & stable company."
good,a comfortable work environment under great managing. Quality over Quantity in our work is expected. Above and beyond is usually what is expected from any of NOVs employees. The best part of work is definitely getting to work with people I have built strong friendships with. Nothing makes a job more enjoyable then bonding together as a team.
good,"The work day begins at 6 am, and ends at 6 pm. Monday thru Friday, a team approach is used to resolve issues and determine future business and process changes. "
good,"The hardest part about this job was having to explain to the customers why we would not meet the deadline given (not by me)."
good,"A typical day is a 10 hour shift from 5am - 3:30pm, the management there was good and also they're focus on safety was superb. The most enjoyable part of the job is most of everyone there have a fun attitude, making work more enjoyable."
good,Great people with lots of talent but upper management/sales gave very little support to the Northeast United States. Huge company but we were treated like a mom and pop store in the Northeast which was a plus.
good,"Todos o dias."
good,"Ambiente de baixo stresse mas necessário dinâmica e pró-ativodade  e relacionamento para realização de trabalhos"
good,I enjoyed working at NO. It gave me a chance to grow and advance my career. I would go back to NO. and work again.  Team work place.
good,"Great company, plenty of work. 7/12's, benefits are great. supervisors are lacking in intelligence and knowledge of the company's goals and progress."
good,They provide a good pay rate and have a great benefits program. Management was not organized and had too much immunity from employee complaints.
good,Working in the bit department was a great experience.  A great team and atmosphere to work in every day.  Hope new career has similar.
good,"Tech Support engineer is the first focal point of contact for the customer's by attending their queries and solving technical as well as commercial issues with the drilling equipment's."
good,Very fortunate to have experienced a great career with NOV. They encourage employee development and career path opportunity.
good,This company has a lot of growth opportunities and they are very laid back and understanding about personal days and family issues.
good,"Bons salários. distante dos grande centros, bons colegas de trabalho, falta de plano de carreira, ritmo tranquilo de trabalho."
good,I was temp at this company from what the perm employees told me they if you are working in document control there is really no room to grow there.
good,Typical work is about 8 hours. Auditors get two 20min break times and a 30 min lunch break. Auditors do not really move around from their cube unless they are getting up for a restroom or the breaks listed above. The work of a auditor is repetitive and can often have bad days pop up from angry customs/ preparers of  these expense reports.
good,"Nice colleagues, comfortable environment, pay depends on duties but overall a low standard pay. One can expect a good experience while working here as there are many different things to work on and various systems that can boost one's experience."
good,Outside sales rep visiting and selling automotive and oilfield supplies and equipment.
good,The upper management always felt threatened by new and up and coming new hires. A lot of shadiness went on in Final Documentation. Nothing you could do about it if you were not buddies with someone in HR or another department.The manager was buddies with everyone so murder was easily gotten away with.
good,Provided an opportunity to learn Oracle. Everyone's ideas and suggestions were listened to.
good,"reunion matutina para la asignacion de grupos de trabajo y en las zonas a realizar, trabajo en equipo con seguridad en el uso de herramientas elctricas,la falta de honestidad y de interes por parte de la coordinacion con las cuadrillas que estaban en areas rurales y la falta de honestida al momento de reportar las horas extras. el compañerismo excelente con trabajo en equipo y colaboracion y compromiso con la actividad,en realidad el trabajo no es dificil lo mas importante es realizarlo con suguridad y cuidado y con buena dispocisión, la satisfacion de entregar un trabajo con calidad y puntualidad."
good,"Work day there was a good learning experience in the solids control area of the oil field. I have learned basic fabricating and mechanical responsibilities on centrifuges. Like, reading blue prints, wiring machines like centrifuges, shakers, dryer centrifuges, and VFDs (variable frequency drives). I learned how to build from beginning to finish different types of centrifuges, like 3400, 2000hs, 1960s, 2172hs. I repaired and ran centrifuges as I progressed. I have also rebuilt VFDs. I had 2 leadmen and a supervisor over the shop. It was difficult working in a place where your supervisor nor one of the leadmen knew how to build a centrifuge, only one did. There was a lot of mis-management and lack of communication happening in the work place. On the good side, the benefits and experience was the best thing I liked about National Oilwell Varco."
good,"Extremely busy and always a change of pace. I learned how to communicate with coworkers and customers to get what i needed and wanted for positive results. There was not allot of management oversight. I did my job and everything was good, i worked well with my coworkers as i always do. I am super easy to get along with, which makes for nice days at work. The hardest part of my job was leaving, I needed more outta life and at the time there was nothing that I could advance to. The most enjoyable part of NOI was getting to travel for business training at such a young age, I felt blessed."
good,"my boss and co workers was so kindly, friendly & i feel at home working there, the job was a lilltle bit heard benning my frist time doing it but at last i love it"
good,"Maintained mud equipment on drilling rigs checking screens, motors, start boxes and making sure the equipment running in top shape. I learned how drilling rigs work with our equipment to produce more oil product. The supervisors I had did a good job delegating work. The people that I worked with I liked because they were team players. Hardest part of my job was working my long night shift but it was not bad because of the amount of days we got off. Most enjoyable part of the job I liked was the days off we got."
good,"Num dia tico de trabalho realizo manutenção em diversos equipamentos, Aprende muito a trabalhar em equipe, Não concordo com algumas medidas gerências adotadas."
good,"would receive incoming crates, stock shelfs, move stuff with forklift, pull parts, ship parts"
good,I was a good and smart worker and had a lot of extra work piled on me while others were busy learning SolidWorks automation for their own personal gain--it was not a skill we needed for our job. They went on to work as animators for another company. LOL! People who worked from home never turned in any completed work. Management was unaware of what workers were doing most of the time...especially since people lied a lot.
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, tem muitas pessoas boas com quem sempre aprendo algo."
good,"I would do from the paint both to the oven & puling the product out with a forklift to the cart operating the crane,i learned how to work the oven & the paint both and learning colors,all of my co-workers were respectfull to one another, i had no trouble doing my job."
good,"I deal mostly with intercompany customers overseas selling aftermarket rig crane parts.I learned quite a bit about on and off shore gas and oil drilling. My co-workers and I have a team type work environment. One of the hardest parts of the job is trying to explain to a customer why the warehouse shipped them the wrong parts. the best part of the job is when a customer emails me satisfied with their delivery times. However I miss the steel industry,an office environment is not really me."
good,Challenging roles in different departments. Can be rewarding if working with the right group.
good,"My job consisted of traveling to different Oilfield companies, working on sales calls and invoices. Also keeping up Customer Relations.The hardest part of my job was adapting to working in the Oilfield on Locations and Rigs, but eventually the situations became easier. The most enjoyable part of my job was the travel and meeting knew people that taught me a lot about the Oilfield."
good,"Enjoyable job, Helpful people. No room for growth unless you are straight out of college. Older employees are not able to promote."
good,"I worked on weekend shift. didnt like it. 12 hr days and only 30 minute lunch, however, large property and no places to go eat around area with the time limit."
good,There are plenty of tasks to occupy your time and keep you busy.
good,"A good variation in working roles, great on H & S, friendly helpful workmates an enjoyable atmosphere to work in. A three Shift pattern of Nights (10-6) Evenings (2-10) and Earlies (6-2) with options for overtime in week and weekends as per workloads required. On site and off site training."
good,"I liked learning new things everyday, I was able do problem solving and had to pick up on things quickly. most difficult thing was staying busy most of the time, most of the time would clean house"
good,"great place to work and learn at any level as there are a lot of different products and divisions its easy to fit in , very large corporation so does take some time to get used to"
good,Challenging environment allows for learning and growth. Most enjoyable part of working at NOV is dealing with different people and personalities. Good company.
good,Good place to work. Mostly good people. You can do lots of online training in different work areas. Very Safety minded. They look out for one and other.
good,"Very busy all day updating paperwork , Kpi boards and computer programs also making sure staff are working to list order to complete the work on time. attending work meetings with other departments."
good,NOV is a descent company to work for. They are going through difficult times as a result of the oil and gas sector and have been laying many employees off as a result.
good,"The pay and benefits differ greatly from one job to another.  By the time I made it to this job description, I had good pay and benefits, but was barely at home monthly due to traveling for my position"
good,"Bright side of this company is the bonus if quotas are met for the year. Depending on which department you are on, you may be able to work 9/80s which is a plus. Most of the time is just dealing with manufacturing and customer issues. "
good,It was long hours and I was away from home alot. It was a good job in my state till they closed down and made everyone quit or relocate. We were paid well for an oilfield job.
good,"Work days were busy I learned to read blue prints in accordance to product inspection ! Find third party inspectors to work for us ! How to do reports and invoices ! Previous to corporate I learned to be overall admin assistant to 4 supervisors keeping track of up to if not more then 300 guys on stack pad - times,  certifications, safety training monthly and so much more"
good,"You can get called out at any time of day or night.  Once you are called you leave your home or the office to head to a rig to get the job done.  Once you've completed that one job, you could get called out to go to another rig and work on something totally different than what you did at the previous job site.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with people that don't care if you're right or not, they just want to argue because the believe they are right all the time.  You learn how to deal with that type of personality.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers your work for/with and have a good rapport with them."
good,"Excelente compañía, con muchas herramientas de trabajo, capacitación constante a empleados."
good,The management would be better if not mostly Americans as NOV has offices in over 65 countries. Some key decisions made are not practical in other countries like in Africa.
good,"Face paced environment learned extensive trouble shooting with controls and electronics in a automated production plant."
good,The work environment has improved with new management. Pay and bonus freeze has affected moral to a point but most are still glad to be working. As related business improves throughout the industry folks will begin to migrate to those places without pay freezes.
good,"Great place to work for continuous education. "
good,"National Oilwell was a good place to work. Management change brought a lot of  different changes and some worked better then other changes suggested. I enjoyed working for National Oilwell, there are some good employees there."
good,"A typical day at National Oil well Varko  begins with a safety meeting before the start of production. Then I would acquire all of the shifts pending work orders and delegate tasks among the technicians to ensure all deadlines will be met. Last before I let anyone began production I inspected all machinery and equipment avoid injury, equipment failure, along with proper calibration to ensure all finished products exceed quality control guidelines. Commencement of the work day included cleaning of all equipment and work areas before finally briefing the relief crew on the previous shift."
good,"I did enjoyed working at NOV."
good,"This is a company where you get what you put in; therefore, contribution is important. I enjoyed working here and was never bored. Made many connections and would work here again."
good,"It was a fast paced job, worked all the time weekend also. I liked the work they just wouldn't pay me for how much i was working, I was paid salary no overtime which is why I left."
good,They do not support their people and a lot leave. They have good benefits but the overall management changes all the time and they never consider making changing that are not beneficial for the whole company.
good,"NOV will pay you low, very low compared to the rest of the industry. They will pay you a bonus through out the year if the company is doing well and they are quarterly bonuses."
good,"Given the current oil and gas market, incredible employees are looking elsewhere for appropriate compensation.  The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and it is understandable that proper compensation is not always available.  Seeing what else is available."
good,The company offers good resources and benefits for a large company. The people are very friendly and it is a good working environment although improvements could be made. The products are leading edge drilling equipment. Career direction is not well determined and fairly unknown or addressed as most of the staff is at higher levels. Management should focus on mentoring and helping junior staff realize their potential and help with charting their role in the company.
good,"Overall good company to work for, employees are the backbone of the company. Management could communicate better and reduce the amount of micro-managing. There are too many people advancing their own agenda to gain advancement."
good,"Really appreciated the bonuses until that stopped."
good,oil field is an interesting field to learn if you apply your self the skills and abilities you learn will open several door of opportunities. the money you make here is good but you work long hours .
good,Great Benefits.  Good work balance.  Nice people.  Too many similar roles in departments.  Lay offs were plenty due to downturn in market.
good,An enjoyable place to work with good benefits. Senior management lost path since last CEO retired. They more concern on internal politics than company future
good,Excellent nine years under the previous management then as industry went down hill new management was brought in and redundancy followed
good,"we use to start the day with a meeting where we discuss and distribute the daily tasks."
good,"while being called out on jobs you work a minimum of 12 hours per day 7 days per week,"
good,"I enjoyed working for NOV and learned alot. Unfortunately, the downturn came and my division got rid of the the smart, hardworking people and kept all their friends."
good,Great company to work for if you want to see the world and meet tons of people.  Company will train you to do the job correctly and safety is a top priority no matter what.
good,"NOV was a job that enabled me to travel to a lot of new places and see areas I would probably never have got to see. The company allowed you to challenge yourself and discover new skills you never knew you had. Typical day included setting up of , or servicing equipment on drilling rigs. We were on call 24-7 and had to respond and resolve any problems quickly so drilling rigs could continue to work. The hardest part of job was working in extreme weather conditions. Such as 110 degrees to sub zero temps."
good,"When out on a job you work 12 hours a day 7 days a week and can spend long periods of time away from home."
good,"Overall I feel I have gained many skills over the years advancing through the ranks at NOV. They are willing to hire unskilled individuals and train them to meet the jobs at hand, but they only do this due to their low pay scale. If you get in at a good plant you can advance fairly far in your career, but as with all oil and gas companies the market swings can be brutal."
good,"My time with NOV thus far has been a very positive experience.  Despite volatile market conditions for the oil and gas industry, I have been able to develop fundamental engineering skills related to mechanical design and research and development."
good,"After 15 years challenges were few and far between. Learned all aspects of the manufacturing, assembly, materials, purchasing and quality of oil tools."
good,This was one of the most difficult places to work but yet I learned a lot of Valuable lessons. If there is not a productive culture then by default to get a unproductive culture. Overall I loved working here because it still was a opportunity for me to learn.
good,"A typical day at work-"
good,nice people to  work with.  good benefit plan good mentors.  Nice machines good equipment and safety protocols. Nice jobs to work on
good,"Co-workers are great, friendly staff. Worked regular hours with a chance for over time.  Management provided staff appreciation lunches every week. Regular staff reviews with options for advancement."
good,"Overall experience with the company was good. Good benefits package and growth potential. The typical workday consisted of gathering equipment information and formatting it into something that could be used by instructors to train customers. NOV manufactures some impressive rig equipment, and each has its own story. With so many different tools, something new was learned everyday. For me, the hardest part of the job was when it ended and I had to say farewell.  Unfortunately the downturn in the oil and gas industry forced the company to reorganize its infrastructure therefore negatively affecting the company."
good,Working with the many great people under my supervision to grow and advance the company.  Taking on the daily challenges of my position and finding solutions.
good,Good work place with a mostly positive work environment. Team leads were knowledgeable on equipment and procedures. If you wanted to learn something resources were there and management was supportive for the most part unless there was a lot of that needed to be done. Most of the employees were easy to get along with. The only hard part bout the job was not knowing what hours you were going be working but nothing to complain about and there was good compensation for it.
good,"I enjoy working in my role and generally find my work challenging. However, an unnecessarily large portion of those challenges is working with certain groups within the company. Far too many legacy personnel who are quick to say 'no' to a new idea in favor of the status quo. This has worked very well, but the playing field is changing and NOV may not be fast enough to adapt. "
good,National Oilwell Varco is a well-recognized company with excellent benefits. There is ample support provided by management. The Health Safety Environmental culture is next to none.
good,The executive team does a great job of managing the company. My team was great to work with. It was a good experience and I enjoyed collaborating with such wonderful people.
good,"I have been lucky enough to advance at my current location, but the pay doesn't suffice.  My location is said to be the dumpster of all Houston area NOVs...I hope to advance out of this location after graduation, but until then I am grateful for the opportunities."
good,"The most enjoyable part of work is when we all have to tackle big orders as a team as work. I have learned more about the functions and operations of an oilfield. Management is unbiased in all situations from personal to business, no change."
good,"Good company with with wide range of products and separate departments handling each type of equipment.  provide technical expertise, advanced equipment and operational support necessary for success. Have the people, capabilities and vision to serve the needs of a challenging and evolving industry."
good,"Very good working atmosphere. Very co-operative co- workers, proffessional and experienced management. Good company"
good,"Management,co-workers are great..room for promotion,great lunch area and break was adequate..will recommend this place to people who wants a growth in thier career"
good,"Most of the managers had a hands off approach, and let team leads do just that. LEAD. It did come with its own challenges, but I think in the end stronger leadership is developed from within. Which in turn allows for plants/branches to have managers with a very solid knowledge of the demands of each position. Most of my co-workers I would consider good friends, there was never a dull moment on the job. the hardest part was ""unforeseen"" demands in man hours (last minute jobs). Now for me its not such a problem I enjoy the overtime. But when I have to ask one of my guys to stay and I know he has an hour commute as it is. I do have a hard time explaining that our customer is what keeps us in business."
good,"trabalho rotineiro, na qual aprendi muito sobre manuseio de maquinário e manutenção preventiva, sobre os riscos e acidentes e como evita-los, trabalho em equipe muito bom sempre estávamos ajudando uns aos outros, praticamente família já que passávamos em media 15 dias juntos por mês, a parte mais difícil era quando um equipamento quebrava mesmo e não dava para ser concertado no local e tínhamos que fazer seu trabalho mais sempre dávamos conta do serviço, e a parte mais agradável era a folga e o salario."
good,would stay working nights. management just worried more about product than personal
good,The company pays well. I cannot speak fr NOV as a whole because I only worked for a company owned by them. Quality Tubing howerver does not have a good reputation and the culture is not very welcoming to someone outside the industry. Te benefits/insurance was amazing though
good,"Very good to place to work, with excellent staff, benifits & conditions."
good,"A typical day at working here is the fact we receive multiple products from several customers that need different types of repairs."
good,I enjoyed the opportunities to work on a wide range of projects and technologies with talented people acreoss many fields. I enjoyed meeting and presenting to customers across the globe and the opportunity to visit interesting manufacturing and drilling facilities.
good,"Average.I perform cycle counts, reconciliations, work order resolution."
good,I was field service so very seldom had a lot of interaction with co-workers ....we always work alone for the most part.....when i did go in the office to complete paperwork everyone in there were nice an helpful......the hardest part of my job was being on call 24hrs...just couldnt plan anything with your family.......yhe most enjoyable part of my job was traveling an learning new technolgy.......
good,I build and teardown Coiled tubing and drilling agitators 5-7 a day
good,Limited benefits for hourly employees. Overall good company. Would recommend this company to other job seekers. Marble Falls is a foundry which can require work to be done in hard environments.
good,"I enjoyed working at NOV for the past 8 years. however, due to shortage of work and organisational restructuring I was laid off due to shortage of work."
good,Good workplace and good management full support of colleagues and our seniors .company give training for performance level .and a lots of really i over enjoyed there
good,"At NOV, management changes very often which results in changes of visions and strategies. Those changes also affect my priorities and plans. When some might see this as a disadvantage, I see it as an every-day challenge."
good,"It will be steady work and consistency during normal market conditions.  If you can get past the ""cost reduction"" that the company tries to do and you will be just fine."
good,"Always room for improvement "
good,I enjoy the day in and day out with my team and peers. Developed a strong working relationship and network. Working in Oil & Gas can be stressful due to continuous changing market outlook.
good,This company is a great Safety and Employee oriented company. I worked at the Orange Plant for 5 Years. This is the one Company I regret leaving. This company does pay well and overtime is highly encouraged however so is work life balance as time off is rarely rejected and the week of Christmas the plant Shutdown. There is some issues with managers not helping employees grow within the company but this is overcome by the training programs offered.
good,"NOV is a solid, professional organization with a strong culture and advance products and manufacturing capability.  It is a rewarding organization to work for and offers its employees challenges and opportunity to excel."
good,"great company to work for, but no room for advancement in my current situation. i learn a  lot about the different products and use that knowledge to try and better the systems and equipment we sell."
good,Working at NOV was a great place to start learning about the oil field and the way things work from a technician stand point. NOV will train most of the employees and will find a way to help your job and production flow easier.
good,Great place to work. Great benefits and all around place to be.lots of driving and lifting. learn a lot about the area and oilfield if you don't know much already.
good,"Desde el primer dia te sientes como parte de la familia NOV, excelente apoyo por parte de todos los empleados."
good,The employees where friendly.  The work environment was comfortable.  The benefits are great.  The work around your schedule.  Don't disclose important information
good,"Overall this company is very good, but too many on the inside ""know one another"".  Hard to get in and harder to advance inside, but the job was better than average."
good,"Very Good Experience, learned a lot and gained experience in different fields like sales, technical, marketing and other sorts of soft skills like Microsoft office & presentation skills."
good,"Excellent benefits, advanced training in all aspects of the oil and gas distribution industry.Great upward mobility. The best part of the job is working with employees and customers. T"
good,NOV is a good company to work for. The only complaint I have is that they hold you back from advancing your career with the company. They will not let you move to a different group to advance your career if you are valuable to the team.
good,"Work/life balance is good for the most part at NOV though my opinion is based on conditions prior to the O&G downturn around 2015-16. Depending on the product line, work can be challenging and fulfilling."
good,Managers always listen to your input and bring it up in team meetings. I enjoyed my co-workers a lot. Everyone was nice and helpful. I learned a lot and got a promotion.
good,I've had the opportunity to learn many aspects of the business. They are very flexible with you as far as balancing your work life and family. It is a very stressful environment.
good,i had a good time working there and would still be there if they had not ran out of work and had to lay off over half my work force. one thing that i thought was wrong was they had way to many meetings each week. most of the time there was aleast 7 to 8 meeting a week
good,I started working here out of college and climbed the ladder quite fast - I liked working there and the people I worked with.  However since I started there so low they gave me some BS about lateral moves rather than promotions and ultimately I was able to double my pay by leaving for another company.
good,"I loved the workplace culture of NOV. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I had an amazing boss.  I was promoted multiple times in my career at NOV, so I feel I was recognized and rewarded for my hard work."
good,This job was an entry level position which was a good stepping stone for another job with another company.  Good people to work with and the work was interesting.
good,a great place to start and build a career. I learned a lot and was able to grow. A very high paced job and challenging. I wish the facility did not have to shut down.
good,"Regretted having to NOV, but due to the downturn in the oil field I had no choice."
good,Great work environment and a fulfilling job. Work at your own pace and take breaks as needed. Long hours and work 6 days a week but the compensation was great.
good,Great company and very flexible. Great opportunity if you willing to work hard and learn new things.  As with everything in the oil  & gas market NOV took a hit during the downturn.
good,"The work isn't too hard but be prepared to work long grueling hours for very little pay. NOV runs a crew with the bare minimum amount of people needed, which is great in slow times when companies start lay offs."
good,When we have work we have lots of work sometimes we did not have any word so we had to feel around for make something up to do when we had work we had lots of fun sometimes
good,Great place to serve as an apprentice. modern technology. good experienced workforce. good salary. the benefits within the company are very good. management were good for working around your outside life.
good,"DistributionNOW, which is formerly NOV Distribution and Wilson Safety Supply, is run entirely by Legacy NOV management.  Believe they can command double digit margins on commodity PVF.  Given they are cash rich, they may be able to outlast the competition but have heard of numerous layoffs in the past year, which is why I left.  "
good,"I enjoyed the work and the people. I would work there again given the opportunity."
good,"High stress job but very interesting with regard to the equipment you have to inspect daily."
good,"good benefit but you work by the group dealer"
good,I have no complaints just hate the industry is so up and down at times. At the Eldridge location Safety was a work-life style. Im hoping to get another opportunity to be employed by this company.
good,"Enjoyed my time at NOV & something new to learn everyday. Most of the people are nice and will go out of there way to help a person in need, an over all good place to work."
good,"Don't expect to work less than 60 hours a week. Pay and benefits are decent for people with no experience. Management is usually sympathetic to employees needs, however it is a large corporation so a lot of times their hands are tied."
good,"Provide a great opportunity to learn new application of existing technologies and good job culture."
good,"A typical day at work consists of been very productive, meeting various goals and demands, meeting deadlines and assisting others. I've learned time-management, leadership skills, customs guidelines, rules, regulations of the Oil and Gas Industry and how to apply them effectively. In addition to how to manage various ERP systems and company designed systems. Workplace culture is okay, some areas can use improvement. The hardest part of the job is when systems fail. The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork and constant training."
good,I was new to this Industry and I was guided into it very professionally so that I could become one of the more successful sales agents they had seen in a while
good,a typical day can be very easy as long as you pay attention to your equipment. the hardest part is trying to catch up if you fall behind and crawling around in a cuttings pit after your wedge for the drying shakers.
good,"as stated in my summary, good place to work, though feedback can be hard to come by due to busy work schedule of supervisors."
good,"very high talented Artisans,who know what they do and willing to teach and guide. working on Big Jobs wich need your concentration.. nice environment to be"
good,I had a great experience working with National Oilwell. And with great co-worker. Love the fact that we were able to travel all TEXAS.
good,"Everyday is a learning and getting better day"
good,Job is subject to the ups and down cycles of the oilfield. Management was young but reasonable to work with. Company did tend to keep the younger people vs the older more experienced people during the downtown.
good,Great managment personnel. Enough hours given . They dont really work around your schedule if need be. Not many opportunities given.but an ok work place.
good,"un dia de trabajo normas es checar todas tus herramientas en pozo estar al endiente de las condiciones de trabajo que le da la gente de pemex a tus herramientas tener una buena comunicacion con el personal."
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. I have been able to learn a great deal about corporate real estate and facility management.
good,"NOV is a company that cares about its employees."
good,Great place to work with very knowledgeable employees who have helped me become the employee I am today. I have learned many different things while working for NOV.
good,"NOV treats is employees quite well during the boom times.  There are lot's of perks for good employees, but the work/life balance is hard to maintain during the boom times.  When times got slow I was very disappointed in the way management handled the lay offs."
good,"I was blessed to be employed with this company for nine years.  Unfortunately, I was laid off due to downturn in the oil industry.  I worked with some phenomenal people and established some wonderful lifetime friendships. There was always an opportunity to learn new applications and expand/improve my skills."
good,"Workload is stable, but only when the industry was good. Management changed a lot and there was very little room to move up. Very hard to get promotions and raises."
good,"A typical days work for NOV would be a 16hr shift starting at 530am. I would attend all safety meetings required before job duties. Depending on what the rig was doing(drilling, tripping pipe, etc) I would make sure our equipment was up to par and running correctly. I would also do recent ""mud checks"" making sure the mud or fluid they were drilling with was up to specs. I operated solids control equipment such as centrifuges, shakers, dewatering units etc... to help maintain the needed mud properties."
good,"Relaxed environment heading towards the product quality."
good,good company to work for. love to promote from within and have plenty of opportunities for growth. everyday is a learning experience.
good,"My time with NOV has been beneficial and I learned a lot. The location is helpful and inviting. I believe anyone who works at this location will find the environment friendly, inviting and safe."
good,"Hoping that the Oil Market will recover, Cell as they call departments when working with our Cell jobs were great, fabricating hydraulic hoses to fabrication stainless steel tubing in house, setting up our own hose kits and tubing kits, we had our vendor of course but a lot of times with new improve modifications hoses or tubing needed to be modified, assembling parts to units other Cells gone a little behind with over load and we would assist. "
good,Awesome company but been affected by dropping oil prices. Layoffs company wide and cutbacks force long hours for employees that are left.
good,boss is very good . health and saftey envorment is good. boss willing to work with employees on things needed to do job. work on machinces as they break down and helped with production when nothing needed to be fixed
good,"Se encontro un ambiente agradable en lo laboral le dedique muchas ganas y esfuerzo pero el salario siempre estuvo por debajo de lo "
good,good work place good place to learn new things cool people to work with but oil prices going down not a good place to be at right now job security depends on how hard you work and who you know. laid off due to oil prices so not so secure.
good,"Good boss, good benefits as long as business is good they lay off based on business which is fair but you don't have any job security."
good,There is a scope for growth for younger generation who want  to work hard and smart if oil market improves.it is hard to comment anything about management in this market.
good,"Recent down turn in the oil market has caused many jobs to be lost and extra work on the remainder of the employees."
good,"A great work experience, for the most part.  At my location, I had wonderful people to work with.  The training is somewhat lacking, fortunately I had had great coworkers willing to teach me.  "
good,"It seemed that once a person was placed in a management position they no longer worked to improve the work environment, but instead played the political game.  The political game is important, however, when it comes to managing a group you still need to be aware of the employees moral.  Management does not seem to do this and become too involved in their advancement."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Got caught up in the industry downturn of 2015 and was laid off. Strong financially company that will succeed as one of the top three oilfield service providers in the near future. I enjoyed my tenure there and would go back.
good,"A very laid back environment, most designers wore jeans to work unless notified in advance that business casual was needed due to customer visits."
good,"I am grateful for employment at NOV. I have been promoted in less than three years from receptionist to Assistant to the Director of Operations. I feel that my hard work and dedication to my job is greatly appreciated and valued. However, training on the job is very poor, luckily I am a fast learner and can decipher problems independently. In the end I believe learning the hard way is the best way. One remembers those life lessons permanently. I am happy that all co-workers are understanding and helpful along the way. However, the hardest part of my job is not knowing if it will be permanent or temporary at this point in time."
good,"Good company to work for just the industry is bad.  I am working in the engineering office, so what I see is only within the engineering office, so I cannot comment the overall condition for the entire company including the shop.  "
good,"NOV er en produktiv arbeidsplass med høyt arbeidstempo."
good,"travel from rig to rig fixing problems and interacting with  customers, i have learned a lot  from other technicians, and made some friends along the way, the industry is down right now but when the industry is good life is good."
good,"Great group of guys to work with, not to work for. Always had opportunity to learn new machines and process. Promotion of safety and new processes start strong but fall short and are usually forgotten about."
good,"Managed 35+ employees. Dealt with inventory management issues to equipment maintenance scheduling and customer sales."
good,"Manager provides you with projects or tasks to accomplish. In the time I spent there I worked with different pipes, pipe fittings, valves, and a variety of tools. I also worked with AutoCAD. Co-workers and managers are friendly and willing to help."
good,An international company that maintains a safe family atmosphere while striving to meet customer requirements with quality product in a timely manner.
good,Usually a busy day at work with challenges that keeps it interesting. A good team to work with and good working culture. A good company to work with.
good,I was laid off but I was given great experience building drilling motors.  If I were given a chance to go back I would take it.
good,"Benefits are great at my current, but it is hard to balance my personal with two jobs-which I currently work to keep up."
good,"Fast and Furious to a slow crawl. It is the Oil business, so it is volatile at times on both ends of the spectrum. Co-workers were great, we had great teamwork and cohesiveness. The most enjoyable part of the job besides the pay was the learning experience in the oilfield industry.the hardest part of the job was not knowing what the next month would bring if anything at all."
good,I like working here but I am need of different challenge. I am used to a fast pace job and like an every day challenge. I have learned a lot here about materials and inventory control. I have also learned the in's and out's of ISO9000 and API certifications.
good,"I always appreciated what my supervisor threw at me, as well as the advancement opportunities throughout my years with this company. All around a good company to set your roots in."
good,"It was good hard work, and had the opportunity for advancement, especially if you work hard and were dependable."
good,Empresa altamente responsable con los servicios encomendados por el cliente.
good,"A good place to work in the oilfield, with opportunities to travel and have new experiences."
good,this is a great way to be introduced into the oil field. the amount of experience that you will gain is great and will help you exceed far in this field. You will enjoy working with others and learning to work as a team which is what it's all about. The only draw back is always being on call 24/7 365 if you have a family it makes it hard to plan things out.
good,Very busy company always on the go. Co-workers are great to work with. I enjoy driving the forklift.
good,There are alot of experienced people to learn from.Most shops work 6-6.
good,NOV provides great job security while providing new challenges to be tackled everyday.  I have had plenty of opportunities to learn about the new products and services that go into drilling.  The management is a pro and con.  They hire and promote on potential which is great for new opportunities but they also ignore problems due to this as well.
good,Working alot in the oilfields and being away from home alot.
good,"The field sales job is probably typical of any oil and gas field sales position.  NOV is a giant in oil and gas industry so awesome opportunity to go anywhere with the company.  Demands a lot of time and energy, but you are compensated well for that time and energy."
good,"excellent work environment. great shift.,"
good,"muito dinâmico."
good,"I would enter in invoices an average of 150 to 200 invoices a day "
good,Work work work... Typical day is 14-16 hours.  Subject to be laid off.
good,Good place to work pay is a little short compaired with the rest of the industry but benefits are great.
good,"Great place to work. I was very productive however, business is based on oil prices which are cyclical in nature.  Out of the heard of oil field equipment suppliers, they actually care about their customers and aim at providing real value."
good,"Each position I held at NOV was challenging and allowed me to grow well into the job needs."
good,"Nothing to say but Nov ia a very good company to work for a lot of travelling that add up on the dollars."
good,learned a lot of different ways to work with mud systems. they sent their employees to classes out of state to get certified.  friendly people to work with.
good,Great place to work. Just looking to better myself. When we get over time it a usually 12 hour shifts but not always. Looking for more  steady hours to be on.
good,Great coworkers and a flexible schedule make working there pleasant. You also get a lot of autonomy as long as you get the job done and on time you are pretty much left to do things as you see fit.
good,"Having a great time working here and it’s a interesting place to work, working environment is good. With a high turn over of contractors, issues do arise. Most work mates and the supervisors are knowledgeable. It’s another string to my bow.. only downside it’s only ever temporary, loving my time there!!!"
good,"Empresa de grande porte no ramo petroquímico, muito boa de se trabalhar por ser fornecedora de vários tipos de equipamentos para sondas de perfuração fazendo com que o profissional que atua nela tenha  uma visão ampla na área técnica em que trabalha."
good,"Just like any other oil and gas manufacturer, there are many times where you have to learn new skills and help other departments to ensure the product can be delivered on time.  Overall, I believe it is a great place to work."
good,"NOV is an awesome company to work for just would not recommend working at the Houston Breen Location. "
good,I work in a very productive area of tax.  We prepare sales and use tax payments for over 40 states for more than 7 legal entities.  I am a liaison between the segments of the company and corporate tax.
good,Its a good place to work if you are ready for it. In my case I wasn't ready to take on the challenges it took. I was at a bad place in my life and had to leave. if I could do it all over again I would.
good,"Worked at NOV for about a year, but felt that upper management was not very communicative about goals and how to best move the job forward as a whole."
good,The projects were sponsored by internal customers. The manager left 1 month after me joining. The management went into bit of chaos with multiple projects coming in.
good,"Management favorable to family members and friends."
good,worked there nearly 15 years several promotions and company focused educational opportunities. maintained employment throughout the ups and downs of the oilfield industry. overall well balanced work life culture.
good,"Working at NOV during the down turn will really upset you. Your friends will be laid off by the boat load. When it is good you may get a bonus, but no promises. A raise? What's that? The best thing about NOV is the family values. If you're in you will be treated as family. Also, Management is constantly turning over."
good,"They really care about their employees, compensation is great. Some management are bias (at least in the division I was). The work culture is great and time goes by fast."
good,NOV has given me the chance to be promoted within the company for your job performance and not by who you know. NOV entrusts it employees to make decisions for their business units and not micro manage.
good,"pay was good, hours were always feast or famine, you couldn't get a day off or there was NO OVERTIME. depending on sales, orders and the market.  People were nice but sometimes it seemed like HR was out to get you."
good,"Most of team were very motivated and eager to assist in assisting new hires. I enjoyed to ""Gung Ho"" atmosphere. (All new hires were to read and attend ""Gung Ho"" classes). Products were made the American way. Good company."
good,There is a great possibility I would still be an employee had there not been such a severe downturn 2 years ago. Management was helpful and the admin staff was great but HR could have done well with some housecleaning.
good,NOV was more of an assignment and it was not enough time to adequately evaluate all aspects of the job.  Within the organization I supported they were in the process of rolling out new software to improve there procurement process.  Lots of challenges ahead to change the culture with the currently software system  being used.
good,all i have to say is it is the oil field when it is good it is good but when it is bad it is horrible so take it when you can and good luck. i do not like doing this typing
good,It was a great place to work we were always on call never had time for our family and some of the company we felt with were rude. And the men really looked down on women at the dock were we would drop off supplies but as for national they were great we were given bonus every six months great people
good,"I started with Bowen Tools and worked through the transitions to Air Liquide and the to National Oil well. I began my career as a laborer in a shop. I was promoted to office Manager, the Field Salesman, Then was asked to transfer to become a District Manager. As is the case with virtually all oilfield service companies: we worked whenever needed. Various shifts and or call outs were not uncommon. Under Bowen Tools, it was a smaller and more personal company. As we were bought by larger companies that sense of individual worth was reduced. Oilfield work requires a willingness to work hard, get dirty and learn multiple skills. we built and provided equipment for rent to authorized dealers and sold companion tools and parts to those same customers. I learned to move when requested to meet the needs of the company. I learned to sell and service the various products that were provided. I hired and trained employees in each location that I worked to carry out the required work while being safe."
good,"A typical day at work could be stressful , yet enjoyable. Working at NOV I have gained a lot of knowledge about spare parts for rigs. I developed meaningful relationships with customers and have gained patients for sure. My manager was very understanding and supported his employees with their work load and pushed us all to improve. As for higher management there was times when lack of communication caused an issue, but overall there was a good relationship. The hardest part of the job was taking the fault of others, but you quickly learn to focus solely on pleasing the customer as best as possible. The most enjoyable was working with my team, and other co-workers. Awesome individuals."
good,"excellent people , and good work enviroment for all the worker who work there, number one in safety , always taking care of their employees, multiculture place to work."
good,Nov is a very good training ground to gain experience in the oil and gas industry. They provide everything necessary for you to obtain a job with higher pay as long as you are willing to put the hours in.
good,"When the price of oil is up the money roles in and moral is high, but on the flip side when oil is down the money and moral is down. When you work in an industry dependent on one thing such as oil it can be stressful wondering how long you will have a job. Nature of the industry and not the fault of the company."
good,NOV was a great place to work.  People were good and the benefits were great.  I left because I wanted to go back to school.  I was in a position that would not let me not travel.  Travel and school do not mix well.
good,I enjoyed working for them but the pay scale I don't agree with. The location that I work at has more foreign people that can't communicate well. Also we only had a 30 min break
good,"Good opportunity for those looking to start on the manufacturing side of the oil/gas business or recent grads since you get to interact with different departments (engineering, sales, purchasing, logistics)."
good,My typical day on the job is preparing my work station and gathering products for that days work...also making sure the work space is safe for the crew.
good,"The job itself was fairly easy, maintaining equipment was a breeze as it practically ran itself.  Working at the shop on days off is possible for extra hours."
good,"Assemble, install, remove, troubleshoot, and repair mechanical hydraulic and pneumatic mobile equipment, Staff are friendly and there always will to teach"
good,"Mixed with fast paced and slower days.  Put in the effort to your job and you will last.  Has ""buddy system"" to extent but for the most part you get the same respect you give.  Generally work a good bit of hours, but weekends you are almost always off.  Usually have the option to work Saturdays if you want. Which would put you around the 70 hour mark."
good,Lots of good people to work with. Management needs a lot of help to improve. Workers being moved around constantly due to lack of experienced workers.
good,Good place to work. Very good mentoring by management. Would recommend. The colleagues are great to be around. I have learned a lot here and have a great start to my career and am pleased with what I have accomplished personally and for the company.
good,"The days tended to be long, but it was a great place to work. Management was very fair to me and I worked with a great bunch of people. I miss the people, the place and the job as a whole. Is asked to go back, I probably would."
good,"Learned a lot from the oil n gas industry that boosted my career as Project manager and project engineer and also technical and mechanical engineering ,that I now can take on any project or job with dedication and confidence and also motivate fellow colleges."
good,The hardest part of the job was fixing accounts that would be given to someone who would not manage it properly. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others with AP and account issues.
good,"I worked almost 4 years with NOV. It is a great company with lots of great thinks to point out. The health benefit is extraordinary. Upper management cares about employee growth and training. Among service companies in the oil-gas industry, NOV is a laid back company."
good,"NOV is a good place to break into the energy industry.  The pay will not be as high as a lot of competitors but it is structures that way so that during downturns, (like we just had) they don't have to lay off as many workers which creates less churn in the work force."
good,"in the morning we would have a general meeting about the daily needs of production output.If some parts were needed that day we would machine,paint,box,and load up trucks.The enviroment was a good place to work.The management was good to get along with.Everyone got along well with each other."
good,Lots of work when oil is in demand hard to get away from work lots of overtime that's good for$$$ but hard on the family great benefits and large company great job
good,"Good, pay, benefits. Depending on the division worked at, management may not have a clear direction. Job cuts during the downturn have definitely increased the workload.."
good,"Ótima empesa, muito bom o clima entre os funcionários!"
good,The work done was very interesting. Working with the engineers on various aspects of the projects was always an enjoyable challenge. The best part of working at NOV is their flexibility and desire for employee comfort.
good,"We use to visit our vendors for the internal audits and this has helped me a lot to understand the different industries,various work environments etc."
good,When I worked for NOV I had never thought how much stuff there was to learn about the company but after working with them for a bit it was worth my time and the pay was great.
good,Work and stay busy. Learned to work with a good team make a easy day. The  Management team was okay. Worked with some helpful co-workers most of the time. Last location I worked was getting to the job on time. Working as a team to get the parts done.
good,"Very good company work for and they help you to succeed in life. Nov don't give up on you,  like other companies around the oilfield. If they ever call me to return to work , I would on a heart beat."
good,"During my time at the company, I always looked forward to work. The company had a good work environment or atmosphere to it. I always felt comfortable while working at my designated work station. The most enjoyable part of my job, to me, were the pool table tournaments that were held between my co-workers and I."
good,Good place to work. A good starting point for your career in manufacturing. Safety comes first. Everyone work well together. They are willing to traine in other depts.
good,"A typical day at work is action oriented productivity, where you learn to value inputs of personnel actually doing the work , and inter -mediate between management to accredit mutual buy in for production goals. The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone on task, whereas the most enjoyable was just having opportunity to engage with them and shine positiveness in all situations."
good,"A typical day at NOV is pretty laid back, a healthy work environment you learn something new pretty much everyday the hardest part of the job is there is no hard part once you learn your job it's pretty much smooth sailing"
good,I really liked the job at that location but had a very bad experience at another of their locations with a manager hiring his friends who had no idea about the job with higher pay then the guys who had been there day in and day out doing the work just fine.
good,"A new task everyday, nothing ever was the same except the process... always found ways within each department to assist each other with workloads when things started to get overwhelming. Lots of training fit for whatever tasks were needed for each position I was given the opportunity to fill. Management and co-workers worked well together to be productive and maintain a well balanced work environment. Worst part - miscommunication / Best part - getting things done on time together"
good,"National Oilwelll Varco was a good organized company, after the company saw that I was a very responsible employee they let me work as much overtime as I wanted."
good,"Good company with a fine work culture."
good,"NOV is a great place to work. Different every day  as far as the requirements of the job. Most of the people you work with are honest and are willing to work with you in a team atmosphere to accomplish any given goal."
good,"Good company to work with.  Diverse with several divisions.  Although certain divisions were closed unexpectedly and without notice, NOV has a lot to offer."
good,"NOV is a place to work,enjoyed my time at NOV."
good,"Excellent employee, exceed expectation, great team work, an employee off the first quarter 2016."
good,"NOV is rather difficult to give a proper review on from my perspective as I started roughly around the time that the downturn started happening. The company consistently claims to be all about its employees but from the employee's perspective it seems all about survival for the company. Which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. "

When I asked him why his words were""I cannot spare you you are my senior employee and are too valuable to me"".

good,"Everyday at work is good , specially when your are busy working on the big orders of our customer. We stay extra hours just to finish the job quick. I am so excited if there is a new revision on other jobs , and this is challenging to my part. i learned a lot from NOV specially when im just starting to build stators, test, weld, crimp and using power tools which before im just looking at it,  and asking myself how to use it. About the place in NOV in Sugarland where i worked at is very convinient, nice people to work with like Supervisors, leadman and co-workers. For me the hardest part of my job is when we have an NCR or rework that the other Mesh up the parts specially if it is a HOTJob.

good,"My position as a Field Service Technician requires being on call 24/7, so work/life balance isn't good if you have a family.  However, the compensation is very good especially for entry level and it is pretty much what you make of it when the market is good.  Work hard/train hard and you will be paid well with excellent perks.  Culturally, this is by far the best employer I have worked for and that means as much as anything especially with the oil market struggling as it is."

good,"A normal day at the office includes completing a daily cycle count on our inventory, processing purchase orders, and completing invoices. When there are no orders to be taken, I spend that free time cleaning and organizing around the office and warehouse. I have learned that the customer is priority number 1. I will always do what is best for the customer as long as it does not violate ANY company policies. My manager has always been slow to speak to insure that the wisest answer is given. The manager also gives every employee an opportunity to ask questions, seek answers, and find solutions to everyday problems. I work with a great team! Everyone I work with has a family like relationship with one another. We get along 99% of the time and we have always got each others backs. Sometimes I feel like we are so close that certain rules or mistakes are looked over because nobody wants to address the problem in fear of creating quarrels. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is keeping myself motivated. I am use to a busy atmosphere and maintaining a full throttle state of mind. Here lately, things have been so slow that it is hard to stay busy all 8 hours of the day. I must say, I enjoy the weekends off and working a steady Mon - Fri 8-4 shift. That allows me to give my family the time they deserve and it also allows me to get a good break from the stress I sometimes deal with at work. The reason why I am looking around for different job opportunities is strictly because of my pay rate. I have been in the inside sales position for almost three years and there has been no"
good,"I have enjoyed working at National Oilwell.  The facility that I work at is a manufacturing division. We manufacture Mud Pumps, Rotary Tables, High Performance Utility(HPU), ADS Drawworks. My plans are to move back to the Lorain-Cleveland Ohio area by the end of the year 2013."

Learning the new software JD Edwards was very interesting to me and I was able to hands on train and work with the inventory to learn the details of our products and every step of how made. Very interesting job.

good,Loved my job and the work I did. My District Manager was the best manager I have ever worked for in my 36 years in the workforce. I would highly recommend working for this company.
good,"It's a great place to work, can start at whatever time I want as long as I'm here for my 8 hours a day. Never had problem with having to take time off or leaving early if an emergency came up. People here are great. Only thing is not too much room to advance and job gets tedious and some what boring- at least in my experience."
good,"I had a great experience working at NOV, learned lots of skills that will help me in the workplace and on a personal level. The hardest part of the jobs is the long hours and the five to six day work schedule. Would recommend this job to anyone seeking an entry level position."
good,"The company provides a good workplace environment with an above average corporate culture. While the culture is above average, there tends to be a silo mentality which promotes segmented groupings."

good,"The job at National OIlwell was to design hydraulic systems for the elevator linkage system. I developed two systems, one rapidly to meet delivery, and another smaller more compact unit to be the production model. The elevators interfacing to this hydraulic system included Varco  and Blohm + Voss elevators. Although no testing was done to validate the system's performance, they seemed to work. A basic regret was the lack of validation."
good,I find NOV is a fair work place and a competitive company to work for. NOV has excellent benefit that employee and family depend on. NOV  have it's own product line and is rate one of the best world wide.

good,"A positive work environment that allows you to grow as much as you want to.  As a mechanical engineer in both new product development and sustaining engineering, it is a great company to work for."
good,"Technically challenging and rewarding, company is the backbone of a flaky, cyclical industry.  Fortunes made today are subject to substantial, often cruel reversals of fortune.  The industry as a WHOLE is volatile and as such job retention can be just as 'here today, gone tomorrow.'  Though work was rewarding, coworkers competent and supervisors OUTSTANDING, top-level managerial decisions are often difficult to cope with as the almighty dollar holds key decision making power when it comes to work and workforce.  This review is not a parable of a particularly good or poor place to work specifically, but a reflection of blue-collar America through the magnifying glass of corporate nepotism and short-sided decision making.  Very lucrative if the industry is good and punishing if it sits any other way.  Good while it lasts."
good,On a typical day as long as you have all your tooling your day would go with no hiccups. Working there I have learned how to run numorous CNC Lathes and some leadman responsibility.
good,"Overall it is good working place. People were very nice, always helpful. The salary was good and there is chances to grow in company. Just work hard,"
good,From top to bottom working there was an awesome experience with top level management. The daily grind of learning new product and assisting vendors made each day enjoyable.
good,"Although my experience at National Oilwell Varco was great and indispensable, it was always work work work. 10 - 12 hour days, always go go go while you're there. They're wasn't much time for a social life. How ever it gave me some great experience. I have now moved back to BC for a little easier of a life style since the Oil industry has taken a dive,"
good,"I've enjoyed my time at NOV, I've learned a lot about working with manufacturing and working own my own on projects. Also learning and gaining experience with AutoCAD and SolidWorks programs. Management was both hands on and hands off. But always available when needed. Everyone was always very helpful, a very good work environment, one of the best I've worked at."

good,"Enjoyed my work environment, safety, benefits and the challenges of the day.  The work orders I received were different and I learned new things which added to my skills;  air and hydraulic lines and controls.  We worked in teams and used the buddy system.  My co-workers were a fun group.  Management was helpful and willing to extend more training, but programs were put on hold because of the oil slump. There was nothing really hard about my job because we had different teams who were specialized in the different areas. I liked going to work to our team environment and welcomed the new day's duties."

Towards my co workers, there's a sound relationship surrounding the workplace. We do communicate clearly as to avoid misunderstandings about work.

good,"I have learned so much from working at NOV, although the market falling didn't help and a lot of knowledge left with it either by early retirement or layoffs and or by just re-organization. A lot of people getting placed in certain segments and upper management was not a good key player to find out if that bucket was the perfect match for the employees, but all in all I would say that it is a good company to work for and a lot of people are there to help you when you need something you just have to ask."
good,"Learned a lot was given chances to advance and move up in the company. Great environment to work, but of course the job security isn't there. Its a oil and gas company and we all know thats not a secure place to work."
good,NOV has provided me with many learning opportunities.  It is a company of integrity.  My job has a lot of variety and challenge.  I have learned to embrace change working at NOV.  The people and location are my favorite part of working at NOV.  The hardest part of the job is losing team mates due to the reduction in force but that is the nature of the oil and gas industry.  It is my desire to retire from NOV.

good,"it is a good place to work with good benefits. slow pace, training,  room for advancement lacking. a typical day work steady flow.

good,"I've been working for NOV for a year now.  Its a great place to work.  Management is great, the hours are a little rough (5am-5pm) but doable, and there is room for advancement.  The only issue I have is that I have been seen as a part-time employee for a year now and have not received any benefits or compensations.

I was personally responsible for creating the situation in which National Oilwell was forced to acquire Dreco since I landed a very large Contract that National Oilwell had been given, and through my efforts, was retracted and given to Dreco."
good,"If you love data entry and continued pressure, this is the dream job for you.  Personal contact is low, no bonuses and very early work hours. Be ready to fight tooth and nail to keep you there if you want to stay working during and OIL & Gas downturn."

good,"I've had 5 jobs in my nearly 50 years.  I thought that NOV was going to be my career employer until I retired.  Unfortunately, along with a large percentage of my division, I was laid off in 2016 when oil prices had been rock bottom for over a year.  I was completely expecting the lay off, and the company even offered me a demotion (with a completely fair compensation package) to stay onboard.  It was my decision to turn that down and leave the company on a high note.  My managers were professional,  consistent and were always willing to coach and mentor.  The job was stressful at times, but with my management team, that was the exception, not the rule.  The hours were long when we were at our peak, but that was what the job required and I accepted that whole-heartedly.  I miss the people that I worked for, and that reported to me the most.  Best group of people that I've ever had the pleasure of working with."

good,Great place to work just the people running it was the problem...
good,"It was a contract position for NOV, to rollout new hardware and software to recently acquired company Wilson. It was well planned, with checklists, bootable USB keys, and test loading before going out on the road. I went to Conroe, TX, St. Louis, Chicago, and downtown Houston.

good,"Good company to work for. Great people and good compensation, benefits and insurance. "
good,Overall great experience. The only drawback is that it is part of the fluctuating oil and gas industry. If NOV was in another industry it would be a place many people could spend many great years working.
good,Pretty easy going place first thing in the morning as long as you made it to work on time. The typical day at NOV would depend on what you had to do that day. Everyone there had various jobs they were required to do. Not just the job you were hired for. I learned about many different oilfield parts and equipment used in the field. The people there are pretty decent to each other. Hard working people just waiting for the bell to tell them it was time to go home. The job really wasn't hard at all. As long as the person paid attention to their surroundings and followed the rules then they were in pretty good shape. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience. From one day to the next you would never know what you would be doing. Sometimes it was a drag and other times it was very enjoyable.
good,"Very fast paced due to orders needing to be shipped out. Learned how certain oil field tools operate and how they are assembled."
good,"Buenos beneficios salariales"

good,"This is were I learned my credit and collections. I liked that I was given the opportunity to learn a new field in finance. The bad part was the pay, it could have been better"
good,"My background in the oil patch started with an office role in a drill bit manufacturing facility and the early days as part of NOV saw the group flourish, with multiple project far and wide offering multiple opportunities for advancement."
good,"25 years of an encounter great advances in growth : in learning of  the business, greater communications with all variety of people, grasping of new ideas, advancement due to experiences, your own willingness, motivations, given opportunities, the can get advancement when others ( even management ) sees your potential, having a open mind that is positive from the start of the day ,until  the end of the day: to keep up each others  morale for the profit of each business day. That was what I saw most of the time from most of the employees ( management on down ). ALL worked basically together, in many trying times ( management on down ). Hardest part of my job was when I could not master some need to do job issues because your team worker has some crisis issues going on in their personal life.Those were times when our economy was really bad for years ... starting in the 80's. The most enjoyable part is where I kept my faith, and knew that each one of who was a part of our company, had a good part and reason for being there. A team!"

good,ES una buena empresa  que le brinda estabilidad laboral a sus empleado si el empleado lo desea
good,"NOV is hands down the best company i’ve ever been apart of and I was very fourtanite to work as many years as I did for such a great company.  The company is succesful because of it’s people, and let me tell you what, they hire outstanding men and women to work for the company. If you are lucky enough to get hired on by NOV, you will without a doubt walk into a building and immediately feel at home."
good,Great company. Began as a temp and was hired as a full time employee a year later. I enjoyed working for them. Had to leave to take care of my Autistic son.
good,"That ' was a good company to work with, good benefit , fair work place , got 401k , health care , dental care , vision , vacations , and some outside activities like free picnic , ect..."
good,"Connected with a number of out of the box thinkers. As a Six Sigma Black Belt, I was involved in a number of process improvement operations. The support was very from mid management. I was given the opportunity to travel and guide suppliers with best practices. Hopefully I will be rehired soon."
good,"they expect a lot from their employees but its easy to get a good raise there, not everyone can get used to the long hours. its something you have to mentally prepare for"
good,"Good place to work, but it is in the Oil Industry and so there can be lay-offs. Reasonable in requesting time off. Good benefits, large company world-wide."

Data entry for shipping and receiving. Very good management, HR, co worker environment."
good,What a wonderful job.  Too bad they downsized and I lost my job and all of my benefits.  It really hurt my family and left us hurting.  Had to search for another opportunity to succeed.

I move up fast and quickly but sometime I don't get enough cross training to move up cause i'm really relied on in my department  i'm that fast to get the job done.  The hardest part of my job is saying is ""NO"" to anyone and other coworker that are not in my department and not staying busy enough. The best part of the day for me is all my orders are out the door and punching out for the day"

good,I have been working at NOV Tuboscope for the last 4.5 years and I have enjoyed working every single day.  In the beginning I wasn't given a lot of responsibility but over the last 4 years I have proven myself as a worthy employee.  I work closely with 6 different departments and each manager is unique.  l enjoy the challenge that I am given.  Everyone is given the opportunity to do their best every day and if you need help you feel you are able to do that.  The hardest part is trying to keep myself busy during the month as the oil industry has become slow.  E

good,"I enjoyed going to work every day. At a time when Oil sector jobs are losing their security, NOV maintained a tradition of investing in technology. I see other oil companies adopting strange work ethics learned from cultures that value the American Worker but can't understand our work culture and destroying productivity as a result, but NOV has maintained the culture it has grown for over a century in the oil industry. Lunches with co-workers were frequent and our department would set up a grill a couple times a month and grill out instead. Employees from other departments were easy to access and frequently helpful. My managers always listened to my suggestions and I felt able to contribute as a result."
good,"I loved my job while working at NOV.  Even though I only have a two year degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology, I was treated as an equal among those who had earned their bachelors.  NOV emphasizes on a teaching environment, optimizing their employees from within to develop quality products.  I loved my coworkers, they were young, eager to learn, and very hard working.  We all adapted to change when needed, because change came often at times.  I loved designing and actually contributing and being part of a team."
good,"Entre sin saber nada de inspección pero me dieron la oportunidad de aprender y saber de que se trataba.La gerencia la ministración excelente "
good,Everyday I would go in and we had a drawer full of jobs that we needed to get done. I would check my dispatch and see what jobs were at the top of the list and make my way down the list.

My co-workers are friendly, and hard-working and management seems to genuinely care about my personal and professional growth.  The most difficult part is probably that the pay is not on point with competitors in the industry, but their benefits are top-notch, and there's a lot to be said about job security and enjoying where you work- money isn't everything."

good,"a 6 in valve was to be assembled and the team was assemble for a detailed presentation of how it is done including the safety precautions to observed. Afterwards we dispatched to our various posts. Each and every member of the team started working on their portion of the whole system. It was assembled and time to be tested.  It was indeed a dangerous task at stake, the hydro-test indeed needed accuracy, not precision. Any shortfall will cause explosion; for a pressure of 23000 HP was to be introduced into the valve to check for leakages. I inspected the whole system carefully and made sure all bolts and nuts were washed and well tightened. I turned the hydro-test machine on and the 23000 HP pressure was introduced into the system. It lasted for 15 minutes and the valve survived signifying its capability to render its intended function to the job market. The final test was to test the scrip, which is the top of the whole body. I injected a pressure of 17000 hp for 5 minutes and it thrive so everything was right on course. the most enjoyable part of the job is the suspense in as to whether or not the valve was rightly assembled and was capable of standing the intended pressures. "

good,National Oilwell Varco is a company where you wake up wanting to come to work.  The people the environment is really a family type of setting which is really rare for a company this size.  The hardest part of the job in my opinion is switching it off and going home because you get so locked in.  No one micro manages you you are left to do your job and are commended when it is done correctly.  The company allows you to move around try different positions and tasks willing to send you to train for certifications and or for job placement.  this company is really a gem and i would work for them again without hesitation.  My only regret is that the market got bad and a lot of us got laid off but that happens. National Oilwell Varco is a top notch company.
