rating,review
bad,"Forum Health was non profit  losing money filed for bankruptcy. Bought by Community Health Systems (for profit) did not make a profit, but at least paid their vendors/bills  tried to make it work.  Steward Health bought and cut all staff that  assisted middle mgmt/employee needs.  Those positions went to a “corporate level” without a plan to make it work"
bad,"Middle Management are henchwomen. They do not even know what the staff does or how the office runs or care if the office runs. They did not pay  bills on time we were constantly having to dodge vendors from shutting off because they were so delinquent. our shedding company stopped picking up for over 2 month, we had boxed of patient information sitting around because they did not pay the bills.  They lie to employees.Told our office the week before Christmas that they were shutting down. Did not have HR to help employees find a new position. Staff has baled out of office and still has over 2 months to run. When CEO was confronted he blamed the Doctor...but he has no clue what they have done and how they lied. They pay well for a reason. Management are Sharks. If you work here go in with eye wide open. worst company in my 28 years of nursing."
bad,Steward health Care is a company that needs alot of work. The company has a long way to go. I don't see this company succeeding anytime soon. Hopefully they can get it together and start treating their employees better.
bad,"This company is terrible.  DO not work for this company. Lack of respect."
bad,"Some flexibility,. Less than desired pay.  Poor management. Fun coworkers that were helpful. As such more challenging opportunities outside of this company."
bad,This not the place to spend your time wirking fir theses people lie ti its nit the wirk they say you will be doing they use you treaten you on job take advantage of you never gives riases just fake fraudulent.
bad,they accuse anyone they want just to be able to let people go and some over the bosses don't even know how to do the job that their in charge of and they will call you over and over again and text you even after you told them that you could not come in.
bad,Have not worked here in more than 5 years. Horrible place to work.  Management does not prioritize patient safety or employees.  I regret not leaving sooner.
bad,"The best people have left...morale is terrible.  You have never seen so many angry people.  No staff, no supplies, no leaders - they leave just as fast - the leaders still there chase the good ones away."
bad,"This was hands down one of the most unprofessional and disorganized hospitals I’ve ever seen. The newer management must’ve come extremely cheap as the inexperience often made the working environment difficult and less safe. There was favoritism and a lot of unscrupulous tactics. Management was only successful at crushing morale, understaffing was a huge issue and not much was done  to rectify the issues. If I could give negative stars I would."
bad,Horrible pay for 18 yrs experience then all other employees got a 3 dollar raise as others got 23 cents..mangment did not care about issues in the lab.
bad,"Vert toxic environment to work in, literally it felt like i was being treated like inmates, too much micromanagement ,uncomfortable environment to work, lack of training. No opportunity to growth, i felt that my intelligence and ability were belittle. Overworked, stressful environment"
bad,"Do not apply to this company, high turnover, poor management and poor work culture. It is unfortunate I wasted my time at this company. You have wait six months to receive benefits"
bad,"It will always be about who you know & not what you know here at Scenic. There is NO room to grow although the opportunity is there. Directors expect the most of everyone below them and fail to realize they're not keeping their end up. As long as you're upper management, you can do/say/go as you please. Just a bunch of favoritism here, so make sure you're friends with the right people to come here. "
bad,This company was the worst place I've worked...the office in Westwood was the most insane group of individuals I have ever came across. Super micro-managers in the Compliance department. The Boston office was a far more laid back and more professional.
bad,"At Steward it's about who you know, favortism. The turnover rate, is poor. Upper leadership does not care about their employees, once you become a target they stick with you until you quit, or they fire you."
bad,"Inexperienced individuals in positions that underscore the point, that titles do not make leaders, behavior does. People confuse Leadership with Boss."
bad,"typical day, up pace,sweat shop,most enjoyable part of the job was the people ,negativity, no positive feedback..lack of direction, excellence with no reward. For meeting your Quality & Quantity quotas allowed to work overtime,six and seven days a week."
bad,This company doesn't pay its employees or vendors well. It puts profits before people. Management hasn't a clue of how to run a business. Patient safety is at risk. Think twice before taking a job there and also seeking care there.
bad,"Management is non existent, we have no leadership.We are left to make critical decisions on our own.Somedays it's so busy we are unable to take a break or l7nch."
bad,"I had high expectations when I started this company and didn’t want to go by hear say. I wish I had something good to say about the company, the morale on the team is just blah! You get talked to like you you are a kid, disrespect d"
bad,"Awful company to work for. Management treats employees badly"
bad,Within the first few weeks they let a very knowledgeable supervisor go with no reasoning. The same followed with several other team members stating it was one thing when in reality it was racism. They don't care about knowledge they want people that will kiss other peoples back sides to keep their jobs.
bad,"The worst management I have ever worked under. Favoritism was a huge role here. I got very little pay for the amount of work I did, was never enough. I think management looked down on younger employees, which I was. Job changed every week and was asked for more than I could do in 8 hours. I ended up leaving because of the amount of work with not enough pay. This company doesn’t have this position in this location anymore, because I would recommend not taking it under the manager."
bad,"It has become apparent that MA corporate jobs are going to Texas. The ""Leadership"" has provided no communication to the departments, and has left the building very uneasy. After years of building up a high performing business office, they will soon look to ship the jobs south. They will of course copy and mimic what we have worked hard to put into place. "
bad,"Dont do it. If you enjoy your life, if you enjoy getting raises, if you enjoy feeling appreciated dont apply here. They invest all this money into ""fixing"" things but not taking care of their employees. Lay offs all the time, budget cuts like crazy. It's just not worth it. Best bet is to steer clear. Rumor has it they will be closing too. And turning it into a surgicenter"
bad,. Seniro Management doesn't have the experience to know that they don't know. A lot of good experienced people leave quickly. Chaos and inexperience. .
bad,"They have ridiculous rules that make no sense. Favoritism abounds. They do not follow laws or their own policies."
bad,"I wouldn’t advise anyone to work here, bullying, targeting and harassment are a part of the daily routine and if you speak out against the perpetrators you become the sacrificial lamb.  The victims end up on the chopping block and the bullies are promoted to managerial positions (even though they are on “indefinite written warming”).  What a joke!  This place is full of liars from Human Resources to the staff you work with.  Spineless Supervisors who are unprofessional and speak badly with the employees about your co-workers and their directors, etc.  At the end of the day this place is full of back stabbing liars who can’t mind their business if their lives depended on it.  Jealous and spiteful people are who are anxious to point out your mistakes to overshadow theirs!  If you are smart pursue a different dream like becoming an Uber or Lift Driver, your chances of survival a greater and peace of mind comes easy!"
bad,Dont apply here!! This company is horrible. All upper mgmt needs to be fired. The director Brandy plays favorites daily and is a compulsive liar.  Completely unprofessional work environment.
bad,"There is little to no management, no sense of working together, constantly short handed due to a md who grabs Medical assistants and yells at them in front of patients. Manager is dishonest as well as divisive. Stress and pay do not coincide"
bad,Sr. Management is unorganized with creativity and moving forward in the 21st century with processes. They tend to lie to just about everyone to bring you on board. People employed with company often complain about being deceived about growth possibilities and salary.
bad,"I worked here for about 2-1/2 years. Management was horrible. Never a manager around when you needed something. Hospitals are filthy. Plan on getting at least one call a day to cover shifts on your days off or during your vacation when you are thousands of miles away. Asked to work 18 hour shifts and then treated badly when you were too exhausted or had plans and couldn’t pick up extra hours for them. Yet taken for granted when you did pick up extra hours/shifts. Managers had their favorite employees and they were definitely treated as such. The favorites were allowed to come in late everyday, disappear from the floor for hours at a time, and were not required to follow policy and procedure. It was a very cliquey place to work, which adds a whole new level of anxiety to an already stressful job. Most shifts I was asked to care for more patients than we were supposed to have. There were never enough nurses or aides on duty. You run from the moment you get there until you manage to get out the door (sometimes hours after your shift ended). Tons of drug seeking patients here. They will admit any patient who refuses to leave the ED. This has a lot to do with the fact that they are a private hospital and don’t have to follow the same admittance standards as other facilities. Lots of nice employees but management couldn’t care less about employees. If you attempt to call in sick with a contagious illness they will tell you to come in anyway and wear a mask. Oh, but make sure you don’t tell your patients you are sick tho because that “looks bad”."
bad,"Multiple turnovers w/ management and supervisors.  Many great employees with many years of clinical experience and long history w/ company were let go/fired. Supervisors promoted that have no clinical background or experience.  Managers have lack of knowledge of patient care, no compassion for patients."
bad,"Unprofessional, unwilling to accept feedback. Used complaints against you.  Nepatism, manager would hire relatives or close friends to sabbotage other employees."
bad,"The place is not organized,too much work even at night shift .And they pay you 15 dollars with the differentiate.People who works there ,are there for ages and dont like to change a thing and get mad if u try to change them."
bad,"A typical day at Iasis... No work. I sat there for eight hours. A lot of down time. "
bad,This is an awful place to work. Pay way below average and the company keeps you at part-time (under 36 hours) in order to not give benefits. The work environment is not ideal. The hospital does not have the funds to help their patients. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The cars in the parking lot tend to get broken into during the day and the company doesn't try to prevent this or set up security.
bad,"Worked in the psych unit for less than 3 months, nothing but problems from getting ahold of HR even prior to starting. Never in my life have I hated a job so much."
bad,Worked in behavioral. Administration is so worried about $$$ they take patients who should be in a PICU. This is a danger to staff and other patients. Acuity and patient load (often 8 pts) is too high and management does not care. Staff is overworked because applicants who do apply never accept employment!!!
bad,"This company put dollars over patient care. Constant layoffs, and no support from senior management or senior leadership.  The staff was rude to each other and to patients.  They constantly broke the rules, and created a hostile work culture."
bad,"Horrible management, horrible directors, you gamble with your license every single day, understaffed, and horrible ER providers.  Racist, sexist, ect."
bad,"Please do your homework for any position you're looking into with this company. The number of recurring vacant positions, including those of higher level management, should be your first indication that this is not a place for long term job satisfaction or security."
bad,"To have been working in a great environment with a great boss where things are running smoothly to Iasis PAYING another company to come completely mess it all up! We lost patients, physicians and good employees all in one swoop and now what? It's even worse than before if that is possible. Sometimes you should pay attention to what IS working. Inexperienced CEOs!! "
bad,"Poorly run, unsafe, and dirty, lack of resources.  Stay away. The doctors and nurses are not very bright and have poor results."
bad,"They hire you then add more work load without compensating you for it. No raises given pay rate is more for someone with zero experience in the health field. As well no room for growth in the company, Management is very poor with lack of communication , Then to add they tell employees "" you are replaceable"" in which is unprofessional."
bad,"Management sucks."
bad,"•	 Assist with daily activities and personal care."
bad,Company does not invest in their employees/technology or facilities. There is no reward and recognition for team members Very low morale.
bad,*open safes for daily deposit
bad,This company could be so great and there could be so many opportunities. Working in the cardiac Cath Lab at Rockledge regional was awful management was completely disorganized leaving the staff overworked. There is a lot of politics played. Stressful going into work and leaving work and there’s no support from management whatsoever. Manager and director both have no idea what’s going on in the lab nor how to manage it.
bad,Staffing is terrible one CNA on a 19-22 bed Telemetry Unit. And some of the nurses don’t even get up to help you answer a call light . Most of the nurses walk around with head phones on lllistening to music
bad,"If considering working at Steward, look elsewhere. Stay away. Worst place I have ever worked. Steward is only about the $ they can make. Management is beyond terrible. Pay is bad, ask for a good starting salary, you will not get any good raises after that. Only good part was the co workers."
bad,"Profit over people (patients & employees). Simply doesn’t matter what skills or knowledge you have working here, only thing that matters is that you’re in the right circle. You have job security only if you’re good friends with the CEO or kiss up to the “right people.” Lack of respect from about 75% of the employees here. Mainly the directors. This facility needs to clean house with upper management, but they never will. Zero accountability for those with a “higher title.” Huge opportunity cost working here, nobody is willing to invest time or effort to teach or even communicate with you correctly so you can get your job done. High turnover rates in every department, especially in admissions/registration. However upper management fails to see the root cause of it all & constantly fails to place the blame where it needs to be. For these reasons & many other more, this facility will continue to receive the reputation it receives. For these reasons, patients seek care at other facilities."
bad,Horrible management! Unorganized! Oh and please don’t actually go in with any knowledge they will find a way to fire you due to intimidation.. from the directors to lower level management this place is a joke! If you have other options trust me take them !
bad,"Horrible place to work. Building is dirty, constantly running out of toilet paper. Bug traps underneath the desks. Rug stains everywhere. Micro-managed like crazy. Employees come and go like you’ve never seen before. Was told about a lay off 3 months ago that was called off 2 weeks prior. Not fair to the employees one bit- people’s livelihoods are at risk and they have no care in the world. No incentive to want to stay there. "
bad,"No leadership, have cut staff to the bare minimum. Healthcare is not a priority for management and it show. Very monetary oriented, The staff is not treated well nor are they respected."
bad,"Although i was trained to do job and learned skills to do the job, it was a rough experience. There were countless one sided attempts for me to have to make adjustments, when few were made from an employee stand point. The work culture wasn't the best. Everyone was afraid to lose their job. "
bad,"Horrible management, unrealistic expectations of work deadlines. Upper management has no idea of what's going on. Lay off's happen daily and no reason given. Supervisors are sleeping with leads, directors are leading blindly with no experience. They lie to AHCCS and Medicare about processes and structure w/in the company. Stay away from this company. Its not worth the dysfunction that goes on behind closed doors."
bad,"Southwest General Hospital is not concerned with the wellbeing of staff nurses just monthly score sheets. The patient to nurse ratio’s are way too high and there is no change in sight. During interviews will tell you 5 to 1, and you’ll be at 7 to 1 almost always. They have major turnover problems and administration doesn’t care because they are happy in their jobs."
bad,Food preparation coming from the kitchen wasn't consistent.  There were different cooks cooking the food differently than the others. Customers and most of all staff coming to expect one thing for dinner and getting something that tasted totally different than the other time it was on the menu.
bad,"Constant Chaos"
bad,"I worked for Steward for 6 years before i quit. I never had the same director for more than a year before they got ""laid off"" or were pushed out. High turnover rate for presidents, managers, administration, and nurses. Unsafe practices in the OR resulting in further illness for some patients (referring to specific incidents) Steward as a whole is seemingly worried about making money, not patient care. It was always a running joke among my colleagues about how Steward was like the parasite and its hospitals were the host. I was promised raises, never saw any. I was promised a better work environment, promised I would get a manager, I never got one. There's more wrong with Steward Healthcare than I have characters allotted in this review space, so i'll end with this: By the time I submitted my 2 weeks notice, my family, friends, and loved had all expressed their care and concern for my unhappiness and mistreatment with my job. I rarely give up on anything and I saw quitting as giving up until I finally left. I should've left way sooner. Steward does not care about it's employees or patients. It's a front. Be warned."
bad,"I recently departed from Steward. It was by far the most toxic, hostile work environment I have ever experienced. The Payroll Manager is unprofessional and unethical. The department is being lead by a clown. And Upper Management tolerates this type of behavior."
bad,"It's all about the money not patients or employees. Phoenix Director has no clue just like the non educated ""manager"". I've never seen a company dismantle clinics, patients, employees, and finances the way this company has under it's current management."
bad,Review all of the information about the company prior to accepting a offer. Understand what you are signing up for and accept a offer only if you have to. Things are not what they seem. And are very deceptive.
bad,High turnover for new hires. Lack of training. They schedule you for mostly midnights when you are told you are hired for all 3 shifts. You also work every other weekend 12 hour shifts both days and can't use vacation time for any weekends off. Lack of help when finished with training. You will be doing procedures that you probably shouldnt be doing once they train you.
bad,"Awful management.  You are not allowed to speak for yourself and think for yourself. Expectation is that you do what you’re told period. Don’t ever think that you matter, you never will. It’s a daily battle and it WILL wear you down. Women do NOT empower women, you can forget that. Fake and bad attitude by upper management. Management actually bring in friends and WILL push you out. Yes for real."
bad,"Didn't feel valued as an employee there; no raises or bonuses. Very little room for advancement. Upper management issues. The only ""plus"" was great co-workers and flex time schedule."
bad,I think this is a terrible place to work. Manager shows favoritism for employees whom have worked for him in the past. The Dept can’t keep a Nurse Manager because of bad relationship
bad,This company is horrible! They do not care at all about their employees. You get no support from management if you are having any work related issues. They expect you to continue working in hostile work environments.
bad,The company took over Sebastian Medical and it was a nightmare.  They over worked employees and did not give office manager the help to run their office properly.  They did not provide staff mostly MA's for the physicians and allowed the physician's to miss treat their staff.  The upper management (directors and up) did nothing to help improve the work environment in the physicians offices.  Everything was blamed on the office managers when they could not improve anything with out the resources they needed to run their office properly.
bad,"This is the bottom of the barrel place to work.  They hire people that pass the mirror test, trained or not.  They don’t drug test either.  Patient care is the last on their list of important things, the first is to get their money and how can they get even more!  I’ve seen untrained “nurses"" in clinics administer near lethal doses of medications because they weren’t professionally trained nor certified.  Management is a joke!  They won’t do anything except fuss at you for calling the so called “anonymous compliance line” to report wrong doings even if you’ve complained for months about the inept helpers!"
bad,The place is moving to Texas and they are laying a bunch of employees off at the corporate office. There is no human resources person. the managers treat employees like robots.
bad,"Management is ridiculous, if you annoy them too much then your fired.. regardless of how well you do on the actual job. There are no set policies in place, going to the managers was a waste of time, 9 times out of 10 their answers are wrong! There’s constant miscommunication, mainly with management. Due to them buying out a company they’ve been behind, but for almost 2 years, it seems like a joke. Due to this, irate vendors are laughed at and mocked when asking about payment from 6+months prior, management prefers for staff to take the heat then them. Who gets hired and fired is based on if they are controllable, not so much their experience. There is so much work that should require a higher pay. The temp agencies show more appreciation then Stewards own staff. It’s just not a good environment, there is no reason to hate coming into work everyday because of management but not able to male the change. Just replace all of management and all is forgiven!"
bad,"I honestly had a terrible time working here. I signed a contract to work 9 to 5 and the director of IS (IT Help Desk) tried switching my hours against what we agreed upon. "
bad,"Work on a team of good people, hard workers.  Unfortunately Steward doesn't appreciate that.  No reviews, no raises and upon the new year starting they have taken away 3 holidays.  A slap in the face to the employees who worked so hard during 2018 calendar year to bring many new hospitals live on MEDITECH."
bad,"Horrific place to work.  ""Managers' and ""leaders"" are not allowed to manage or lead.  patients 2 sick 2B cared for by new nurses-no mentoring whatsoever.  orienteton not as described-hosp has no regard for there employees-horrific in every possbl way-pay,bosses,work load,bennies."
bad,"If you think this is the place to be think again. The lack of management and structure is baffling. I have worked for various practices and this was by far the most unorganized, unprofessional place I have ever been. Work load gets doubled if you are a good employee and the others just sit around and come and go as they please. I highly recommend you keep looking. They paint a pretty picture at first but then you learn the hard way. Turn over is HORRIBLE and for a reason."
bad,"Steward seems to be run by a bunch of intellectually arrogant bullies. They are convinced that they know the best way to run a health plan despite that fact that they've never run a health plan.  This seems to be leading to the rapid demise of the Health Choice (the health plan they acquired).   Some days, I seriously wonder if their goal is actually to self-destruct. With management choices this poor, the only logical explanation can be that this is intentional corporate suicide."
bad,"Management sucks and the workload is very very stressful. You will learn a lot but  the Hospital is horrible, it should have been called a nursing home."
bad,"very stressful "
bad,"Desert Grove Family Medical is under Steward Healthcare. I would not recommend working here unless you would like to be taken advantage of as an employee. You are underpaid and the office staff is in and out so often that front office does not flow. I am in a higher position than most, and a lot of my co-workers make more than me. I have addressed many situations and they never get taken care of. If I do get a reply I have to push it or address it well over 15 times for something to even happen, and once it hits that point it has already been 3-4 months past the situation in the first place. Any other place under Steward Healthcare I would recommend, employees elsewhere enjoy their jobs, I am looking elsewhere as well. I love what I do at the office, but I will not tolerate being treated poorly. As soon as I am able to find another job I am out of here. Along with many of my co-workers in my same position as well as other positions. You cannot  live off of the pay here, if you don't have bills to pay and you like getting taken advantage of then by all means go for it and gain the experience! I go home crying at least 2-3 times a month. Another thing is you are not able to communicate with your co-workers or you get in trouble by your manager ( your managers don't answer you when you have questions though)."
bad,"When I began my career with Steward there was a great legal team in place. However, that ended once the new GC and his team were brought in. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Sorry"
bad,"Manager tells everyone's business, you shouldn't know what everyone is getting paid or their personal business. Pay is horrible no room to grow within the company. Management does not listen to your concerns they always dismiss them. You get a week or 2 of training n you're not fully trained correctly, you pretty much learn on your own"
bad,"I work in dietary, we have been short a prep person since before I arrived 1.5 years ago, have received several warnings over my inability to get my job done on time, well either hire help or leave me alone, well they hired cooks and a prep person, since I have been out, and they still can’t get the food ready, but I had to do it myself!"
bad,I recommend not waisting your time with something you'll be emberassed to put on your resume. I would not recommend outside partnerships with this company nor utilizing their facilities and services. The people in leadership are not experienced in policy and it's merely the blind leading the blind. Management once told me to encourage me *foolish* that working at Steward was like flying a plane and building it at the same time. Now how idiotic is that. But she certainly was CORRECT a crash waiting to happen. And trust me there's no parachutes. Save yourself and your career.
bad,"All upper management lacks experience and skill as pertains to revenue cycle management. Company lacks structure and any know how. Will hire anyone. If you actually HAVE KNOWLEDGE of your position this is not the place for you. If you feel management should actually LEAD, this is not the place for you. Manager of Cash is a male chauvinist. And seems to have lucked up on a management position. No one in this company can help you with any question you may have. And if you pose a concern, you can't trust anyone to express it to."
bad,"When looking for a new career, this is not the place to shop. This corporation was the worst experience of my career. This is an environment that condones and allows bullying by upper management, therefore local management assumes the same attitudes and behaviors. They bought the facility I worked for from another corporation just as shady and have progressively destroyed the hospital's reputation within the community and with physicians. Relationships with local administration, staff and physicians are nothing but negative. Staffing is compromised in every unit of the hospital and this is reflected in what is becoming a catastrophic decline in census and embarrassing reviews on social media. They keep laying off people with no intention of replacing them. There's nothing in place for retention of good employees and never any reward for exceeding expectations. When there isn't a layoff or a threat of a layoff, newer and long term employees are looking for any excuse to leave. Local administrative personnel are the perfect minions for a larger corporation with deteriorating morals."
bad,"overwork with managers that should be directors, managers report to vp directly no director. job advertisement is misleading, they should hire analyst"
bad,"Management has everyone in the building on a write up, people are constantly spying on you it is a terrible working environment.  They discourage you from making friends with your co-workers.  They only move around favorites to desired positions."
bad,"There's a reason why there's high turnover.  On the other hand, there are some employees that have been here since the beginning of time and they're just waiting for retirement.  Miserably waiting."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is getting my work done in a timely with support. Listening, caring and meeting my patients needs is one of my enjoyable momen at work."
bad,The kitchen is a very hostile work environment! The 2 female “managers” are directly attached to the click of women that make it impossible for any staff to come to work and do their job peacefully. The favoritism they show is completely inappropriate for anybody of management status to display. Your scheduled shifts are changed the day before or even the day of!
bad,"At first the job was great.  But upper management revamped & the work atmosphere, along with morale, declined.  It seemed like I could not do anything right so was called into the office & told I had an attitude problem.  Just got tired of wondering when I would get fired.  The day I was fired, there were two others fired also.  The stress was gone.  I would not recommend anyone work for this company.  Not employee friendly."
bad,"If you are an outgoing, collaborative person with ideas and a strong, positive, management style...you will not fit in. This company fears change, prioritizes money, not people (the end user). Overall a negative experience, however, I learned a lot about who I am and what can be personally tolerated. "
bad,"Was thrown into position without knowing what my responsibilities were."
bad,Management is constantly on your back about production numbers. One on one meetings with management became a weekly harassment meeting regarding personality traits of each worker.
bad,great and enjoyable place to work.  Team environment and co workers were always willing to answer questions and help.  Management was involved and wanted you to succeed.
bad,"Easton Hospital was owned by Steward Healthcare as of 05/01/2017"
bad,"Management has no sense of direction and does not care about employees. Unethical accounting seems to be normal. There is no culture, no job security."
bad,"Management is horrible, even the C suite. We had a horrible manager who did nothing but make the job is bad environment . No one listens when people complain. Even down to the human resources team no one cares."
bad,"Steward is a for-profit company & that is the only thing they care about, making money for their upper management. They purchased our hospital & destroyed it by cutting staff & eliminating services.   The typical day is very stressful. RNs had 5-6 patients who were usually very ill. No breaks, often no lunch. Run for 13 hours straight. Very short-staffed all the time. They got rid of unit secretaries & went down to one social worker & one transporter for entire hospital. We were lucky to have one aide on unit for up to 20 patients. Constantly running out of supplies & linen. They ran the hospital into the ground & closed after only 17 months."
bad,"I worked at Steward for 4 1/2 years and was let go the end of April 2018.  Although we were really understaffed and extremely busy there was no support from management.  Instead everyone in my department was written up I eventually asked them to let me go as the work was to much for 3 people and the management goals were unobtainable although the upper management did not know our job we were always tasked with projects upon projects that had nothing to do with provider enrollment.  you only get promoted if you knew the right people same people got promoted over and over again."
bad,"If you value work - life balance, do not work here. The fast paced cut throat environment is toxic and suffocating, I wouldn't recommend this position to anyone I knew personally."
bad,Working in the Corporate IS setting is very stressful. They set unrealistic deadlines and do not communicate with the staff. Lately the hardest part of the job is coming in everyday trying to find a reason why I shouldnt quit.
bad,Company has ran out all good I experienced staff and good managers were let go for standing up for employees.  Company is not concerned about low wages across most departments and morale is terrible
bad,"At this location in Richardson, TX the stress level is extremely high, due to poor management and the feeling you'll be the next to be walked out for no valid reason.  I was told I wasn't allowed to have an opinion by a Director....what kind of leadership disvalues an employee at that level?  They encourage you to be an automaton, and discredit you at the slightest  idea of improvement.  I was excited to join this group and watch something new come to fruition, but there is no encouragement to become part of a team, to learn or grow."
bad,Steward healthcare is cheap and don’t want to pay there employees what ether hospitals make. Manager is awesome and co workers.  The health insurance is  terrible !!!
bad,"this is a 100% toxic environment and will drain your personality dry. Management is awful and they never follow protocol. the pay rate here doesn't compare to the work you do. I can't stress this enough, reframe from sharing your personal life. Please listen when I say this, if you are really considering applying to this facility DON'T."
bad,NOT A good place to work. Management keeps changing. There is lot of employee turnover rate. Decide yourself if you really want to work there.
bad,Management isn't good.No room for growth unless you're close with management.The staff is wonderful the ones who are still there..Because of management alot of people left and got new jobs
bad,"The management is only looking out for themselves to cut staff and when the supervisor does, management questions everything you do. The staff are rude and disrespectful. This place is evil."
bad,"Steward has grown too quickly and it not engaged in the success of their employees. While the company could change for the better, it would likely require management changes. Most management seems to be more concerned about theirselves instead of their employees. They frequently take credit for their employees work instead of rewarding their employees with a simple compliment and sharing in their success. I would avoid working for Steward until significant changes are made at the top."
bad,"Worked there for several years, and learned that policies are haphazardly followed, there is favoritism, and they do not operate with a team approach to caring for patients. The director has no contact with the clinicians, it is often difficult to collaborate with the nurses, and the clinical supervisor takes a micromanagement approach and does not support the staff. There were safety issues as a well due to reliance on hospital security to manage patients escalating. The hardest part of the the job is working in a vacuum without support or appreciation for the challenges present. The most enjoyable part would be direct contact with the patients."
bad,"Large hospital that is revenue focused. None of the senior level management has a healthcare background, getting permission to change or purchase anything has to have revenue generating applications."
bad,"Ineffective management makes hollow promises of advancement potential and then cuts you down to cover themselves when their own poor decisions fail"
bad,Communication and job security are very bad. There is no organizational chart. It is hard to understand their processes. They are behind in many areas of their business.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"I worked in the Home Care Division 9 yrs.  When calling out sick, we were interrogated about the reason for the sick call & asked to make up the sick day by working on the weekend, or next scheduled day off.  As a result I stopped calling out.  I went to work sick & finally left the company with 173hrs of sick time on the books which I was told I could not use or cash out so they were just forfeited.  When I resigned I had finally just had enough of being given a greater distance to travel daily, then having to come home at night to complete documentation for another 3-4hrs.   I had the most seniority on my Team, but was increasingly given last preference for scheduled time off, even with asking for summer or holiday time off months in advance. The compensation seems good until you factor in all the time you spend on the phone or at home completing documentation.  There ends up being no balance between work & home life.  Family time suffers, as well as your health & general happiness.   As Clinicians we strive to provide excellent care to our Patients, but it cannot be done at the risk of our own health & well being.  Having a Director that has no Interpersonal skills or Managerial Training & yet remains in the position after numerous resignations of Skilled Clinicians in hard to fill positions, reinforces the belief that it’s all just about the bottom line.  There are positions posted frequently because Nursing & Rehab Staff retention is still horrible for all the same reasons as I have heard first hand.  I left Steward 4yrs ago and was recently asked to fill a Contract position,"
bad,"Very busy and frequently stressful acute care hospital on the south side of San Antonio, Texas. While all staff is very supportive of one another and those coming from outside agencies, we are regularly understaffed, the management is very authoritative, and it is apparent that this organization is not willing to invest resources to retain the best employees."
bad,"Was amazing when I started, then the company started buying bad hospitals and it has not recovered since."
bad,"Once hired, your pay kind of gets stuck unless you move up the management ladder. But I see management and I feel the company abuses their time at home."
bad,"Steward made promises they didn’t keep. After CHS cut services and staff they swore they would expand, but they continued to cut. The night shift was lucky to have two PCA’s in the entire hospital and if they were on a 1:1  too bad. RN’s had to run labs , clean instruments, take the cart to SPD leaving the floor even shorter because if these things had to be done. There was no extra pay for taking on these responsibilities and management did not care at all."
bad,"This company was one of my worst career experiences. The building is nice and there were some good people who worked there but unfortunately, everyone trying to leave so it says a lot."
bad,"Management is awful, they don’t care for employees what so ever. I was the only tech for over a year and a half, not even making $11/hour, and when I asked for a raise their response was “it’s not a career position.” I worked with some awesome people from multiple departments, and no one seemed too happy while at work. Honestly the company as a whole is rated at like a 2.5 and I think that says it all. Cool perks getting tickets to games and shows but other than that I wouldn’t work here."
bad,"The company is expanding quickly and has multiple divisions, locations and positions. The rapid expansion along with lack of communication has affected the culture."
bad,"I worked as a CNA at Sebastian River Medical Center which is a Steward Health Care owned company. The turn over rate on the PCU floor was unbelievable. We were always short staffed and over worked, Cnas and nurses. Which put the staff and the patients in danger. They hardly gave raises and when they did it was a joke. Everything was always chaos."
bad,"I worked here for 2 1/2 years on PRN position in PBX position I was an excellent employee. I never got a bad review, I was never once late and only called in sick one day in 2 1/2 years. The management here is very unprofessional the PBX area falls under Security and to my point of view was never managed properly. I felt like I was in high school again. Such games and favoritism. Different rules for different people. There was no one to turn to. They have so many employees going in and out of there you would there you would think someone would notice maybe it's a management problem! Oh well just my opinion."
bad,"The days at work are never routine, and are ever changing.  The system as a whole is changing which has been a difficult part of the every day view of hospital"
bad,"Terrible company to work for, especially corporate. I was much happier working inside the hospital. Working for the corporate office is very depressing. Steward is so behind in claims and revenue compared to other healthcare organizations and expects you to resolve claims from 5 years or more. There is no diversity really no people of color in high paid positions. There are no merits unless you work in finance. "
bad,There is a lot of turnover here because employee expectations and workloads are unrealistic.  People are pushed to the edge and it is difficult to have a good work/life balance.
bad,"Opened the cafeteria grill making typical American breakfast foods. They included but were not limited to pancakes, French Toast, hash browns, bacon and sausage."
bad,It was a good place to work mannegment was not so good not good communication and they will not give you chance to advance they will want to keep in one job no cross training and it was a okay place to work but I learned a lot from that place thank full to had started to work there there was people that help a lot.
bad,typical work week for a consultant is 60 hours. Steward will only pay you for 40 hours. very poor communication from Sr Managements and typically unrealistic expectations.
bad,"Steward would rather hire new employees with no experience and pay them the minimum wage for that postions. Senior employees are expected to train these new employees, for very little compensation.  there is no room for advancement in certain postion. Management is very unsuported towards the staff. This hospital is all about money. They veiw patient care as an assembly line. Patient are raipidly pushes though the system, to make room for the next pateint."
bad,"If you are desperate, quiet and submissive, willing to work hard for very little, do not need compliments, don't have any ideas for growth, enjoy micromanagement and can tolerate a political management environment, from management  this would be an ideal job for you.  The employees are great.  The management needs much improvement.  .  The are very numbers driven and find ways to make you work harder while sitting around chatting with their clicks.  They lead with a pen and not by example,"
bad,"The job itself has tought me alot to live by. I have learned a number of different things It is a good opportunity. The members that I speak to on a daiy basis can sometimes be not so great and others can be awesome and it just makes it all worth working for because you never know how the days going to go once you take that very first call to the very last call. It differs everyday, and thats the most exciting part of working here."
bad,"Management hostile, unfriendly and have no control over staff."
bad,I took the job in Steward as an advancement of my accounting career and am ready to take more responsibilities. It does not turn out well as the transition does not happen.
bad,"Very few benefits, difficult management, and understaffed in many departments. Several departments and key individuals were eliminated when they took over IASIS."
bad,"Compensation is low.  No matter how hard or how much effort you put into work, merit increase does not go by your input of your work.  Everyone get the same amount of increase. This make lots of people don't put more effort into their work."
bad,I was there only a year but had to cut the cord to pursue opportunities better aligned with my experience and qualifications. The work life balance was in desperate need of improvement.
bad,Steward offers competitive salaries/benefits. Fairly nice coworkers. Management tends to lack experience. Strict when taking breaks/vacations. Vacation/Sick days DO NOT roll over to the next year. I found the HR staff to be unpleasant and unhelpful.
bad,"A small fish in a shark tank. One minute you had a job, and the next someone from Corporate came down and without any knowledge or questions, you were terminated."
bad,"Corporate culture. Patient care not main concern from upper managment. Not enough staff, sick patients to manage. No incentives including raises, paid holidays, etc."
bad,"I worked here for a year. Our team never met, and our boss was non-existent. He lived 5 minutes away and worked remotely, and I drove in 2 hours each way for a Senior Level position that I could have done 100% remote... especially since I never saw nor interacted with anyone on my team. Work within teams was siloed, as was work among the whole organization. I never felt there was any desire or concern from upper management to coalesce the team under a unified vision. They attempt to skimp on resources, then expect their good employees to fill in the void. "
bad,I personally would not recommended anyone to work at this facility. You get overworked and shown no appreciation for your efforts. Work should be pleasant not constantly stressful and have so much divide among staff.
bad,Great co-workers. Limited decision making opportunities.  Frequent turnover of executive and senior staff which limited ability to move forward with individual goals.
bad,"The people in my department is the most enjoyable part of the job.  With the new acquisitions, changes, moving the headquarters to the Dallas area, the departments that are affected and has disrupted their operations.  The workplace has become unknown, because of the sudden withdrawal out of the state."
bad,"Every day I worked at the Front desk, Greeted the mail man and Deliveries of supplies ect. The people were pleasant to work with, we moved to new System that made things Easier to process. Took calls from Patients on bills, collected Insurance info, Did payments, did Discount adjustments. Transferred credit from one account to another of patients accounts. Did financial aid applications, collected income info sent to the Hospital CFO, then sent letters to the patients with the Decision from the CFO. Added Insurance and billed out."
bad,"Training wasn't great. I was at the company for only 4 months and i was training team new employees. Company is very stressful to work for because they are so behind in billing. This is a company that likes to micromanage. Supervisor will breathe over your back to make sure your doing your work, which is uncomfortable in opinion. Im not sure if its just this office i work at or how the company is as a whole."
bad,Corporate C suite erratically demands information with typically end of day notice to deliver on demands. large ranging strategic and financial decisions will be made on a whim and changed just as quickly.
bad,Since Steward Healthcare bought our local community hospital they are only interested in making money and not with the patient care experience  and the safety of the patients and the staff.
bad,They gave hardly any training on the computer or with the duties of the job.  Were at times very hard to work with.  The teams did not work well together at times.
bad,"Company is in a downward spiral....we were told that our jobs were secure for a year during/after the acquisition, major layoffs four months later.  Dishonest."
bad,"New England Sinai Hospital was a medicore place to work as it was recently taken over by a large coporate for-profit company with little emphasis on quality of care. Staffing ratio was 6:1 with many very sick patients who needed more time consuming care. At night and on weekends there was only one attending doctor working, and it was difficult to obtain written orders when patients needed something  that was not ordered upon admission. Staff worked together well, but most times there just didn't seem to be enough help and support."
bad,My typical day at work is managing a staff of 50 people. I participate in quality and risk activities daily. I have learned a great deal at the company and appreciate their leadership style. The hardest part of my job is relying on others to complete their tasks and sometimes criticaly think about outcomes. I enjoy the challenge to motive and inspire in this direction.
bad,Phoenix St. Luke's Hospital was acquired by Stewart Health Care approx. 2 years ago and will now be closing in Nov. 2019.  Laboratory management provided great mentoring and personal development opportunities.  The quality of laboratory services was continuing to improve during my time there.
bad,"The office was wonderful to work at. Many scheduling issues that were not realistic to work with. Not enough rooms, staff, or physicians to accommodate the patient load on a daily basis."
bad,The full time peers & coworkers are awesome!  Upper management is horrible & they make poor decisions.  It almost seemed like they intentionally tanked the company to sell off.
bad,Offers opportunity for earning CE's. Liked my coworkers. Hardest part of job was lack of training and lack of responsibility for safety of employees.
good,If you want to make some extra money you better have your numbers up as far as productivity or you cannot do any overtime.  You have to ask if you can do it before you can stay late.
good,Not a great place to work and they don't treat their employees very well.
good,"Fun environment when your around the other employees. The managers are ok, but they aren't very family oriented when it comes to family emergencies."
good,"nice place to work, not enough work, great place to get experience to start.  I have been PRN for six years, I would like a full time position"
good,I finally got promoted after 5 years of working in the same position. Only after they hired 2 other people before me to just have those 2 quit. Once I finally got promoted they still did not pay me what they hired people off the street for.
good,"you will gain great experience and freedom to explore areas that interest you.  However you will be a pawn to management who will state ""We didn't budget for salary advancement, we'll see what we can do next year"""
good,"Wadley in Texarkana was Great! Rarely short-staffed, adequate orientation, great place to work. Glenwood in West Monroe, LA not so much. Frequently short-staffed, departments did not work together, manager was rude (yelling/screaming at employees), patient safety was a daily issue, impossible to change departments without retaliation."
good,Very low pay for expectations. No room for growth. Lots of promises for growth but only promote friends and family.  No regular yearly reviews.  No real HR dept.
good,Overall its a decent place to work. However  the work life balance is not something that I can rave about. Working every weekend doesn't give you much of a work life balance at all
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but when it came down to politics and management, there was just horrible communication. "
good,"Process referrals, Schedule appts, Phone Triage"
good,Workplace culture regularly expects 50 plus hours per week without any additional compensation or benefit incentives. Executive  management seems disjointed most times.
good,"Steward is currently in growing pains mode while structuring the organization to a new corporate parent."
good,The PTO Holidays and Sick time are all in one bucket. They have high expectations to reach goals that are Unrealistic and goal changes  weekly. Makes it hard to do your job well.
good,"The parent company while I worked there was too focused on squeezing every dollar out of the place.  I hear it has changed, that is good.  Local leadership was always changing and there seemed to be a lot of instability at the hospital and the sister hospitals.  I hear it is better now."
good,Inefficient work flow making for stressful environment. While the department is staffed with excellent  technologist the department supervisor has no Nuclear Medicine experience and that lack of experience leads to poor policy making.
good,Not enough staffing. Was great until steward took over. Mangement isnt all that great either. never taking complaints serious enough and it is a shame because it takes a tole on our patients
good,"No interactions from the Director, and the director let the coworkers go workout and continue their 2 job while still on time at Iasis Healthcare"
good,"I have found this employer do not have the management that is needed to succeed in a hospital setting.  They tell you one thing and then there is no follow through.  The management will circulate a letter with changes without any reason to change.  Only circulates to a few people, then when questioned will say they are only thinking of the change."
good,"A pleasant place to work,that has recently under gone a business restructuring. The hospital itself has been in business for over 150 years as a non profit organization it has recently been sold to the Steward Corporation and is being run as a for profit organization."
good,Non stop day
good,Company is laying off people without any severance pay. Company was a nice place to work I want time now very stressful because you don't know if you're going to get laid off or not
good,Management was never around and they didn’t know their job and not qualified.  Can be a good thing or bad thing.   When you needed help or had a question there wasn’t anyone to help.
good,"This is a very intense and chaotic environment. It's really a hit or miss in terms of what leadership style you're direct supervisor will have. Seemed to be a culture of fear from the top down, not the best."
good,"I like to work in an institute that has a diverse group of passionate change-makers, creative fixers and relentless advocates, and strive to improve the health and wellness of the world’s most vulnerable populations"
good,"Steward health care recently bought the company I work for. Soon after the purchase many employees were laid off, benefits were reduced, co pays for benefits were increased."
good,This is a great company to hone your skills in and work toward something better. Growing company that is trying to grow as fast as possible which sometimes can seem too fast.
good,"17 years experience as clinical pharmacist. A lot of Clinical pharmacy experience gained and constantly used. A very busy environment. Staffing has decreased over the years to make job much more demanding. Unless in a management position your opinions and past experience do not really matter. The best part of the job is the rewarding feeling when you accomplish potentially life saving activity, and interacting with patients. A rewarding but very demanding job."
good,Co-workers are great. In my job function I learned a lot regarding hospital billing. time management is essential in this position. sometimes not being given clarity on issues when asking questions or with information not being shared that is relevant to each team member.
good,"This company went through major layoffs 3 months after i was hired. Luckily, they gave us plenty of notice with the option to move (TX). They promised communication of job openings but did not follow through."
good,"Great place to start for new grads. You will get  learn ALOT. A wide variety of diseases/ illnesses. Ages youll care for range from 18-100 years old. Majority of patients though are 40-70 years old that are recovering from addiction, surgery complications, respiratory failure, need wound care, some are on vents, dialysis and so on. Excellent learning experience. The only down fall is that your patient ratio is fairly high 5 or 6:1. Management was alright but def not the most helpful. They would only help you if THEY HAD TIME. The only reason why i left was because i hardly ever got a raise the four years i was there. I knew i deserved more money for the amount of care i was given."
good,"Management is not aggressive at all, problems are swept under the rug to keep them quiet.  Going from Iasis to Steward there have been decisions that make absolutely no sense, we are incredibly short staffed but no raises to motivate or retain are given, evals are done in January and if you don't get a good enough review you don't get a raise at all, turnover is very high and justifiable because employees aren't treated very well.  You've just a body filling a space."
good,"First coding job so really have nothing to compare it to"
good,Its run like a factory.  Multiple people from above to immediate supervisors constantly on top of you to discharge the patients.  Pay is good but I would not want to be admitted there
good,I enjoy working with this company.  I got burnt out working excessive hours every week.  I would love to go back and work with the company the pay was good.
good,Largest Healthcare employer in the US now which is great until you want to be paid as a contractor for services rendered.  6 months and barely pd on time twice.
good,"Much favoritism in the workplace. Was informed would be docked for lunches, even if you did not take them. Company was sold during my employment, so many changes were made, some changes were unproductive and unsafe for the staff and patients."
good,"Internal management (Tampa) are in tune with their employees and make sure that employees concerns and issues are adressed in a professional manner. External management (Phoenix) is horrible, micromanage your every moment, will question why employees consult with one another, as it is shunned upon. High employee turn over, management is very out of touch with employees and only cater to a certain few needs and wants (favortism). Gottacha mentality is enforced on to new employees and are very nonchalant to those who learn at a diffrent level. They basically are looking for bodies to fill seats and dont care to give the employee a chance to thrive at the job they were hired to do."
good,Good place but I hear its better now. I liked being able to work from home. Fair pay and lots of overtime. Too many changes in upper management but the work environment was good.
good,"Observation and interaction with direct patient care. Be aware of all safety factors of the patient, unit sweeps and communication with coworkers . Hardest part of job is inconsistencies and continuity and poor communication"
good,I enjoyed working in the kitchen but unfotunaltly school work and sports all got in the way of each other so I was working for extra cash cause of free time around school but once it all got in the way I had to leave unfortunately
good,I have worked for hawathorn medical for many years.   Steward took over about. 3 yrs ago.  It has been a nice place to work.  Very long hours. 8 to 5.   Very clean environment and support patient care.  They do offer a great health insurance dental insurance and do have many other benefits.
good,Training is at a minimum.  Good place to start and learn on your own.  Poor compensation packages.  Mediocre benefits offered to employees.  Good 401(k).
good,Iasis needs to train the managers and supervisors better.  The company just sold so there is no job security.  Iasis does pay well but they don't give employees enough training or time to learn their job.   I'm leaving to work closer to home.
good,"The company culture has changed over time and not for the better, unfortunately. Compensation is not equitable. I love the patients and the people I work with, and I will be sad to leave."
good,"Came in at 7am and got to work for the rest of the day. "
good,"I loved working with the people I did. The staff is the best, but the pay was not. I could work elsewhere in the valley for $10-12/hr more (I did this) working less than was required with this company. It was a great job for the ""experience"" but long term is hard to envision with them. The opportunity for moving up into management was nonexistent."
good,"this employee has enjoyed working for the hospital, making sure that patients receive the best care."
good,Consisted of both inpatient and outpatient blood draws. Venipunctures on patients of all different ages. Fast paced and great work environment. Great company to work for.
good,"needs better structure and leadership with management, their processes for account resolution front-end to back-end is not great compared to other organizations, dress code is old fashioned can only wear jeans on friday, lunch breaks only 30 minutes which do not apply to all departments but some which is not fair and it sucks, it's a lot of micro management within departments, they do not offer flex time for arrival , their health benefits are not so great IF you choose the less expensive plan types"
good,"Okay company, routine job, nice people to work with.  Need to catch up with technology and automate more of the reporting.  Good company to start career with..."
good,"I have learned many things in my 17years of being employed by this company. The coworkers are okay. The work load is fine also. But the units could be run better. Their is a lot of favoritism, and it is all about who you know."
good,"I was seeking a full time permanent position. Shortly after I started working, I learned that they were moving many of the accounting positions to Texas. I just learned that they are moving mine. I think they should have been up front about this when I was hired."
good,".Work hard, fast paced. Learned a lot about electronic health record systems and how the doctor's practices use these systems to document their patient notes."
good,I think it is comparable to most healthcare facilities. The staffing is comparable to most for profit facilities. Upper management does not micro manage the directors which makes it a better environment to work in.
good,was ok. just not enough work to stay busy in my position. Had an issue with carrying out acting supervisor request. then got myself in trouble trying too help new associates.
good,"Iasis had always been good to me I was able to advance to high levels in the company, But you will work very hard with little support other then the co-workers that you work with."
good,This corporation decided to relocate to Richardson Texas from Boston. I do not think the company thought this through before the transition.  There is no structure here and no one is able to help you completely. Management is ok but need to separate business from social life.
good,The employees of the hospital are pleasant to work with. The hospital is a small community with a good communication between departments. The employees are like famly
good,"It was okay.  The staff seemed burnt out.  A lot of complicated cases, and busy working day.  However, everyone was friendly and helpful.  Parking was annoying at $6 a day."
good,I have worked at Steward Healthcare full-time 
good,"* Fast Pace"
good,Good place to learn on the job skills.  Not a lot of training provided.  Good retirement benefits.  Poor benefits overall.  Decent management.  Poor job security.
good,The organization always seems as though it is trying to evolve to meet constantly changing environment of health care. The problem is that they do not seem to want to focus on developing staff. Instead they are quick to get rid of staff to meet a staffing need.
good,"Worked for Iasis for more than 15yr, as time progressed benefits decreased and expectations increased. When someone called off you may or may not get a replacement."
good,"contracted with Humana, the two companies merging their different business styles in the beginning/start up phase was challenging. management was non existent the majority of the time, it was difficulty to find answers and leadership on the Iasis side"
good,"The work life at Iasis Health is good and balanced. every company has it ups and downs, but over all , it's good place to work. if your lookinf for easy work to do ,this is the place to be."
good,"Call Volume 40 to 60 calls a day"
good,"I"
good,good place to work. no growth within the company. you will not advance. traffic is serious. I would think it is a good place to work but make sure that you go in with a good position and pay because neither of the two will change
good,Standard healthcare company. Centrally located in Westwood. Benefits are exceptional. Informative staff from Director to team lead.
good,"I enjoyed the interaction with the staff and healthcare professionals."
good,Good experience.  Excellent workplace.  Challenging technologies.  Decent cafeteria
good,. The best part of working with Steward Direct is working in a team every one helps each other .
good,"My job at GSMC is a good job. It is very busy which I don't mind. I work with the general public and help people.I am a float which means I will go to any dept or facility that needs coverage. I learn very quick and am always looking to expand my knowledge. At my job now we check people in, schedule appointments, take co-pays, get prior authorizations, and get referrals it is a typical Medical office setting. I like my co-workers we work well as a team. The hardest thing about my job is the fact of not knowing what their next move will be. We are going to be having a layoff and none of us are certain if we are going to have a job within the next few months. I am looking for a new job that will give me a little more job security. I own a house with my husband and need to make certain I will have a job."
good,I enjoyed working at New England Sinai Hospital for many years until of recent when there were numerous changes in upper management.
good,like the people at the job and like learning new things. I had to run more than one system at a time. work environment was calm and easy.
good,No 401(k). Even though it is a health insurance company the health insurance is not very good. They don't provide paid vacation for a lot of the entry-level positions.
good,Company benefits comperable with other healthcare facilities. Easy access for time off requests. Multiple specialties to work for ... company however is lax in upholding policies .
good,"This company has struggled with compliant billing issues, and has been purchased by another entity, which hopefully can pull them into compliance. The future should look brighter for them now..."
good,"Place to start a great learning experience, can be fun at times however, it can also be very hectic and demanding. Overall, it's a good place to work!"
good,"Working there is rewarding. Value family and beautiful site. I enjoyed working with some of the people there, they really are a great company"
good,"I worked in the business office section for Iasis at a hospital.  The turn over rate for management was extremely high, creating instability within the office."
good,"You learned a lot while at work. The patients here are very complicated. You learned to do med administration, vents, HD to wound care for every patient on your unit. Your fellow nurses, RT, aids all try to help you as a team."
good,IT work is very challenging. Amazing expansion and growth necessitates creative solutions to technical needs. You won’t get this experience anywhere else.
good,"we worked short staffed. we didn't get breaks or lunches. their was a lot of stress amoung workers. we had a hard time keeping new hires to stay.Our supervisiors  was never their at 4am when , we started and had no clue on what was being done."
good,"This is a very positive place to work however if you do not have a bachelors or higher you will not advance in levels. They do offer medical and dental with 401k, however they are very pricey benefits to have. This is a corporate company and the chain of command doesn't listen to the needs of the providers or staff members."
good,"Great people in all departments. Though dialo fue is about quality Pt care, inderlying goals are about money. Orientation was inadequate to prepare for this role."
good,I made sure claims were paid by checking claim status and working denials and doing appeals. Did credits for team lead and other special projects. Company was not good about managing work.
good,"a typical day at work consisted of drawing out patients, in patients, ICU, ER, Recovery room, maternity, labor and delivery, psychiatric units, etc..."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure that all reps are doing what they should be doing to meet daily numbers. Analyzing what needs to be done to be successful for the day. Everyone usually gets along. Management could be a little bit better in being involved with reps. Hardest part of the job is learning to manage people in different ways. Everyone is different and responses to things differently."
good,"Very little concern for routine maintenance & other important upgrades.  Corporate ran hospital into the ground, poor communication. I would never recommend working here due to the poor management.  The staff is awesome!!  They made the best out of a neglective situation.  Corporate doesn't invest in the staff at all, highest turnover rate I've ever seen due to the poor management."
good,"I learned the ins and outs of the hospital culture. Management was changing hand and it made it difficult to deal with new policies, this is natural when things are constantly changing to find what works for a company."

good,"I work for 2 different steward facilities stewrd satellite emergency facility is operated at the former quincy medical ctr and is supervised by carney hospital.Since is an offsite facility mgt is lacking/poor to say the least and entire facility seems to be behind with equipment and training.I work 12 hr shifts 3 days a week.I also work per diem at good Samaritan medical ctr which is literally the polar opposite of the carney.Where carney staff appear to this r.n. and patients,staff are bitter treat patients with disrespect and are not very sympathetic towards there presenting complaint..good sam on the other hand are very supportive of patients need and make the effort not only to resolve presenting issue but also call patient the next day to inquire how they are feeling and assure patient to f/u with d/c instructiobs."
good,Steward is a great company to work for. I have a few complaints regarding management. Salary could have been better because I am sure they can offer more specially dealing with people with different backgrounds is no joke.
good,They need to be more flexible overall. They need to allow job sharing. They do not always treat people with respect or professionalism. There needs to be a better review process.
good,Working at this hospital was a pleasure and I worked there for years. I felt the work and staff were very professional and the staff felt like family.
good,"Fair management. Some turn around."
good,It was a great company to work for.  Great co workers as well. They provide the ability to grow within the company. Lots of  opportunities for training available.

good,Great place to work.  I didn't feel as though my talents were being maximized.  I prefer product and service promotion.  This position was more of an operations job.

good,Growing and productive work place. Health care company on the forefront of health care changes and moving forward to be the leader.
good,"Each day I am assigned a Steward Health Care System hospital or facility. I am given a set of accounts and medical records to audit and a deadline. It is my responsibility to discover and correct any discrepancies.

good,Internal job advancement has not been been supported for myself nor my peers. Poor transition during change of departmental ownership (was not smooth).
good,"Busy and dynamic environment, nice fellowship and no micromanagement. "

good,There is never a dull moment.  From managing three executive’s calendars to scheduling clinic visits to over 25 clinics for out of town corporate executives.  The management team is dedicated to the success of the organization and is flexible to meet the ever-changing demands on their time.  The many personalities within the company make coming to work a pleasure.  I have never once regretted coming to work at Physician Group of Utah.
good,"Some nurses are great others not so helpful. "
good,Had to do 65 accounts a day.  Learned a lot about Medicaid and Medicare. Management was new and did not have a lot of knowledge and experience. Had access to lots of programs

good,It's a fast paste environment working at that hospital. the minute you get there first thing we do is get report on out patents and then after give care to them. Its a busy place you learn a lot dealing with Trachestomy patents and working with nurses and Doctor. We work as team. Always helping each other out. The nurses are great. Wonderful Environment.Hardest part of the job is when we work short but like i said we work as a team and get things done.

good,Great coworkers to work with. Changes in management. Best part of a work day was taking pride in my work and caring for my patients.

good,overseeing employees to help them meet their daily goals and overall team goal. Taking patient complaints and problem solving to improve quality assurance for patients.

good,"A typical day can consist of a mixture of Emergency patients, Inpatient interventional procedures with the Radiologist.  To include Biopsy's, Drainage catheters and localizations.  Intensive care patients for Any type of procedures or routine exams.  Outpatient procedures are a mix as well.  We have a high number of pre and post op Gastric bypass patients. Ortho Patient's that are going to have Hip and Knee replacements.  I am always curious to learn new procedures in CT!  Since coming to ST Lukes hosp. I have learned various protocols for Hip and Knee replacements.  Calcium Scoring too!  The hardest part of my job is patient transport, it is a long walk from CT to ER and back and having to transport and scan patients, it is easy to get behind.  The most enjoyable part of my job is patient appreciation!  I am very appreciative of my patients that take the time to say Thank you!"
good,"Love the people who work there, but the pay and lack of advancement do not make it a great place to make a long term career.  Great place for new nurses to get experience."
good,I love the work atmosphere here at SLR. The staff is fantastic. The surgeons are generally easy to get along with. People will go out of their way to help if you need a few hours covered or a little bit of training in an area.  Breaks are given regularly and staff is willing to work with you to find the best time for your break. Coworkers are willing to share notes and information. The insurance is decent. Benefits used to be better. Pay raises and advancement are kept at a minimal level.
good,"Like my other jobs it has taught me to be patient with people and learn how to troubleshoot problems with healthcare. This experience alone will help me in my future with other jobs related to healthcare and in my personal life as well. All the coworkers are very nice and friendly which makes up for the not the best customer service that comes from the managers. Overall I would say the hardest part of the job was the minor hypocrisy of some of the managers. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people out, by solving their medication issues, or their benefit issues. I have always pride myself of helping people and this job has helped satisfy my need for helping others."
good,"hours and pay are very consistent but management can be a bit one sided. treatment of workers  is very satisfactory, but implied ethics and rules are a bit slacked and overlooked"
good,I really enjoyed my work at this company and the management truly tried to help their employees even in the cutbacks the company dealt with. I enjoyed helping our hospital patients with their billing questions.
good,"Having worked for Steward for 10 years, it has been a highly productive environment that taught me about team work, team build and organizational and production skills that will make me succeed into future endeavors. The co-workers are the best and the managers and directors listen to you. The least enjoyable part of this job is the commute to work and the monotomy of the work. I am always eager to achieve more and to go above and beyond my nornal day-to-day functions."
good,I enjoyed working there.  My coworkers were friendly and helpful when I first started. Management was good to work with when I needed time off for personal reasons.

good,"The company offers lots of skills for individuals just graduate from college, it's a good company to start when entering real world. I like the company over all."
good,"Management of Telemetry Units was very challenging due to expansion of both of the units from a total of 35 beds to 49 beds within a 12 month time frame, and trying to find enough skilled staff to work both units after expansion. Teamwork was better on one unit and work environment was better. Majority of staff coworkers were good to work with. Management coworkers were above average to excellent. The most difficult part of the job was trying to manage as well as help with staffing when there were shortages and the long hours."
good,"I was fortunate that I was offered this position after my previous employer sold the company.  Worked with wonderful people, very considerate.  The only bad thing is I was driving 2 hrs each day to get there, and after a couple of years it became drudgery."

After being a field service engineer, I learned what it would take to get back into an in house position and the sheer variety of equipment that was involved. I had a great manager that always treated me more than fair especially when he was my only co-worker in the department.

That meant playing games, talking helping walk, push in a wheelchair whatever the patient wanted and was allowed. I learned how working in the social work field can be a tough but rewarding experience. The toughest part was having to say goodbye to the patients when I was done for the summer. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the patients and seeing their faces that they knew why I was their and were happy about it. "

Some growing pains due to the acquisition by Steward, but I am optomistic that these issues will be resolved. This company has high expectations of all employees, so if you just want to collect a paycheck this isn't the place for you.  C suite is always supportive."
