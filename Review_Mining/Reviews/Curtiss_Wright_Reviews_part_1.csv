rating,review
bad,Absolutely clueless and dangerous management . HR women makes rules up as she goes along. It’s a really dangerous environment. Someone will get killed. Just a matter of time.
bad,"verbal and physical abuse, and doing the job of 4 people to get criticized and harassed. like working at a prep school frat house except warehouse style. poor pay, no work life balance, just slavery and inept hostile mgmt. look somewhere else"
bad,Poor management.Unrespectfull.No training  time at all.No room for advancement.Management concentrates in whom to blame when a mistake happens.Stead of fixing the processes.
bad,"Please do not apply, or accept employment."
bad,"Starts ok then down hill from there. Comes across as a very open place but nobodys straight with you. "
bad,Management and HR are all for themselves. Getting to see HR is like pulling teeth. You are simply a number. Not valid. You here how much profit they made and your reward is a poxy voucher for the overpriced canteen . And a once a year profit bonus which amounts to around £15 a week before you are taxed on it. Christmas you get a 20 quid gift voucher. Spoken to like your a kid in school. No respect of its staff at all
bad,Prep and clean parts for grit blasting and thermal spraying . it sucked there i dint know why or how me telling you how it was working for those people
bad,"Don't recommend this company. Discrimination is allowed without anyone getting in trouble, with HR even being aware. All good engineers have left already. If you accept a job there, just remember they will use you and then get rid of you the minute they know you are smart and can handle the next level up."
bad,Jobs were outsourced for cheaper pay with no benefits - trained people with zero accounting or finance experience.  Managers left company before employee - they were smart.  Poor and uneducated managers were hired to fill in spots - that you had to train on the basic email system and excel.
bad,Working at C-W was like working at old failed and boring Westinghouse.  Mgmt took care of its own.  Period.  Nepotism & abuse of H1B visas is rampant.
bad,I interviewed there and staff seem terrified by management. I did not have a good feeling about the organization and maybe they did me the favor by overlooking me.
bad,"Never worked for a less professional group of managers than exists in the Idaho Falls location. Vindictive, hostile work environment!!! You need to record every interaction with management because of their lack of integrity."
bad,"HR are horrific and lost me my apprenticeship due to poor organisation and no clue what they are doing. "
bad,"Certain employees were great to work with. In comparison to other companies CW basically had there act together as far as computer programs etc. "
bad,"Poor Management from the Top down, incompetence at the top and no accountability for those who make poor decisions. The place is run like a dictatorship with limited resources and support to complete tasks. Projects are always falling behind and expect to have no work life balance. "
bad,"They will fire you at will, the management is a joke, work life balance is non existent. They can't retain any talent and no one there is happy. Glad i left while i could, they will work you to death for revenue and commit fraud and abuse while they are at it. They are lucky no one has called DoD ethics hotline on them."
bad,"Company used to be a great place to work, but they have ruined themselves over about 2 years."
bad,Mgmt. and culture from old failed Westinghouse has infected and diseased CW.  HR is lazy & mgmt goes above and beyond to take care of itself.  Period.
bad,"...dass ich nicht Lache... Sie suchten nur Jemanden zur Überbrückung von Personalengpässen, mehr nicht."
bad,i got laid off after 1 week for no reason at all they said my assembly work wasn't up to scratch but never assembled anything in the short time i was there.
bad,Corporate needs to go in there and clean house. The management of this facility is horrendous. The equipment belongs in a landfill. Stay away unless you need a paycheck.
bad,People are focused on individual results only; management lets certain unethical issues continue; work-life balance is nonexistent; do not care how you achieve your results - just the fact you get there.
bad,Many have come and many have run away screaming and yelling.  A high turnover rate in an accounting department tells a lot about a company. The End.
bad,"The majority of all departments work more than 40 hours and that is very much ""expected"". Many people are unhappy but have been there so long that they believe they cannot leave. The benefits seem great, until you begin using them."
bad,"Total joke! Managements clueless. Only care about their bonuses. NO ADVANCEMENT unless you have a degree or you're a ""pet"". They want you to bow down & praise them. Otherwise, you're a ""Minion"". All employees rat on each other as well. It's a glorified daycare here. Managers peek around desks/ pallets and watch everything. Only care about being lean & clean. Maybe they should listen to their employees & actually care. THIS PLACE SUCKS, STAY AWAY."
bad,This place is managed by bullies that like to over manage the details.  No room for your suggestions it's their way or the highway.  Very political environment and you need to be connected to the right people
bad,My most enjoyed part of my job is working with and helping people obtain and achieve their goals.  A typical day at work I am involved in a multiple amount of projections where I need to multi-task.
bad,"Verbal abuse from leads and co-workers on a daily basis. My first raise in three years came up, and it was for 1%. Wouldn't go back there for anything."
bad,"This position is not worth having.  Compensation is really good.  Senior IT management is clueless.  A single local SAN is over provisioned.  SAN is supporting replication for files from two other locations.  For additional space on SAN an offsite system admin changed the RAID configuration from RAID 10 to RAID 5.  "
bad,"Used to be like a family, management knew your name and your kids names... Then they retired.  New management took over and the decline began.  They're the sit up in their Ivory tower and make decisions on paper that are impractical type.  Their arrogance flooded the place and ruined it.  If you disagree with them you find yourself laid off.  Since they took over they lay people off every few months. No rhyme or reason to it, just people that got on their bad side or had health problems. Once you got back from FMLA you were gone - either laid off or forced out  They fostered an extremely toxic culture which is sad because it used to be great.  I wouldnt recommend the brecksville location to my worst enemy.  Stay far far away. It was a mass exodus of retirements and people leaving the last few years everyone wants out! Also pretty much no mobility because they constantly eliminate positions. Dead end place."
bad,"Was fired after 3 days for ""disliking my job and not performing up to expectations "" but the real reasom was i was pregnant at the time and they didn't know it when they hired me."
bad,Curtiss Wright was very understaffed which made the work load for all employees overwhelming at times. Month end hours were not ideal as it was expected to work 12 plus hours a day during the last week and consistently 6am to midnight on the last day. No potential for growth within the company.
bad,"Decent pay and benefits, promotions are based on good ol boys and boot lickers. Hard work and dedication is OVERLOOKED. Pay and insurance is the only reason they retain the good employees they have."
bad,Management is horrible and workers are overworked with little to no rewards or advancement.
bad,Great experience earned but management is poor. As this company grows they need more of a progressive leadership that is knowledgable and knows how to implement change well in order to stay competitive in the market and retain skilled workforce.
bad,"Troubleshoot without training on most product. No manuals available "
bad,"Talented workers can not be retained, do to management expectations are too high. Daily struggles keep workers from doing the jobs they were hired to do."
bad,Stressed work environment over all has no people skills and constantly changing priority within minutes or hours.Very little communication when something is needed until it misses its target date.
bad,"As a typical machine shop, you need to be part of the good old boy networking here to get ahead.  The people are nice, but many are inexperienced or lack motivation.  Jobs are being moved to Mexico so the long term stability is nonexistent.  There is a steady stream of work though and a nice mix of parts to keep you learning constantly.  Pay is decent, but management is horrible.  Upper management developed a system to bypass quality inspection points when QA backlog gets high.  Obviously our customers did not know this, so this is completely unethical.  Your ethics will be tested here for sure.  There are a lot of shady goings on here and they hire the wrong people for the management positions.  HR is pathetic as there is one lady who is practically never around.  Site leader is blind to all the problems going on here, but hey, your paycheck will show up on time and they pay a decent wage, so if you don't mind being jerked around and told to do unethical things, then this is a great place.  For me it was a paycheck and a part of my work history I'd love to forget."
bad,Let me go after a down sizing situation which I was more qualified to do than the other pesonnel that stayed with the company.
bad,The leaders of the of the organization seem to focus strictly on the bottom line and not on what it takes to accomplish the task leading to excessive hours and stress causing a high turnover rate. Some managers are all talk and promise and fail to deliver.  Changes are made without regard to customer or employees creating unhappy customers and employees. Just about every perk that was promised when I was hired has been taken away without any compensation to replace it.
bad,"Benshaw's product line has marketability but lack the management to effectively grow the business...not only from a division perspective but also at the corporate level."
bad,Average. Not the best place to work. No educational benefits. Management overwhelmed with task but not enough employees to cover task thus can be over
bad,I would not recommend this company. They do not treat the employees fairly. They come take over small companies and the employees get lost in the shuffle. No morals.
bad,"Work hard on new products.  Management wasn't supportive, but people worked hard to make a difference.  Work long hours and 6 days per week.  Had 3 individuals working for me"
bad,"I can honestly say - with more than 30 years of experience - that this is truly one of the strangest places I've worked.  "
bad,Not a healthy atmosphere to work in. To much micro managing with little support or help to get the job done. The workers are overworked and there is no appreciation by management. Most enjoyable part of my job are the workers and the personnel who work for me.
bad,Management does not give clear instructions on tasks or deadlines.  Often times management will demand that a job get finished that day without you even being notified beforehand about the existence of the job or its priority. Employees in certain departments do not seem happy at all and are overworked.  The company as a whole does seem to promote a good work life balance but certain departments are way behind the rest of the company in this field.
bad,"A once great company turned into corporate politics, with management unable to effectively manage the union shop floor. Attempts to change culture fail because of lack of respect for shop employees, poor decision making and rewarding yes-men. Management is a revolving door, and no effort is provided to actually improve performance but rather unrealistic deadlines are given, which fails when the union shop won't work to the schedule. Some great minds there, just obfuscated by anyone speaking over others."
bad,"i have many jobs that i enjoyed in the past and this is one of them. here i was given the ability to grow, based on my performance."
bad,"I have been employed there for many years and watched the company grow. It is a very results oriented business now, relying heavily on a business metrics management system."
bad,"I agree with other posters.. the management of the company is poor.  They treat engineers too much like they are factory workers with regards to hour flexibility and general opinion.   Also,  company is infected by evil cult management club that I've see on other companies.  They hire engineers  and remotely watch them to train their buddies, even if said people don't want to participate.  I've seen that many time in recent years, usually those companies are going down hard because they filter out the best people and hire and retain deadwood, and people that hate doing their jobs and burnt out long ago..."
bad,"i schedule all work processed in the heat treat and braze area and i insure product is processed to the highest level of quaility and effeciency, following strict customer and aerospace specifications"
bad,"My engineering team was run like a chicken with it's head cut off. It was either very relaxed and there would be very poor work flow to keep most of the team busy, or it was staying for 10+ hours a day to meet some deadline that suddenly appeared in two weeks. Most of the software team was interns because they were able to make money off of them, but most of them had very little experience and the majority of the projects suffered due to this. I know people who moved up quickly by looking busy constantly yet doing nothing, and people who worked hard and ran out of work were punished. "
bad,"Curtiss Wright boasts that Innovation is the driving force behind there company. I can attest that this is not true...squeezing more money out of every resource and doing it with less people in the lieu of innovation, is the driving force behind this company in attempt to maximize profit. The sacrificial lamb in this company culture is the conducive engineering environment that is required for innovation along with employee empowerment. I'm sure there are worse places to work but I know there are better one too."
bad,Buenas prestaciones como fondo de ahorro y mucho tiempo extra.
bad,"Very fast paced high energy company. "
bad,"If you want to work for a company that expects you to work hard without any perks, than this is the place for you. As a new hire, I do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling about this place. I feel like they don’t want you to be innovative even though that’s what they preach. The process are stuck in the most manual way possible. They are a holding company that doesn’t really want to re-invest with themselves."
bad,"Boring"
bad,A typical work day for me consists of pressuring up bottles and other hazardous materials to very high volumes of pressure. Co-workers and my lead supervisor were all very helpful and guiding when i first started the job. The hardest part of my job was making sure that any and every safety precaution was being taken at all times.
bad,Well rounded IT Professional and experienced in many industrys
good,"5 year plan changes every year."
good,"You can get all the overtime you wanted, management micromanages too much causing friction between employee and management. good benefits and vacation time"
good,"its a very clean place to work at, stress free, you go in work your hours at your station, solder as many component as you can inspect it and pass it on to the next person for the next step."
good,"The pay rate is very good for the area, however, the opportunities for advancement and enhancement are very limited (sort of a ""buddy system"" dictates the opportunities)."
good,"Aprendes mucho y rapido, sin entrenamiento y trato directo con clientes por lo que es muy interesante. Hay mucha convivencia entre colaboradores y trabajo en equipo."
good,"Las bases de la empresa estan perfectamente bien simentadas, el unoco detalle que veo es que no te dan la oportundad de ejercer una posición diferente, aún sabiendo que uno cuenta con la experiencia necesaria para desempeñarla."
good,"Really nice people in the departments. But management is very cult like. The very same Code of Ethics you agree to is very seldom enforced with management, with many violations to adherence of the same. Talent management is exclusive to exploitation, with many managers taking credit for others creativity.  You better negotiate a very high end wage on the curve because you will likely remain there for ever. As for getting paid time off they are very flexible. Maybe would recommend  for starting a career. But no place for having one. Knowing what I know now, I would have not taken position with this company."
good,"40-50 hour work weeks largely meeting and email-based."
good,Career starter not a place that you would like to stay for a long period of time. The company is going through a lot of transition and cost cutting measures.  The goal of more work with less people is affecting the moral of employees.  Employees are overworked and becoming burned out. Great employees and benefits.  Pay is not comparable with work load and duties.
good,"Reading blueprints operating two CNC lathes changing different style chucks collet, step boring jaws and turning parts with vary tight tolerances. Using different types of measuring tools."
good,Poor management is killing this company
good,"Sweat shop, HQ gets all the benefits. Down the line, nil point."
good,The co-workers  was ok .20 min from my house not a hard job .the pay was to low for me .the communication was very  bad .very dusty hard to work some days.
good,"A typical day at work is getting modules built by the deadlines. There are many on the job training chances, and benifits are good."
good,"This site designs and manufactures an assortment of electronic boxes for military and civilian aircraft."
good,"Fast pace work, worked with all different types of people. worked through weather the building had no heat nor air. worked with some cool laid back people."
good,"Mucho favoritismo y demasiadas injusticias, los jefes de grupo y supervisores de área son un asco"
good,Great Co worker the learning experience was well worth the employment and the skill learned. The negatives was the rush to get the jobs completed. Worth the growth
good,I installed plumbing components in natural gas and oil separation tanks for the oil field. It was fast paced and demanding. I learned a fair bit and liked my co-workers
good,"Great people, good work atmosphere. Management is disconnected and arrogant. This company is not transparent, will not divulge pay brackets, bonus structure. Management is treated on a much different level than the regular staff (pay, bonuses, incentives, travel for 'training')."
good,"Daily systems administrations duties included creating applications in BASH, PHP for RHEL/Apache/MySQL (LAMP) systems. "
good,The ability to navigate through the layers of the overlapping business units with employees that report to corporate and the site in the same work facility.
good,To much micro managing with little support or help to get the job done. There is no appreciation by management. Most enjoyable part of my job are the workers
good,"Steady work and overtime, may have some traveling. Offer good medical benefits.  Job may have advancement opportunities.  On the bus line."
good,"Very fast paced high energy company.  Great people hard working and motivated."
good,"The workday at work typically presents varied activities and challenges that keep it interesting."
good,Una junta sin jefes ni jefes de grupo puro operado
good,Many of the IT employees are very helpful and team oriented. The infrastructure is chaotic considering there are multiple domains with different configurations. Far as advancement it is quite challenging speaking specifically when working in IT.
good,The actual environment was great. My co-workers were well to work with. Difficulty working with our factories in the U.K. & China. Very busy most times of the day.
good,Overall not a bad company. My direct report was outstanding. For my first civilian job out of the Military he made the transition easier. I marked it down on Job Security as Lay-offs are a common place. The 4 gentleman that worked directly with me were top notch as well. Would go back if an opportunity becomes available.
good,"Cons:"
good,The company was in the process of selling off their automation business. When the office closed the position was no longer available.
good,You get to test and troubleshoot all the new technology use for military defense equipment.  
good,"I worked in Gastonia, NC. It is nice and friendly area, and low cost. The job was ok. It could be better if the managers were less conservative. Pay is average for the area. Managers were interested in politics more than in building something interesting. The hardest parts was to deal with internal and external politics. The most enjoyable part was visiting machine shops in the area and talk to local vendors that used to be cotton farmers."
good,"Pros: As a design engineer, I got a lot of opportunity to work on extremely interesting products. I got to work with all sorts of professions which seems like a rarity in today. Of that group, many of the engineers I worked with were of the top class of engineers, some were leaders in the industry. Most of the people I encountered day to day were phenomenal people."
good,"so I don't really have much to say, I enjoyed working there but all new management has taken over and I can't say anything about it now because the culture is probably different."
good,"Not even sure if the place I worked is in buisness anymore, but it was a good place to work while I was there.  Clean atmosphere and friendly workers."
good,"As an intern we did not get to interact with the broader Curtiss Wright teams. However, great mentorship from the business group but a lot was left to be desired."
good,The work at Curtiss-Wright fluctuates by season. Lots of overtime required. Demands are set by people without direct knowledge of the work required to complete a job and are unattainable most of the time.
good,"Multiple products to be functioned, instant gratification with daily tasks of completion.  Management provided ample amounts of training and open door of communication."
good,I performed ordering and receiving parts.  I inventoried supplies.  It was a nice place to work.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  They were very supportive.
good,"Typically inspect first run parts and finished products, inspect machine setups, prepare non conformance reports, determine root cause of deviations, use various measuring equipment, read technical drawings,"
good,"Typical day at work varies based on tasks given, at times overwhelming while at other times, tasks are sparse.   No room for advancement at administrative levels.  I have learned a great deal from management during the past 5 years."
good,"Curtiss Wright is the best company to work for. Co-workers are very friendly, work environment is very professional and great."
good,"This position offers a full day of challenges and diverse job requirements. I have had the opportunity to learn several ERP systems during my brief time there. "
good,"There is a lot of challenge available for those workaholic and self-starter types like me. A pressure vessel estimator here is responsible for everything required to get a proposal to the customer, from mechanical design to proposal content. However, the inadequacy of mid-level management appointed to this division by CurtissWright makes staying very difficult. CW is a Wall Street small cap with the inability to vet mid-level management at it's acquisitions. I haven't worked for anyone here who SHOULDN'T have been working for me. Double negative intended."
good,"Managment has changed over my 35 years there, went from experienced hands on based to a course of college educated perferred. Good people work there, just more solid direction needs to be give for the company to be successful in the future."
good,"Temp position, assembling and testing test stand for environmental testing of electronic assemblies."
good,"Well managed organization with a diverse workforce."
good,"During your rotations you get valuable experience in different divisions in the company. The people are very intelligent and helpful. Navigating through workplace politics can be a pain sometimes, and management can sometimes be a pain to deal with. Overall, I had a good experience with the company"
good,"Supported engineering with new product design development and testing. Learned electronics design and applications used in aerospace and military. Management is struggling with meeting customer deadlines and budget constraints while customers are becoming inpatient and employees are overstress and undercompensated. There are great employees, both manager and co-workers to work with and learn from. Hardest part of job are meeting tight schedules and have limit resources or people. The best part of the job are the oportunities to learn and work with great people."
good,"Was good working ,learned to help minimize tool room expense and"
good,"Answering phones, quoting, emails, customer complaints, preparing shipping reports."
good,"Typical day at work is like every day, doing same thing overe and overe again, i don't mind doing that. I've learned a lot, need more charatcetrs to describe.But is time to get other experience. i like to work there,great team to work with."
good,"Very fast paced environment entering Dwg's and Data into SAP.  I run CCB meetings four times per week to determine if all Board members are in agreement of new ECO's being presented which affects multiple Products."
good,"The environment at work was fun and interesting.  What caused all the commotion was management.  Some of the managers did not know what they were doing and should not have been managers.  Another issue CW had was to allow software team to run the show which caused hardware, systems and division managers feel like they don't exist."
good,"I  have a lot responsiblities in several areas  and programs "
good,"That's what I appreciated.  Our deparment liked toys and to play."
good,It's a good place to work  good pay nice hours. I recommend people to put in an application with curtiss-wright company I was working at the Rolls Royce building
good,"Loved CW, and the great people that wok there. HR doesn't manage staffing well at all. If you aren't in the unions don't bother trying to work there. HR doesn't care about employees at all or what they go through. I feel that CW needs additional staff but doesn't have deep enough pockets to run the company as it should be. They want as many contractors as possible to avoid adding someone into the unions. This prevents them having to pay what people deserve, and giving them the benefits they deserve. I think the unions need to step up and do something about that."
good,A great place to work at one point of time.  The company is geared more toward making numbers more than developing employees.
good,"Curtiss Wright is a good place to work. If you like a lot of over time. "
good,"All the OT you want flexible hours, if your really good at your position you wont advance because your too valuable, no backup training if you go on vacation no one does any of your work even as an hourly employee you come back from vacation with a load of work."
good,"Atypical day at my job was good ,,except for the high stress.    I learned much about the navy navy nuclear program.and the ships and submarines they go on.Ok they treated me fine .workplace culture was good,and safe .Very high tech.machining, with very high tolorences, that's were the stress comes on..never scraped parts though. Each valve could be up to 500,000 or more and waigh,up to two tons.enjoyable part of the the job cool people,,good friends.."
good,They have a lot of growing to do. The shared Services is to new to tell right now. There is a high turn over within less than a year.
good,I like surrounding myself with smart people. Not much of a work life balance.
good,"En general, Curtiss Wright Querétaro es una muy buena empresa para trabajar ya que tiene un buen mercado (Aeroespacial) y los procesos (Maquinado) están muy desarrollados. El ambiente es bueno y las prestaciones y salarios muy acordes al mercado."
good,"As a co-op at Curtiss-Wright EMS in Cheswick, you can work in a broad range of engineering roles. However, I would say that not all are equal in the opportunity that they provide to learn about the engineering process and in getting good work experience. I was fortunate enough to work in three different positions where I learned about each part of the engineering design and manufacturing process from early stage contract negotiation to product design and manufacturing to shipping of completed products."
good,Great place to work at except compensation is pretty thin. Management is ineffective and spend all days in meetings. The work place is pretty pleasant but workforce is pretty stretched.
good,"Work was fast paced on very interesting due to being a nuclear industry supplier."
good,Very satisfied here as it is a very progressive company in the aerospace industry.  The management is continually improving the performance and engineering is a key part of that improvement.
good,"Good company to work. "
good,"I have had many different positions over the years, but the primary one was to update and maintain data from Nuclear power plants throughout the United Stated and Canada. This data would then be shared on a website that I maintained so subscribers could buy and sell parts from each other."
good,Good place to work to gain experience after spending 25 years at a large company (Boeing) working on the B-1 program.  Worked with Boeing and Sikorsky as helicopter product customers.
good,"Acquisitions and growth.  Lots of folks trying to learn how a large company operates.  Lots of companies being picked up and merged into Curtiss-Wright."
good,Company business is getting to complicated and customer and work place is suffering.
good,Curtiss Wright was a typical manufacturing plant specializing on aerospace rotary actuators for wing flaps and doors.
good,The company has a lot of moving parts that making learning possible. All of the departments interact with each other and it is a very collaborative environment with hands on management
good,"Imagine telling people you work for the company that invented the airplane! To me, that felt great, but Curtiss-Wright needs to capitalize on that sense of heritage a bit more effectively. The good news is that this is a strong company, focused on acquisitions to promote the right kind of growth and vitality. Unfortunately, their succession plan does not apply to every role within the company."
good,Curtiss Wright is a good company to work for they are just going through a lot of changes which is hard for employees to understand.  They could use some improvements with communication and job evaluations.
good,Learned a lot about the different equipment. The management team was nice and very respectful. The hardest part was the changing of the work hours. Best part was the people I worked with.
good,The days are full of variety and I have had the chance to sharpen my problem solving skills within the area of mechanics. I have learned to accept many challenges given to me by management. The people I have had the pleasure to work and grow with have been wonderful.  Balancing my home life with my work life has been a large difficulty due a lot to the time spent traveling to and from work on a daily basis.  I have enjoyed many aspects of my job here most of all I have enjoyed the chance to learn many different methods of dealing with problems that arise from the product I have worked with
good,"nuclear work actively promotes job culture , they want employees to own there work and be accountable.The pay is good but there is no guarantee of work , all jobs are staffed on an as needed basis , this tends to create tension between employees which reduces the feeling of camaraderie I have experienced with other employers"
good,"experience, training, good working environment, very capable partners in their daily work activities, weekend work, knowled and experience"
good,"christmas party is fun"
good,"Always busy, sometimes challenging. Never did the same work and a daily basis, Always learning something new and worked with a great group of people in a variety of engineering positions."
good,"Great 401K and Stock Options. Good Health Care with"
good,"It's a decent place to work, the benefits are good, pay is steady, the workload isn't terrible, and the people for the most part are great.  Management is a problem.  Processes would change from day to day, and the decision makers don't seem to have a head for business.  This company is the result of engineers running a company."
good,simple got along.forman cool nice people easy paydays.....
good,"I started out in an agency and was shortly hired on direct. This company put  customer satisfaction first, at times putting strong deadlines employees have to meet. But, with the heavy demand of work and tasks, a day flew by"
good,CW is a great place for anyone looking for stable income and great benefits. The teams there work hard at getting product out the door to the customers.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of data entry for orders, quality control and filing."
good,Empresa muy demanadante con un muy buen nivel de desarrollo. Falta mejorar en algunas areas de lal administracion.
good,Good Company. Was a great first job after the Military. Manufacturing environment was a tough pill to swallow when Layoffs come around. Its Not for the thinned skin.
good,"Excellent career opportunities, although no longer at the City of Industry location (where I worked), as this group migrated to Santa Clarita."
good,"I learned new skills, everyone was always so nice & helpful. Day always went by quickly.  Good supervisor. Wish I would've gotten hired, I got layed off :("
good,To much overtime required. The job is going to Mexico. A good work environment. A real good place to ick up a relevant skill set.
good,"place which gives a lot of opportunities to learn something new. Give you a chance to work in an aerospace environment. Helpfully staff, good managers"
good,typical day at Curtiss Wright was Slow Mornings within half of hour work would pick up. Busy there was always work to keep moving throughout the day when I started with the company management was great room for growth it was good to work with difference culture hardest part was getting there in the morning... enjoyable time was  the team work pulling the workers together to build a great work place...
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at this plant. The people who worked there were very friendly and provided me with a safe work environment for me to work in.
good,"Working as a lead engineer, Taking care of quality of deliverabls"
good,Curtiss-Wright was a great work place. Benefits were good. Very
good,"Empresa con oportunidades, con un aprendizaje para las personas que quieren hacer las cosas bien, desarrollo día a día, ambiente estable y con un crecimiento para personal y laboral."
good,I enjoyed working at  Curtiss-Wright. I started off as a Senior Buyer and then ended up as a Program Manager. I had to look for another job because they moved their manufacturing facility down to South Carolina.
good,Curtiss Wright was a great place to work with good benefits and career advancement opportunities. The companies leadership has grown Curtiss Wright to be a premier company.
good,Una buena empresa donde tiene buen salario y buen ambiente de trabajo
good,"Good Company to work for.  Best Manager.  Very collaborative work environment.  Cross functional teams work with Manufacturing, engineering and quality."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
