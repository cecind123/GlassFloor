bad,"Old school environment. No work from home. No 9/80 schedule. No consistent communication. No integrity within management. They say what you want to hear but don’t fix anything. Favoritism is rampant. Promotions given to least qualified instead of who"
bad,"Nothing but politics. If you arent in the clique, you wont be welcomed. HR is a joke. People at this company will lie about you and the regional manager will ask you to perform illegal stuff. Not worth the risk."
bad,"I've been working for this company through 3 name changes and for 23 years.  It's in worst shape today than ever before.  They have hired unqualified individuals for management positions that they have no experience, or education in."
bad,"Maintain daily operations of a natural gas plant"
bad,"Nice new plant with normal plant issues. Has a few problems with pressure and temperature drops. Which causes issues with the flow and proper valve operations. In need of more experienced personal. Slow down the training process of inexperienced personal."
bad,"I worked for Targa Midstream for 3+ years as a project engineer. In that time frame, Targa has consistently not treated safety and environmental concerns correctly."
bad,"Typical work day included pulling fuel samples from pipelines, trucks and railcars and reporting findings."
bad,I work in Tacoma and management is terrible. Really they have no idea what's going on and any time you ask for info you get a blank stare. You get micromanaged. My coworker's are spacey and crazy and I don't know how they have a job?? They make me want to cry on the regular. I am bored most of the day cause there is nothing going on. Just kinda rotting away honestly. Maybe the jobs are way better in Texas?
bad,The company had good insurance and benefits. As a whole was good comapny. Unfortunately the plant I worked at had issues.
bad,"I worked there and management talks bad about you if your not on there side. No room to grow within company. This terminal is almost a fly by night operation. The office and operators are on different levels and the right doesn't know what the left is doing. The terminal manager is lacking in leadership or better yet very unprofessional and micro manages. You wonder why people leave because it feels more like a babysitters club."
bad,"A very fast-paced environment with things changing every day. Very poor management, unfortunately. The manager micromanaged everyone and had a history of not letting any of his employees excel within the company. He created a very toxic and hostile environment by never being on our side when issues arose."
bad,I love what i do here but alot of judgements calls from some of the management and the leaders in the facility are very questionable. In my opinion there alot of people in positions that dont have the experience to have to be there and also for all the work we put in at this plant they under appreciate it and the pay scale is low
bad,"Overall Targa is a good company to work for. I have been fortunate to see many years here but when it comes to advancement among its employees, you have to be in good with upper management. Hard work does not play a vital role in promotion but rather who you know to say the least."
bad,The management is very poor.  Condisending and talk down to employees on a regular basis.  Other locations may have been different. The work itself was not difficult.
bad,Good place to start and get experience. The compensation package is lacking.
good,The company changed from all contractors to employees last year.  they do not know how to treat an actual employee.  It all depends on your manager whether you can work from home for doctor appointments or you need to be home for a plumber or something.
good,"I was hired to inplement a consolidation and modify another DBA actitude within the users but it turned out that management depended on him and my recomendations where ignored."
good,Good company if you want to get in the door and get some experience. Not much room for further advancement once you are in. Your success depends on how appreciated you are by managers. If you want long term prospects and want a strong growth in your career it may take a very long time to get there just because there is little room for promotion unless some leaves. A little underpaid as well for all the job duties we have to handle and management has say in the day to day activities so there is very little employee autonomy in making company related decisions.
good,"On a typical work day we make line ups, maintain and operate pipelines and storage wells, displace different products, maintain brine pond levels, run the boards in the control room, lock out tag out pumps and different equipment. I have learned a great deal about plant operations here. Also the operations department. The co-workers here are great. Easy to get along with."
good,"Good People to work with, we stay very busy which is good. Not much for work life balance, no 9/80 or anything. Have to be self starter who is used to working with out a lot of supervision which I like."
good,"They encourage ""work-life"" balance but don't give you credit if you need to work at home.  Makes meeting service people tough when you have to take ""vacation time"" to take care of these ""life"" things."
good,"Busy, meeting deadlines and problem solving. The department along with management team experienced high turnover.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the needs of the ever-changing management styles.  However, the most enjoyable/rewarding part was being successful in developing and maintaining constructive and cooperative working relationships with individuals at all levels of the organization."
good,"Really, this place is like high school in many of the areas.  You try to be part of the team, but your just not cool enough.  There are people talking bad about other people.  Really it's just a joke."
good,"Was a good break out company, but things are looking grim after some bad business decisions. Total lack of respect from employees of several different departments."
good,"A good place to start your career, however, there isn't a lot of upward movement available. They seem to hire people from outside rather than promoting within. There also isn't a lot of training available or support."
good,"A few of the older guys there are some real difficult guys to workwith, and if your not in the "" click "" with certain people,  you are just another employee, but the ones in the circle are protected and praised"
good,"Targa Resources is a very good midstream company.  I really enjoyed working there. "
good,I was a little confused about this job. Manager spent the majority of his time in Houston. There wasn’t a very good description of exactly what my job duties were.
good,Work was relaxed slow paced. Pay needed to be more. Fellow co workers were very enjoyable. Enjoyed learning plant and it systems in my short time there.
good,Leadership was not empowered to perform necessary functions to guide teams effectively always overshadowed by upper management. Not always possible to trust leadership as a result.
good,Good place to work with a the ability to learn a lot about the petroleum industry.
good,"Will not take care of the local people only the out of town workers, if you're in town your screwed, if your out of town you get mileage pay, and housing"
good,"Great company, unfortunately the group I was in did not have good management and not eager to train employees to become better. No positive feedback and little job recognition."
good,"The company has a lot of opportunity for growth, just not in the areas I was looking in. The bottom line is the most important. It is somewhat clique-ish."
good,Underpaid positions. Targa resources is known to be the launchpad for workers. Their pay scale is no where near anyone else. Annual bonus isn't great.
good,Work with some excellent co-workers. Typical day at work is easy and stress free. Hardest part of the job is lack of communication.
good,"Training outside operators of their role and responsibilities, planning work, writing start up and shut down procedures for a fractionating natural gas."
good,"Management in SCM is completely closed off to any ideas for growth or to make processes more efficient and streamlined. Little to no contact with management, it can be months before I hear from any of them which is great if you’d like to avoid micromanaging, but terrible if you’re looking to grow or advance in any way. Get poor employee reviews for not going “above and beyond” but if you try to, your ideas and attempts will be shot down, keeping any opportunities for advancement or higher pay (or even feeling like a valued employee) completely off the table. Very monotonous work that starts to wear on you quickly. Other than the SCM group I feel this company is a decent place to work."
good,"A typical day at Targa Resources was pleasant, our payroll department worked well together, shared knowledge and processed payroll, entered data, maintained Benefits, auditing.  Our accuracy was 99% we took pride in our work, reviewed for errors often, and being proactive was a valuable asset for our department.  If we did make an error, we review why/how it happened and came up with a plan, new audit or review so we did not duplicate errors. Special processing usually had a small window to process including quite a bit of data entries.  We would work around the clock to meet the deadline.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, we all seemed to get along great, worked well together, Management had a wide variety of people with different work styles causing some employee conflict with  employees as they did not always get the same treatment, opportunities and work schedules ((flex)."
good,"Fun place to work until industry took a slight downturn and management looked at reducing workforce to compensate and I was laid off with one other, many changes at the top while I was there and this resulted in knee jerk reaction to reduce work force."
good,I think it should look in to the practices of there managers.  in general is you exclude the bullies of the company it id not s bad company to work for.
good,Good place to work if you’re good at your job you may be stuck in that position unless you can find someone to replace you you may do 2 different job duties hard to find people to work them due to pay and housing
good,high volume of accounts payable which i am used to as i like staying busy not bored with nothing to stay be busy for 8 hours a day.  great staff i worked with made many new friends and associates and 2 years later we still stay in touch  we worked as a team and supported and helped each other when the need arose
good,"I like the verities of work, motors, compressors and plant work. The hardest part of the job was getting the parts I needed to preform the job task in a timely manner,"
good,"Always different challenges for repairs. Completing work orders. Assisting pipeline department, and operations department. Working in extreme weather conditions such as cold and hot temperatures, Wet conditions, working in confined spaces and noisy areas."
good,"The company is excellent.  Their was not much room for advancement, however.  Work and family balance was more geared towards work as well.  I didn't feel that employees were empowered enough to make decisions."
good,Lots of different locations. Work is intense. they offer good training if you have the time to take it. Safety is taken very seriously. Management is always willing to help.
good,All in all I am very happy with the people I am working with. The pay needs to be higher to compensate for the expenses of staying away from home for 7days.
good,Console operator on gas plant. Start up was challenging. Good management and co workers.  Learning a ton of new info. Management is fair to employees and the future at Targa seems to look good for now.
good,Work with some excellent co-workers. Typical day at work is easy and stress free. I'm currently trying to transfer to a Texas location and I don't feel like I'm getting much help within the company to help me relocate.
good,I love how i can take control of my area and be in charge of work going on in my area of the pipeline. Time off is very flexible and overtime is always available
good,"Good atmosphere, good company to work for, doable hours of work."
good,"Management, coworkers, etc were all pleasant to be around. The company taught me to think critically about business aspects such as return on investments, expansion, and acquisitions."
good,It is a really good place to work for. They do a lot of things for the employees. Really good people and managment!
good,I am very happy to be working for this company. The newness has worn off and I can take a look at the company as a whole.
good,"the work days were pretty flexible, you could come in from 6-10 in the morning as long as you were willing to stay later and got the work asked of you done."
good,"Good place to work. they take care of their employees."
good,Started work at the Sandhills gas plant and was a good job. I enjoyed working with the people there and was a great experience. I then moved to the field and enjoy it even more.
good,"My tenure at Targa Resources was focused on training the various departments on the O-365 collaboration tools to better their future as the entire company made the move from Office 2010 and 2013 to the O-365 cloud environment. The executives and upper management were instrumental in guiding the path and the environment was open to the new  innovative lessons to be learned in collaboration of Teams, One Note and One Drive."
good,Good company to work for. Safe work place and very productive team. Always someone willing to teach new things for those wanting to learn.
good,"The company really believes in giving back to its employees. There is a relaxed management style that allows employees to get their work done without someone breathing down their neck. Basically, if you get your work done, no one pesters you."
good,"Good company good coworkers, wrong location . Company progression for construction is moving in the right direction. Would have stayed if more time off to be home in a different state. Miss the people and the work environment."
good,"Good people to work with, miss working there. Worked in a natural gas plant. Noisy, dirty and very gratifying. Hard work, some stress at times. Great pay and vacation time."
good,This company is good to work for. Highly recommend. Benefits are top of the list! Hauling LPG is a constant learning trade and obviously one to not take lightly but we are compensated for that. Paid for most everything you do.
good,Excellent upper level management. Loved my job... had wonderful co-workers. Teamwork is essential in this position.
good,"Great place to work, great people just wasn't enough work to stay busy. It is a market based job. If the oilfield slows down then they cannot keep contractors working. If they had enough work to stay busy than I wouldn't work anywhere else."
good,"Good work environment. Cares for their employees, allows growth and supported me during a transfer to another city. This company is large but personable."
good,It was a very nice place to work. Enjoyed working with everyone there. I looked forward to going to work everyday. Never dreaded it which is a plus. It made work fun.

They're relaxed policies and culture make one feel at home and the professional latitude and respect they afford their employees is exceptional!

good,"Not just a number in this division, they treat you as a family and we all were equal as one and accounted for, management were very courteous, they explained and answered questions at any time needed. Very understanding and good company to be apart of"

good,I made a mistake and left for what i thought was a better job.  being a terminal we would load/ off load trucks/barges. We inspected and tested products and shore tanks within the terminal.
