bad,Very bad company to work for look the other way when looking for employment don't waste your time with this very political company your not someone's favorite you don't stand a chance
bad,"I've been with the company a little over a year. Whenever someone new is hired, I lose my hours. I was out for 6 weeks because of surgery and now they have no intentions of giving my hours back. I work 8 hours a week. At 9 something hour. I cannot afford to feed my family. On top of that, ever since I've been back, the shift lead and assistant manager have been trying to get me to quit."
bad,"Receiver position is the most important in the store but least appreciated. Too much added job responsibilities to the position & not paid enough."
bad,If you work here you do the job of the manager and other team members. If you have a question they call you stupid. All management cares about it their monthly bonus if they feel your the reason for no bonus or to little of one you will be fired. If you get hurt at work and go to the dr your told not to come back.
bad,District manager is a bully and will destroy anyone in his way of his own success. No one above him seems to care and have done nothing about the continuous complaints about him.
bad,They will work you til you break your back then let you go with no pay or anything when you do get hurt..and not give you the money you earned. Dont work there unless you like being used and treat like trash.
bad,"Management does not take time off request into consideration while making the schedule. Management often laughs in face when asking for more hours or for a change in schedule. They are not open to helping in anyway when hours are cut. Not very accepting and often talk poorly about past workers and sometimes even current workers, either management likes you or they do not and make it very shown to other workers and yourself. Not any type of encouragement to do better or move up the chain at this company or store. Often times leaving you uncomfortable to approach management about issues involving you and other coworkers or situations."
bad,Terrible place to work was sexually harassed and bullied because I was a woman! I was a manager for a year andnthey hired a young man for the same position and they started him off at 3 dollars more an hour
bad,I liked it before they hired a new manager. He lied on everyone who was there and I was injured on the job site and tried to call them and let them know I wasnt able to come in. They fired me because I apparently didn't call when I know I did. They just didn't answer.
bad,"It is a grind between moving tons of paletted goods a day ,no matter what gets done its never enough,no encouragement is ever given once you burn out they replace you"
bad,Since we got a new manager I have been bullied and screamed at more often than not. Other team members have told me they are going to get me fired and they are the managers favorite so it could happen. Today I was told I’m going to be written up because I didn’t get someone else’s freight put away. If your not in the clique you don’t stand a chance. I use to believe in tractor supply no longer.
bad,Don't work here it sucks and there's not good people here and they barely pay you coworkers do not do their job and there's always stuff not being done the right way
bad,"TSC sucks to work for, they treat you like dirt especially when you are injured and can’t work. The HR department is not helpful at all when needing questions answered."
bad,terrible management terrible hours worst job i ever had garbage rude manager rude stuff under paid no opportunity for raises or more hours would never work here again
bad,"Company does not care about their employees, management is terrible,all they care about is thereselves, as a receiver,I did the work while the managers,sat around and talked about their private lives,with their boyfriends,and drinking nightlives!! When I brought to district managers attention,He did NOTHING!!  SAD!"
bad,Manager and Assistant manager where very disrespectful not only to employees but to the customers. Worst place I've ever worked for.  Would not working at this location  to anyone.
bad,"High expectations for very little compensation.I was in charge of the warehouse and entire store inventory,for barely above minimum wage and only 30 hours a week.TSC preaches family values,honesty and integrity,but that only applies to upper management and stockholders.After 8 months I had to decide to keep working here or be homeless,I decided to be homeless if that tells you anything.The only people happy working here are those who are already retired and just need something to do part time"
bad,Management sucks you get treated like a dog there talked down to and not payed enough to put up with the garbage that goes on there I have never been treated so badly by a manager then I have in the past few days
bad,So far from professional its a joke... Slave drivers for whats its worth. This job will put you in a bad place mentally and physically and give you a false sense of whats actually right and how your supposed to be treated. Tractor supply only cares for themselves and the bottom line. They literally give you so little for payroll and hold you accountable for unrealistic goals because all of the upper management has never even worked in a store it seems like
bad,While working at tractor supply there was absolutely no appreciation when you ask for a day off it usually doesn't happen even if it is way in advance there is no help when you needed it most the manager doesn't act like one that's why the store isn't ran how it should be also there is alot of favoritism in this company and all that happened when I worked was I was constantly screamed at for things out of my control or because my line was my line was backed up although I would call for assistance when needed and it never happened backed
bad,"I respect rate system however, when we are slow and them placing me here and there then get penalized is not cool.  They lost alot of stores right before my hire and the rate shouild of changed alot more then it did.  Moving ppl around all the time does effect the rate."
bad,Pay could always be better. Take care of customers and their needs on the phone or in the store. Learned how to work with different types of people and fix problems
bad,"This is a growth company that has little room or time for any employee that may need help or assistance.  Management is dedicated to a pure profit verses overhead ethic.  There is no room for error and each day will demand the most out of the physical part of the job being asked work harder and harder.  Turnover is very high because of this.  If you enjoy a challenge and hard work for low pay, then this is the job for you."
bad,No advancement or changes since I started I just don't make enough money to survive and would like to make more I take my job very seriously and I all ways make my numbers and never miss any time I take everything I do seriously and I love to work when the money is right what you pay is allot more than I make and I would really like the chance to show you I'm a good employee
bad,"Do not work there!  The drama and management are awful.  You get very little praise for hard work, r expected to work in the dark, r not allowed to sit down (unless you r sleeping with a team lead) even after working a 14 hour day."
bad,Handing my TSC vest in was the best choice I have ever made when it has came to working at this company; most horrible management there has ever been.
bad,I hate it.  Thanks God for it but it's not worth it. Just get the experience and leave. Managment is the worse. They only  care about their pockets.  You can't even talk out there. If caught talking it's a final. You put on finals for anything.
bad,"I worked so hard for this company! I strived to do great and it showed. Upper management could care less about you! A lot more work than pay! I liked the job but was not worth the stress, hours, or pay"
bad,"This is the worst place I was ever employed by.  Stay away fro the place if you know what is good for you.  There is NO job training provided at all, you expected to go in and know what to do.  The  management and other employees are really stuck-up and uncaring."
bad,"Tractor supply makes you work hard, have very little time for fun, and for low wages. You can make more money working for fast food franchises. Don't waste your time making salaried, managers richer. They push selling and push donations etc."
bad,It was a very disorganized place to work. Always was doing things wrong. I didn't like anything about the job. Wouldn't recommend any young person to work here.
bad,"Was told to alter my time card by 15 mins after asked to cover a shift and stay late to prevent the general manager from having to pay me time and a half after reporting to my 5am shift. Was told to take an extra 10 mins at lunchtime after I clock back in to make up for the time. Not the first time either, there were times when closing that I was told to clock off but had to stay because the manager wasn't finished. This location has a terrible general manager and assistant manager. Other leads were great but it's not worth working there."
bad,"The store manager has good service, Assistant manager needs work, and  team leader needs work etiquette. I worked there for 365 days and when I started I loved my job. But when they changed management the job became very stressful and I started losing weight and health started to fail."
bad,"In the 12 hours you work the breaks are good, the pay is good for the hours you work, but dont trust anyone or talk to anyone. Its not like a normal job there they accuse you of things you dont do. Dont complain about anything or your fired."
bad,"I was constently overlooked for promotion, never got a raise, and when I asked about learning other areas, I was told later and never followed through on. Worked there for 2 years and the only thing that really made me happy was my regular customers."
bad,The manager only thinks of her dollar amount she gets paid AMD makes sure her wallet it padded and doesn't care about her employees! She employees only 4 FT employees and 20+ PT so she doesn't have benefits taken away from her bonuses!
bad,Management & staff were rude. When told to management.. nothing was done & showing favoritism when coming to the schedule. One day a week & less than a 7 hr shift is NOT something you can live off of getting paid bi-weekly.
bad,If you wanna work with rude management who doesn't pay attention to you and people who don't like to work as a team  Then don't work for this company. People there are rude they don't work as a team nor do they help you when you ask a question. I was never trained as  properly on computer to print labels. BBad place
bad,"The store manager is rude, full of lies, promises promotions and raises which are never seen. If you have an issue with management well that's to bad YOU are always in the wrong. Management never makes a mistake."
bad,"My time at tractor supply may be the biggest waste of my life ever.   The manager criminally forged hours off of employees time cards,  never gave us rest breaks besides lunch,  and was stealing merchandise from the store.  As a result the inventory was constantly off, when I brought these concerns to tractor supply at the corporate level I was met with indifference and uncaring attitudes.  "
bad,"Always scheduled for hours, not agreed upon during hiring. Not flexible hours at all, management doesn't care about customers or employees, only if the are making sales so they can get their monthly bonus. Would not recommend, especially for females. Definitely a boys club, since females are evidently only good for the cash register."
bad,If your not part of the in crowd management will treat you like garbage. I would never work with this company ever again. Show up to my job and never call off and still get treated like garbage.
bad,They have you watch a bunch of videos that really don't help you at all with your job. They run the least people they can to make more profits.  Won't  go back.
bad,"$9.25/hr for body breaking work."
bad,"The general manager seems nice at first but its just a face she puts on to get people to work there, theres too much drama and team leads and other managers dont want to work there anymore. The drama there is childish and uncalled for. The gm doesnt know how to schedule consistently and if you request days off you wont get the half the time"
bad,"Never seen a company care so less about the employees. The turn over rate is dumb high at the store im currently still employed at. Ive talked to both my store owner and the guy above him and they never address any of the employees concerns and the pay is extremely low for the back breaking work some of the employees have to do especially having constant people calling off (everyday of the week) and then not getting any sort of decrease in work hours or just being flat out fired for never being to work. Then making every single night a living nightmare trying to balance having 3 workers on duty at all times, one doing stock, cashier, and a manager or teamlead and then having set goals that are unachievable due to the customers always interrupting us. If the store i work in would put more priority on the day shift over morning shift maybe the store could actually get something done till then i will never ever suggest someone to work at a tractor supply"
bad,Worked there for a year. It was a great place at first. They call you in a lot but the work isn’t too much to handle. The manager can be a bit much at times but overall it has a steady paste throughout the day. My problem was call offs. There’s not much room in the schedule for flexible shifts. Management doesn’t teach employees much. Management doesn’t take much responsibility in anything. Shifts are usually run by just three people at a time. Overall I would recommend for someone who’s needs a job.
bad,The manager is rude and very unfair to his employees hes very pushy and very unprofessional to be around. Disrespectful around customers as well. Talks down to employees.
bad,"I regretted taking this job in less than a week. There was very minimal training, if this was my first job or I had no retail experience I would have been in a lot of trouble. The store manager was very unprofessional and belittled her employees on a daily basis. When I had questions on how to do things in training I learned very early on to ask anyone but her as she would be quick to tell me I should already know something (even if I had never been told). They were aware I needed as many hours as possible (I applied for full time as that's how it was advertised but was informed it was not full time, at least not for me), however I averaged about 24 hours a week, while male employees were over 30 hours a week (including a male employee who was hired after me, so seniority had little meaning). The general atmosphere is pretty low as the store manager belittled nearly every employee on a daily basis, but no one could do anything to stop it. The rest of the management team was pretty awesome, and very helpful when I was trying to learn the basics of how to perform my job. I would say the only enjoyable part of this job was the coworkers were decent and occasional people brought in pets."
bad,Management is horrifying here. The management was so bad when I quit they had to fire all managers including the store manager. There is not really a dress code. Hours are all over the place. You do not get any help you need with managers and they expect you to know everything when you first start. You have to lift everything no matter the weight.
bad,"Managers of all levels are rude, "
bad,"We are always short staffed, always pressured to make sales goals. Tractor supply does not pay their employees enough and they do not care about us, especially higher up management. Turn over is terrible and we will go months with lack of employees. We have also had many incidents were employees should have been immediately terminated but management wouldn’t do anything about it."
bad,"The number one complaint I have is, they do not give enough payroll for the stores. The store I was in was one of the biggest profitable one in the state. It should never have less than five employees on the floor at a time. On top of this they demoted a good manager who knew what they were doing, for profit. Replaced them with someone who had never operated a box store of this level. It used to be a fun place to work, and the customer's are very colorful. That is the only thing I miss, is the customer's."
bad,"What a horrible place to work. Employees calling off and coming in late was a common practice especially amongst the female employees. Also, no pride in working with the customer's. One manager was illiterate and cried foul every chance she got to get her way. The employees were not Team-Players. Store Manager would never discipline female employees."
bad,"Awful place to work the worst I company I have ever worked for."
bad,"I liked this company when I first started but after working there with the manager Kimberly Woods the experience was horrible She is a God-awful manager the retaliation rule doesn't apply to her because if you go above her head or apply for a position that she have in mind for someone that she like or know she will bully you and pick at you and make your work day miserable I left without a two week notice and i feel like if she wasn't there, in the Thomasville Store, it would be a better work place it is a  lot i can say but don't have the time Get a better manager in Thomasville, AL and it would be an amazing place to work How can one person have so many complaints and still have a job as manager and a horrible one at that"
bad,"It was understaffed poorly organized, to corporate and way to much to do in such a short period of time.I would not recommend this as a job unless you have no family or friend."
bad,Very stressful and hostile work environment. The company does not care about their employees or their store managers. They will let employees voice record all other employees and let employees threaten people and still be able to have jobs.. because they are afraid of being sued.
bad,"Don't work for this company they will do u dirty every turn they can.. They don't care about the employees.  And they don't appreciate the hard work you put in, the more you work the more they want.  DO NOT WORK FOR THEM"
bad,"The current manager of TSC in Ahoskie makes working there very unbearable, she treats everyone as if they are less than her and doesnt train you to do your job. She often will try to change your work schedule without any form of notice and will fuss at you for little to no reason at all."
bad,I worked at TSC for 1 year and they are very unorganized when it comes everyday operations.The store manager tells us a new policy and two days later you get yelled because they never said that but they did. The Mount Vernon TSC has one to many chiefs in that store and not enough indians.
bad,"This by far has been one of the worst locations I have ever worked in, I had to fill in a manager Position due to legal trouble and they didn't show up to work. On top of all of that You never got any hours and if you did it's because someone didn't show up for there shift."
bad,District/Upper management is held to a different standard of accountability. HR and upper management sweep their accountability under the rug while they hold store management and team members to different standards of accountability.
bad,"Manager is a creep. To mush of a clique work place. Forced to work over time. Manager like to gossip and hit on any female to enter the store. "
bad,"The store can’t seem to get a descent manager and the overall management is lazy and ungrateful."
bad,"Its poorly managed"
bad,"This company is a joke. I was never given the hours I was promised and had to basically run the store myself because it was so under staffed. There would literally be two people working having to run register, throw hay, stock, and clean the store all at the same time."
bad,"- low pay..."
bad,TSC is in the business to make money for upper management and that is strictly their goal. They provide a phone number to call if their are problems but will not follow up on complaints.
bad,I was hire to only work with Carhart clothes and they had me do all the clothes . The mangers are very professional and gossip about there employees . Employees and manger would talk about their drama in front of customers .  I was also not hire to do register but I was on it all the time .I was only suppose to be Carhart and nothing else .This place is always slow . I never got the amount of hours I was told .
bad,I worked at tractor supply for about a year as a team lead.  Higher management states u have authority to make decisions but when I do it backfires on u.   There is no backbone to the company and tho they promote that if u work hard u get promoted it’s not the case at all and don’t have the decieny to tell u at all.  The let cashiers bully the team leads and when everyone in the company tells the manager the cashier is the problem nothing is done and the team leads get the wrath.  It was fine when the old manager was there but it turned horrible with favorites being played and people being left out of the loop.  The people what work hard are expected to work harder and the people that don’t are rewarded with more hours.
bad,Upper management are all about money not customers or employees and the store management is horrible as well i worked really hard to get promoted and i had every right to get promoted but never did i did majority of the labour intense work while helping customers and management and other employees barely did anything i was treated unfairly i was never giving the due credit i deserved i was very loyal to the company and managers when they didnt deserve my hard work or time i showed up numerous times when no one else would i hope tractor supply will change for the better in the future for other employees sake and customers but i doubt it due to the way the upper management and store management is which is terrible.
bad,"Management does not communicate. The right hand does not know what the left is doing. Ethic and Safety violations every day. HR and 3rd party group contacted several times, nothing done! Bonus programs rolled out but never followed up on and only the asst manager received a bonus. Recycled materials collected but no one sees the money except management!"
bad,Had several managers in a short period and they didn't know the job. There were favoritism and employees talked inappropriately in front of customers.
bad,"Cashiers stand all during work time, no benefits, no perks. There is nothing about this place that is positive. Pay sucks starting out, and raises suck worse than I ever thought!!"
bad,when I first started here I loved my job then It became a chore just to go into work. the hours are unreliable. you get called in at a moments notice. there is no set schedule from week to week and the management is another thing entirely. the management has been known to sexually harass its workers and human resources does nothing about it. they will expect you to do everything but the management will do nothing.
bad,"I worked for the DC in Casa Grande for about 3 1/2 months, hours we crazy they expected you to do above and beyond and hardly give you enough time to do it. I got a write up because they were low on work and kept sending me places that had no work and not even in a area I was trained in, they said I had to much down time but refused to send anyone home in my department, Management is all over the place they play favorites. I came into work my last day and they had no work but expected me to just find something to do which there was absolutely nothing so instead of getting another write up I left, and I'll never look back."
bad,"The district manager kept pulling managers in and out of our store, and eventually took our manager and transferred him to another, and took our assistant manager and transferred him to another store also. It was hard to find leadership and continuity."
bad,They dont work with you. They don't understand you have a life outside of work . They are ridiculous with what u get untroubled for like I got in trouble for how I walk . They dont understand that people get sick. I gave them a doctor's note up to the 14th. They said take as long as u need it's fine u dont have to c ok me back in the 14th an it took me a lot longer to get better an then they called me and threaten to right me up for not calling in when they said it was fine. An they changed my schedule without talking to me first to hours I told them in the interview I couldn't work so I said I'll have to leave if u dont change my hours they said they would but never did so I quite.
bad,Bad bossing no way to move up the Chain the people don’t show that they care about there workers and don’t have a friendly environment but the best part is leaving that place
bad,"This was the worse company I have very worked for! They keep and employed druggies for there management, and managers have no clue what products the have in store! It’s sad customers know more than employees! Also as a former employee never ever recommend them for any person to work for! Very sad!"
bad,I've been working for this company for a year and a half now and all I hear is drama I have bad co workers who dont do anything and I always get other peoples responsibilities put on me because I'm the only one who does anything
bad,"upper management, district and above are liars, I would never suggest anyone work for this company.  I have nothing good to say about this company, would never recommend"
bad,"They have weak leaders who are good story tellers."
bad,"Where to begin. I was hired for part time but worked full time hours never got moved to full time, so sick time, no benefits. The store manager was lazy he took a 2 hour lunch. we got an half hour. They would lie find reasons not to give a raise.  This place will use you and not care. Do not apply here you will hate it"
bad,"Management staff is rude and unwilling to help. The management team talks about how bad of a place it is to work, they allow you no hours so the managers work most of the hours."
bad,"Hated working here, management turned there heads to accidents, as well as customers, and store problems. Management sat in the back of the store talking for hours and ignored customers. Manager would get disrespectful with customers and ignore them constantly. You were only liked if you were the managers pet, and it gave you a free pass to joke around and spread rumors. Employees and management constantly joked around and only few actually did there jobs. The ones that did there job left because of how they were treated. People who did their job poorly were treated better than those who went above and beyond for their job and received little pay. Inventory was constantly off and people would drive over an hour to get a product that wasn’t even there and management did nothing. You were thrown out onto the sales floor when you first start working there without any training or employee handbook. People were fired without write ups or warnings for simple things. Employees joked around on their job and never put things away correctly on freight, customers constantly complained and nobody did anything. Never had things stocked correctly. Customers who were loyal stopped coming due to lack of customer service and because of the overall experience. Management was allowed to do whatever they wanted but if a cashier needed a 10 minute break from standing up there all day after a stressful sale, they were laughed at and couldn’t get breaks. Absolutely hated the experience here. Can’t count how many people who were GOOD workers, quit because they were taken advantage of and talked down"
bad,Just an AWFUL culture that has deteriorated rapidly over the years with the current executives.  They carry around missions and values cards and try to preach it to the associates but have no desire to follow it themselves.  They purposely have restructured the bonus program on Store Managers to make the bonus unreachable. They have also eliminated stock options allotted to anyone below a district manager. Be prepared to work 60+hrs a week with no recognition or appreciation by anyone.  Annual raises are 1-3% and based upon NOTHING.  The worst performing person in the department would regularly get 3% raises...its laughable. Don't bother speaking with HR because they will not do anything that operations doesn't support.
bad,I wouldn't work for tractor supply ...not so friendly manager ...he was rude to his employees ...you work hard to keep everything stocked and all the manager did was yell that you wasn't working fast enough
bad,"This is the worst place to work, if you want to dislike your job this is where you go. The discount is very sparse, you get paid $9 an hour starting off, you basically break yourself for no money. The management gives you trouble when you call out or cant come in on your days off. There is tons and tons and TONS of drama, they hire nothing but lazy people and they target certain people to write them up. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL place to work."
bad,The manager stuck every female working there on the register and would not let them work anywhere else. I felt like everything I did was questioned or the wrong thing to do. The managers do not offer any helpful feedback. You do not get any paid vacation days no matter how long you've worked there unless you're full time. It felt like an extremely hostile work place and no one ever got along. Best part was the customers. The discount is also about pointless to have. It only discounts items up to a certain monetary point.
bad,"Tractor Supply company is a back stabbing company. If your not in bed with management you go no where. If your not kissing butt you go no where. You can bust your butt all day long and get nothing for it . Prices are to high. They don't have veterans discounts or even help our veterans. No delivery for those who can't get what they need because of lack of transportation. Poor management,slave drivers. I don't recommend anybody working or visiting TSC they are not worth it.Some employees have lack of knowledge on the stuff that tractor supply carries"
bad,Tractor Supply was a bad experience that was Driven by the poorest Managment you could ask for It's not the company Managment just don't care about employees that work hard and that are honest  . Managment is dishonest . They talk about all employees that work their and it's never good no matter how good of a employee they are . Managment all sticks together to save their own jobs .
bad,Come in to work the manager on duty will tell you what to do and when you would call for help or backup at the register no one would come up until you called them 3-4 times. The management treated the employees poor and every worker hated going to work because we were under paided for the amount of work and stressful situations we had to go through.
bad,"did not learn anything "
bad,Tractor Supply sucks they don't take care of their part time employees and they are extremely sexiest towards women. They don't give you the chance for overtime and they play favorites.
bad,"The company doesn't care about its people at all. The stores are unsafe, hours are long, and there is zero room for advancement unless you know someone."
bad,What a terrible place to work Employees that are Loyal do not stand a chance I worked for company for close to 3 years always enjoyed it had great customers .The management is horrible district manager you can't trust . I can't believe this company lets the Loyal employee suffer because of Extremely poor management I would not recommend working for TSC Bad Experience !!
bad,"Will wear you down, doesn't pay enough for workload, nothing you do is good enough, management is a joke, never enough help on floor,gossips about all"
bad,"Our mngr walked out without telling anyone he was leaving to be manager at another store. Current assis. Mngr takes multiple smoke breaks but never lets me use the restroom. If I don’t take a break the manager or team lead changes it so I don’t get paid for that extra thirty minutes. Breaks are not long enough. No matter how long you work you only get 30 minutes. Management doesn’t listen to my schedule. I work every Sunday and Saturday and holiday which is unfair as I am a college student and barely get to see my family anyways. I was promised a raise and training on the floor which I haven’t gotten. Customers are extremely rude to me and I get no back up from management. Instead of constructive talks I get yelled at if I’m not doing something correct or I don’t get new loyalty members. Employees don’t show up to work half the time and don’t call in and don’t get in trouble. I worked by myself on a busy day because my team lead was hungover and she didn’t get in trouble for that! But I get yelled at for being away from the register as she’s sitting in the break room on her phone. I’m not getting paid enough to work two jobs and deal with rude customers all day long. I’m always busy while the ones working on the floor sit around and talk and get nothing done. And I get yelled at if clothes aren’t straightened up properly or I get yelled at by customers because no one is helping them. Terrible employees, terrible managament and pay is awful. So not worth it working here."
bad,"no commuication, lots of gossip and assumptions, flexiable on work hours, some other employees were ok, customer were nice, the hardest part of the job was watching alot of favortism."
bad,"Everything and I mean everything was drama related. I have so many bad things to say about this company. The management is so poorly handled when I was working there and while I was getting ready to leave. The coworkers are so rude and there is constantly unneeded drama flying everywhere. I just think the environment was unprofessional, and would never work there again."
bad,They are not what they seem. The have values that sound like they are a great company and at the beginning the were but they do not believe in any of the values that they preach to you.
bad,nobody really belong there they should pick good people to fit  the job I don't even like to go shop there at all the store anit very clean but enjoyed working for the style of company if they knew what they was doing
bad,"This place has a high turnover rate, there is no advancement. Management and Supervisor are not supportive they have their pick and chooses. The attendance policy is awful they give you and point and take your PTO when you miss a day. During the sum meetings you can never ask questions so basically your concerns are NOT IMPORTANT to this company they only worry about your production.."
bad,the management was terrible they would yell at you in front of the customers or loud enough to where they could hear. they were unorganized and I would not recommend people working there
bad,I did not like working at Tractor supply for one they hire people that have no clue about livestock or anything else. I think if your going to work around animal health you need to know about all of it.
bad,From the day I was hired it was always being harassed by management. Not enough training what so ever and very bad attitudes from management. Not enough time given to complete tasks and then written up for not enough time. Constantly scheduled one manager and one cashier which resulted in having a customer pile up and chores pile up before leaving. I don't reccomend anyone take this position because it is not worth the stress. Take longer to find a job that won't be a temporary fix.
bad,"It was a bad experience all the way around. And when I left the company, I asked to be contacted so that I could explain my grievances with someone in HR or senior management. I was never contacted."
bad,"No help"
bad,The new manager didn't like me and i am going to college so he was rude and treated me like i was ignorant. So for me it was not a good place to be so I left.
bad,"Horrible management, lack of responsibility and communication between management and staff. Hires mainly high school kids who just want a check and don't care about anything else."
bad,"This is a great job for if you don’t have any bills to pay. Management is very clicky and extremely rude , get screamed at for asking to take a break, have to ask every time to use the bathroom when your up front. Very hostile work environment , they have no idea how to train new employees or fit them in. Defiantly not worth the stress or time."
bad,"Employed at Hamburg location for 3 years and had a second part time job. Manager didn't accomadate my schedule and treated me unfairly with stupid ""write ups"". She scheduled me on days I had unavailable then wrote me up when i didn't show up for my shift even though someone else covered it for me. She feels as if she has to dictate her employees which is wrong."
bad,"Started out great, I enjoyed most of my co workers. Bad management ruined it for many people. I would not recommend working for Tractor Supply company. Employees are under paid."
bad,"I worked there for almost a year and i didn't like it because i wanted to become team lead and the manager at the time kept trying to put it off and then decided to hire a new set of people and offered one of them the position i was asking for, for about 3 months. Then after almost a year of working there and him finding new people as well one of the new employers i hate threatened to kick my butt and my husbands and my manager at the time didnt feel like that was a threat and a harrassement so i felt unsafe and didnt like being at work anymore so i quit"
bad,My typical day included working with a diverse group of people. My day entailed driving a fork lift and whatever other duties that were required of me throughout the day. The environment was busy and always fast paced. There was always something to be done and tasks to be completed. The most challenging part of the job was the pace at which the supervisors expected things to be done.
bad,loved the people i worked with the manager did not know what he was doing and was very ride to his employees and did not care to have an agruement with employees in front of customers. WORST PLACE TO WORK
bad,"If you need a job, just a job, with no advancement possibilities and lots of sweat rolling, this job is for you. Don't worry about that open door policy, its open to EVERYBODY; your business is everybody's business right down to the clear lockers that the boss inspects after every clock-in, break, and clock-out. Most days, other employees know your pay amount before you do. Your first vest is free but you pay after that.  Plain and Simple ---DON'T WORK HERE"
bad,The experience is not good when you have been given a long term contract and the contract is terminated  due to lack of work.  I would never work at this company any more
bad,"I worked at the one in Glasgow, KY and I liked it at first until they started threating to fire me! I just got tired of constantly being criticized and some of the other employees were really nice but most of them weren't!"
bad,The work and hours were fine but the shoft leaders thought they were better then everyone and were always trying to make you look bad when in fact they were the ones making the mistakes
bad,"Terrible managment, stressful work place, fast pace. A very unorganized company with terrible leadership. The most enjoyable part of my day was getting to leave."
bad,"Offloaded inbound merchandise and verified shipping, SKU and receiving labels were accurate prior to dispersion. "
bad,"Managers lie and will cause drama. They will attack your personality. Management lied about my pay and threatened me everyday to replace me with someone who they can pay less. Do not work here, go work at McDonald's."
bad,Tractor Supply was a decent place to work if you could get past the fact that it was dirty and the other employees don't want to do their jobs.  The company is dirty they hire you then fire you weeks later if you have a criminal background.  Even if that info. was provided during the interview process.
bad,"Lack of leadership, will cut throat you at any given time. Everyone does their own thing.  Meeting new people everyday was exciting, but not the leadership."
bad,team members were under payed and we were treated badly and were under payed only the managers there can make a living wage for only working every other day
bad,"Tractor supply has a very small staff with a lot of work to be done. The pay is poor, the work is hard and there really is not room for advancement. I would not refer anyone to work with this company."
bad,The conditions were less than beneficial. No one wants to help you during your job and no one wants to cover for you; long hours without break and a small lunch if you're lucky.
bad,"The company has very arcane practices that are detrimental to its success and impossible for the locations to fulfill. They believe that constantly changing the merchandising adds to sales. In reality customers are irritated that the departments are always changing, and pricing is now constantly going up to increase the average ticket...that is until the customers realize it. They have cut hours so deeply that you can't accomplish the tasks they require and they don't care. They portend to be family oriented but the opposite is true. You will have to work at least 6 day weeks and 10+ hour days to have a location that still can't get everything done!"
bad,"I worked there for almost 7 years, and in that time frame my career didn't go anywhere. The positions are pretty much stagnant. It is difficult to move up into management, as you have to wait quite a long time to even be considered."
bad,I was very excited to work here when I got hired. I never got the benefits I was promised when I was hired. There was zero communication with my managers..was very dissapointed working here. I did love my customers and did learn a lot about retail and did get customer service training.
bad,"the manager is not the best to work for very judgmental. If you are a had working you will never get the appropriation that you deserve, you always feel like your not good enough."
bad,"Over worked under paid.  Had me helping others with their work and could not get my work done. Management keep me from doing my job and I would get wrote up. Was hurt on job, hernia and left shoulder problem. Used up all the workman comp."
bad,its a very welcoming once you start working there and then every employee ive encountered became very rude and nothing but gossip and nonreliable I will never work for this company again.
bad,Lets go this way in 9 months 13 people quit or were fired. The ones fired called the anonymous hotline and human resources ended up telling the store managers who was calling.  They got them fired.  Was told to pick a side management or employees.
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful. You are assigned too many tasks in a short amount of time, and as a member of management you are required to do too much, for too little. They do not pay, or care about their employees like they should."
bad,Short breaks with long hours. Lots of weekend work and work on holidays. Lots of outside work in all types of weather. Upper management is tough to work for.
bad,"Terrible unless you can't get any other job. I worked there for long enough to watch the company take a nose dive. It puts profits before customers and employees. When I started, it was a much different environment. It's the Wal Mart of the farm stores. Exceptionally high turnover of underpaid, overworked employees tells the actual story."
bad,"Management is horrible the environment is bad amd none cares for customers,management is self centered and have no direction and managing a place.never work there again...management takes more breaks then they do work never worked in environment where management doesnt care about the will being of others."
bad,"Low wage, no respect from management managers nonprofessional, managers have zero personnel integrity poor training program"
bad,It was once a decent job until they hired in a lazy manager who did literally nothing but easy stuff and forced the staff to do all the dirty hard labor jobs and would cut hours on the schedule making it hard to make end meets. DO NOT WORK AT THE TSC IN SALINE! They replaced all the staff that had worked there for years with a bunch of high schoolers who don't know anything about the store making it extremely hard to get what you need. They also pay the workers very poorly for the effort they do and have all the money go to the upper managers and corporation.
bad,"Underpaid, overworked. You do a lot of work here for not barely making any money and being treated poorly from the higher up management and other employees."
bad,I worked there for over a year and was treated poorly. I was always the one working hard while no one else did. Management was poor and the pay wasn't worth the stress.
bad,The management doesn't like to keep the stores in the loop of upcoming programs.  They do not stand up for their employees.
bad,"Tractor supply isn't a bad place to work if they would stop treating there employees like numbers ,and firing people over every little thing they do, I think they need to start with the management, treat your employees good and they will work hard for you, don't lie to them, show them the same respect you want instead of just caring about your self ,, and firing someone just before the holidays, tractor has the worse turn over rate out of any company I worked for"
bad,"Come to work, supervisors never happy with what we got done the night before. Always were pushing us to get numbers up. How can we get numbers up if we only get one day off a week. We were working Monday thru Saturday."
bad,"This place has no respect for others unless you are an assistant manager, manager, or have worked here for 5+ years. I hope people will reconsider working here."
bad,i worked there for three months and after about two weeks i was ready for another job got tired of the managment and the way they run things managment does not follow corporate rules its just not worth going through fuss they give u honestly
bad,"Never gave me days off, worked 32 days straight no off day in the offseason. Management doesn't care about employees. They trick you in training to make u believe you can grow with the company which is far from true."
bad,I did not enjoy working at TSC. Very poor management and employees lack skills and also lack a clean safe work environment. Pay was not good.
bad,"Fun and nice place to work with a supportive team.  The company is always changing, but that is given in our day and age.  Very enjoyable place to work hope to work there for many more years to come."
bad,"Work day was random and never did what my job title was. I learned how to balance work, even when more is added. Management was horrible with no leadership. Co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was having every position in the store added to your own. I did not enjoy the job at all. Even after making them the number one store, driving sales, and keeping moral together, they let me go. The district manager had to make up an excuse to fire me because he knew I would not quit easy. Good company but the high stress with very low pay, and poor management made it a not very good workplace."
bad,It was a friendly place to work great management and staff. I was a case picker so i had to pick orders for on line customers everything from lawn mowers and fences to bags of dog food. I had to use the head sets that was set exactly to my voice. Keep up with the picking orders and turn them in at the end of my shift.
bad,"I have never worked for such a poor employer in my life. Was lied to on many occasions about fixing my schedule. I'd work one night until 9p.m. and have to be in the next morning at 5a.m."
bad,"Worked there 5yrs. I worked hard there, was promoted several times, they fully paid relocation 4hrs away for me, I did great for them. However, they started changing their culture about 3yrs ago.  When the original executives that build this company up, started retiring, they began pulling in ex-Walmart / Dollar General executives and managers. Took the ""Fun"" of a Farm/Ranch store out of the job. Forced to pay terrible wages to the team members who worked very hard, so the turn over was huge and raises were out of the question if you had a good worker. Never had enough payroll for staffing, so your customer's were not getting helped properly.  If you are salary, you WILL live there!  They have this attitude that you should feel honored to work for low wages and give up all your personal life because they are this ""Awesome place to work for"" ""A growing company with tons of advancement"". The brainwashing worked on me for a few years. They are good at it. You can move up to any position you desire.  But beware! When you have issues with their H.R. dept, you will get burnt quickly! And there is an H.R. issue around every corner there. They encourage tattling so extreme, that you cannot manage an effective store for them. They feel they are the best place to work and people are dying to get onboard with them. If you are a manager and you try to discipline a team member, watch your back, cause they will not take the manager's side, they will fire you faster than a subordinate.  Your bosses will turn their back on you quickly.  However, you are held responsible when the team member"
bad,"Just poor management, entry level employees are considered disposable"
bad,"discounts of  pet food"
bad,Worthless Company. Idiots for Assistant Managers & Store Managers. If they only had a clue how bad they were.
bad,"Despite values stating ""balance"", there was never regard for my end of a shift.  Very rarely were employees able to clock out when scheduled, and the schedule changed multiple times per week without notification of the change.  Worst management of any store I have ever worked or shopped.  Would tell customers anything to get rid of them so he could go on to the next task.  Employees were treated with no respect and expected to put TSC above everything else in their lives.  Hopefully a location issue rather than a corporate value.  I won't even shop there now.  Very disappointing."
bad,Promise future nothing but lies district manger lie about most of the things going wrong in the store along with store manger mostly put the blame on his management team worst place ever
bad,"Started at the new store in Homosassa, FL. We all worked very hard to get that store up and running, put out most of initial inventory with no AC (and one afternoon no lights) worked around electricians so they could open as scheduled. "
bad,"I have always dreamed for working for tractor supply. The manager I had is completely awful. The assistant manager was very young and was only in it for his self, didn't matter about his other co-workers. Manager would talk about me in front of other customers. When they would come in and ask if hiring, he would say If I fire her you will have a job. He would constantly ask me to work off the clock. When I ask for more hours, they would give me more that week then change the schedule while I'm not there then try to write me up because I was late when I had no idea of a schedule change. The co-workers and customers were about the only good thing about this job"
bad,"I have been there over a year never Called in not one time,worked anytime they would ask me.the manager is not good to his workers if he likes you you will get more hour, ive heard him talk bad about every workers he's got. The District manager is a person with no personality and does not care about the workers at all. Just Himself & You making The Goal for the month that way the Manager & Dist Manager get their bonus! You work hard all month and your bonus is a Big $30.. That sucks !! They will work you long hours on Truck day is it. The manager at South Williamson is not good to his workers.Bad management"
bad,worked foir an awful boss dont even apply here sell your truck bmw or what ever you don't need....
bad,Very Busy store with new team members trained. Upper management not fair at all.
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. the management personnel is lazy and sketchy. the work load is far greater than compensated for. they cannot make consistent schedules to save their lives. I know that I am leaving out a lot of details...
bad,"Acts like a down home American country store.  It's all fake.  Cheap junk from china.  All corporate greed.  Gutted benefits, low wages, terrible management, might as well work at a fast food joint."
bad,"Too many dumb rules, management have favoritism towards pretty girls, ( if you get hired, you will see what I mean)."
bad,"This company I believe at one point had good intentions and a sense of value for their employees and customers but that’s all gone now. TSC has grown ahead of corporates control. DM’s say a store manager gets to run the building like their own business but still call all of the shots and have final say on just about everything. The DM over the Ripley, WV store is worthless and has ran it into the ground by not allowing good store managers to run it the way it needs to be"
bad,"Run dont even waste your time , had i known how catty some people are i wouldnt of wasted 3 weeks of my time . "
bad,"I was passed over for a promotion I was told I was getting.  I was always early. Completed my tasks as well as other's.  Have years of management and forklift experience but could not rely on co workers or management to enforce others being on time when I had to pick my children up by 5:00 pm."
bad,"Manager too busy to explain the job throughly. Other employees all part time,and in school. So I felt just kind of lost for the first three months; Holiday Season !!!!! So it wasn’t the best time to get hired. It made me feel totally incompetent and I had no support from my manager."
bad,It was a great place to work too much drama. Management changes all the time. So they forget rules. Their are alot of rumors about managers sleeping  with each other.
bad,"I was very excited about working here when the distribution center opened. Worked there for over six months before getting migraines from the LED lights in the warehouse, talked to my supervisor about it and he said he would do something for me but kept putting me on a machine that was causing the migraines after I told him what was causing the migraines and how to avoid them multiple times. Throughout the 12 hour shifts I would get bounced around each department because of lack of employees and told that I wasn't reaching my numbers in my actual department. As soon as my supervisor knew about my migraines I got treated like an outcast."
bad,There is no advancement. They have their picks they show favoritism. Management sucks. They have no experience in managing other employees. They were promoted by kissing behind to work their way up. They are unfair. They don’t what’s going on in your life if you have sick kids or whatever they want you at work or it counts against you. I would never work for this company again if they doubled the pay
bad,Very difficult place to work. Very high turn over amongst management. No job security at any level. Revolving door. Started in 2014. The entire management staff is new.
bad,Management is a bunch of young unexperienced people who have nothing better to do but make the work environment feel like a elementary style setting with strict rules that only apply to the regular hourly workers and not to supervisors or management. The morale is at an all time low for the Macon DC. If you report to corporate you will be frowned upon and eventually once they find the smallest mistake you make you will be terminated
bad,"This company has not figured out that the need to pay people accordingly for the work load placed on their shoulders. They expect employees to break their backs for the company with little recognition or pay. Management is allowed treat employees horribly without any repercussions. I spent everyday crying because the manager was bullying me. Called hr they told me to call my district manager. Called him, the first time we had a meeting. He told the manager that she and I were both doing a great job and that we just needed to communicate better. Nothing changed. Called him again this time he was “tired of it” constantly covered for the manager. Finally had enough and left a company I worked hard for 10 years at. They have gone down hill and have no respect for their employees."
bad,I worked at the Corporate Office and absolutely hated the change of management in a short period of time. There was no moving up in the position I was in. If my son was sick I would get scolded for having to leave to get him. They put me on shifts where I could not pick up my son on time. Overall I think the position was horrible not the overall company. They need to change something. Crooks.
bad,Was promised room to move up to full time when I was hired. After talking with a couple of other employees one of which had been with this tractor supply for a year plus some and still hadn't received full time it set off red flags. Turns out they promise everyone full time when they hire them. Not somewhere I would return to. Good luck if you get hired on here
bad,"First off, I’d like to make it clear: nobody on their management team knows what’s going on. They praise themselves for working for such a successful company but they forget that they’re only on the distribution side of things, and while that is important for many businesses big or small, you can’t go around acting like you’re better than someone else just because you’re in a leadership role at a dusty warehouse, which is what all of the supervisors here do. They do not treat you like a person here, you are only a means of production to them. They do not care if you’re hurt, sick, or tired. They could care less about staying open on days where we have 6+ inches of snow, they expect you to come to work anyway regardless of how far you may live. Management will not even talk to you unless they’re talking to a group of people because they all lack people skills. Management/HR are a massive “buddy” system and they do not promote from within. My supervisor was neighbors with the original GMs and that’s how he became a member of management. Mandatory overtime every week for the weekend shifts which is very inconvenient for people who chose to work weekends in the first place, usually due to lack of having a baby sitter or working a conflicting schedule with your spouse. "
bad,"I was a team lead for the Hillsborough, NC store for 2 years. I loved my customers and just the overall job itself until we got a new Store Manager. She would curse and yell and threaten our jobs. She would make employees change their time so they wouldn't go into overtime and get her in trouble. She micro-managed and would lie to the DM to make her look good and others look bad. All the good employees are now gone."
bad,At this store it is more like a high school where if you are not already best friends with the management then they treat you badly. You are promised full time hours but aren't given even close to full time. You are told too many ways to do your job and get written up for failing to do even the most minor thing wrong rather than taught how to correct it. Even when you go above and beyond for both the store and the customers you don't get any recognition for it.
bad,"The management team was a culture of liars and slackers...each covering the other's backside by throwing employees under the bus when the @#$% hit the fan. During my time the manager and assistant lied to employees, customers, vendors, the district manager and service providers."
bad,"mandatory overtime every week, heavy lifting, short breaks, long hours, hot in the summer, hot in the winter, dusty dirty working conditions, mice everywhere"
bad,This is not an ideal place to work if you want to be able to move up. Associates  are allowed to play too much and very rarely get enough work done. They have very poor management. This would not be a long term place of work.
bad,"The company as a whole with their policies of cutting hours on a weekly basis just because the manager feels the need is ridiculous. I worked a full time position for nearly two years and rarely got more than 30 hours a week. They ""consider"" that full time. No place yo provide for a family. I actually think their business model is a joke."
bad,Company talks about a good balance of work and family...LIE. If you are salary you live there. The company does not care about the employees and the pay is very poor.
bad,"As far as the management was concerned, all they cared about was getting their egos stroked by upper management.  I was cut on hours being the receiver, threatened to be written up,and tossed everything that management didn't want to do or knew about. I am letting the community know what a messed up company it is."
bad,"never know when you actually get to go home, 15% discount is nice, the training is not good at all, freight days are a mess, but you will meet the nicest customers"
bad,When your team lead does what they are told and employees don't like that you can deal with it. When that employee is still not doing there job and is rude you tell your store manager you need a meeting with this employee to fix the issue. what you do not do is hire this employee's husband and keep either one of these employees after the husband comes to the team lead and address these issues like he is going to do something about it. this is a hostile work environment!!!!
bad,"Poor management, low hours, sporadic schedule, stressful work environment. They will work you to death at tractor supply for a little over minimum wage, there is absolutely no room for advancement in this company. The turn over rate is outrageous and the stress is unbearable"
bad,"The pay is good, but the communication  between upper management and production workers is nonexistent. Also, during the yearly evaluations,  employees are not given the scores and raises they truly deserve. They are constantly taking on more work even though they are understaffed, overloading employees to the point of exhaustion from working 50+ work weeks of physically demanding work which, in turn, makes the turnover rate ridiculous."
bad,"A raise is literally a few pennies and the store is like a zoo. The management doesn't do anything about it, the sales are going down the drain.One of the managers even cusses out customers and workers but the Store Manager and above does nothing."
bad,"love the customers, different rules for different people.  I am a policy and procedure girl.  I like rules but when they change for no reason I have a problem with that."
bad,"Not enough pay, Lack of work, Not enough hours, low pay, less benefits. Too much work put on only one person, lack of knowledge, Not that busy. Very very very much lack of communication"
bad,The store manager never took care of any issues within the store. Always forced others to work all night shifts and sundays. The assistant was extremely unethical and did questionable things. Worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"It's a job. The owners run the company cheap and their workers hard to make a big profit. Management will reward your hard work with more work so it's best not to show you can work hard. Otherwise, be prepared for extra work from then on."
bad,"Management was poor, not any raises or bonuses. they were cut throat whatever to make them money. very unprofessional. this job would only be good for a second job or a student needing a little extra money"
bad,The management is very poor at that store. People normally only last 6months then quiet. Fun work though if you like  agriculture and talking with farmers. Customers where probably the friendliest out of the employees and managers. Very low pay and starting out only 15 hours or less a week.
bad,Good place to work with the people that work withyou but the supervisor would get real nasty with you talk about people behind your back and call people bad names and get in an argument with you over nothing
bad,The company doesn't pay well. No work life balance. They reward team members that purposely target others to get ahead. No payroll and no loyalty. Customer service is a focus but due to under staffing it is not possible.
bad,Poor management was a main issue. The schedule could change day of and there would be a write up for not knowing. Organization and advancement were no where to be found. The sales team had no product knowledge was not required too.
bad,"Underpaid for the work expected, poor local management.  Not enough leeway in practices.  Not one of my better choices for employment."
bad,"The management has such poor communication because they simply don't care. Store management doesn't care because of how terrible the company, itself, treats us on the store level district and regional Managers are just simply ask WAY too much of you and then after you've worked so hard they yell at you at how terrible it is, cut your pay, retaliate. Really there just is no management there because nobody cares about their job quality. The company tries to screw you around every corner and every chance they can, however it is a typical corporate who can't make up their mind on what they want to do... EVER!! The only up side to this terrible work place is the job security because of how hard it is for them to keep people in the company, you NEVER have to worry about getting fired. Even when you TRY!!!"
bad,"This company hired me as a receiving manager and within a couple of days moved me into Assistant Store Manager position without my consent.After being told as a receiver that I would only have to work 1 weekend per month, I ended up working every weekend. Store manager had no clue how to run a store and was horrible with both customers and employees. The company said they wanted you to have a work/personal life balance but wouldn't even give employees 2 days off in a row. Practice what you preach!!"
bad,"A typical day is busy. I learned the WMS, but I'd rather work 3rd shift the atmosphere is some much better. The hardest part of the job management don't care anything about your life, and family and always deny your request to be off to handle personal business and rather for their dedicated employees take a point."
bad,Constant irregular work schedules. Management that doesn't care. No real advancement. Does NOT pay a living wage even at assistant manager level. You'll make more money flipping burgers.
bad,If you like to bust your butt for low pay and be treated horrible then this is the company for u! Promised advancement but hired people off the street first.  Heavy lifting on a daily basis with zero help.  Never the same hours.  Can't trust anyone in management!
bad,"I was employed by Tractor Supply Company for one year. I was hired in as a ""Team Lead"" which is fancy wording for Head Cashier. At first things went well, it took about a month before I was exposed to favoritism and outright bullying. Three months later I became pregnant, disclosed this information to my Manager, asked him to keep it quiet as I hadn't even told my family yet. By the end of the week it was all over the store and everyone was asking me when I was due. As anyone who has ever been pregnant knows, there are restrictions. I brought in doctors note after doctors note only to catch a serious attitude about the things I was unable to do. I took the time to schedule all of my doctors appointments on Monday mornings so I could be scheduled in the afternoon, and week after week I was scheduled Monday mornings and when I brought it up I was told I was ""asking a lot."" After I got bigger, my same manager would make comments about my weight and tell me I was huge. I filed a complain with human resources and he wasn't reprimanded at all. I asked for a transfer to a different store closer to home and he would tell me I really didn't want to work there and blah blah. He was constantly inappropriate. When I went on maternity leave I contacted human resources to transfer to a different store and my manager blocked my request. So I quit. My advice? Don't work there if you don't want to be bullied and worked to the bone for no pay and awful hours. "
bad,"They pay next to nothing an expect you to work nights,days,weekends! They only hire part time an promise you full time don't believe it! This company cares nothing about their people all they care about is profit for the shareholders ! The only way to advance is be a submissive yes man to the district manager no raises except once a year! No exceptions! The worst place I have worked!"
bad,Was lead to believe that I'd learn alot but in the end they said I wasn't a fit for thier company. I intern said they weren't a fit for me
bad,"Please do not work here, It will stress you out more than that small pay check they give you can relive."
bad,awful place to work management is god awful has no idea what they’re doing so rude unprofessional way too young nasty people no respect and I think your job is more important than school. corporate people are amazing super friendly and nice but just local in store management is just on organized and nasty people.
bad,"Brought in through a temp-to hire agency as a group of about 30 by the end of the second week about 7 were left. Coworkers were mostly nice but i would constantly hear them talk about how we were all going to be laid off by end of year. In my brief time ( about 4 weeks) I was almost never spoken to from management. Almost every other day we all were sent home 2-4 hours early. This was specifically uncomfortable for us temps knowing we were cutting into the available workload of full timers. Eventually people started getting frustrated and giving that attitude to us temps, honestly I didn't blame them. overall the work is fairly intense but doable, but it does not matter if they don't need you they will dismiss you for whatever reason.  They don't even have to give a reason as they dismissed about 20 people in e-commerce after a week because they didn't need them. Passive aggressive management is the name of the game here. "
bad,Tractor Supply  is a very stressful place to work for and some of the upper management  is not respectful to the team member and it not a secure job to work for and they don't treat some of the superviser fairly across the board it like the one who have the most experience in this company get treated with less respect because they are not in the click in other word it a who you know and you don't have experience or if you don't have the experience at least learn from the one that can help you but this disbruition in Macon Ga don't respect their co-worker it not a go place to work for but at first when I got hire with this company it had a lot of respect from the upper management to the team member but not their anymore
bad,Not worth the time or effort horrible management that will work you to death if you let them and show no signs of training or making sure you understood what you were doing
bad,"Management was horrible. The most sexist, homophobic/transphobic, racist environment I have ever been subjected to and it was an employee issue not just by customers. I was harassed by customers on a daily basis and my manager never did anything to support me and basically told me to suck it up and be a big girl."
bad,"I worked there for maybe 4 months.  got hired originally as a team member but never got to leave the cashier even after new employees were hired. I had been promised for 2 months that once someone else gets hired, I'd be able to stock. More people got hired and my hours got cut. I eventually left because my hours were less than 30 and it was obvious that it wasn't going to change. The ENTIRE time I worked there I heard nothing but employees putting other employees down for childish things and how they're just going to walk out and quit one of these days. Every week the assistant manager would swing by a fast food restaurant while going to the bank but stay out for over an hour just because she didn't want to work. The stocker would hide either in the employee lounge and ignore customer assistance calls from overhead or hide outside and claim that they didn't hear anything. The general manager (Who is a huge pathological liar and very good at lying) would give things to other people FOR FREE to make sure the store got a good promotion and then leave for so many hours during the shift to go home to drink. She would come to work smelling like alcohol EXCEPT on the days that she knew that the regional manager would show up. The employees have bad attitudes, especially towards customers and they put things where they don't belong just so they don't have to walk down a different Isle to put it correctly away. The store is always dirty and sticky."
bad,"They will work you a bunch but not compensate you for hard work. You make money for shareholders "
bad,"It is stressed, ""unofficially"" of course. That anyones' employment status can be easily given away and taught to another employee by management. Employees who provided vast improvements within company goals are not give credit. Managers take credit for percentage reports improved accuracy numbers. Not even extending internal praise to the employee that factuated thework."
bad,"First things first, management its a complete joke, the Head manager refused to work with my schedule and constantly overworked me even after countless times talking with him about it. I was currently a student, something management did not give a care about, and was looking for 15 to 20 hours a week tops, but instead, he would give me 25-30 hours a week, something completely unacceptable.  Also, the job itself was terrible, it's slow and the most boring and miserable place I have ever worked at. The co-workers were not friendly and would constantly gossip behind my back, along with all of management. Overall not a fun working environment, extremely toxic, and God awful management. If you're a student, don't waste your time working here and if not just be prepared for misery."
bad,"most store management are incompetent and don't do their job, don't know the real way things work.  workers give their discounts to whomever they want and management knows and does nothing"
bad,A typical day at work at tractor supply was stocking shelves and listening to the one of the managers training you.  The training was not the best as the manager would always look down on you instead of trying to help you.
bad,"Limited training, constant push to meet unrealistic goals,little to no gratitude for employees who work hard for them. All is well in the beginning. Then the companies true colors come out."
bad,"Stressful, long hours and very unappreciated, I worked very hard long hours. After putting in overnight long hours expecting to get overtime pay the Mgr made you take time off to eliminate the overtime"
bad,"Management doesn't care about the job. If you're not liked, don't expect to receive help from employees or management on anything you're required to do. Instead of pulling you to the side to discuss a problem they have with you or your work, they'll talking about you to other employees and fellow management on the sales floor and make your job that much harder to do. You wont get proper training for anything you're required to do unless it benefits them.The money is okay, but definitely not worth the stress."
bad,"I worked at Tractor Supply as a part time employee for about 3 months in the summer. While the co-workers were excellent, everything else was a poor experience. Pay was low and hours were long, often going up to 12 hour days. In addition, there were not enough employees, which caused everyone to be overworked. As a part time employee who signed up for 20-30 hours, I consistently worked 40-50 hours and worked on holidays due to the lack of people. Overall, a very poor work experience and one I would not recommend for anybody."
bad,"Being a team leader comes with a lot of responsibility that inevitably will drive me to quit this job, the management is a joke. Does not listen to your thoughts and concerns. My store manager is the absolute worse, a joke of management. My wage will never be enough to deal with the hard labor and poor treatment of this job. Good Luck to anyone that gets hired."
bad,Poorest excuse of supervisors i have ever seen and they can't figure out why they have a80% turn over rate. People can't make production rate and get fired. Work three holidays a yr. Now
bad,"I believe when you go to work you do not go to make friends or play. You’re there for one reason, a paycheck. If your not there for that then you obviously don’t have bills. Although some people at this work place believe they must get emotional with everyone (aggression being that emotion). I was a team member here but had to leave due to them going back and taking away my hours which I had already worked. The management there is aggressive and do not make you feel welcomed which causes a hostile work environment."
bad,The district manage makes your life a nightmare!They come in bark orders and leaves a  list for the manager then manger leaves it for the lowest person .
bad,The store manager does nothing but tell you what you did wrong. He constantly puts down employees to other employees. You have no staff was causes huge safety issues. You are asked to do tasks such as operate a fork lift that you are not trained properly to do. You are not provided tools to do the job. The cashiers have to provide their own pens There is no proper safety equipment when filing propane. They do not care about your quality of life outside of work just that they have a body in the building. They pick and choose who they fire. It's OK for some team members to break  the rules but not others.
bad,This company discriminates against African American workers. If you are African American that is the first thing that you will notice. human resources have a bunch of woman who don't know anything. so don't come to them with a question about because they wont know the answer. They lack diversity in management.
bad,If you have health issues like I do. I don’t recommend working here got sick and felt super weak and didn’t wanna get hurt at work called off got written up for it. Huge lack of communication your not allowed to talk or to ask a co worker a question suppose to call for a question half the time there is no phone. Pat wise you don’t make enough to earn a living. My advice seek a better job and don’t apply here
bad,I did not like working there but it was something to pay the bills and I thankful toward any employers for hiring me and giving me the opportunity to make a living for myself.
bad,TSC places lazy unskilled people in the roles of Store manager  the blames and holds the associates and supervisors  for the store failures. The HR dept is a jokes and does not help employees when they are being bullied or are being retaliated by the store manger when calls are made and the daily and gross laziness of their store managers. They will remove your overtime behind your back and often toss you under the bus to save their back sides.
bad,Worked as a recieiver no manager at all or district manager that cared about their employees. Don’t waste your time on it. This past week 3 people quit
bad,"The culture at the store I worked in was toxic and nobody cares about you. They fired 6 or 7 management level employees in a few months, just not the right ones."
bad,"This store has an awful manager and assistant manager who like to play favorites. New team members don’t mean anything to them."
bad,"Management lives in their own world. They will make or break you. A good place to get stabbed in the back. Fellow employees are always willing and ready to turn on you. If you are a hard, dedicated worker, they will abuse that constantly."
bad,"The pay for the amount of work required is not okay. You don't really get acknowledged for the hard work you do, and it almost feels as though you are taken advantage of. I believe strongly in the triangle effect within a company as far as you taking care of your customers, your customers taking care of you and your company taking care of you. If the company doesn't take care of the employees, you're going to have employees that don't care about it's customers, which I see a lot within the job. It's really unfortunate considering I see a lot of potential in TSC"
bad,"Tractor Supply claims that customer service, ethics, and integrity are part of their values when 9 out of 10 times they value unethical means by non-management to create drama and run store. Management means nothing to them. a typical day is where shelves are empty or old sales still posted but not valuing customer to honor prices displayed on items. No assistance is given when lines are backed up or for carry outs, and God forbid it should rain and a customer want propane, employees are scared to get wet."
bad,It is no place to work....it sucked....management was abusive and suroundngs were terrible....not a place I would recommend........turnover is a joke there
bad,"Upper management has NO idea how to run the business or treat employees, that's why they have such a HIGH turn over rate. Management has too many groups of ""clicks""."
bad,District Managers are hired in from other retailers. They don't know the everyday routine of a store employee/manager. Employees are underpaid. You are not valued.
bad,Management wasn't ideal. Nothing was particularly hard or overwhelming. Didn't learn much of anything other than loosely followed company policies. I did enjoy when people brought their dogs in the store. Dogs are great.
bad,"they hired me at 17 to witch i did not lie about but i was given the job anyway, then i was irregularly  payed due to my age and was under paid compared to what we has agreed to. i was also treated unfairly do to my age, i would not recommend working their unless you're over the age of twenty four."
bad,I enjoyed taking care of my customers.  I done everything possible to help with  the customer needs.  The upper management didn't know how to handle daily concerns. I have learned that if you are not one of their favorite people then they will work against you in your job.
bad,if you like kissing butt and never having a voice then its a great job. i got fired because i spoke out on their garbage benefits plan they were making worse. so they didnt like me after that and slowly messed with my production rate till i got fired. only work here if you are out of options.
bad,"Work lots of random shifts, Work extremely hard for low pay, micro managed, have no time with your family.  store managers work minimal hours and the easiest schedule. Store Manager makes his own policies and doesn't follow company policies or mission and values of company.  No advancement opportunity due to store managers never leave why would they. when there not expected  to do any of the work and work a great schedule with great pay"
bad,"working 6-7 days a week because management cant figure out how to manage. Rules and regulations are strict for a warehouse type job.If you upset one manager all managers attack you until you are either fired or quit. Corporate management team is no better. when sending emails to managers trying to get a resolution instead it is passed around like a note and you are made fun of. "
bad,"TSC doesn't care about the employees. There is no way to balance home and work life. There is not enough payroll to meet the expectations they have. They have Team Leaders responsible for all signage and merchandising, opening and closing the store and being manager on duty for $9 an hour. Other places start entry level positions at $10 and more with no responsibilities, and TSC wanders why turnover is so bad."
bad,Management didn't let me learn more in the store. My coworkers were rude and didn't know about personal space. They called me a liar for family accidents and death in the family.
bad,"Management is very temperamental, rude to customers then expects employees to smooth over their anger.  No respect for their customers"
bad,Tractor supply is a Great company cooperate wise. Rapidly expanding and good infrastructure. Store level is very disorganized and compensation is below national average. Too much work not enough pay.
bad,"If you are going to work there, work there and go home. Strickly business"
bad,"Near min wage @ 20 hrs. week with 4-5 hr. shifts was terrible for part timers. "
bad,"It was a good place to work at first, then all they had me going was feed! Didn't get any hours but on truck day 5:00 am . Didn't pay much. The manager & Dist manager done care for his employers"
bad,"As the youngest team lead at 27 I thought I'd be working when adults. Nope this place was just as bad as a highschool. Mind you before I got out of the Marine Corps I was dealing with kids who had just graduated highschool and we're more mature. HR is a joke; I have thick skin, but when your store manager ask if you're mentally handicapped for asking questions in your first week that's wrong. HR didn't do anything. Very toxic work environment"
bad,Sm and Dm are terrible. A lot of favortism. Big click if not in it your at the bottom.hours are ok.no training left on own.looking for another job.very few people working at a time 2 to 3 at most.
bad,You never know from week to week what time you go in or get off. Can’t plan anything with family or attend church on a regular basis . I wouldn’t advise anyone who enjoys being with your family or wants to attend church service on a regular basis to work at Tractor Supply. They are job first and everything else is secondary . If you are looking for a part time job and don’t expect much in pay then this is a good place to work
bad,"Don’t call HR because it makes things worse for you, Upper Management treats you like you are just a number. If you are female Upper management don’t want you there and makes sure you are singled out for it. There Mission and Values are a joke."
bad,"Totally just trying to make a dollar, they could give 2 s#*ts about the employees . And for the managers they are all about making their bonus every month and will do whatever it takes to get it. My manager was sleeping with a married employee while I was there"
bad,The manager is the one that calls in sick the most. He is seeing a team member which is against company policy. That team member is getting 26 hours a week when we were all told him we hired in it would be 15 to 20 a week. I'm probably one of the hardest workers they have and I get four hours a week. Mommytime getting up and getting a shower to go to work for 4 hours
bad,"Unorganized, low pay, management is helpful and go out of their way to help, no fixed schedule. ......................................................."
bad,One of the worst places I have ever worked. The store manager at the time was very disrespectful and the work environment was extremely toxic. Working there was expected to be your only priority and if it wasn't they made sure you knew they would replace you. At the time my phone wasn't working properly and they couldn't contact me to call me in so the store manager said I must just not want the job. The costumers that came in the store were almost always rude and treated the cashiers badly.
bad,"Thw company is strong, but.operates with a bonus structure that makes ethic and moral decisions irrelevant . Changes need to happen, putting people that have come up in the stores, in positions where decision making is.possible."
bad,"Receivers are dogged down with unobtainable goals due to schedule, constant load-outs and outdoor resets. "
bad,"Assistant manager will tell"
bad,"even though they preach their ""core Values"" they don't follow them.As a team lead you have to work through your break time due to the fact that they only allow one manager in store at a time due to labor costs. You can not say that you didn't get your break or you will be written up for that as well."
bad,"The overall job is simple and easy but they pay you absolutely nothing and give you 34 hours a week, which they consider full time. Upper management is focused on sales and sales alone. Nothing you ever bring to them is of any worth if it does not pertain to sales. Not worth the headache for $12 and hour at 34 hours a week."
bad,"Management required to work 60-70 hours weekly.  Scheduling of employees is WAY below what is needed to operate, making non-paid overtime mandatory for managers."
bad,The management is really bad. Most of the time I was unsure of what my job was. It would change sometimes daily. Being a cashier I did not get breaks. Some days I would be at the register for six hours with no lunch break.
bad,You would clock in. Then have your subscription meeting. They would tell you that yo uh needed to pick more. The ops mangers had their pickes. If you didn't suck  up and rates people out. You didn't have a chance there. So I resigned
bad,I loved my job at first until we got a new manager and got sudden pay roll cuts. I went from 40 hours a week to 20. It is not a job for someone who needs to pay bills. Good for some extra cash or someone who is retired. Otherwise this isn't the place.
bad,The management is poor they are incompetent keeps the company unstaffed and completely over work. harassment accrues by management but was not reported just dealt with personally.
bad,I dont have much to say about this employer thats positive. Its a job with a paycheck but the schedule constantly changes and there is alot of disagreements in the chain of command
bad,"Company is doing very well overall, yet in the area I was in ,Poor district level Management made it difficult to effectively run the store. For hourly team members, pay is in the $10 an hour and you will work hard."
bad,"Their motto is work hard, have fun, make money. As a whole, the Company is great. Worked in several different store locations that lived up to that motto & made the workday very enjoyable. BUT, upper management tends not to know EXACTLY whats going on in individual stores & allows individual managers to treat their employees however they want to. When a single store has a turn over rate of 99% & has only been open almost 2 years, there is something very wrong in THAT store. The 1st year of operations we made sales plan every single month earning our bonuses. The 2nd year, due to inexperienced store personnel, under-staffing, improper management & or frequently absent management, customers not receiving quality customer service, & general appearance of the store & not being able to locate products, we only made sales plan 1 month out of 12, yet no one thought this was unusual & stepped in to rectify the situation."
bad,"I was a student in high school when I started working here expecting to throw feed and be on the floor but they stuck me on the register and made me do all the nasty cleaning aka the bathrooms, trash, etc.. I asked when I could be put out on the floor instead of being behind the register and they kept saying ""next week'. Next week, they would say the same thing up until a new manager was in training so I asked him and he said never because my title was ""cashier"" unless I wanted to apply again! So they kept lying to me about that! And because I was in school I had to study but they would keep me there until 11pm on weekdays! They just used me to do the jobs they didn't want to do. So I finally left that $#!^ hole!"
bad,"Company does not believe the work ethics they drill into us.  Do what ever it takes to make the sale, please you get fired over it."
bad,"To many promises not enough follow through, I applied for one position given something totally different and hated the demands.  Manager hires another person and says one thing to me about hiring her later when i knew earlier and told by him he was forced to hire her, not a trustworthy person, also a full egomaniac."
bad,"I couldn’t ask to be relieved from the register to go to the bathroom without someone rolling their eyes. I didn’t get my legal 10 minute breaks. One of my team leads actually threw a fit when I asked to go on lunch even though I was about to hit 6 hours, which is against policy. They also did nothing when my truck was keyed by a co-workers girlfriend. The same co-worker was stealing merchandise and cash from the store."
bad,"They would rather believe someone who was there 3 months or less than someone who was trying to make a career at TSC, so in my opinion I believe that person was coached to get rid of me...So can you understand why I am still bitter about it"
bad,"Shareholder value is above all else at this company.   They are a growth company that is based on # of open stores.  I worked in the Information Security team.  Largely comprised of immature individuals, I saw turnover like a revolving door.  Anyone with real skills should consider other options.  Politics get heavier as the food chain progresses toward executives."
bad,"Wouldn’t be a bad place to work if management didn’t completely suck for the most part, if there were actually communication, if confidential things said between associates and management stayed confidential and if they actually paid a decent wage."
bad,Someone just starting out it's ok but when you get into management they put too much on you and no compensation  for the work  you do . Store Mgr are way over payed for doing nothing.The pay sucks
bad,10 out of 10 do not recommend working at the Bluffton location. Unprofessional people. You cant balance a work and home life because the sm and asm don't want to be in there past 2 pm. They don't work weekends either.
bad,Horrible company. Too many tasks not enough time to do them. High turn over due to lack of livable pay rates for anyone under management. Save your time and body. Go flip a burger they pay more.
bad,This company wants exceptional customer service but hires morons. They have rules but do not enforce them. It is a political nightmare that just covers up and avoids problems to make a buck. Employees have no knowledge of equipment and products and are under educated but the company focuses on hiring minimum wage morons to sell dog food.
bad,"The job demands themselves were not difficult, and I liked most of the people I worked with. "
bad,Hard work little pay. Horrible inexperienced managers. They don't care about the workers just the numbers. Do yourself a favor and look for work elsewhere.
bad,Management can curse you out and be told it's hear say which gives them the ok to treat people the way they want also they hire convicted felons with theft charges
bad,It is certainly an experience. Easily understood. Challenging to complete tasks in accordance to policy. Good support system through all the sister store. Easy to learn from coworkers. Needs to focus on proper training so it is easy to understand what is acceptable and what is unacceptable dealing with customers requests.
bad,"I work in Casa Grande AZ at the DC warehouse. The turnover rate here is 79%. For every ten they hire they keep two. The managers and supervision staff are power abessed.  They don't care about the work/life balance they claim exists. Currently it's forty hours a week. About to ramp up to seven days continuous. It was this way from June through the end of September last year. "
bad,Tractor supply gives you 10hrs of computer training to start off. They have changed my hours without asking multiple times. They will give you the jobs that others don't want. They don't train everyone on fork lift and give minimal training. My first day I was working on the floor I got minimal instructions and was left alone.
bad,"Not a bad company but the payroll vs the job demands are ridiculous hard to provide legendary customer service when the work load is constantly piled to high with no realistic payroll to get anything done, Then you add in the burned out angry guy called a manager that works about 40 hrs a week instead of his 52 and leaves his store hanging all the time and cries and complains and cusses why nothing’s done. Bad morale in this store all the good people leave like I will be. Terrible lazy manager but from what I hear from other stores it’s mostly the same everywhere in the company. The mission and values really need revised or at least practiced and not preached. Company is growing to fast and is losing its way. I"
bad,Never met CEO. How would you like to have someone constantly belittle you and threaten your job by continuously making remarks such as youre not going to have your job tomorrow.
bad,"Loved my job, and my assistant managers and other co workers. store manager constantly had attitude towards me and other co-workers. Always made rude and disrespectful comments, never had a chance to sit down and talk to the district manger about his actions I was let go before I could. Comments were also made to other co-workers. injuries were reported and ignored by him."
bad,poor upper management too much favoritism  got along good with co workers  good place to work if looking for a second income   flexible hours work weekends
bad,"I absolutely hated the store I worked in. "
bad,"zero job security, management sucks.. their communication is wayyy off, they treat you like robots, but the money is GREAT. Just don't expect to stay long. They fire then hire left and right."
bad,"They may seem like they are on the up and up at TSC but that is just a front. The company only has their benefits that are looking good for them but after the change in DC, those are getting worse as well. You will get thrown under the bus by the Store Manager just to save their own skin. Despite how much work you put in, they will fire you at the drop of a hat. The district managers are not to be trusted. If you do work here, keep your mouth shut and don't try to advance yourself. "
bad,"I have been there a long time and people come in after me and get more hours and more pay than me. There is alot of discrimmination going on there. The District manager is a person with no personality and does not care about the workers at all. The manager is better now but have a few different ones and not one of them have been fair, the all have their pets and that is who gets the hours and pay. I am looking for a better company that will treat a person fair and on there abilities not the way they look and flirt."
bad,Work like a dog and get nothing in return. Often asked to work later then cut hours for next week. sometimes work off the clock. management can't get its act together. no leader and no team spirit.
bad,"Poor management, lots of workplace politics, especially considering the small size of the teams in the store, and the company preaches ethics they do not practice. Most of the products they sell are subpar; look at what actual farmers say about their products and the lawsuits they're involved in/companies they collaborate to make products with are involved in. The company is very customer service oriented, but it's hard to sell to customers the products they sell when you know they're subpar at best. There's an OSHA violation around every turn in their buildings. The environment is stressful and good luck getting anything done with HR, because they are just an out of building department that doesn't even know or meet the people they're in charge of, and are also involved in the workplace politics."
bad,Manager was awful. Got hurt on the job and they wouldn’t listen when they asked me to do something I couldn’t because if my injury. Just got told to stop complaining and do it so I quit for my own well being and I’m still having to go to the doctor under workman’s comp and its almost been a year since my accident
bad,Tractor Supply is a very physically demanding workplace of all team members.  Their pay for the team is very under-rated for what is asked of the team.  The hours of operation are great but for the past 2 yrs it has consistently taken more and more time away from me and my son.  This is one of my main reasons for looking for other opportunities.
bad,i've worked at tractor supply in Tomah for almost 3 years and I deal with a lot of stuff that shouldn't have to deal with and i'm underpaid for a lot of it. they will also cut your hours if you ask for more!
bad,"Long hours, no bonus as was told at hire, not enough help to get everything done that was supposed to be done.  The mice and rats were horrible.  My suggestions fell on deaf ears."
bad,The store i worked at was terribly managed. A lot of favoritism. I started as team lead. Was later given the reciever position. Then was forced into two roles at once with no pay raise and a manager who refuses to help at all.
bad,"It was very disorganized, I picked up everybody's slack and got blamed for not doing my work even though everybody there for the most part lazy. I had 4 managers and they were all very lazy."
bad,This is a difficult place to work due to stress. Team members are mostly unhappy with hours vs work load. Corporate does not give enough of a payroll to accurately staff this stores location.
bad,"ok place to work.dont treet emploees wlove the productsell, low pay, bad managerment, great customers. district manager was unfair didn't care about the employees. high turn over with staff"
bad,Growth company.  Good Executive Leadership but does not translate to District Managers.  Poor communications and little personal/professional balance.  Lowest percent to sales payroll in retail industry requiring managers to carry the burden.
bad,The work area is full of drama. Pushed work limits. Overtime every day you worked. Hours were short. Didn't enjoy working there at all. Difficult to get along with people there
bad,"staffing levels are inadequate to staff the store.  Can not provide the quality (GURA) customer service that the customers deserve.  This is a hard, fast paced, physical job with little to no down time.  There is not enough staff to properly do your job.  Customers are always complaining about no staff, product not on the shelf, having to wait.  Customers complain about the constant turnover and the associates don't know the products offered.  Operating the store with 1 cashier and one other associate to handle phones, stocking, load outs, receiving trucks, etc. is a common occurrence.  It is also unsafe.  The company is continuously opening new stores yet they don't adequately staff the stores they already have."
bad,"TSC can be a fun place to work. District management very clicky.  Tsc routinely pay $8 to $10 an hour for team lead management. TSC stresses core values like integrity, accountability  honesty, however it was my experience that those values are not followed."
bad,The job gives you no time for a life and the district manager was unprofessional.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bad,"they need to clean house, management, or lack there of ...sucks"
bad,"You work as fast and as hard as you can for 8 to 12 hours. You may be able to squeeze in a 20 minute break on some days, but most days you eat on the run, if at all. Always under staffed for the amount of business and freight you receive. Management is usually completely over-whelmed and overworked with no let-up. The pay is descent, but you earn every cent of it. Upper management is focused only on sales and doesn't care who they run-over to get there."
bad,"There was a girl that worked there that had been shot in the army, so she got special treatment. This girl would bring her dogs to work & play with them all day & if she wasn't playing with her dogs, she was completely ignoring the customers & playing on her phone. The manager was never around. 2 other girls would stock customers on Facebook & date them."
bad,I worked at Tsc for a total of a year. The gm was great but the assistant manager was awful. I dreaded my job there so much. I was treated unfairly. Never given chance to prove myself and never offered any advancement even though position was available. People with no experience were promoted and people quit left and right. We went through at leasst 12 people in 6 months most due to poor management. to
bad,"Not many people enjoy tractor supply. Many come and go as I’ve worked there. Management is horrible, employees are nice though. The store is usually dirty and unorganized. Also treated poorly from time to time."
bad,"TSC Corp executives must make lots of money because store level employees make next to nothing. Always so much to do including endless repetitive busy work with so many price changes and resets. You will work your tail off and it’s never good enough. The customers (most of them), are nice and appreciative of the hard work employees do but that doesn’t pay the bills. Employee discount is only 15% and ONLY on regular priced products. Employees pay the same price as customers for sake or clearance items. Bonus program is distributed by what percentage of payroll each employee is so it’s pretty much mostly for the store manager."
bad,the environment at tsc was very bad from disgruntled employees to managers that don't care about anything but making sure they get their bonuses. upper management are always looking for ways to fire or reprimand all of the employees
bad,It’s a great job if you’re a single person and have no kids. They’re all talk about being all about family and safety but in reality they can care less.
bad,Just save yourself the headache and don't work there. They expect your to move at a pace that is unreasonable. All in all a terrible place to work because of the rate system.
bad,"No place for advancement, don't expect a raise either. Hires a great many part time employees to keep from having to pay benefits, vacation, holiday pay. Hard, hard work with very minuscule pay and the hours are terrible."
bad,"Management doesn't know how to do schedules properly, constantly changing the schedule threw out the week. Understaffed all the time especially on friday-sunday which is the worst days to be understaffed. Requests for days off months in advance go un noticed."
bad,Hard work and they only offer a few full time positions. T work you very hard for low wages wage. Part timers will work all holidays and weekends. Leadership only cares about the bottom line profit
bad,TSC started out great. New store new job. Started as team lead. Working my way towards assistant manager. But the DM hired a 20 something as assistant she worked at Petco. I real kick in the teeth.And the salary does not even come close to the amount of responsibalites you have.
bad,They constantly increase their rates until no one can keep up and they fire you for it. they have the highest turn over rate ive ever seen firing 15 to 20 people every week
bad,"IF you want no family life then Tractor Supply distribution is the place for you! Pay is average, coworkers are great but tired from working 28-30 days at a time!"
bad,The managers have a huge head trip with their titles and put down other employees in front of customers which is a no no in this business since customers don't want to see or hear that kind of nonsense. My first 2 weeks on the floor I had a dozen of complaints from customers about the old and rude manager that could care less about delivering great customer service. No wonder why the store I worked at has an OUTSTANDING turn over rate. Treat employees with respect and they will stay...
bad,"if you don""t mind lift heavy bags of feed this job is for you. the Managers don't work well together. Communication is lacking. The customers are always mad of the lack of origination."
bad,Its all about who you know at tractor supply..managers and supervisor show favoritism to whoever they want. Building relationships with the people in charge seems to be the main key to success....not your work ethic..sad but true
bad,"typical day was either work the cash register or organizing items on the store floor. The manager was not working most of the time so it put more work on his other employees, the other employees were fine and most of the time easy to deal with but to much in the lack of discipline to make it a great work experience. best part were the customers. it was enjoyable to deal with the customers and maybe learn a few things from them"
bad,"It was an ok place to work but a great place to shop and the management were good as well, they need to be a little more understanding of family issues but still a good place to work."
bad,"I was on register every shift for my entire shift. Didn't get to see coworkers much. Certain ones are always in the back talking. "
bad,"only working about a month, I can say that there is not enough employees to provide the type of services they offer.  the employees are overworked and stressed out.  in short the company tries to be a multimillion store with only a handful of employees. wish I would have never taken the job."
bad,Was great till original store manager left to better himself.  He didn't mind rolling his sleeves up to help with anything!  But he himself left because the demands and expectations were too high. New store manager comes into an A+ store and changes every thing to his satisfactory rather than adjusting to ours. He also played favoritism to some while others picked up their slack.
bad,"VERY, VERY low salary. Could not make a living working at TSC as a manager. The store was easy and fun to work at but there is zero room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate to a different part of the state."
bad,"Introverts shouldn't manage retail stores. They cannot easily engage in conversation with customers which is key in making sales. They cannot easily communicate with employees which is key for scheduling, job performance, and overall work environment."
bad,"Poor commitment to employee professional development. Low pay, benefits compared to competitors. Mixed messages regarding customer care throughout company organizational chart."
bad,nothing came out of this place it was so bad i will never send anyone to work there. they did not teach you anything they would just throw you in there like you already knew their system no training what so ever
bad,"tractor supply company is a terrible place to work. there are rats. there are spiders. i was only paid eight dollars an hour and after a year n a half, my pay was bumped to eight thirty an hour."
bad,I am constantly micro managed and ridiculed in public. Your suppose to be able to walk into a Tractor Supply and not know who the real boss is but our GM lets everyone know he is the main boss. Even if you know the answer to a customers question he will purposely tell you that you are wrong in front of customers to try and degrade you and then he will give the same answer .
bad,"Fast pasted and a lot of customer service, some days it can be crazy and overwhelming but all in all it’s not a bad job most of the employees ore very easy to get along with others not so much."
bad,Would not recommend anyone to work here. Management is awful if they don't like you. They will find ways to either make you quit or get you fired. They will lie to make you look bad. Corporate will always believe management over employee. This place sucks. Stay away.
bad,this company mass hires to get a new store open then lets half the people go.   this was the most despicable thing i have ever seen in my career in retail.
bad,"they do not schedule you more than a few hours a week, and are un-willing to schedule more hours to current employees but rather hire new employees at a lower rate and give them more hours to train"
bad,as a new employee and needing help was a inconvenience. sometimes when i needed help there was no manager around. The managers weren't team players they sat around while the associates worked. not a team environment
bad,"Was not the opportunity i was looking for. The job was stressful, and very repetitive. Moral and motivation to work was unhealthy and very low as a whole."
bad,"This store is full of drama, and snooty employees who believe they are better than everyone else. It’s a constant stress even when you’re not there. I would constantly get text messages about things that could wait until i was at work."
bad,Management has no clue what is happening and simply ignores the team. A typical day at work involves doing everyone else job and simply not enjoying the work environment.
bad,"I worked at Tractor Supply for 2 years. Though I was a part time employee, I often worked 39-40 hours per week, regularly being expected to come in at 4am and 5am multiple times per week and stay until the work was finished. This often resulted in 10-12 hour days. On one occasion, a truck came in late and the schedule changed. Those unloading the truck were expected to stay until 1:30am to finish unloading the truck. Breaks were not given every 6  hours. Often we were in violation of state laws because employees were not allowed a second break, but were expected to stay past shift. When I first began, I was thrown on the register with no training from management or a reliable employee. Lastly, conditions were often dangerous in the back room. In one year, there were three major injuries, all because of carelessness and violation of safety rules when it came to stacking pallets and placing stock in the back."
bad,the associates or Tm as they call them are hard working for the most part. However the HR department stays involved in way too much on the floor. the business is still running on outdated programs and does not accept change. Feedback is ignored and never appreciated on ways to make the place better and faster.
bad,"It was a nightmare working with Co-Workers. No one wanted to pick up and help at the register. Security against shoplifting was low, and no help at all."
bad,It was a good company but they will promise pay raises and promotions and full time and will never act on it. Lack of communication is a big factor as well.
bad,In call Washington store management is very rude inappropriate and takes hours from you for herselfEmployees do not do their jobs correctly they stack stuff or it doesn’t go then mix different products with different things they don’t keep their dog food selections stocked up don’t clean the outside property up came back lot is disgusting hail over play stroller please thrown everywhere
bad,Management was not the best. Hours are not as promised. I didn't even get the job that I interviewed for. Was promised 32 hours a week so I would leave my other job then my hours were cut to 28 a week. Also was told there was opportunity for full time after they saw how my work ethic was. Schedules are also not posted until a day or two and sometimes the day it started a new schedule.
bad,management was not great at all. There was no communication and the hours and flexibility was horrible. the crew members in charge were rude.
bad,"They have their favorites, and most the employees are great and other ones shouldn't even have a job"
bad,"Job was great at first then the newness wore off and everyone changed.  They want all of your energy regardless if you have any family obligations, and if you cannot give it to them when asked they fire you without notice.  Management is horrible and the communication there is even worse."
bad,The store manager is never at the stote and if she is always in the office and does not know how to run a store at all. Always putting the blame on others.
bad,Poor management at the store I worked at. They didn't do a good job at scheduling everyone and worked there for 2 years and team lead position open up twice and never got asked if would like the position and was passed over for someone who was not even there for a year
bad,"The managers are horrible. The manager i had would sit in the back everyday, all day long playing a game on his phone or on his phone with another store manager. When you would try to call the manager out on the floor he would never come or take a long time to come out and made customers very angry and the regular associates had to deal with the upset customers. The pay is nothing compared what you have to do task wise there."
bad,young management to immature not professional at all. At times they would not give proper breaks and would leave employees on the register for six hours straight. To demanding for such a low pay grade
bad,There were too many times we had to change managers. No chance for advancement. To many chiefs and not enough indians. Low pay for the amount of work that you have to do. Always understaffed.
bad,"They will work you as hard as they can for as little as they can pay you. Many warehouse employees were promised end of year raises, only to be told later no raises would be given due to budget issues. Health insurance is expensive with a high deductible and barely covers anything. You are better off getting state provided health insurance. Mandatory overtime leaves no time for life outside of work. There are a few good department supervisors, but many poor.. Many supervisors are completely unaware of how their department even functions, and completely rely on shift leads to run things for them, yet they are the ones getting big bonuses while the employees doing the actual work are being worn thin and denied raises they were promised all year. Although shift leads do 75% of a supervisors job they are denied ability to rise in company. TSC will hire from out of company instead of anyone in company. High turn over. No one wants to stay once they see how poorly TSC treats employees. I only give ""would you reccomend working here"" 5/10 because if you are literally desperate for a job they will hire absolutely anybody that can pass a drug test."
bad,"It's an OK job if it's something starting out,  but overall it's a stressful place. It could be a whole lot better if the GM and and assistant manager would do right by paying there workers"
bad,"Typical day is very long and lots of heavy lifting "
bad,"Very high turn over rate. No benefits even if you work 40hrs, you're labelled as PART TIME so they dont have to pay benefits. All about how much they make."
bad,"Being a publicly traded company ruined tractor supply. Extremely minimal staffing, unrealistic goals for stocking and poorly managed stores make for a terrible work environment and less than satisfactory shopping experience. The store is packed to the brim making shopping with a cart nearly impossible and with only two people working the entire store, help is hard to find. The associates work their tails only to get poor ratings from DM visits and getting thrown under the bus by the nowhere-to-be-found manager. The only benefit of the job was the few customers that felt for you, and you grew to know and like. Had it not been for the terrible management, I would have never left TSC. A thoroughbred can only run with mules for so long before they leave in search for more thoroughbreds."
bad,"I worked from 7 until all freight and receiving from Corporate DC trucks had been completed. I enjoyed the physical labor of the job, and the atmosphere with the customers due to it being similar in many ways as to how I live my life."
bad,a typical day of work consists on stocking shelves and interacting with customers as well as cleaning the store at the end of the night management was lazy and did not follow protocol
bad,"Trying to sign up customers for the ""Rewards Program"" or ""Neighbors Club"" is the most ridiculous thing ever. When the district manager comes and fusses at the employees about how we are not making our goal number of signups every week or month, it gets old. Living in a rural area where many of the residents do not have a computer or just simply don't want to join shouldn't make a higher-up start complaining."
bad,"Tractor Supply Company Is a decent Place to work at. Even though the pay is low."
bad,I enjoyed wring at the store and with all the other employees but i did not see eye to eye with the manager and that lead to some complications in the work place as a result i had to leave the store for the first time
bad,The company is not all on the same page as a whole. Management team does not hold associates accountable.
bad,"Hours were never steady, could never work long enough to get benefits."
bad,They over work you. And don't value their workers. They discriminate over your background even a misdomeanor on your record will have you terminated. They will work you through their busy season then drop you before you get your bonus so they don't have to pay it. Poor management and high turn over rate.
bad,"Upper management is not very understanding or supportive. Money over employees. Toxic environment. Very unwilling to help their employees feel needed, valuable, or appreciated."
bad,"TSC is a deceitful organization.  From their hiring practices to their pay practices, they are not protective of their employees or management.  Their training is horrendous.  One should not have to beg to be trained in their position repeatedly for years.  "
bad,"I worked at TSC for 2 years and they have the worst employee turnover I have ever seen. They hold mock interviews for managment positions within the CSC, and then when told how unethical it is to already have offered a position to someone and still hold interviews to save face is, they respond with ""it is a corporate office, we dont have to even tell you guys there is a position available."" If you really need a job that pays a little something, then I say go for it. However, if you are looking for a CAREER don't do it. The only holidays off are Easter and Christmas Day, and there is a rotating weekend schedule. During the black Friday craziness there is mandatory 6 day work weeks."
bad,I will never work there again. They tell you one thing in the interview and then all of that goes out the window when you get hired. At least in the lockhart store.
bad,"You don't get paid enough for the jobs they make you do at work. they want you to do more than 1 thing at a time, and when you don't finish they're mad, because you didn't finish they job you were given."
bad,"They want you to want to work yourself to death. I've always wondered if it was just my store that was kinda bad or if it was the whole company.  Turns out it was just my store. The Lockhart store a coworker went to is apparently very nice and helpful to other team members. "
bad,I loved working with the people I worked with but the management sucks. Wish things were different but I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. The part time people were funny and cool though
bad,Tractor supply does not seem to promote or want to retain employees we lost many employees because they had to work two jobs and management would not work with their schedules
bad,I did not enjoy wokring for this company. It taught me lessons but the management was awful. They did not work and forced employees to do their job. They were mean and cold.
bad,The idea of tractor supply is great but this store in rindge has a horrible manager and the district manager just lets it continue. I would say working at that company would have been better if i didnt have to work under an ego maniac.
bad,"In the past 5 years or so all of the top management that made this company great have left, retired etc. They have been replaced with executives that have failed at other Fortune 500 companies. The missions and values they talk about only apply to store team members. Above store level, they mean nothing and they insist on pushing growth beyond what the DCs can handle. Freight crew schedules change at the drop of a hat and PT team members are expected accept frequent changes to written schedules without question, 'for the needs of the store'. The average customer is not your typical entitled retail customer. They are super friendly, courteous to team members, and honest. They often bring their pets in and know half the team by name. The customers and store team members are the company's only saving grace"
bad,"No benefits, no raise, no motivation, staff were very down to earth people but the company itself was not the company for me or any other employee for that matter."
bad,"Standing at the cash register for hours at a time, helping customers, always kept a smile on my face, the company overall is an amazing company and i loved working there but i did not like the store i was working at, to much drama, worked to much and didn't get paid enough, my manager was not very understanding about the fact that i had school, The store was not organized and was always crazy hectic, the hardest part about the job was standing there for hours past my breaks or the time i was supposed to clock out, the most enjoyable part of the job was some of my coworkers, and customers they definitely made the job worth having."
bad,A typical day you wouldnt know what to because you had 4 people telling you to do different things.If you did what one person told you to then you would get fussed at by three others. The employees were all unhappy because of the management .
bad,there is nothing to review about this job.  worst job i ever had.  great for high school student.  no raise no benefits nothing
bad,A typical day at work would be to make people happy. I learned that everyone I different and parience is a virtue. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing and be around other people.
bad,I worked part time for 2 years and went and talked to the manager for a promotion and not until they had to get rid of someone was I promoted then they couldn't pay me what I had asked for.
bad,"Managers are mostly clueless about the farming/agriculture environment"
bad,very low paying work place for the amount of work you are expected to do.
bad,Work load is too heavy for the amount of time given to perform assigned tasks.
bad,"Start checking SVP's calendar, emails, phone messages, requested assignments for the day, mail, sorting, filing, letters, powerpoint presentations, excel presentatoins. I learned how to create animated powerpoint presentations, Management was business only, co-workers were good. Hardest part of job was noting. The most enjoyable part of the job was working independently"
bad,The business was slow and the workers played around too much.
bad,"TSC in WI has a good manager & good District Manager. Danville, KY was a totally different story! Horrible management, bad District Manager, awful co-workers who argue in front of customers, and a assistant manager who hid & never provided support for other team members. When I left WI, i loved TSC, but Danville completely ruined it for me. I could never go back with the same Districy Manager. Such a shame."
bad,"No accountability:  The job itself you had to learn on your on or as you go. the main manager was cool, but she sided with the female employees a lot, I had a asst manager who was an alcoholic who would drink on the job, she does nothing about, I got coworkers who were just outright lazy, she wouldn’t do nothing about it, I was left to do a lot of the labor intensive work which was fine at first, time when by fast but after a couple time it’s really annoying but she still doesn't hold them accountable"
bad,Every thing is held against you.  If you are injured they dont listen to what the doctors say about restrictions .  They will write some people up and not others that have missed many days of work  doctors notes or not.
bad,"If you are a manager prepare to live at the store."
bad,Love to work with customers. Lots of lifting walking and standing on your feet . I have learned a lot about different animals medications hardware and tractor parts
bad,Place is a joke. Management belittles you and makes you feel dumb for the slightest mistake. They are also rude and consistently make fun of employees in front of others. Don’t expect any help from them at all if there is an issue.
bad,"I’ve worked here at the Warsaw store for a year. The work isn’t bad but the store has a policy that work comes before life, so this isn’t a great idea for a part time job. All the managers are great to work with but not the best at scheduling. The pay isn’t great and you can’t move up in pay. The company used to be a great place to work for but it’s really gone down hill in the past year."
bad,"When I applied at this company I had high hopes for the job, those hopes were dashed about 6 months in, my hire on mananger loved drama and the one that replaced him is not any better. Employee issues are not addressed but swept under the rug, your hours get cut with no explanation, the team leads act like childern and love to talk about other employees behind their backs. If you dont fit in, they will outcast you!! It may not be this way at all locations but this one is horrible! Oh and dont get me started on the DM!😡"
bad,"The job was easy, and the other employees are friendly.  You could work double shifts as much as you want. Sometimes i was exspected to move freight that was alittle on the heavy side , by myself. But overall not a terrieble place to work."
bad,"For the most part I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply, but they wouldn't work with you on your schedule (like doctor appts, etc) & I was a single parent."
bad,During my 2 years within the company I suffered the loss of a store manager who died of a heart attack the next store manager was rushed to the hospital due to a brain bleed... I believe both incidents were indirectly caused by unnecessary pressure placed on their shoulders by upper management.
bad,I was a team leader. Aka Cashier with keys. We never had enough staff to cover hours. I often had to fake lunches aka work off the clock because scheduling was poor. Was never trained on 75% of what I should have been. I did the job of 6 different people almost every day. I wasnt able to do the tasks I was supposed to due to being stuck at the register. The only full time employees were management. The manager had no idea how to work in a store or set up a schedule. Only ever had lunch breaks. No other breaks. Often closed with 2 people with no one to run the fork lift. Price changes were never done because I was the only one that did them. The District Manager could see no wrong with his golden child of a manager. Most blame got put on me for everything that didn't get done. I was forced to close most nights. When I asked for a change in hours I get more closing shifts. They didn't care about the fact that I had animals to get home to. Not a friendly place to work.
bad,Poor salary compensation.  5 years of service and still no advancement in company. Very high deductible insurance.  No availability for advancement. Bonus available based on if your store made plan based on corporate decision and then your bonus depends upon how many gourds hours you work.  Full time employees never get 40 hrs.
bad,"I loved alot of the customers i worked with on a daily basis, and the staff were a joy to work with. The management however, worked us like slave drivers while they took Vacations. We made very little money for the work we were doing, and in turn, had to work extreme amounts of hours to compensate."
bad,"The day to day grind is just that, its a grind, no one ever wants to be there, there is favoritism, people act nice just to get you into some sort of trouble, everything is go go go with no actual production happening, management just says anything to save face, abosolutely doesn not follow what you are told or taugh in orientation."
bad,"Not the place to work if you believe in gender equality."
bad,"As a store Manager, we were required to work 52 hours per week, but often had to work 60+. Upper management has unrealistic goals for labor hours available."
bad,"toxic work environment, bad management, horrible pay for the work that is required, barely any chance of advancement, miscommunication, cranky customers"
bad,"When I worked at Tractor Supply, we were always understaffed. Oftentimes there were only two employees in the store. We seldom were able to accomplish tasks in the allotted time and were always stressed by regional managers to do more."
bad,Company says they are for the people but they don't give a s*** about people. They have their picks of people that they take care of. The other ones they could care less it's all a numbers game. And they keep bringing temps in because they don't want to pay him the benefits they get rid of them before the times up.
bad,"Upper management lack vision.  Too much over supervision,  too much waiting time on goals instead of sales.  Pushing out of long term employees.  No vision."
bad,"Daily greeting of customers, checking them out, helping with questions on products and stocking shelves.  The company itself isn't bad to work with.  The management at the time wasn't very fair.  Hired younger, inexperienced help for more pay without explaining why.  Didn't  treat all employees equal."
bad,High turnover. Most employees are overworked. Lots of heavy lifting. A lot of overtime is required. Management does not listen to employees concerns. Poor training.
bad,Management wasn't the best and there was a lot of back stabbing and two faced management positions. All management position trying to be evil and two-faced to the other management position.
bad,tractor supplys in the pawling new york new milford areas are horrible with customer service. thus in the patterson new york store the manager belinda is very rude to all employees and customers. doesnt care if you have any health issues or any big problems causing you to miss a day you cant socialize with your coworkers unless its off the clock or to tell someone to do something horrible place to work
bad,One person required to do the work of 3. I would leave my areas clean and come back to a mess. No accountability to others for the mess they left. I would have to.
bad,the management and most customers ran it like a common clothing store when in fact it was for farmers and rural living people needing parts and tools and equipment and for most part the crew didnt know how to help.
bad,Corporate doesn't care about team leads and team members work isn't consistent  not enough pay for work load no tip jars bad corporate leadership. Doesn't care about veterans and families over penny pinching.
bad,"Its a stupid low paying retail job where customers do not treat you like human beings, but more like machines. Retail stores are horrible to work or make a career in."
bad,The first few days were okay then we got a new store manager and she was ok at first and then she started favoriting everyone else over me and then she wouldn't care if people were late but if I was late once she would write me up. she was putting me way below everyone else. We can get very busy so its kin of hard when you have to answer the phone and deal with a customer at the same time
bad,Painful environment to work in based on the lack of support all employees receive from a company that is more focused on growth of its footprint than the quality of its service.
bad,"The job itself was not bad. Management needs more training, very unprofessional. While I worked there only 1 assistant manager who really did care about the employees, the manager and the other assistant manager need more training."
bad,"If you want a place that will work you to death and not appreciate the effort you put forth, then Tractor Supply is the place for you!  There is so much work most of the time that you don't know where to begin.  You could work 15-20 hrs. a day and not get all the work done.  At our store there were a few key people who busted their britches trying to keep things going while the manager (not qualified to be in that position) did the easy fluff jobs like changing price tags.  Upper Management either didn't care or had their hands tied by higher ups.  Overall, a very big waste of time.  They pay peanuts for highly responsible positions and will keep adding more and more to your workload until it is humanly impossible to complete.  Very often you will only have 2 people running the entire store and when someone needs to leave to fill propane or load t-posts or hay or any other of a hundred outside tasks the 1 remaining person is there to keep an eye on and serve the customers who are in the store.  It is unbelievable to me how a company thinks it can provide ""Legendary Customer Service"" when it only allows a couple of employees on the sales floor to do so.  Like I said, it's impossible.  If you are considering working for TSC I'd quote from the movie Forest Gump: ""Run, Forest, RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
bad,"Company does not hold everyone to same standards.  Upper management within the store do not follow same guidelines and often do not do the standard of work they are asking of others, instead using their status as an excuse. Most nights the store is run with only 2 people"
bad,"load/ unload animal feed and outdoor power equipment, clean/ organize store and store supplies, register/ customer service provider, assemble outdoor power equipment."
bad,"Working at TSC can sometimes be rewarding when you get a chance to help someone, but your average day is long, the customers are cranky, and you can expect the least pay legally possible with little chance for advancement, much less raises. Benefits don't exist (including overtime or holiday pay) for any part-time people (which is everyone except management). Hours are low (less than 20 per week for most people) for about 6-9 months out of the year. You'll be expected to meet sales quotas, push Item of the Month, ask every single customer for add-on sales and offer Power Plus with every approved purchase, but no matter how well you do, you get no guarantee on hours for the upcoming schedule."
bad,"not enough support from management ,hardly any. a lot of work for the pay. often to short handed to complete all task. had to do a variety of tasks, running from one to next, plan o grams, freight, loading feed, customer service, cash register, stocking, straightening."
bad,"Tractor Supply does not seem to take action against managers who do not manage well.  Their version of resolving a conflict with a manager, even when their is tangible written evidence, is to simply ask the manager if they think they are wrong and go with whatever the manager says.  It is not a fair and equal opportunity employment place and not managed well."
bad,"The new Macon, GA location is an absolute mess. We are working 6-7 days per week with no plans to be successful. We often come to work and there is absolutely no planning or organization. It is a complete mess. If you wan to see how to NOT run an operation, this is the place for you. It's like comdey night to see this place."
bad,""" Its retail...we cant pay you that."" -D.M. TSC. What can I say stay away unless your 18 and are looking for some pocket change..def not a place you stay and try to make a life for yourself. Poverty level wages"
bad,"If your on work release or are a yes man, you are good to go. If you have your own opinion or disagree with management, you are good to go, out the door, sooner or later.  Don't ever ask the company to back you on anything because they will not do it.  Like I said, if you are a yes man, your in.  If you are not, see ya."
bad,"That should've been a sign when I was being interviewed and I was told how the assistant store manager, a team manager, and a few other people had recently walked out but I needed the job. I am a quick learner and figured I could easily make it work. I was a cashier, which is mind numbing so I was always cleaning and organizing when I could. Unfortunately, this short chubby woman felt as though it was her store and she was always complaining I did this or that. I was told I was to straighten up the clothes during down time, which is fine, but then I would get in trouble for not being at the register when a customer walked up. If I had 3 people in my lane, which is fine and I was quick, then another person walked up I would get yelled at for 4 people being in my lane and not having called for back up even though I hadn't even been given the chance to call yet. Even if I did call 99% of the time no one would come. I could see a lot of the store and if every associate in the store is within eyesight of me with a customer then it's pointless to waste time calling when I can apologize to the customers and gesture as I explained that everyone was busy. I never once had a complaint or even an upset customer! I finally quit when I had a lady write a check that was rejected & was trying to find another credit card. A man needed something 10ft away and she said it was ok to help him. While she was trying to find her card more customers walked up and a team lead was nearby and knew that it was getting backed up. Well, this woman who thought she was the store owner came up to me and said"
bad,It was a fun place to work. Bad hours and no chance of advancement.
bad,Team leader are Working every weekend no time with family.. store manager and assistant manager are off Saturday or Sunday. And I think they sexiest when it comes to females
bad,"No recognition for a job well done.  Many cliches within associates, and if you are not in, you are snubbed and lied about.  Manager out right lied to get me terminated.  Very hostile work environment."
bad,"When customers come in wanting feed panels or troughs or ANYTHING big, i stand there looking like an idiot because NO ONE has shown me in my month here whats what or where to find stuff in our red book. Its very much a ""figure it out as you go"" which normally i dont mind but when theres so many new products to learn and so many products in general, it gets difficult."
bad,Fast Pace kept you busy make the day go fast unorganized everything's everywhere to many inidanas not enough chiefs . They go through so many people but love the experience
bad,"Past few years, seen the management team change 3 or so times and it's always the same. Being over worked, underpaid. The cost of living in the area is so high you can barely afford a single bedroom apartment but the company is very frugal with how they pay and give raises. Most managers fail employees on their performance review so they dont need to give you a raise."
bad,"Not much to it, retail job with pretty friendly customers. Upper Management had no idea what they were doing and were non existent 90% of the time. Training was held off until way later than they needed to. No real head of the store there. They go through people very often"
bad,This job has competitive pay 4 the area however its a fast paced work environment. This job is unprofessional and full of mess & drama. The management team is not very knowledgeable of the production side of the job and sometimes unable to assist when help is needed.
bad,"Tractor supply has lost its way as far as its value and ethics are concerned. Management has no problem lying to any employee. Work/Life balance isn't balanced and the overall opinion of upper management is degrading. The turnover is tremendous, never seen one so high. I loved my job for the first year and a half and then it went completely off track. I thank them for my tenure and skill advancement but, I wouldn't recommend anyone to the company."
bad,As an assistant manager there are times where you are the only person in the building if you are opening.  A majority of the customers are very friendly and personable.
bad,Manager does not know how to treat staff. Is Rude and very condescending. Each day going to work at the McCook store is like walking on egg shells. You never know for co-workers are going to get alone. Would no recommend the McCook store to anyone at this point. Other stores I am sure have better experience then the one here.
bad,It was a pretty laid back easy going job. It had its few challenges but over all pretty decent job. Freight Fridays were my favorite shifts because you got to touch almost all the product that you sold in the store.
bad,"Fun Job taking care of the customer. monthly bonuses, stressful environment.  Fast paced. Hard working and promotable environment. family oriented employees."
bad,"Doing too much as cashier, to be getting paid little and driving 50miles to work. I was  promised flexibility and quick advancement with benefits and better pay after 3 months."
bad,Too many changes in management. Lack of concern for employees that have been there longer then others. Too much gossip between co-workers. Not very welcoming to employees and cuteness who are different.
bad,"Management (i.e. store and assistant managers) were poor with scheduling and following restrictions on hours I could work. The manager was rude and consistently had a poor attitude. He tells employees how ""worthless' they are and often snaps at them. The lower management (team leaders of cashiers and stockers) are decent although, the team leader for the cashiers constantly makes personal calls throughout the day on the company phone."
bad,Poor management and not great pay. There is lots of products available for the ranch lifestyle but there is a lot of them that are not very good quality especially the tractor supply brand.
bad,"management do not care about employees welfare but production. they also target hard working individuals and lack of motivation. its like they enjoy employees slipping up than tapping them at the shoulder for a good job done,"
bad,"the management sucks they pick and choose who they do stuff for. they dont pay enough for the amount of work they want you to do  for the,. they always come up with crazy new rules out of nowhere. they dont appreciate anything you do for the company.when its time for your yearly raise you'll be lucky to get $0.30 if you even get that much. half of the supervisors are running departments they dont even know how to work in (the workers know  more than the supervisors). only apply here if its your last option anything is better than this place."
bad,"I quit the company twice, and they still tried to recruit me back for a third stint, but a manager can only put up with so much ignorance from their district managers. Unfortunately TSC is the Wal-Mart of the farm and ranch world."
bad,If you're looking for a job that will work you into the ground everyday while also cutting your hours this is for you! Teamwork is horrible and hours are cut short even if you're full time just for not meeting ridiculously high sales quota every month! Not only is that a ridiculous fix for making sales it makes everyone's lives just that much harder! 3 people on shift is NOT enough during very busy hours! The customers are self entitled and rude if you aren't helping them over another customer and the same buddies always win the country mile award for recognition. Definitely not a place I would make a career out of it you'll go nutts. Everyone I worked with gated their job and were looking for new ones
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I enjoyed helping people with their needs. I also enjoyed my specific job as a receiver, even though their was little help."
bad,"I would run fork lift, restock shelves, assist with costumers needs, unload trucks and assemble ideems management could have been better as well as pay fort e amount of work you do"
bad,"typical days work is make sure the dog food,cat food live stock feed is filled completely on everyday basis. your required to learn everything that is in the store and where its located."
bad,"The manager picks favorites on who to divide hours up for, also does the same when giving out raise amounts. Very poor scheduling. hours are also cut frequently because the “store” spends too much money."
bad,"The teams lacked crucial members so I would end up working to catch-up in order to help with the store. I learned the importance of managing inventory. The most enjoyable part of work is how my coworkers are really relaxed and fun to work with. Playing catch-up is the hardest part. Management wouldn't schedule fairly, wouldn't hire proper people, and made people leave due to attitude at work."
bad,"upper district manager was incompetent didn't know the average knowledge of a high school graduate.  I really enjoyed working for the store manager, I was just unsatisfied with the district manager and his organizational skills."
bad,It was great company but I wanted to do more in my life and went back to school and got my medical assistant certificate. Which I. Know I made a good choice.
bad,"I love Tractor Supply, the manager not so much. Many problems throughout the store and I was stresses. I liked my coworkers, the customers and the store, the manager was something else. He doesn't take into consideration how hard his employees work just to keep the store open. I felt frustrated as well as the other employees. The store will get better hopefully when someone cracks down and runs the store the right way."
bad,"I feel uncomfortable at my job all the time, management is horrible and no chance to move up in the chain or for any kind of career advancement"
bad,Management is misleading and often negates responsibilities and takes credit for work they do not do. Grossly understaffed.They do not have the payroll to give to anyone besides full timers.
bad,"Team leads never on the same page, constant arguing. Lazy freight leader causing freight to never get done on time. Manager took sides with team lead and refused to fix the problems that team lead caused. Wouldn't give you hours when you needed them and there was NO chance for advancing, not even to become full time. Manager/team leads acted as if helping a customer was a CHORE and didn't want to take time to do so."
bad,It use to be a good place to work but the manger and assistant manger are very sexist and disrespectful to women who work there. they also don't follow any of the rules but get write up happy with team members
bad,Poor management resulting in a bad work environment. Team members are treat like slaves while the management will go out smoking cigs. leaving the floor sometimes just to the cashiers. Not to mention the management was always in a angry mood and took it out on the employees
bad,Currently the store is lacking in enough staff which makes the stress level higher for the employees. Also the management staff is weak due to a lack in employees.
bad,"Following all Standard operation Procedures, putting proper label on product pallets and locating in proper destination."
bad,Very little regard for the individual worker.  No effort is given in the training of the team members.  No positive reinforcement from management.  If errors are made there are no positive corrections attempted.  Quick to use the write up process to flush an employee out the door.
bad,"As a former employee I am extremely disappointed at the bad management! The employee's who DO work are overloaded with the work ""other employees"" won't do! Frustration at this store is at a all time high!"
bad,"The customers for the most part are great, but was only being scheduled 15 hours a week, but would be called to not come in so the paycheck didn't' cover the bills."
bad,"hated going to work, horrible asst manager, good workers. best part was going home for the day."
bad,Salary too low compared to responsibilities of managing a store.
bad,"supposed to be a great place to work. everybody un happy"
bad,"If you like a lot of responsibility and little pay this is the place to be.This is true for management and hourly employees. The stores are seriously under staffed due to payroll constraints. Ultimately it is the customer who suffers because of this. Product training is poorly administered. Basically you sign a paper and are handed one back with bullet points on said product and you are considered trained. The pay scale is very low in contrast to the work load and effort put forth by the staff. TSC likes to trumpet its ethics like ""team work""', ""work/life balance"" and ""work hard, make money"" but in reality these are just empty plaitudes. TSC is in buisness for one reason and that is to make as much profit every quarter as they can and keep their shareholders happy. In that respect they are just like every other retail outfit and it will never change as long as there is an endless supply of what TSC considers non-skilled labor to pull from. It would be great if TSC truely developed good and knowledgable employees and retained them but it won't happen. In closing, two words TSC doesn't want to hear, Shop Steward."
bad,"Tsc is a typical money hungry company. Their greed outweighs their care for their employees. I have over 10 years in retail experience, including management, and they barely started me over minimum wage and they refuse to give hours. I can't provide for my family on 28 hours a week"
bad,One week you will receive all the hours you were promised when hired the next week be on call.  Management is not a thing...  Favorites are played and work is not evenly distributed!  Some employees are hostile and management does nothing about it!
bad,"Most are just in it for the money. It's nice to shop there occasionally, but when you have to work with people who don't care, it makes you not want to stay employed. The store I was at was a mess, dirty, filled with bugs laying on the bags. You get a few gems that you work with, but most aren't. Even the management doesn't care what happens if you're making the company some money."
bad,"I didn't get a lot of training on any of the products so I was thrown into the the lions den trying to convince casters to buy things I knew nothing about. The Management was rarely ever there and avoided me when I tried to contact him through day to day task all the way till my last work day. I don't know much about the company but I seem like they cared only about the people in charge, those who were on the ground floor was just expendable drones."
bad,The communication between one shift to another is very poor communicate between an employee and a supervisor is very poor quite a few times and they don't give you the tools to finish your job or make your job more complete
bad,You're expected to do multiple things at once with no time to do it. Customers are constantly disrespectful and can be racist and sexist. The management expects you to prioritize work over all other responsibilities.
bad,Employees are rude don't let you feel as though you fit in.  They under pay to for they type of work you have to do for them they don't offer many hours
bad,Work schedule was often changed without notice. Full time could mean only getting low 20's hour per week up to 39. Never the same amount of hours each week. Often only two employees in the store at certain hours.
bad,Job would not have been bad if employees would show up for their assigned shifts instead of always calling off and leaving everyone short handed.  Management was also easy to deal with.
bad,"A typical day consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers find items, caring items to their cars. I was part time after school and Every Saturday."
bad,"I have been for TSC for 8 months and I haven't gotten over 18 hours a week since my first month working there. My normal hours are closer to 10-14 a week making $9 an hour. Do that math and you get maybe $400 a month on a good month. I was blown off when I asked for a transfer to another branch by my manager saying ""we have plenty of work here for you."" But I can't get hours! The managers, branch and district, are sexist against women and even though I'm a guy that isn't right and makes for an uncomfortable work environment. I could go on and on. The company won't discipline problem employees no matter what and they constantly change employee policies to regulate what you do to the point where you can't even answer a phone to help a customer unless you are management. I am greatfull for getting this job and experience as my first job but this is not a place to work if you want to go anywhere.  Good jumping off point but no more than that."
bad,"The company managers do not care about you at all. There’s no raises, empty promises, and the managers will go against company policy to save themselves. Even if you are the most dedicated then it doesn’t matter. The agricultural background was fun to be around, but you get treated poorly."
bad,It’s a good first job for just out of high school on your way to college but when I worked there it was still in the process of getting ready to open.  It was fine then great team experience and work experience but after it opened the management got lazy and would change the schedules the last minute with no announcement to staff this would mostly happen after everybody had left and the manager forgot something he would return to the office to change the schedule then text you at 9 the next morning asking why you weren’t at work for your shift even though you took a picture of the schedule showing you were to be off that day but I’ve noticed since I left and the management has been completely changed to a co worker of mine at the time I would definitely recommend for a first job
bad,As a cashier here. It’s crazy. You have more to do then just be a cashier. Most of the time you are running around doing others job. As a cashier you are told to many jobs while trying to run the register in a timely manor.
bad,Since I have been there since the day the store opened it was great .but in the last year with a new manager it has gone down hill.Manager doesn’t seem to care about store or staff.
bad,Working at tractor supply is very challenging. The managers show favoritism to certain employees. They do not follow company policy. The store manager never works the hours she is scheduled to work.  If you call hr for a problem or issue it’s a lost cause.
bad,The manager resented someone with intelligence being hired. Caught the employees changing their time punches and the manager told me not to be trying to change things there that they were a family. I found outdated product that had been expired 2 yrs.
bad,"It's a work place where if you're not from there they treat you differently. Mostly women work there and they hire people they have worked with before and know how they work and don't work very good."
bad,"It is retail, so don’t plan on having a regular schedule.  Managers can either make the job great or miserable.  Stores are generally understaffed making it almost impossible for employees to provide stellar customer service and complete the assigned daily tasks.  Pay is not fantastic and trying to move up can be a real challenge. Keeping the store well stocked is nearly impossible as freight is auto refilled at a slow rate.  And they try to cram too many products into some parts of the stores making them look overcrowded and messy."
bad,If you aren't upper management you do all the work. And hours are very inconsistent. One week your at 15 then the next week you're at 35.  And very poorly paid for what you put up with.
bad,The company does not follow its own standards. Favoritism is how people get promoted and not based on performance or merit. I was promised different things and didn't get any.
bad,HR claims to protect employees then bottom line support higher management regardless of the truth and the number of employees telling the same story! Used and abused ((
bad,"Having experienced a variety of managers at Tractor Supply, the one constant was always weak leadership. This occurred at all levels throughout the organization. Customers and fellow employees made the job enjoyable, but not somewhere to stay long-term."
bad,Upper management would make decisions based on what people in an office somewhere decided was best for a store when they have probably never set foot in a store. And working odd hours does not work well for someone with a busy family and church life
bad,did not enjoy working there at all they messed up the work schedule 24/7 an didnt notify you at all when changes were made an the manger was no help very stressful
bad,When I worked here all the employees were having affairs with one another. The manager was sleeping with another manager and an employee. Being at work was like an episode of jerry springer.
bad,"Work wise it wasn’t a great experience. Way to much drama within the work place, and very unfair management.  Definitely showed favoritism. Would not return to that particular store, it needs A LOT of work. But would love to work another store."
bad,"Over all Tractor Supply is a good place too work but advancement opportunities are few. Management does not work well with the team."
bad,"- Open the store or take the deposit to the bank; work through tasks assigned by corporate task list and the manager; customer service and more customer service; lots of feed and hay bale load-outs; closing tasks with deposit preparation."
bad,very poor management. rules constantly changing to suit convenience of management. Hardly any communication between shifts. But i do have to say i was on a really good shift and had a bunch of really awesome people to work with so made most of the BS tolerable.
bad,"Okay job needs better management . The hours weren’t the greatest. Needs to offer more hours  or better pay. Co workers are great to work with, work with school schedules"
bad,Don’t really have one it’s an alright job just looking for something better and and that I enjoy. Supervisors there have double standards but I can’t bash the job
bad,"Not paced to make money, no incentive to work harder.  Suffocation of ideas and growth with no reward. Turnover is constant for a multiple of reasons one being no light that can be seen at the end of the tunnel."
bad,no ability to advance in your career. always short staffed. large store with only 3-4 people working at at time. stores easily need 8-10 people per shift.
bad,"I  was standing  on the reach truck the whole day I worked, I would get my RF scanner and then go find the reach truck I was assigned to that day. After that I would start putting product away from the receiving dock."
bad,Specifics for management is very detailed.  Many categories to be proficient in.  Heavy lifting required for long periods of time.  Not ideal for older people.
bad,"It was fast going at first. Old manager had everything going great. After leaving, it started to suck. Everything got disorganized and no one got along. Hours started getting taken away and crazy work schedules."
bad,"You have to be able to work in more than one area of the warehouse, which is good. The more you learn, the more you become a benefit. They show favoritism to whom they choose. You will be overworked for little pay. Working overtime happens often, so be prepared to not have all of the weekends as promised, unless you enjoy working that much. Some supervisors/ leadership abuse their authority to the max, and aren't capable to lead. You're basically getting trained by your fellow coworkers, because the supervisors aren't even skilled to work in that area, they're just going by a system summary of the area or what someone has told them about how the area is, But no physical experience from them have they performed. They say that they care about the people, who is the main ingredient for the place to run, but they do NOT. Its mostly like an ultimatum: Do it our way, which may be the worst way, and you may NOT get a consequence for it. Their values that they present verbally does not show physically. The physical labor is bad on your body. Their main goal is all about making a number instead of making a great team. The turnover rate is so high, which is a very bad thing. You don't go to work just to remain in the same position and be overworked everyday, you want to progress. For all that is being demanded on your body, your time, and your overtime, the pay could be ALOT better, as well as the treatment of the people. Its modern day slavery, and people are being conditioned to settle for it. They don't realize how many great potential leaders are there because of their own ""personal"""
bad,"I enjoyed being able to interact with customers face to face, but I did not agree with or appreciate how the store was run and how their employees were treated. I also felt under paid for the amount of physical work this job require. However, the hours always worked with my school schedule."
bad,"There is no employee moral, there is no trust in the work place, no respect, no accountability, discrimination, constant threat of being fired, bullying, being humiliated in the presents of co workers and customers. very bad work ethic on behalf of management."
bad,"Poor advancement opportunities, IT challenged, focused on fundamentals for store count growth and not employee growth/ career pathing ,Long and inconsistent working hours not associated with seasonality, frequent issues with supply chain/distribution network."
bad,It was a part-time job that atmosphere depended on management. I learned lots about hobby farming and was my first experience with customer service. Hardest part of the job was figuring out what people were talking about.
bad,"The management is ok but the manager is hard to work with. The hardest part of the job is going on a ladder and trying so hard not to fall. the most enjoyable part of the job is every weekend there is a humane society with the animals inside the store or outside of the store. The sight of the animals is the best feeling I had before I got into work. I cashed customers out, took out the trash, counted my drawer in and out, front faced shelves, swept and mopped the entire store and restocked the shelves. I learned where everything went in the store. If I did not know where something went, I would ask one of my fellow co-workers and they will tell me. Some of them like to play guess where it goes, where I would guess and if I was right then they would say yes. The workplace is very stressful and demanding."
bad,it was a great place to work at for a few months and then the management let down his employees. he is a horrible manager as he would delegate. that was his favorite world. I feel a manager should lead hid team not just delegate.
bad,Tractor Supply Co operates on its stores based on the Lean Company model. they understaff and overwork their personnel and do not give them the recourses necessary to provide good customer service. Very often there will be only 2-3 employees on duty at a time in a store that requires a large number of customer carry outs and stocking tasks. Management will often find itself in a position of doing the brunt of heavy lifting and load outs while the only other employee on duty runs the cash register. they incorporate a large number of processes designed to stream line employee tasks and will criticize and critique every step an employee makes on the job.
bad,"I feel they do not pay enough for the amount of work they made me do. They would have a cashier payed $9,50 but someone that works in the back only $7,50"
bad,they treat everyone good and very well can move up to management. hardest part of the job is loading feed and fencing stuff. the other bad thing is the short breaks
bad,"Benefits and wage are poor, management is controlling, and the hours/schedule are inconsistent."
bad,The manager I worked for that ultimately made me hate my job was hired with no agricultural experience. He came from a grocery store and had no idea what feed requirements are needed for different species etc. Very unknowledgeable and had no want to learn from people that did have degrees in Agriculture.
bad,Worst place I ever worked at. The manager was so rude and ungrateful you could work and pick up the slack of 3 people and he complained and put ever one down.. He harassed me when i took off for my great grandmother funeral..
bad,"Open/close store, put out tills, count safe, take daily deposit, assign daily tasks, reset planograms, follow up with team members on projects"
bad,Enjoyed working with the public. The coworkers were a pleasure to work with. The job was very fulfilling and rewarding. The pay OK.
bad,"completing transactions for customers, helping customers find products, stocking and receiving goods. The most enjoyable thing about the job would be meeting new people."
bad,tractor supply says that they pride themselves in their management training/ skills. Well i think its b.s. It is all politics.
bad,"fast paced and the other co workers that I worked with were great,  the management actually helped use with problems and didn't make it seem that I was our fault from the begining"
bad,"Fast paced customer service, multiple customers being dealt with at once by a single employee, lazy management who pawn off customers to lower positioned employees, great co-workers who try to help you when needed."
bad,You need really strong time management skills to maintain the work life balance that they preach about
bad,I picked and filled orders. It wasn't a hard job to do. I worked with some pretty good people.
bad,"I worked for Tsc for 2 1/2 years with in those 2 1/2 years I had 4 different store mangers and 3 assistant store mangers. Management wouldnt tell you what to do nor was welling to help you . They was so much turn over working for this company. I enjoyed working with my part time team leads, cashiers and team members.  I wouldnt recommend anyone to work bfor this company."
bad,Good entry level job.  Great exposure to farming community.  Good introduction to customer service.
bad,"You can work your hardest and not get any recognition for it. There is no room for advancement unless you hire in as a temp. The management there has no idea what is going on half the time because of lack of communication. They will hire temps and put them in the departments that the full time employees have put in for, and then it they will fire the temps after 90 days no matter how hard of a worker they were just so they dont have to hire them full time. Then they hire a whole new group of temps and do them the same way. They do not give raises very often and its very hard work. They have alot of accidents because people are not trained properly on the equipment, and they put very young people fresh out of high school on the equipment that just want to goof off, which causes the accidents."
bad,i've not been taught anything new even though i've been promised additional training.
bad,Tractor Supply to me is a good job to work at if you are young and aren't looking to advance or make a whole lot of money. I enjoyed it until they only started scheduling me when the management didn't want to work and even though they always praised and complimented me I was overlooked when it was time for someone to advance.
bad,The hours were not great but the people I worked with were great
bad,"not much balance.. work, whatever it takes..."
bad,"I enjoyed my first 2 months of the job. I advanced quickly to receiving manager. However, I was under trained due to the company wanting to fill the position quickly. If I had questions about my new role I was often told""I don't know"" or ""figure it out"". I have a family with 4 small children and they were not understanding of this."
bad,You get what you put into the job. If you want the sale bonus at the end of the month you make sure the shelves are stocked. You want good reviews have good customer service.
bad,whatever you're hired into doing you're pretty much stuck with that job for the rest of your time there. at my TSC store no one liked to help you do anything because they didn't want to be at the front of the store up on the register. Raises are very low!! no vacation!
bad,"my immediate supervisor is great, however, like most companies upper management is out of touch.  They are disconnected with the workload and what it takes to actually accomplish the job, they have a dim view of female leadership which is reflected in both training videos, disseminated to the company, and the corporate culture."
bad,"most bizarre job ive ever had. constant work interuptions, no clear objectives, changing/ policys with no real reason behind them. you will be constantly  2nd guessing yourself on how to do most tasks because of management oversight, no matter what you do or how you do it you will always be wrong. constant staff turnover/ always understaffed."
bad,Mandatory overtime is given based on company needs. You may be required to work overtime with only 3 days in advance. You will be held accountable for not being able to make it. Not good for single parents
bad,"They preach - work hard, earn money and have fun. Extremely heavy workload, minimal pay and very minimal raises, and no time to have fun. High employee turnover for the same reasons."
bad,"The only thing that they are about is making money, not about their employees at all. I fell flat on my back from a 8 ft. Ladder and my manager did not care AT ALL. She supposedly went back and looked at the cameras and she told me that she didnt see anything at all and that I didnt fall. Rude customers and coworkers always. Not paid nearly enough. They treat their employees like trash. I quit after a month. Do not reccomend whatsoever."
bad,"Customers are rude and have no idea what the products are called and get upset when you bring them the product they ask for, but it's 'not what they wanted!' Management is poor. If you're not part of the inner circle, you're getting all the poor shifts and poor customers. Chick days are the best."
bad,It is a fun place to work at but management was very poor. Management will choose to like you and keep you or dislike you and try to get you to quit or fire you if they do not like you.
bad,"Management was horrible. I won't say anything about the first level supervisors cause they are often put in precarious situations, but for the ones above I don't have anything for. I have ample experience in the field, and was astounded to see the company's lack of base standards. I observed numerous employees not show effort, or any promise of being productive additions to the business. The company obviously doesn't know what the probationary period (90 days) is supposed to be used for. Either that or they just don't factor it in when making an official hiring decision. The company would see improved annual financial reports even if all they changed was instead of keeping unproductive associates, and attempting to remedy  it by moving them to another department, terminate there employment. Most of the better workers pointed out because they were over tasked  with duties. It's easier to make one guy do the job, instead of making sure everyone is though, and once started.. They engaged in gaslighting. They tried it with me, but I've worked at some facilities that were really rough, and TSC doesn't hold a candle to them. Insubordination will get you fired faster than anything else in a warehouse except for used up allocated attendence points given to each employee at the start of there employment. Hours were cut to remain inside company budget goals. Rarely could you opt in for overtime without there already being issued mandatory overtime. If your in an office all night instead of on the floor where I'm working then I don't really care to hear your employee review. You might"
bad,"I've been with Tractor for almost two years and I've seen a lot of people come and go. High turn around on employees is pretty standard and it comes as no surprise that Tractor sees their employees as tools, not people. Tractor pushes managers to make good sales but they don't push them to take care of their own. Working here was one issue after another and although I kept hoping for change it became apparent that there wouldn't be any."
bad,The management is poor.  You are treated like a number.  After i put my notice in then I was worth more money to them otherwise they didn't care.  My replacement was paid $5 more per hour with less experience.
bad,This company does not follow its own mission and values this is my soul reason for looking into a new company. Also their lack of concern for their people. Pay and benefits are not competitive
bad,"The job is very physical with very limited staff. The stores run with an extremely lean inventory. Training is minimal, and done mostly online. I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,They would always change your schedule. The managers did not know how to treat their employees. Rather than having someone that was trained for the position they would just promote people who didn't deserve it/didn't know what they were doing from the beginning.
bad,"I have been with company for over a year and find it harder and harder to believe that I will receive any recognition for the hard work I do. From what I've seen and experienced, TSC rewards hard work by relocating you to a poor store to fix their problems or by giving you more responsibility. I'm exhausted and tired of never seeing my family. I'm tired of the drama and being called in on my days off."
bad,Days at Tractor Supply are not typical every day has the possibility of different tasks and customers bring in something new all the time.  There is never a time that you have nothing to do.  
bad,"There is never enough help. We are always behind. The back room is full of freight and a lot of shelves are empty. Customer satisfaction is very low. I supervise the part time employees. deposit the cash,lock the doors and operate the alarm."
bad,80% turn over. Orientations every week hire people whether they can do the job or not.   Can't fill the orders on time.  6 different leaders in 3 years...
bad,"I had a bad experience working here. Had two terrible supervisors. I worked here for 3 years, I left feeling unappreciated. I got a promotion to receiving manager after being here for a year. I was promised the out of store training, but I never went. After one month of training in the position from my direct supervisor, she was out for 7 months for surgery. After being in the position for a year, I got a demotion. I was told I was not doing all of my duties, after not receiving the needed training to know my duties."
bad,Tractor Supply Co in Hanover is a sucky place to work now because management its what it should be. The manager now isn't fair. There are some really awesome customers...that's the most beneficial part of the job.
bad,I enjoyed my job until management starting showing lack of team members request. Team leaders never made time for members and allowing one to succeed.
bad,"The company used to be the best place to work. Within the last few years, the benefits became terrible for more pay and less coverage. The managers that stay are micro-managing individuals. The long time team members are leaving and the company prefers to hire free labor through hundreds of interns and doesn't do anything nice for the team members that try hard."
bad,"It is a multiple hat job, and can be very demanding. Management can be inconsistent and not very encouraging of team members. The amount of work you put into this job and what you actually earn will never equal."
bad,"While my store had a lot of good people working there the upper management was horrible!  District manager made promises that never happened, raises that never happened, and then became angry when I brought it to his attention.  After that it seemed a lot more hostile."
bad,Difficult place to work. Work life balance is non existent. Salary and benefits are competitive. Hours are long. Weeks are long.
bad,"the place is a joke to work at depending on the management and the store ...low pay as well, unorganized place...the people that I worked with were awesome"
bad,"loved working with co-workers and helping the customers.did load outs,stock,truck,cleaned,modes,front faced,cashier,help people get what they need."
bad,"Started out as a great company to work for, Ended up being a place that is very corporate run. Not much of a chance to use your own ideas or have have the opportunity to manage your own business. Follow the policy and do what your told, No outside the box thinking or entrepreneurial executing allowed. All merchandising ideas and daily tasks are handed down from corporate,  Seasonal transitions and planograms change constantly taking away from payroll hours and not allowing the stores to provide customer service or provide a cohesive work environment. Store Managers are underpaid compared to the industry standards, support on district and regional level is non existant"
bad,"Work was good , easy. The production rates were easy to meet and exceed. I learned how to load trailers in a fast and efficient manner and still maintain rate with very little to no damage to the product."
bad,"Always looked forward to going to work, i had a very supportive and close team that worked excellent together. The company encourages the team dynamic and made it easy to feel good going to work everyday."
bad,"Typical Day : Physically stressful not matter the weather"
bad,"Good first job, but unless you plan on making a career out of it do not stay there. Working hard will earn you a raise and possible promotion, you will be taught how to operate a forklift, register, cardboard baler. Customer service is a big part of the job as well as marketing, stocking and administration duties."
bad,"No support from store manager or district manager on safety issue. One day someone will get really hurt it killed before the management team listens. They do not train anyone on the fork lift, just give them a license and let them go. I watched a guy climb a boom of the fork lift to get the a box from the top shelf, then he told me the management has always let him do so. I brought it up to the store manager and district manager. After that conversation I kayed my keys on the desk and ""retired"" from tractor supply"
bad,Very few people here know what's going on. Many things are done behind closed doors and there is a lack of transparency.  Advancement is done at the draw of a hat and not based on objective or tangible evidence.
bad,"It's simply a place where I wouldn't want to work again. It was very taxing in multiple ways, management wasn't in tune with the environment they were creating, and it just burned me out over time."
bad,Lack of hours and differently people being hired and not kept up. pushed their jobs on other people so they didnt have to work at all to get by. thank you.
bad,"Company's business philosophy seems to be completely upside down to me they put profits 1st customers 2nd and employees last, There is constant pressure on the employed yeast to always give and produce more work as they continue to cut the amount of time to do the work it is like asking for something that is not possible to do, There is little to no encouragement in their culture or celebration of employees accomplishments for recognition of people's skills it's all about numbers and results"
bad,"This was a horrible job.  They are so hellbent on achieving a high productivity rate that there is not time to breathe.  I would  have approximately 3 minutes to take a pallet off the truck, find the storage location (might be across the warehouse) watch out for people in the way, put it away and get back to the truck to unload another one.  You had to keep up this pace all day or your productivity rate would go down and they would use that to fire people.   I was told I was behind even when I had 93-96% productivity!"
bad,Good job to learn how to work retail if you plan on pursuing a career in retail but not a good job for a person who plans on going out on to the field.
bad,The area I'm in now hopefully does not transfer throughout the company. Poor upper management and inadequate support makes working there difficult. We're asked to do so much with no payroll to support what is being required of us.
bad,"I loved doing my job, however, room for success wasn't given fairly or appropriately. "
bad,"TSC will work you to death. If you are a family man you will never see them. On top of all that management is horrible, they don't listen they micro-manage everything and are constantly making up rules as they go. If you want to get paid decent money work tons of overtime and get treated like dirt this job is perfect."
bad,"While there are some positive aspects to the idea of working for this company, such as promising schedules and easy work, there are more pressing matters that ruin the company name, such as poor management and mandatory overtime that seems to never have an end. This DC has a tendency to lie to its employees about mandatory overtime. They have went through seven general managers since opening its doors five years ago. Many employees have had negative experiences with HR personnel, even with basic needs such as filing for benefits. They try to promote college/work balance with a new schedule for Friday through Sunday; however, the overtime that they require every week does not allow people to easily balance life outside of the company. Fellow employees, however, are personable and friendly. I had many teammates help me in my job when needed, and accepted help when offered."
bad,"weekly hours were few, compensation was horrible, advancement was hard fought, management was given to the wrong individuals, my co workers were either very kind or not at all, the company expected too much work out of the floor associates and constantly complained when things wouldn't get done."
bad,"They force a policy on employees to greet and ask every customer what they need, common business practices. Then the management turns around and (usually passive aggressively) scolds you for being slow and unproductive when the customers waste more than enough of your time."
bad,The ability to rebuild pto is the only good part working here.ALways under pressure on production on hard to hit places. Upper management does not respect hourly team members.
bad,"Compensation is Poor, $8 / hour for extremely labor intensive work and long hours. Management may or may not be understanding depending on location, but generally the people who work there are less than upstanding. Benefits are very low, and are withheld for the first six months of employment. Corporate and management tend to favor making you work with no breaks by giving you the maximum shift length that makes you ineligible for meal breaks, which only last a half hour. All in all, it's fine for part time work when you have absolutely no other alternatives, but you'd be better off in some other retail chain."
bad,"Management and everything else sucks. The pay is OK,  but you are on a production scale and there is no production pay. Te shifts are 8 hours and they are 7-3 3-11 11-7."
bad,"This is a good company.  I worked with customers on a daily basis. I had a very good rapport with my customers. I started as a Team Lead, then moved to the receiving position.  From there I became the Assistant Manager and finally in Sept. of 2013 I became the Store Manager.  Unfortunately the drama and backstabbing at the store became a little too much."
bad,They'll work the heck out of you and make you work off the clock and still tell you that your not doing good enough.
bad,"My District Manager is vindictive,and will lie and make promises he has no intention of keeping just to get you to do what he wants. He wanted me to be asst. manager but now because I got my ESA he has decided that I can't even do the team lead job. Go figure."
bad,Good steady job.very high turnover for team members  and managers alike.low wages are not enough for cost of living and the economy. to much emphasis focus on management and not the team members.never enough coverage for the amount of customers and tasks that need to be completed.there is always roaches and mice out of control in the building.needs better management.
bad,Tractor supply wasn't a steady job for me.  They did not teach me where items go so I had a hard time helping my customers find what they needed.  And I told my boss I was 8 weeks pregnant he made me pick up a chainsaw for someone off the wall.
bad,"I've always loved TSC. When I went to work there, I was hired by the ASM who was acting Manager for the time being. He was wonderful and hired wonderful employees among myself. Then the store manager returned, and employees dropped like flies, either quitting or being ""fired"" upon mention of their intentions to leave. Management really made the job miserable, and even though the customers were quite amazing, that just couldn't be looked past. One cashier would struggle on the register with many customers in line or while desperately needed to go to the restroom while other employees kicked their feet up with the manager in the office. Customers would ask for the manager and employees would be told to tell said customers he wasn't available when he simply wasn't up for it. Getting a lunch break was nearly impossible but those who didn't take one were threatened with a write up. The store would be a mess and the manager, who hadn't been there all week would threaten to fire everyone for making him look bad. The company itself is wonderful and I'm more than happy to take my business to them, just not the location I worked at because even after leaving, the current employees complain of the same conditions."
bad,"There are some good points about working there.  They train you on the floor,  the cash register,  and the forklift.  There is heavy lifting involved with the animal feed and the hay bails. It can be back breaking at times.  The manager which was fired blamed all the employees under him of stealing.  He would throw out damaged and probably undamaged items out and didnt log any of it. We had to be individually interrogated to keep our job. Since none of us had anything to hide we went along with it.  They later looked at the security cameras and saw that the manager wasn't properly logging in the merchandise."
bad,didn't really fit into this type of job. was great if you enjoy a ho hum type setting that all you do is the same thing over and over again. Management sucked. never around
bad,I gave TSC 5 years of my life and was taken advantage of every opportunity given.  If you have a family that you care about then I would highly recommend looking at another company.
bad,"Always behind every day, never enough employees to complete job duties and help customers the way you should, very stressful experience, would be a great place too work if the company would spend more money on payroll in the stores."
bad,"large work load, yet no help to complete that work load. lack of challenge to merchandise your store to support your customers base need. payroll cuts continue to happen yet more metrics to meet at front end for team members"
bad,This company is bottom line based. However is focused around people. Great platform to grow in. Money wise... keep looking. Not enough payroll to run your stores and take care of customers
bad,"A typical day at work would be very repetitive, just stacking product on a pallet and dropping them off at their shipping lane. Management wasn't really on top of their game, it seemed like every day different problems arose. I asked to get certified on different equipment on about 5 separate occasions but they lack job advancement and don't provide equal opportunities."
bad,"Typical chain retail. Pay was subpar, benefits were the biggest perks. Overall understaffed (purposely) managment either lacked leadership skills or were beyond burnt out from corp meddling."
bad,"Poor management"
bad,The management is sucky. You don't get to work as much as you want. You have to stay after your shift is done to get the store cleaned. You don't get out of there on time at all.
bad,"Upper management has their idea of what they want and the buyers are basically the person who does that bidding, instead of being merchants.  They are too closely tied to the calendar for a portion of the store, and that effects financial results negatively for other areas."
bad,"I would assist customers with anything they may have needed help with. I would also assist with load outs,cashier, re do any planograms that needed to be done as well as hang signs for new ads."
bad,They want you there at 5am a few days aweek and pay as low as possible. The work there is heavy moving lots of feed bags around. They are always marking stuff down. Dirty place to work.
bad,"its hard work and we encountered an infestation with bugs and rats from the ware house.  They didnt teach me anything, I had to learn it all for myself but, fortunately, I learned most of it from another job.  Co-workers were great country people but management was horrible.  Hardest part of the job was having to do it all because management knew I would do it.  Most enjoyable part was getting to know the frequent customers."
bad,"typical work day you go in try to not only finish the tasks given to you by the store manager but to sell items and answer customer questions. What i learned from working here was that the customers are not always right. My original store manager was a great manager she always made sure things got done and customers left the store happy, my current store/assistant manager is not people friendly and never takes the time to really work and explain things to her crew team. Hardest parts of the job are both the dealing with the angry customers and redoing plannograms for just one small item."
bad,This company is a great company to work for if you are retired or if you are in school. I worked here to get through school because they were flexible with my schedule. I would not make this a career due to the lack of compensation in management roles.
bad,"Manager did not train. Employees did what they wanted. Manager has no control. To busy putting out fires. Not organized. Products not put where they need to be prices wrong, planograms not correct."
bad,The GM is a bipolar mess who makes things horrible for everyone (weekend shift) he was moody and would often take his own frustrations out on other employees
bad,It was a good place to work but they always overlook good employees for full time positions. The management was horriable. And hasn’t gotten ant better
bad,"Going to work in jeans and a T-shirt is great. However TSC does underpay, in my opinion,  considering the strenuous work coupled with customer demands. There are usually only 3 people working at a time (4 if you’re really lucky) so the positive is you stay busy so time flies but it can be stressful. "
bad,"Very relaxing job, days were long and slow due to lack of business in our specific store. Cool members and certain leaders. Horrible management. Great company. Just needed major changes at the store."
bad,"Overall, working here was a much-needed stepping stone in my life. It gave me some experience, taught me about the retail industry, and gave me my first taste of having a job."
bad,"TSC DC was a place I was really optimistic to join. Unfortunately it wasn't all it was made out to be. They have a wonderful value system embodied by all of the upper management and office personnel who were interpersonal and genuinely concerned for every individual. The problem is with the direct supervisors. I reported a near miss to a 3rd shift supervisor who ignored the problem, said nothing to any team member, and I ended up correcting it for fear a loaded pallet would fall onto individuals passing below. Favorites are played heavily, and the easiest levels of work will continually be given to the exact same people rather than to those who struggle, while the hardest tasks are completed by the same cast every night. If you show fondness of a new area in cross training you are guaranteed to never do it again unless they are completely out of options. When you ask for help or have to hunt down a supervisor for a question (because you will NEVER find them in a certain area and there's no established way of finding them) you will be greeted with a sour, rude demeanor and demands of why you aren't ""in your spot"". Every question or request for help is treated like an attempt to get out of your work, and you are consistently deemed not important enough to be your supervisor's problem. If the upper management worked a day with those people, they would quit too. The supervisors preach safety and teamwork but condemn any action of the sort."
bad,The job was a great job.  I love working with people and helping people.  I found that management was lacking.
bad,"my typical day at work would include dealing with customers all day,ordering new clothes from different vendors,taking in special order request for customers. I enjoy working with my coworkers they make the day go by faster, because we all have fun but still get the job done. the hardest part of my job would have to be fixing other coworkers messes. some of my co workers like to argue wtih customers thats when i have to step in and make sure the customers attitude gets turned around and tell the co worker what he or she had done wrong. the most enjoyable part of my day is hearing how much people appreciate me, all our customers always say theyre so glad i work there and that i keep them coming back."
bad,If you would like to work for a company where you come in and work and have little to no say about your work environment Tractor Supply will be the best job for you. If you’re a teachers pet you’ll fit in perfectly.
bad,To wake up at 4 o clock in the morning and having to work until 4 that after noon is ridiculous. And god forbid something happened and you have to call out. Might as well say goodbye to your job. Also there’s so much drama between co workers it’s crazy. Honestly if you like lifting 50lb bags on a regular basis this could be a good fit. But if you wanna work where you feel secure with your job and don’t want to deal with drama at work then maybe stay away from here.
bad,It is fun at first but after a while you start to see there is a lot more cons than there are pros for part timers. the people on management get rammed with work all the time to the point that they are struggling to keep up.
bad,"Learn from the local farmers"
bad,"Tractor Supply used to be about family values but it has moved away from a mom and pop feed store and now is focused on the corporate level. Typical day at work is dealing with customers assisting with all they're agricultural needs. All the way from feed for livestock or fencing for the ranch. I would say the hardest part of the job is when you get a difficult customer who gets upset but still trying to provide customer service, the most enjoyable i would say are the regular customers and some of the coworkers. Manage recently has been at its worst it has driven most of our best workers away."
bad,This job is good because they have the employees doing everything.  So you're never glued to only one job.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.
bad,"A day included greeting customers, checking out customers, seeing to the customers needs, price changes, daily paper work, planograms, stock, and organizing inventory. The hardest part of the job was lifting fifty pounds of animal feed. The most enjoyable part of the job was when repeat customers came in."
bad,Expected to do too much work outside of job classification.
bad,Poor management. Learned customer service.  Counting down cash drawer daily.
bad,like the company it good place for a part time job. lots of heavy lifting and not enough hours given.
bad,"Did not work, only went through orientation. Warehouse is extremely huge."
bad,"While working there i was a freight worker which meant i had to be there at 5 am to stock shelves and sort freight. It was good for awhile but after the new manager come in he cut everyones hours. He had cut everyones hours to where we were only working about 3 days a week. I, just like most others, have many things to pay for and couldn't afford to work there any longer."
bad,"opening and closing registers, training new employees, setting up new displays"
bad,"fine place for a summer job, this is not a company i would consider working for again"
bad,Depends on what you want in life. Some things are not worth others in the grand scheme of things
bad,"if you're into a rural lifestyle, then this is the place to work. this job requires a lot of heavy lifting in awkward spaces. there are also major plumbing, roach, and rat problems at this location."
bad,"It was a pretty good job. The pay should be increased for the work they ask some of the team members to do. But, I enjoyed my time there and would recommend this job to anyone who is starting out job hunting."
bad,At tractor supply I learned to deal with people with all different types of cultures and attitudes. The managers had their rules but if you did your job right you never had to worry about anything.
bad,they started out as a team member company and very recently put money ahead of team members. many taem members are very upset with the climate at the store level. always cutting hours. motto is have fun and make money. upper management has all the fun and we make the money
bad,I enjoyed most of the people I worked with and some of the management. Good benefits and pay raises. The work load can be heavy and difficult to preform.
bad,"This job was one of the worst that i have worked at, they didnt care about customer service, instead they were more concerned about the amount of people that signed up for there credit cards and tractor supply bonuses and offers through your email.I HAD CUSTOMERS GETTING MAD AT ME BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY CAME IN THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE GETTING HOUNDED FROM THE EMPLOYEES.At Tractor Supply it doesnt matter how much you sell or how much you work your hardest,or how your on time every time you have to work, it wont matter cause they only care about sales and not the customers."
bad,A regular day at work is very fast. You're always busy doing something. Great people to work with and around. The hardest part is possible the scheduling and keeping employees with so much competition around that's paying way more.
bad,We never were scheduled and never made enough to make a living. I was scheduled 3 days out of the week for maybe 5 hours if i was lucky a day. Got paid 8.50 but still could not cover my bills.
good,Turnaround of managers is too often. And they seem to care more about number than employees. No efficient training for new hires either. Employees are very often under appreciated. Promotions tend to go to under qualified employees as well
good,The schedules are normally messed up and always has to be fixed. Lunches are short and the payroll is bad. Hours are always getting cut which makes it 10 times more stressful.
good,Working at Tractor Supply is physically demanding. The people at tractor supply lift heavy bags of feed. If you get a job their I suggest knowing knowledge about animal feed and there products.
good,I think that tractor supply distribution center is poorly managed. there has been two different general managers and two different assistant general manager since I have been here who rules the guidelines Change Daily it seems as if nothing is set in stone this DC is run like a brand new business it does not seem as if anyone in human resources or management has an idea of what needs to be done to correct particular issues.
good,"People I worked with would treat me with disrespect, and it was hard to get along with those people. The manager would say he would go to the bank but always went and played golf for almost 2 hours."
good,"its a good job, bad leaders, not enough hours, short breaks, good team, i didnt like working sundays good team leads i was a fead and restruck and truck unload crew"
good,"5 yrs ago I would have rated this company 5 plus...in the last 2 they have completely changed from their out here life style and it is all about the $$$ now. They use to listen and care about employees AND customers,now they have turned into self help...get your own feed and get out,was a customer before employee,after 5 yrs of service i am neither and will travel farther and pay more to not spend my hard earned money with a company full of lies!"
good,"It was my first over the table job, was great at first but as time goes on it just starts to eat away at you. I worked very hard and pulled more than my weight and never made anywhere near enough to justify it. So I left after many months of my manger just letting people go to hire new people. I felt like the trainer. Unfair considering I was only a team member and nothing more. Also, hours would fluctuate wildly."
good,not a really competitive workplace filled with micro managing leadership ignores team member feedback does not follow company goals good for learning how to operate different types of lifts and equipment
good,More training would of been helpful but working there u learn bout sueing phones working on computers handheld scanners setting shelfs  putting up stock.
good,"I enjoyed working at tractor supply but the schedule would get posted 2 days before the work week so it was very hard to plan an outside work life.  One manager was really rude to everyone, I always got complaints about him and his attitude."
good,I liked helping the customers with clothing purchases. I liked facing the shelves. Setting up displays. Putting equipment together to display on the floor.
good,"For a new company that's been here for 2 years now, things should have gotten better for the employees.  To much have changed that doesn't benefit the tm's."
good,I enjoyed this job because of the other employees. It was a good place to work but I gave it such a low score because the Lakewood Store is absolutely awful.
good,"A typical day at TSC is unloading the trucks that need to be unloaded and then getting the product out to the customer."
good,"I would not chose to work back there, There is not enough employees to properly run the company.I dont want to be in the midst of all their stress when it is their fault to begin with."
good,"got this job as a first job while still in High school, Management at the time was a do as I say not as I do management and frequently broke the rules they asked other employees to follow."
good,"I personally didn’t have the best experience working there. management had favorites, you could never move up in the company they always brought new people in. you don’t get raises.  you do more than you were hired on to do."
good,I returned an item for an irate customer. Couple days later got written up.     they order stuff way late all the time  n the customer gets mad at me.
good,The pay is the only benefit.. One or two supervisors will be honest with you bout the job and human resources... They'll feed u during holidays bt beware bc they'll stick it to u later in sum kinda way... No job stability.. Ur always being watched even if all u do is work.. They change things to suit them.. Just beware
good,The manager that I had was absolutely horrible. He played favorites and there was no work management advancement unless you were on his good side no matter how hard you worked
good,"When I started here I was to be full time I have been asking ever since still nothing. Now it Christmas and they have me schedule 4 days in the last 4 weeks"
good,working there was good while it lasted but i wanted to seek better opportunities.  The company over all is nice to work for and I would recommend others for the job if they are applying.
good,"Good starting place but if your part time, its horrible. "
good,This is nothing more than a temp job. Don't look for advancements. They would rather higher outside people than promote a long time employee. Managers are awful and self-centered. High turn over rate and terrible pay!
good,Now is working at tractor supply I would have to come in clock in will have a group meeting before we start work and then we start unloading the pallets in the back sort them out put them where they need to go and then we will go out and help customers and we would also unload and load lumber feed ik cetera
good,I will quit this job as soon as I find another one I really hate tractor supply at least the one I work at low pay demanding work average raise is about 20 to 40 cent a year if your fortunate enough to get the 40 cent or somewhere in between company sucks all the way around. Macon DC JUST FIRED GM
good,"The Manager was insane he would always yell and scream not just at Employees but at CUSTOMERS because he didn't like to be bothered with questions, concerns or comments I think the only sane manager there was the Assistant Manager(until she left because she couldnt stand the store manager anymore) who i got along with very well some of the employees were awesome and a pleasure to work with(until the crazy manager ran the good employees out and hired a bunch of lazy slobs) and never really had a problem with any except for maybe 4 of them, the job could be stressful at times especially during the holidays when your on shift with the crazy store manager, the thing that made me start looking for another job was the fact that I couldn't really stand the insanity of management, especially when the Asst Manager had resigned and left,  but also the laziness of the employees in my last 3 months of employment there, it got so bad I was always doing there work they never finished and I would fall behind on MY SCHEDULED ASSIGNMENTS and I'd always get B***hed at and written up for my ""poor job"" Performance, thank god I'm out of that store, that store has potential but only if that Manager leaves and the lazy workers leave."
good,"The job is great for someone who is looking for a part time position, it is not a job for someone who has a family to support.  I was unable to get full time hours, so I left the job for a position in a company with benefits and full time"
good,"Was a great place at first then they kept changing everything, like how many day you can miss. And they started getting rude with everyone."
good,I loved talking with my customers while assisting them with finding whatever it was they were looking for. The management was a little unorthodox but other than that it was a very nice place to work.
good,I would never work for that company again or refer them to anybody they were the worst place to work for 
good,"The worst part was the management. The store was a mess half the time and everyone disappears when they’re needed most. Overall, not a great place to work but not overly atrocious"
good,I loved working their then management was changed and things just weren't for me anymore. I worked there for over a year and a half never got offered a raise and I never got offered to move up and advance.
good,Not the best place for someone to work unless you are still in school pays low and u dont work alot of hours. When u do have alot of hours to work u dont have a life out side of it
good,"Nothing special, garbage hours and low pay.  Sometimes upper management will give you a pat on the back.  Store management has little to no control over how the store is run.  Will definitely yell at you for ANY customer complaints and allow customers to walk all over you.  If you're lucky, a $0.25 raise per year.  Never enough staff for the workload you're expected to complete, and no intention of hiring more people."
good,"You will definitely come out with some interesting story's. The employees are the only people you will get along with. There will always be that one that is annoying. "
good,Working for tractor supply was fun at times because of the customers and insteresting coversations. Co-workers were fun to work with but could tell there was issues amongst everybody. The GM is arrogant and not understanding at times.
good,"Overall it is a decent job but does not have a lot of room for advancements and getting a raise is very hard even after it was promised. It is more of a part-time job, really looking for something better."
good,"I have been with Tractor Supply for a total of 15 years and I have enjoyed about 13 of those years, I have helped with training managers, receivers, team leaders and cashiers.  I feel like I have devoted a lot of my time and energy into training managers to only be denied the chance to advance myself."
good,"Helping customers"
good,"Was unable to keep a steady schedule. bounced from 30-32 hours to 40-60 hours. hard to keep a budget, at the time there wasn't any assistance from management to pick up the slack when a lower management employee was out ill but our people were always sent to cover for other stores."
good,"Working as a Team Member at Tractor Supply means you're at the bottom. There is a slight chance of moving from Team Member to shift lead, assistant manager, or manager, especially if you're young. "
good,"High turnover rate. Some managers are good others are awful. Understaffed, dirty stores. Good policies but almost never enforced. Poor pay and almost no breaks."
good,"TSC is a business that promotes from within, so you do have opportunity to grow if you so choose. The hours can get a little early and a little late for a farm shop and the schedule changes within the week sometimes. Other than that, it's not a bad starter job."
good,"Workplace was very manageable, i was close distances within my job at the time. i also had decent hr and had very simple task such keeping the store clean and socked."
good,"The overall experience was ok, but I couldn't make everyone happy there. There were instances where I was to complete a project and  2 other projects from the other bosses at the same time. And on top of that, customer loyalty was down. I couldn't focus on helping the customer for trying to please everyone else."
good,"My experience with Tractor Supply wasn't the greatest. I did not hear much positive feedback from any management unless I was the one that said it. I loved my customers, I enjoyed my job, however the management made it extremely difficult. As Receiving Manager, I was expected to not only attend to and maintain all that I needed to do in the back room, but also to assist with the lack of manpower in the front of the store also. Which I did not have any problem in doing so, but when I stand for an hour lecture as to why I have two broken items still sitting in the write up box, or why I have not planogramed my receiving desk to the exactness as how the district manager wanted it, work became unpleasant. I felt like the higher management cared more about where my paperclips were located than the care of the customers in the store. There was also an issue with employees not wanting to come to work, which left me many times not working in the back room at all, but rather in front filling in for the absent cashier, or helping with the ever changing planograms."
good,learned alot
good,"decent work place, not much advancement oppurtunities. alot oh hours lost to temp workers."
good,"It is not difficult to be a TSC Team Member, so long as you enjoy customer service, but unfortunately there is little recognition for hard work or a job well done. To be a helpful employee, you must have a broad knowledge base of all products; you will get asked every question under the sun by customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at TSC. I learned alot from customers, about different farming strategies. Team work is definitley required as an employee."
good,I've spent 3 years here. Not a bad job but could be alot better. Management could be more competent. Part timers work their butts off for minimum wage and you will hate life after doing propane loadouts and hay and feed bags for 8 hours.
good,"I was with TSC for 12 yrs.  I was Cashier, key carrier, team Lead, assistant manager, store manager and ended my career with them as Receiving manager.  A lot happened in 12 years, the good and the bad.  Overall decent to work for"
good,"I loved my coworkers and I had great relationships with the customers. I worked as hard as I could but I felt like it was never enough. The SM would hire men and never put them on as cashiers, even though their job title was ""team member"" and being a cashier is apart if their job description. The people that sat around and did absolutely nothing never were wrote up for not doing their jobs. How can the SM and ASM wright people up for being late one day but they constantly call out, are late, or leave early? ""Equal opportunity"" was a foreign language. Certain people didn't have a chance to grow and move up in any way."
good,"its ok, not the best there could be more things that would make it better to work there but these things are not in place, i do not know why or how, needs longer break not just a 30 minute break not enough time to go to lunch, shouldnt be told the same thing 3 times in a row, shouldnt be told that i am working to slow on a pallet with 60 different items on it meanwhile customers, overall, i have new work experience and i am happy about that."
good,"Good hours."
good,Uncaring management with no consideration. Play favorites. No consideration to the fact that your life isn’t being their slave day in and day out. Drama and if you aint a favorite you get the jobs no one wants to do. I left while I could. Management stresses you out s had to up my anxiety meds.
good,The job was good the managing was notgokd and the schedule was always messed up not very good hours or pay the manager would not schedule correctly always hectic
good,"The manager was not consistent and often left his responsibilities up to his assistants. At the time I left there was a lot of racial tension, issues, and profiling which is why I left. From my understanding the shop is under new management and seems to be doing well."
good,"I found there was a lack of communication between local management and the home office.  Often when there was a sales circular, the Monroe store did not receive the merchandise.  "
good,"I loved my job at Tractor. It seem I did everything in my power to make our store a success. On opening the store we was able to beat profit each year and was told I was Store manager material. I was sent to special training preparing me to lead a store, but when the chance came the DM placed special demands on it. My pass performance didn't mean anything. The pay was extremely pour for the amount of work I was doing and was looking forward to this promotion. I don't blame anyone, but I feel I was let down. I turn in my keys and retired that day."
good,"I worked at tractor for three years and in those three years went through two managers neither of them were any good. I loved the work and my coworkers but the store manager just wasn't a very good manager. She would constantly leave early and leave us short handed, not leave the office (watch/manage us through the stores cameras), and would disappear when you needed help. Was also constantly taking smoke breaks, using the store phone as her personal phone, and always playing games on her cell phone while ""assisting"" customers."
good,"Great co workers, lousy upper management. Corporate really slashed payroll the last 6 months I was there, and there were never enough of us working to get the job done. Usually 2 crew and 2 or 3 managers, who liked to do manager stuff and not help with Getting the job done"
good,this place was a great place to work till I was being accused of stuff and come to find out it was the manager that was doing it to feed his addiction to narcotics.
good,"DM should not have operate on constant fear of termination "
good,At least once everyday one of my superiors comes and talks to me about something that I did wrong while contradicting themselves from previous conversations. It is almost as if I can never do my job up to their standard.
good,"customers can be rude, no one can become full time unless promoted to management and that is very rare. then say this is a fun place to work however it is not due to the hounding of managment."
good,"This is definitely a job where you can learn a lot from your customers and your coworkers. However it is also a very fast paced job where you need to know the right people to advance further than a shift manager. If in fact you become a shift manager you are not only expected to take on management duties but also the duties of any regular team member-great for learning to multitask however if you aren't in the right clique you will be the scapegoat for many store inspection issues.The best part of the job is throwing 50 pound feed bags, its a great workout."
good,"Many people called in causing for more work then 1 person can handle. Managers don't fire people until the 10th no call, no show even if they are lazy and don't do what they are supposed to do. Managers yel at you to finish other peoples work because others didnt. you constantly get called in on your days off. constantly have to be doing something even if youve already finshed everything and no customers. many customers are super sweet and make the place a better enviroment."
good,Management really needs help. they will have managers or team leads apply get hired and quit in the same week really sad. so the business is only as good as its management.
good,"love to help the customers! always so nice and happy, love my coworkers, have made friends with all of my coworkers, bad management. dont expect a day off cuz theyll call you in everytime. i was part time and they made me work 40+ weeks. Pay and benefits suck! and alot of those 10-14 hour day had no lunch/break."
good,"For the most part a typical involves running around helping customers, and taking phone calls. All the while trying to redo planograms and stocking shelves."
good,"i put feed away, the truck away and also help with customers. my co workers are okay to work with . the management could be better  some of them don't know how to take pressure on busy days."
good,Work was good but the material was very heavy for one person to lift. Pay was very low for the amount of work they wanted you to do. I wouldn't recommend this job for people over the age of 35. It's really a hard place to work at and it tears your body up.
good,In the beginning of my career at TSC it was fun and enjoyable.  However when management changed hands the atmosphere is completely different and I dread going into work on the daily basis.  It would be an awesome place to work if the Management of the store was different and if there was a Store manager who knew how to manage a store.
good,I enjoyed working with Tractor Supply Store. The store was very much like working for Lowes only on a much smaller scale. In this position there was no hope for promotions or enough hours.
good,a topical work day is a lot of work heavy lifting and a lot of pulling ! i learned alot of thing about different tools tractor parts and animal  feed. the managers was cool  they made sure you was working at all times. co- workers was nice and helpful at times. the hardest part of my job was pulling those 500 lb of horse feed. the most enjoyable part of my job is tha work.
good,low pay does not hire full time but works you full time missed placed my pay quite often.. thats about sums it up
good,"Typical work day for me as a part-time worker was usually a 8 to 10 hour day usually anywhere from 5 to 7 days a week. The manager at the time was not a good manager at all. He worked all this ""part-time"" workers at full-time and he just treated everyone poorly. I enjoyed being a cashier and answering phones. The hardest part was the lack of people working on the really busy days."
good,I was hired i thought full time told them I wanted full time I left a full time job to work there. This was a new store. just before opening they asked us who was full time i raised my hand. they then said they could not give everyone full time(  not the time to tell us this). Has soon as we were opend my hours started to drop. I went to manger and told him i need needed full time at least for now some were near 30 hours. he said he would and cut my hours to 12hrs a week. I got an other part time job and told him I could work certian days and would be glad to do so. So he schedualed me on days i could not work this happened to every one. we were lied to not a Copany I could trust to worh for or cares about its workers. this was in Wickenburg AZ.
good,"I signed on with TSC because I loved the passion I saw during my interview process. Although I had other options, they really reeled me in. But things have now changed as they tend to do when retailers get too big. They forget what got them to that point and it stops being about the people."
good,"I liked the fast-paced environment. I met alot of great customers and always looked forward to them coming back into the store. I gained alot of product knowledge so that I could pass onto my customers. My co-workers were great to work with and we all got along great. Lifting 50lb bags of feed got tiresome but as long as I was helping a customer, it was worth it. This is a great company but they did not stay on top of their management. As a team lead, I should have had a lot of additional training that was required, but whenever I asked about it so that I could work on it, I was blown off. When I left, I still did not have the training I was supposed to and I had been a team lead for over a year. Without the training, there is no chance of getting a promotion."
good,"I love my job but lately I’ve been feeling like I have to find something else. Every time they hire some new employees my hours get cut to nothing. I have a family of 5 to help support and 8 hours a week isn’t going to cut it. I have to buy diapers and formula for my youngest can’t do that with 8 hours a week at $9.50 an hour. "
good,Do your homework on salary negotiation. Be prepared for high stress and ridiculously high expectations. The information structure is a nightmare. Be ready to be thrown under the bus when someone else drops the ball.
good,Working for tractor supply was fun but the pay raises could have been better. When minimum wage went up all part timers went up a whole dollar while team leads only went up .30....a little bit of a slap in the face if you ask me.
good,"Nice team members to work with, and the work itself isn't hard. Just sometimes the company itself can make working for them hard. Even though working there was not the greatest all the time, I still enjoyed my job and didn't resent going in for my shifts."
good,Terrible HR department & management. They have no ethics and are out to get anyone who doesn't act like a puppet to their rules. They have way too much overtime.
good,Do to a small schedule budget it is hard to get a 40hr work week because the company won't give more budget along with store manager having her own select group if your not In it then don't expect to advance anytime soon
good,Ride a platter jack around picking orders and placing it on a pallet then wrapping the platter and placing it in lanes to be loaded on truck. Wearing a headedset all day receiving information of what to pick and place on pallet.
good,This company has grown to the point where communication has been all but lost and general direction for stores and company overall seems to be very scattered and disorganized. Very little concern seems to be given any longer to salaried employees and ever increasing demands without increasing compensation are placed on salaried manager.
good,Tractor Supply has a wide variety of products. For the most part the customer's are great! I know in my experience I learned a lot from our customers. I enjoyed the team that I worked with. Sometimes I did not agree with the management style. All in all its a pretty fun place to work.
good,"A typical work day here can include many things from cashiering to stocking feed yet you won't know until you come into work that day. For that day you do whatever your task is plus whatever management adds on wheater it's their work or just something extra while doing that you are taking care of load outs for any merchandise held outdoors where you would need to load it into the customer's vehicle. They do teach you how to operate a forklift and how to fill propane which is nice and done often. Management is full of ""good"" people as in that they are cool outside of work but at work, they constantly put themselves first while throwing you and your out of work life under the bus. They constantly change your schedule without telling you, laze about while giving you their work, or force you to stay longer but guilt tripping you over the slightest thing, an example being if someone called out for a night shift and they want you to stay they will constantly talk about how nothing will get done if you don't stay or how you owe them due to you calling out sick that one time. The managers will also cut your hours and secretly hand other works more."
good,You will do well at this company if you like to play games and get involved with others personal business. If you choose to keep to yourself and just focus on your job you will not do as well. If you play the game you will advance and have time for family work balance. If you go against the grain you will find that there will be no balance as you will be required to work closing and all weekends
good,I can't afford to stay here raises practicly non existent promotion not likely. Have been doing my job that was hired for and duties above some even at management level.
good,They kept me there working during the holiday and after my hours dropped a lot. only 1 day out of the week i worked.I honestly have nothing nice to say about this place.
good,"Not very good to employees, workers weren't paid fairly, the work wasn't evenly distributed among the workers, all around bad working conditions. Never really had stable upper management"
good,"I was new to the job. They never did tell me where anything went and expect me to know and know what everything was. I had many angry customers since I did not know much. With the angry customers and the ungodly amount of hours they gave me, I did not enjoy my time here."
good,It would be a real nice place to work if management would get more training in there own departments. They can't answer questions about the department that they. There is a lot of favortism it's who you know that's the only way to advance.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,Has the potential to be a great company but needs to put less emphasis on getting a new store opened and more attention to the understanding of company policies to its employees.
good,I didn't feel challenged enough. I was just the feed guy and stocked the feed shelves. Although I was not the only feed guy on the clock I ended up being the only one who was working hard.
good,"It's a great place to work I overall love working here. Great working, environment nice people and generally you just feel welcomed at this workplace."
good,Tractor Supply no longer supports or promotes women in the workplace. My recent experience was horrible. It's a boys club at many stores. I was never recognized or respected for my hard work or skills as a part of the management team. Resulting in my termination. The women are clearly singled out and treated as nothing more but cashiers and welcome door mats. It's unfortunate the CEO doesn't know what really goes on at the store level. I was a  very committed employee with the desire to make a difference and retire from this company.
good,Tractor Supply Company is an alright place to work if you are in shcool needing partime work. Not near enough hours and minumum wage is not worth for what all the jobs duties are.
good,"Not an easy job, management is scattered, no one wants to do their job correctly, policies are broken, accountability lacks, no morals, people come and go especially management"
good,To work if you have a farm or ranch or something along those lines. Fairly easy to learn everything once you get the hang of it. The discounts are great and the people are even better.
good,I use to love my company until I got into the management side. They pay SM and up more than what they are worth and step all over the rest of their employees. So much favoritism that I can't stand to even go to work anymore!
good,Stocking feed and helping customers. Great management. I learned a lot about managing inventory. It is a lot of physical labor but the people there are great to work with.
good,I like this job but  just can't stand on my feet 8 hours a day.  I have great co-workers.  I just don't like the hours I have to work...it keeps changing and I'm just on my feet too long.
good,"enjoyed customers, assisting customers, locating products"
good,"Tractor supply is a good in between job for high schoolers which would be good while going to school."
good,"I stated before that I enjoyed working for my home town Tractor Supply but the Management was very immature.  "
good,"I had a really good time working at Tractor Supply, the employees were hard working people, management were tough but fair, I enjoy the fast paced work that the company required, my, responsibilities were to start out as a picker on the floor, and then moved up to driving a reach truck forklift, where  my responsibilities were  to do replenishments, as well as put away inbound product."
good,"It was an ok place to work at first, but no one seemed to ever know what their job was or wasn't. it was very difficult to make changes to better a company or position when you didn't understand just exactly your job title was."
good,Work with good people in the main. Learned company directives fairly quickly. Management not as focused on preparing for advancement as should be. Keeping up with changes in seasonal areas biggest challenge.
good,"micromanagement seems to be the goal and example, benefits are decent but business is slow paced and inconsistent. Management is only concerned with self interest"
good,males don't defend female employees from harassment your job will be gone and you will be looking. safety is last priority and not important and no matter what you do know that your wrong in management eyes.
good,"TSC is a great company to work for;  however, the good ole boy attitude of the district I was employed in still existed in  this century!  Promise the moon as long as you work your hardest, but it never is good enough.  Get a five star rating on your review, only to be told you aren't eligible for your own store, but you can help run someone else's.  Oh, and yes you can train other manager in trainings, but we will never give equal pay to females...this was in my district.  Alot of promises, but no follow through.  The company though, is phenomenal!"
good,"A typical day at work is that I'm always learning more each day about the items we sale, as well as our customers"
good,"I learned a lot more here than I ever thought I would. I really enjoyed working there, and work hard was the order of the day. Weekends and holidays, irregular work schedules interfered with family plans. Most of the crew was comprised of teens and college students, but they were most always eager to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers have a good experience and create return customers. I was able to use problem solving skills quite often."
good,Enjoy the contact with people like farmers and equestrians ect.
good,Decent place to work while you are attending college or working someplace else for your real income
good,"The managers don’t make people do their job correctly. Team leaders complain to management that they get ignored and certain employees go and do whatever they want, and the managers  never do anything about it"
good,I would recommend it for students or people that have other jobs. The pay isn't good and the managers are lazy. The managers don't help and assist as should.
good,We need our old management back thease clowns have no idea what they are doing. They rely on the employees to there job and the managment job. Not enough space to say what all I want tp say!!
good,"Part time, hours change every week, from 5 to 35 hours no garuntee. lots of heavy lifting and standing all day. No structure to the work flow. High turnover in employees."
good,"They put all the work usually on one person, phone calls, cashier, load outs, stocking. While the rest of the employees sit in the back. If the manager gets an important call he gets mad if u come to him."
good,"I've been with the company for 22 years and up until the last three I've always praised them. They have been a good company until recently. I feel they've lost focus on what makes them such a great place for their customers and team members. They have been flexible, caring and customer oriented for as long as I've been there and they have strayed away from that and it is no longer a enjoyable relaxing place to go to every day. I use to love going in to see and help customers and now I dread everyday."
good,It's ok to work at Tractor supply. Supervisor on my shift is very hard to get along with. Very hostile environment to work with them. They expect you to do the job that is made for 3 people. If you don't hustle they treat you bad.
good,"Huge turn over. Management stresses team work and ethics, meanwhile no one manages. Lots of promises made during hiring interview, later to be disappointed and excuse filled answers of why the promises were not fulfilled. Hard work is not recognized. Store manager sucks up mostly all of the monthly salary with overtime. Seems like everyone is on their own agenda."
good,"Most the time at Tractor Supply management was hard to keep, and was rotated very often. Team members would randomly not come in, no call no show, or just quit. The store was often in disarray as there was no way to assure a lotted time to complete closing task as there were usually only 3 people on a shift, regardless if it were busy or not. Management would take complaints, but no solutions were ever sought after. More often than not I would find more assistance from knowledgeable customers than from management. The district manager over the location at which I worked was unhelpful as well as he would tell team members when a anonymous reports was made against them, but then enclose who it was that made the report, which would lead to high work tensions, and a lot of unnecessary conflicts.  There were a handful of regular customers who were always pleasant and made it easy to develop customer relationships."
good,Too much is expected in a short time frame.  The manager feels she can talk to team members any kind of way. The store manager sits in the office and says she's filing papers for 8 hours.
good,"TSC does not uphold their mission and values. Ethics, accountability and balance are my examples. Theft was high in the store I worked in. Mainly internal. When given hard evidence of employee theft, they said they had no grounds to terminate the asm, but later fired the asm for something petty after alot of money and product disappeared under her watch. Accountability is a joke, I was told to pick my battles by my dm. I could have easily terminated many employees for dishonesty, theft etc but was told not to.  Balance doesn't exist.  Some weeks I worked 60 plus hours and missed out on alot of family time. I even missed my sons kindergarten graduation because the key holders called off last minute knowing I had that important event to go to."
good,"I loved working at Tractor Supply. Talking/helping people at the counter really made you feel human. The job was never too hard. I got plenty of hours for the most part and planned on making my career here. That is, until I was brought into a room and yelled at through the assumption I was lying about a medication that I had to take."
good,Worked almost every weekend. Upper management it was their way or no way. My opinion was never valued. They would pick on me because I was a new young manager. The customer loved working with me and that meant a lot to me.
good,"Always something important to accomplish, never without meaning."
good,"Unfortunately, I had to leave this location because of the manager at the time. Sadly, numerous good employees left because of her. I don’t believe she is there anymore though and would highly consider working for them again since she is gone."
good,"A good after school or college student job. At the time, i was in college when i worked there and had an awesome boss who worked with me to flex my hours so i would be able to go to school. It felt good to work there and help customers find what they are looking for. If anything this job helped me with is to be able to socialize more with the public and lend a hand to anyone in need. If anything i don't regret working there during the time i was there."
good,"Never get to leave on time.  Always having to cover for people that called out on a constant basis but they never fired them.  Finishing other people jobs, cleaning up other coworkers messes, using foul language, calling workers stupid."
good,My experience with Tractor Supply Company was great aside from the management team. My coworkers and I got along well and I enjoyed the jokes that we made with each other. The most difficult part of the job was probably just the days that one of the employees or managers were in a bad mood. The part of the job that I enjoyed the most was being able to help the customers with different products. I learned how to stay calm if a customer became upset or angry.
good,Be prepared to hustle the entire time with limited rest and access to water.  Feels like you have a skeleton crew all the time.  Focus is on pushing the credit cards and insurance plans plcc and power plus and neighbors club.  Not an easy job. I love serving the customer but man does it get hard to do thar with not enough support.
good,it was a relaxed place to work not hard for the most part youd just stand there and smile. it wasnt hard and if they had more of a living salary i wouldnt mind working there for a little bit.
good,"Loved the customers, the work itself isn't very challenging . Can be very fast paced. I had a bad experience with an employee at the Covington store mistreating the people that were paid less and having to pick up her slack (even though she was a teamlead) . (Warning if you apply, she still works there)  Other than that there was not really any problem other than lack of promotions/pay raises."
good,TSC was very stressful and I was always being questioned like I didn't know what I was doing and it was completely unfair. very rude mangement that didn't like when you asked questioned.
good,"Poor management, lazy associates.  Manipulative management, never enough people to work the floor. Constantly cutting hours and rarely able to meet daily sales quota."
good,"When I first started here, I was very excited to try something new. I always enjoy challenging myself in my work ethics and I had worked one previous time at a lumber yard. I got hired because of my experience which I very much appreciate! The down side is how management schedules employees. Mornings at my store are always guaranteed to come out with an angry customer that felt like their needs weren't met because we're short staffed. Thing is, we are not, we have plenty of employees to schedule, my manager just doesn't care to accommodate for it? maybe It's corporate that won't give them more hours? regardless, it makes it difficult for everyone. management is also younger than me and it shows. They can be unprofessional, quick tempered, and in my eyes, doesn't have what it takes to run a store... time will only tell. My coworkers are great, everyone is pretty much on the same page about everything."
good,"lots of lifting which is often expected to do on your own. the application says 50lbs or less, but it is sometimes twice that if not more. poor management, no communication. i learned a lot of valuable job skills."
good,"I loved the customers and most of the people I worked with here. It's a great company, but my manager wasn't the best. She would ask for advice or ideas and if they weren't the way she wanted it done, we didn't do it. She wanted everything perfect and only the way that she wanted it done. Nothing I did was ever good enough for her. She would stick me up at the register all day long and then get mad at me that I didn't get my work done. It's a great place to shop, but not such a great place to work."
good,Tractor Supply is a good job if you’re looking for a part time job. It’s a good work environment and the people are great. It can be at times fast paced but generally it’s consistent.
good,I would not go back they are not nice to the employees at all and when you do something extra they take advantage of you i loved the work but it could have been betere
good,"Spent more time at work than with family.  Always being called in to work and cover someone's shift. Not enough help to get ""management"" tasks done. District Management was horrible."
good,pay is aweful. You work your butt off for next to nothing. employees are always frustrated. Not much else to say but this thing requires you to write too much about a job that just wasnt all that
good,"I like what the company is about and how it stands behind those in Agriculture, but the managers aren't the best and coworkers tend to form cliques. It was a normal, slow paced job, but it was hard to keep up with all the sales of the week. If you didn't sell more than what your manager told you, they would immediately get angry. It would be good for someone as part time job in high school, but don't recommend it as a career."
good,"tough job, not for the weak minded. Management is 50/50 on a likable scale. THE REGULARS THAT COME IN ARE THE MOST ENJOYABLE PART OF THE JOB! it's a job for country living people that know their gardening, wild life, animal health, truck and trailer, welding kind of job fields as well as tractor and other power equipment parts"
good,they have a huge rodent issue which makes it gross to work in. the hours they expect you to work vs the pair is not fair and they last manager was not a very present person.
good,"Being a team member is a fun and rewarding job. The downside, they higher ups wont let you go over 40 hours in a week for overtime, they will send you home. They are understaffed most of the time."
good,"High management turnover results in under-qualified individuals in leadership positions that micromanage the competent resources.  The people who are good at their jobs become frustrated and quit due to poor management and suppression of advancement opportunities. A tenured employee will be obligated to take on entirely too much responsibility and specialization for the comparative compensation offered."
good,stressful hours of working with some employees not willing to really work productively. Items found in wrong places in store to be seen  due to lack of demand.
good,great place if you want to work hard for nothing. you do get monthly bonus if the company makes money but it seems all they care about is money. Customers get irritated when askes 5 questions every time they come in.
good,"My last store manager was lazy and put all of his roles and responsibility on me. The district manager was just as bad. He had his ""golden"" children and would protect them on everything."
good,"hired as part time. no paid hoildays or vacation been with company over a year.coworkers are great there only 12-14 all together only 6 are full time,instead hiring a full time night cashier to work 5 nights a week they hire 4 and split hours."
good,"Tractor supply is a good place to work for a young person with Farm experience and if you can lift heavy feed bags 50/60 lbs. all day. This is a very physical job even for cashiers."
good,"I am not one to enjoy retail, so for someone who does, they may like this company. The products that are made by the company are cheaply made and cheap in price."
good,"Not bad for part time job. I need something full time and more pay with health and retirement benefits. Management needs to be worked on, manager is nice and thanks you for doing your job but puts a lot of his responsibilities on other employees."
good,"Tractor Supply Co is a store that you have to know many areas of life. Be that its animal feed, farm equipment, clothing, hardware, lawn & garden, or animal care. You'll need to take extra time from work just to familiarize yourself with everything. "
good,"This job has its ups and downs. Being local, it wasn't hard to adjust because I knew a lot of the customers. The stock feeding was back breaking. Having to move older feed out and stocking newer feed on the bottom put a lot of stress on my back. The people were friendly there but it's hard times with the economy so not a lot of business booming."
good,"Good pay is all I can say.  My experience is not going to be everyone's.  When I started, it was a good family oriented company.  Months later, top CEOs and management changed completely and company policies no longer focused on family values. The change was very obvious.  People got fired left and right, they regularly hire in large groups because the turn over rate is so high.  If you are single and only have to support yourself, this would be an okay job.  People with families, be prepared with lots of family support if your child EVER gets sick or has to leave school early, if you don't have that huge support system since not everyone does, try somewhere else."
good,"This is merely a part time job with no future. Definitely. Lots of shoes floating around. Some folks are discourteso to customers."
good,"I learned to handle farm equipment, communicate with the farming community and offer them the best products for their needs.  The job was not difficult even though management could be trying.  I was a cashier first of all, then stock and product knowledge came as I stayed employed there. I loved working with the customers and establishing rap pore with them.  The hardest part of the job would be stock and cleaning days having to be in before six am."
good,I learned quiet a bit in the short time I was with this company.  The management wasn't the greatest when handling stress or being under pressure due to being short staffed.  My most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help the customers and making sure they got all the assistance they needed.
good,"I have had 6 leaders in 2 1/2 years.   I currently work 11 hours a day starting at 4:00am and leaving at 3:00pm  Leadership changed every 6 months,  "
good,"Lots of people call in with no accountability held, which leave the rest of the team overloaded with work. Would be nice to get paid more for the work."
good,"Poor work/life balance. "
good,"No two days are the same. Priorities change daily based on the day of the week. Customer service is always number one. I enjoy the customers allot. The hardest part of this job is throwing 50 pound bags of feed and grain, and I am not getting any younger."
good,"I was fired for a 99.97 out of a 100% production level, short breaks, hot atmosphere, too much favoritism the supervisors get together and plot on employees this job has a high turnover rate"
good,"I was in charge of opening the store and closing the store. I was also in charge of setting encaps and on some occasions I had to close the store and do ending reports, and the following day I had to do the deposits also was over 5 employees."
good,"I learned and was certified to fill propane for customers. I was also certified to drive a forklift. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable was helping people with everything they needed and more. Also, just be up on my feet and on the go all day."
good,"Loved the employees and the customers, everything else sucked. "
good,It is a good starter job but it is always short staffed to save on money and underpaid. no benefits or anything else for that matter. It is the cheapest company every but their merchandise is expensive.
good,"I never got to do what I was hired for, if I was hired for clean up crew then I would say the job was fun. Very seldom did I get to stock shelves and I just found this unfair that they would hire me for stocker and make me clean every day."
good,"I worked almost every day and every weekends, many times open to close on Saturday and Sunday. I left the job because my boss would not give me the time off for my high school graduation."
good,"The job was great when i first started. Then the store got a new manager and things went downhill fast. The Manager had a personal grudge against me for some reason, he pitted the employees against each other and talked down to the female employees."
good,"Majority of mid-level management is very unethical and cover for each other - removing those that would undermine their behaviors. This goes against company ethics and values and anti-retaliation policy, but goes completely unchecked."
good,"Working at Tractor Supply, I dealt with a difficult management. The manager would clock in to work and then leave for the rest of the day until it was time to close. He would schedule only 1 or 2 people on the floor and have to scramble to call in people through out the day. The other sales associates were friendly. The best part of the job was seeing the same people throughout the week and building friendly and trusting relationships with customers."
good,Family is just as important as a work life. Work days have been slowing down and I would rather be on days shift. Management needs some work. Some co-workers are very hard working while others have poor attendance. No job is too hard. picking different merchandise
good,Hard working job with specific duties. Knowledge of different departments of the store. Maintain a positive attitude at all times.
good,"The day at work would depend on what day of the week it was. Monday I would stock dog and cat food. Tuesday, it would be freight and I would restock the merchandise. Wednesday would be an easy day that resulted in mostly helping customers. Thursday, I would stock livestock. Friday, would be much like Wednesday. Saturday would be the most busy day of the week. Lots of load and carry outs and answering the phone. Hardest part of the job was doing freight short handed. Easiest was customer service."
good,Tractor Supply is a great place to shop. But working there is not as glamorous as you would think. It was like a revolving door with employees coming and going.
good,The company as a whole was ok the new management was terrible I enjoyed the work pay was good My direct supervisor was great
good,Heavy lifting and low pay.. Little or no chance for advancement
good,i did learn a lot from this first job. i learn quick so i got the hang of it fast. i did what i was supposed to and always reliable and on time..
good,"I have a very upbeat, infectious personality, therefore I always went into work infecting others with positivity each and everyday. I make it a point to find the best aspects of any endeavor, and at TSC my favorite part was helping the customers and communicating with them on the best products; especially for their animals. Management was somewhat disorganized and the assistant manager in particular was a bit discriminatory toward women so it made my job an uphill climb in comparison to the males that I worked with. I learned a lot about farming, retail, construction, etc."
good,"ok place to work if you never want to move up."
good,"Okay, place to work. Its hit and miss on management. Great place to learn customer service. "
good,"really great place to work, would have like to stay there, but i got the job through a temp service."
good,"Great People, Great Customer service values. Usually short staffed due to scheduling restrictions.All in all a great place to work, just to far to drive for the money they pay."
good,"greeting customers, assisting with frieght, different aspects of the store, co workers are enjoyable to work with, the hardest part is during slow periods, most enjoyable part is being able to interact with people"
good,Balanced register and helped check-out customers. Stocked the shelves when slow and product came in.
good,"This was something very different for me, even though i caught on quick. you have to be very equipped with tools, animals, and feed. etc. something i was not use to. the hours were not flexible and i was very unhappy. i actually went to TC for a year because i was not satisfied where i had come to."
good,"I worked at Tractor Supply for 6 months as a receiver. The job was relatively easy and fast paced, but could be stressful from time to time. The management was abysmal though, I was treated like absolute garbage every day for 4 out of the 6 months I worked there."
good,"Marketing dept., is fine but there are a lot of politics which are triggered from the IT Dept., "
good,"TSC is a great store for livestock, housepet, and hardware needs. Some stores have questionable management and team members. Overall a decent 1st job site."
good,"They need more employees with a better attitude also a better manager! Work area is somewhat organized and clean, very nice customers, love meeting new people!"
good,"It's not something you can work a long time. If your looking for somewhere that has great managment or somewhere they stick by the companys ethics this is not the place. They pay is good well at least at some of the locations, not all tractor supplys pay the same. They expect alot without explaining alot."
good,"""Work Hard, Make Money, and Have Fun"" is their credo.  You DO work hard, but you get paid peanuts for that hard work and you're so under staffed it's hardly fun to work there.  You are told to ""do whatever it takes to provide legendary customer service"" but are second guessed by leadership above the manager's level.  The store management is waylaid when the metrics falter."
good,"The manager likes to micro-manage the employees who are actually hard workers while not requiring lazy employees to do anything. There are no consequences for lack of production which then causes the good employees to be overworked, feel underappreciated, and yet everybody gets the same pay. The pay is very poor which also leads to a lack of good, productive employees."
good,"Steady work with overtime, not much focus on employee growth.  While there it was not uncommon for management to have mandatory 6 and 7 day work weeks."
good,"Tractor would be a great place if they trained everyone equally"
good,Was once a great place to work. They have now become too project oriented and less focused on customer service. The sales plan continues to grow however the allowance for payroll does not.
good,"Like the company and my bosses are great, but hours are many and long. Usually short staffed so constantly being called to come in. Almost fulltime but without the benefits."
good,Had two managers quit within the 8 months I was there. Never had the right amount of employees on hand. I was completely bored most of the time. Wouldn’t want to go back.
good,"I believe that each store is different based on the management team. Across the board, TSC starts pay very low, and it is hard to make a living based on low pay, and few hours. I believe they have the right attitude about customer service, but should also be taking better care of their staff."
good,"It is a very fast pace and chaotic setting with people going here and there almost running over and into each other at times very safety minded but people just do what they can not to get caught breaking the safety rules, you don't have the summer holidays off only Thanksgiving Christmas and New Years. so if you are a family oriented person forget the holiday Bar B Ques"
good,"I am happy here. Since I started working here I have learned a lot. I have even learned somethings I did not know. All and all it is not a bad place to work.  As long as you realize there is no ""I"" in team you will do great!"
good,"The work alone isn't bad, but even after 3 years with the company I have only gotten $.47 of a raise way too low for how long i have been with the company and the expeirence I have. They try to get around it by giving store bonuses but everyone I have spoken to part time would rather just have the extra $ per hour."
good,"It is unfortunate that the company does not live up to their mission statement. The overall feeling from employees is that the pay and benefits do not compensate enough for the demand on the individual's time away from his or her family, or the physical demand on ones body."
good,Honestly did not enjoy.  Liked most customers.  Things have probably changed.  Pay and work life balance was not fun.  Smaller the store less support same standard
good,I did move up from part time to full time sorta fast. Went from cashier to ASM and MGR training within 3 years. But I had to push my way up the chain.
good,"While one may assume a typical day at work would be consumed with helping customers, it was not. Typically, I would work exclusively loading feed bags and freight with little customer interaction. The workplace culture was alright. The one saving grace of Tractor Supply was the good management team."
good,I didn't get many hours the longer I worked there. The supervisor wasn't very informative about things. They also didn't train me very well so I was often lost on where things were and what to do.
good,"2nd shift needs a female supervisor, and needs to stop being given the caca end of the stick compared to the other shifts. Not a bad place to work other than that."
good,"my experience with Tractor Supply Company was the worst professional working experience I have ever encountered. I would not work there again if they paid me twice what I made when I was let go and work half the hours. The management was indifferent at the anagement level, and the customers as well as management expected unreasonable performance at the individual level, and the pay was not fair for the work you were expected to perform."
good,"Its an ok job. "
good,It’s was an alright place to work. At the end of the day it wasn’t much more than a way for me to pay my bills. I can’t complain about the work itself however my coworkers were a bit distasteful.
good,"I love working with the customers and doing the manual labor, but the scheduling leaves little to be desired as their is no consistency.  We have a lot of great people working there, but we are always understaffed."
good,Took over department that was run down by the previous manager or never had a manager. Work on a cleanup and reorganize of Dept and within 5 months had it the top performer in the store.
good,loading truck in shipping is a fast pace job and you have to accurate when loading every pallet must be scanned to the truck and there is a method to loading the truck so it is balanced..
good,good professional workplace employees are nice and management is helpful . I have learnefd many things and is a good company to stqart off with and is a good sstaring job
good,"When I started with the company they were a good place to work. They placed an emphasis on their ""missions and values"". That was six years ago and now the company has gone downhill. They have placed a greater emphasis on chasing the dollar at the expense of company morale. Their ""missions and values"" are still touted as being something that they follow, but they routinely work counter to them. All in all, I do not recommend taking a job at this company at this time."
good,Your schedule is usually posted in the employee lounge but it changed so often because others needed to change their schedules that I had to talk to the manager almost every day to figure out when I would be working.
good,What I mean by that comment is the pay is not substantial and because of such few allowance of hours for so many par time workers you need every type of help you can get meaning that you're parents or relative or friends may give you proper lodging.
good,Tractor Supply could be a wonderful company to work for.  Everything is like a game to them.  You have to play along and keep management happy.  Your performance does not dictate whether or not you advance in the company.  It is all based on your manager's opinion of you.
good,"retail environment, no payroll, no room for advancement. Lack of leadership and willingness to work as a team. I learned what not to do as a manager. Culture was very gossipy and back stabbing. The hardest part of the job was the compensation. Most enjoyable part was being able to help customers."
good,"For a first time job it would be perfect , they work with your school hours but unless you plan on making it a career that's all it is a beginner job to get your foot in the door"
good,You can't move up in changing positions. You can not get full time employment. The schedule changes every week even after it's already been posted. There is favoritism shown there towards a few with the management team. If you are a hard worker you will not get recognized for it not even a simple thank you. It used to be a fun and busy place for people to come to and buy their product and socialize with someone they knew. It is nothing like that now that the store is under a new manager.
good,I loved my coworkers and I didn't mind the tasks that were assigned to me but the manager at my time of working there was not a good supervisor. Unfortunately I had to leave.
good,"It is a good opportunity if you are on the farming lifestyle. TSC does offer great benefits but very low pay. They cram 5 weeks of computer training into 1 week and then expect you to know everything with no supervised training. Very frustrating when customers come in expecting you to be an expert and you are not. Great opportunity if your cost of living is low and you are of the country lifestyle. If not, this job is not for you."
good,"Typical day includes setting up the work for the day as well as dealing with any issues that come up, culture is okay and seems to be getting better, the hardest part is dealing with people that don't come to work."
good,"Tractor supply was a great place to work when I first started in 2015. Through the two years that I have been employed, the management and staff have lost sight of what our goal is. The everyday goal is to do whatever it takes to get the customer what they need."
good,"MANAGEMENT NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!! I worked there for a year and 7 months got treated poorly, got accused of stuff that I didn't do, got yelled at all the time by the managers, Customers are super friendly, its a good place to work if you can get passed the management."
good,"Enjoy working there, but only receive minimum wage for a large amount of work with very little opportunity for advancement. Understaffed and overworked, but the district manager does not seem to want to help improve the situation. One team member has already quit due to being overworked."
good,I loved the environment that I worked in but the management did not care about their employees and made working there difficult.My experience was not the best at this store.
good,If you are a very multitasking person then you should apply to be a cashier at tractor supply. Over all you literally run the front of the store and are expected to assemble new displays and keep the whole clothing area organized at all times and keep the front of the store very clean and swept.
good,Hard company to work for long hours no home time didn't feel like I was a asset to the company high turnover for management and team members need better structure
good,"my typical day of work is the same as any other day in the week. Same stuff everyday. Its also a battle of the management, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. i Learned how to take care of the customer. Learned how to drive and operate the forklift."
good,"Got advancement very quickly. Went from being a team member to Team Lead within 6 months of hiring. Went to assistant manager 2 weeks before I went on maternity leave. I was the 3rd assistant manager within my year and a half there and 2 store managers, awaiting the 3rd one. Training is poor. I got thrown into being acting store manager lost. Got paid the overtime for the overtime I worked, did not get any extra income for running the store."
good,Tractor supply is a decent company to work for. They could work on a few small areas such as better communication with store managers and other team members on certain issues.
good,You have to be very fit to work here! Never do you have a dull moment! Multi tasking is a plus when wanting to work here! Knowing your merchandise and where its shelved is very important! Always keep on your toes!
good,A typical work day consists of moving product around and resetting shelves.  Freight day and truck days are different due to product being in the back and needing to be put out on the sales floor.  Management when I left needed improving.  The negativity of people wears one out and is not a fun place to work.  The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent hours and having a different schedule every day.
good,"Although I loved the atmosphere, the company itself was not so great. In a year I got one raise after 6 months, not the first 60 days like i was told. Also there was no moving up. i never missed work, picked up everyone else's shifts, and taught myself to do everything and never got a thank you!"
good,I liked that I was always on my feet and had plenty of tasks at hand and that my objectives were usually made pretty clear. It was very easy to interact with the customers and had time to get to know each one.
good,"I've been with Tractor Supply for about two and a half years now and I can honestly say it has been a roller coaster ride. The pay, though better than some retail stores, is still very low and the hours are all over the place, even for full time members like myself. The only person with a set schedule is our receiver. Pay and hours aside, there is literally no communication between the management team. Well, what I should really say is that some management communicates well while others do not. I hate coming to work and dealing with a customer that was originally helped by my manager only to find out that he did not in fact help them. This then leads to me fixing the mess while getting yelled at from said customer. I've even gotten a negative review from a customer that my manager and assistant was supposed to have helped and didn't. I had no idea about the situation and because of this the customer chose to write a negative comment about me. On top of all this when I moved to a new store in a new state they decided to take my raise away from me. What's up with that? Tractor Supply is good if you're only looking for a temporary job but I do not recommend staying for more than you have to."
good,"In the receiving position the work load is next to impossible particularly with hours constantly being cut. The customers are great and so were the other team members.The store manager needs a lot more training not only in how to manage people but also in what his store sells and how the day to day business operates. The new managers that I have been associated with are well versed in reports but not in the store itself. Training used to be thorough but now new associates are just kind of thrown on the floor in part due to the constant cutting of hours. Corporate is making boatloads of money but always always cutting payroll, not the workload just the amount of people and time to complete the constant list of tasks. Pay is the lowest that I have encountered in retail chains other than among the ""dollar stores"". After 3 1/2 years had to go, part-timers are being hired at 50 cents an hour less than someone who is been in a management position."
good,very stressful place to work with horrible turnover rate. But at the end of the day it is what you make it to be. The hours and discount is great.
good,must be comfortable multi tasking and be able to change priorities quickly. Comping has been on growth curve for several years
good,"It all depends on the boss on how you are treated. Typical stuff, most busy Monday, then it slows down to the end of the week. It is great to be appreciated by going home early before a holiday."
good,"There isn't much room to advance in the company. Co- workers are "
good,"I clock in and head to the registers, sometimes the lines are backed up really bad.  I help as many customers as possible and do the best I can to find what their looking for.  If we don't have an item I will call a store they wish to travel to.  I call for cashier assistance because I know my line could get backed up.  After I help the customer my boss chews me out on the floor in front of people for helping a customer with what they needed.  The people that are supposed to be helping with customer assistance are all in the back.  I have to make call outs multiple times for them to load items up sometimes.  After we close(we close at 8) we have to stay at the store until 9:45 even if everything has been recovered and looked over 2 to 3 times. After 9:45 hits we get to leave.  The hardest part would be trying to get my line down without any help after I call it out 2 or 3 times.  The easiest would be getting to deal with the customers and interacting, I love learning about them as I help them out and make sure their experience is good.  Co-workers are nice but I hear them talk about people often, just not trustworthy like co-workers should be.  Management does not work with schedules very well, and he was involved with my softball career until it got in the way to much.  Not understanding of younger students in High school/ college."
good,While working here I have learned about so many items and animals. I have learned what animals can take and medicine to give along with farming equiment. I enjoyed my employees.
good,This was my first job. Other than the managers coming in like a revolving door (meaning they only lasted at the longest 6 months because they didn't know much about farm equipment or animals.)
good,"in my time at Tractor Supply, I enjoyed a few of the employee's but the manager rarely came out of the office and was also very rude to the customers. Work loads were not evenly placed among each employee and the employee's were not happy."
good,Tractor supply is family oriented. They believe family is first.
good,"Good place to start if you want retail experience, other than that they are always cutting hours/"
good,TSC is extremely physical work with demanding task level and long hours. Total compensation at each position is in the market but you will need to work overtime to reach it. Sales goals are not realistic – except to make bonus only in months where missed previous year and miss where you made it last year. This leads to every other year bonus in practice. Opportunities exist if you are willing to relocate to new markets where company is expanding. Advancement in established markets is slow and can be extremely political with manipulative District and Regional management. Often promoting on cost savings to company.
good,- A full day of customer service.
good,come in at 6am and work until 3.the management does not look at temps to hire fullt time. co workers are honest and easy to get a long with. sometimes there is heavy product that is hard to lift.
good,The location i worked at for tractor supply started off great but shortly after one of the team leads made it so that i didn’t have much of a chance for promotion. No promotion meant no raise and i definitely needed more money. I believe it was that specific team lead that led to my downfall i’m sure at another location I would’ve have succeeded.
good,"Management is definitely not a great example of what other Tractor supply stores are run.  This store unfortunately has a management group that solely thinks of profit, not the employee."
good,"Not enough hours. I'm only working 2 to 3 days a week and 4 and a half hours on those days. I need more hours to pay bills."
good,"He didn't want to manage stores in Nebraska and made the experience unbearable.  He would rather ask employees than his managers what types of challenges were experienced.  He didn't investigate any allegations, just took the word of employees.  Unable to get the work done with allotted monies."
good,Tractor Supply was a good company you must know a lot about veterinarian techniques and what to do with animals because that's most of what was asked of you from customers coming into the store good luck
good,not enough employees and quite a bit of slacking by other employees. Always ended up with other peoples work on top of my own. Corporate had a good culture that was not followed at the store level.
good,"It had its good days and had its bad days. Team atmosphere was good. Management was good. If I could improve anything, it would be better communication."
good,"Have I ever had to defuse a situation?"
good,A stressful place to work because training was not great and there was constant turnover of employees.  Management did not stand behind employees even when they were following policy.
good,"It is a great opportunity for people who like the farm life. I love animals and that is why I took this job. It is hard work, nothing is really easy. You put in overtime all of the time. You deal with happy customers, but you also deal with a good selection of upset customers. You lift a lot of heavy merchandise and feed. Lots of load outs. Management is hard. It isn't every store, but this one has a very high volume. It is very hard to keep up and also very hard to keep people to work with. This job will wear you out, but it'll keep you in shape.lol."
good,"When I first started working at TSC, I was so excited. I made the most amazing friends / family there, and my Manager and AM were amazing. They helped me out with everyone, and all of my coworkers helped me out as well. Management went downhill when the manager and AM left, and the new boss was horrid. They didn't help at all and gave stupid hours."
good,"Difficult to work there at times, still are certain certification I haven’t gotten and certain functions I cannot do becomes I’m still not certified. It just feels like no one cares."
good,Is an alright place to work if you are willing to put in physical effort for little reward.  Management is generally hard working but upper management tends to be very disconnected from day to day tasks and ongoings.
good,"the workers are lazy, the manager never around. The management is not run right. they need to be better. The schedule is never the same, Always short staff."
good,"Working culture is sort of bad. Employees don't get along. Can affect working environment. Employees frequently don't get along, hard to advance, no real leadership."
good,"The absolute best thing about my job at Tractor supply company, was getting to see all the dogs and puppies, the occasional pig and goat coming in the doors."
good,"Loved working with the people, the thing I didn't like is the culture supported by upper management. It was a culture of stress not success, management preferred associates working behind the eight ball rather than feeling a sense of accomplishment."
good,The floor was usually understaffed for the amount of business it receives. Its difficult to provide top notch customer service or fulfill daily expectations when there aren't enough personnel.
good,My job duties included stocking the back all day. It was fun to see what all they had in stock for future ideas. I would use my discount often since I have a farm back home. I wasn't my type or ideal job setting but it worked for the time being
good,it could be a lot better but no manager will put forth the effort to make it better. and those who do can't for one reason or another. the store manager is a joke. it is almost imposable to advance with out prier manement experience. you work no nothing. it is not worth the time to do it.
good,They demand far more than they are willing to pay you for. You belong to them 100%  They are unfair to Store Managers and have unrealistic Sales and labor goals
good,I loved my coworkers they made it fun. The job wasn’t hard. It was usually just 2 in entire store when it got busy you had to be on your toes. If it was slow you’d just pick up and clean.
good,"Working at TSC was great, but management needs tons of improvements.  Management will degrade you in front of others, talk about you badly to other employees.  I found it to be a hostile inviroment if you're not in the managers click."
good,"It’s a good company long as you have a great crew, and good management who respects eachother. The work expectation load can be rough especially if understaffed on certain days."
good,"I (female) was paid almost $2.50 less than my male counterpart to do the same job. I started to feel un valued. There were a lot of internal problems, between operations, management, and store appearance, that were not being fixed."
good,"I have been at TSC for a little over a year and a half, and I can just not take the poor pay any more. My manager has put his hours and pay before anyone else's and has constantly put his hours first."
good,I enjoyed working at TSC for as long as it lasted due to I already knew a lot about hardware and farming. i got decent discounts and made a bit more than my previous job but the manager/head of the store was horrible towards his employees and customers. He was fired by corporate after i had left to find a real job.
good,Did not leave this place on a very good note. There were some people I did enjoy working with. I just wish it supported their workers and helped us out with our pay.
good,If you have good management it's a good place to work. If you don't then you will not like working there. The last two manager just wanted to sit in the office and walk around very poor customer service on their part.
good,The clientele in this establishment make the job worth while everyday. There are some issues that could be better when it comes to the management and  scheduling. Not enough training and  company culture is non existent.
good,"Very unbalanced.  every one had a different view of how things where to be done. "
good,"Store has good team members, but management above store level has no focus or vision. Executives fail to see the market that Tractor Supply serves. Executives have no concept of what Tractor Supply sells and who the customers are. The current consensus is that the execs running TSC are failed execs from other retail establishments"
good,From my experience at tsc I would rate the job a five. The job was not the bad but I didn’t enjoy working with most of the people ther at tractor supply.
good,"Managers fine greatly care about employees, they see them as replaceable. Customers are allowed to treat employees terribly and if they complain about you for not kissing butt, you get talked to and written up and told it’s your fault. It’s always guilty until proven innocent"
good,"Your work environment depends entirely on your general manager. Be prepared to hustle. A background knowledge in agriculture is recommended, but not required."
good,TSC was a lot of fun and has been for the past year but it's retail and the store I work in you get a lot of the regulars that come back but no advancement  positions because it is such a small store.
good,"Pleasant experience. Good opportunity to learn about a wide variety of products. Very physical work, very hands-on, can get pretty dirty. Its a great place to work for those who don't mind working hard and getting dirty."
good,"our manager is wonderful, she cant really make a scheudule but works with you as best she can. the new assistant is on a power trip and not much fun to work with or for. I like the people I work with but I do think I deserve more pay. the staff is friendly for the most part."
good,"Great place to work, but advancement on the distribution side takes awhile due to only having 7 Distribution Centers. Otherwise the work atmosphere is great, good team work and an overall great experience."
good,"Supervising employees to ensure a productive work environment."
good,"You would come in and go to morning kick off, and than go get your tickets and start picking, than take your breaks and than go back to picking until the end of the day."
good,"Typical work day was clock in, straighten up clothing area, check out customers, help with questions, make sure front of the store was neat and easy to find what the customer was looking for. At closing time, sweep and mop the front, take the trash out, clean the bathrooms, and watch the mod count the deposits. Management was okay. The hardest part of the job was having a little amount of time at night to complete all the tasks for cleaning up and having it look perfect. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,Days at work vary from high stress to barely any customers. I like helping people at my job. I like the people who I work with and how we pull together as a team.
good,"TSC is currently going through a phase in which there are not enough employees to staff all of its stores in my area. This has resulted in many challenges, particularly around work/life balance. It is a good company that has some issues to work through."
good,Not everyone lives the mission and values.  Everyone needs to be held accountable for upholding their role and responsibilities. Diversity is lacking in this company.
good,"Stood around until someone was ready to check out, swept the floor over and over again, fixing merchandise on shelves. Management was excellent when she wasn't running around, and the workplace was ok. Didn't learn a whole lot, wasn't really given the chance, I would have liked to learn more then being a cashier. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers and the hardest part of my job was quiting, if they wouldn't have cut my hours from 35-40 hours a week down to 12-15 hours a week and moved me from a cashier to something else to keep me busy, I would never quit but standing around doing nothing got a little boring. Plus they have employees with attitudes towards others and when taken to one management, nothing was ever done because she's been there longer then any employee and management, my opinion is, I think because she's been there longer, they didn't want to chance losing her as an employer."
good,"fast paced, great atmosphere to work in, friendly people, physical work environment, management is fair and honest, work life balance is not what it appears"
good,This is not the place you will get a lot of funds. It fun and easy work but not much to move up and the pay is below what I expect from anyone. Been there for 2 years and am getting paid less than all the new people hired. Asked if I can at least be making what they were.....NOPE! I only stayed for the 15% discount off grain for my livestock but was a waist of time!!!
good,good company but a major lack of communication. management is very strict and the company doesn't keep store completely stocked
good,"you would get your equipment, and get to work, have 2 20 min breaks "
good,"It sure is fun to work here, but not a job to keep a family income! More like a job for a teenager. Wish I would have known. The co-workers are always fun to be around though."
good,"Great company, but the hardest part of the job is the lack of a manager at the Huntsville branch. All the assistant managers act like their head honcho and what they tell you to do gets rather confusing."
good,While corporate is solid. they leave out the extreme lifting you may have to do and dont really warn applicants until after they start. I was on limited duty from a work injury and no accomodations were made due to limited staff and others willing to assist me when i could not do work because of the restriction.
good,"A typical day at work for me is answering phones, greeting customers, cashing customers out as well as carrying out there bags,freight as well as floor sets. I have learned a lot since June in regards to how to be more proficient with add on sales as well as more knowledgeable about our products we sell. Management is great they are very helpful and have taught me about basic managerial skills as far as hands on goes . My co-workers are fun and we get along well, The hardest part of my job is not being able to fullfil customers needs when they are specifically looking for a product we do not have. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the customers get to know me and ask for me ."
good,"* Large product mix involving hardware, small farm supplies, landscaping, indoor and outdoor decor, clothing and pet food."
good,To be honest I have nothing against tractor supply but they could do better to higher more help with all the business that they see.
good,"The company is decent, it's tough for job advancement. Management doesn't recognize the hard work that you do. Motto is work hard, have fun and make money."
good,"Loved working here, but as time moves on want more done and less resources allotted to you.  Expected to operate an entire store at times with only two people.  Due to the nature of our products, customers need assistance having things unlocked, cut, etc and you also had to be doing load outs and carry outs as well.  Not well managed from the top.  My advice to upper management is to not forget this isn't the ALDI of farm stores and if you do not equip your teams to provide legendary customer service, customers will go elsewhere."
good,"A typical day at work was waiting on customers checking them out of the checkout lines.  Providing the best customer service and helping them find items they couldn't locate it themselves. Making the store look presentable throughout the day during slow times. I learned to smile thru the good and bad times.  Management was always changing while I was there, so you would get use to one team lead and then it would change.  My dependable co-workers were great to work with and would do anything to help each other out. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the schedule changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and making them happy so they would come back."
good,"A typical day at work is a busy one, You are given an array of tasks such as doing a recovery, (Cleaning a certain area of the store) and when you are finished someone must check your area. Between your tasks you must assist customers with various needs including finding parts for lawn mowers/tractors, lifting feed, (50 plus pounds) and doing work outside in the side yard.The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with difficult customers which can be both taxing and educational and the physical demand of lifting heavy items when necessary. My co-workers are from all different walks of life which makes the company diverse in a positive way with so many different view points. the Management team is knowledgeable and works well together. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk to all of the people who come through the store on a daily biases, many own small farms in the community and are recurring customers who we know and cherish."
good,"no organization "
good,"What i learned at Tractor Supply is how to operate a forklift/Stand up pallet jack. The management was good but could of been better. The hardest part of the job was working in Dog food for 7/hrs and 20mins lifting 50 pound bags building 6 feet tall skids it was tough. But what made the days good at Tractor supply was the Co-workers, working with them made the bad things good alot of joke's was said it was fun i maded good friends at Tractor supply."
good,"A typical day would start with a team meeting in the morning, followed with daily stretching.One of the things I learned at Tractor Supply was operating a forklift and mobile pallet jack. The management was great, and my co-works were also very fun hard working individuals. The hardest part of the job was sometimes working in harsh weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the career advancement, and training."
good,stephenville was not as enjoyable as brownwood. brownwood is a very great employer with good managers and team members who work very well together
good,Overall a good company to work for which offers monthly sales bonuses and profit sharing. The unfortunate aspects are that due to low wages and few payroll hours allocated it is difficult to incorporate the investment of profit sharing into an average budget.
good,Tractor Supply emphasizes customer service and community involvement by being a moral and ethical company
good,"Stocking of goods and performing customer services. This is a fun loving place to work. As long as you do your job and get to work on time, you will be respected and get rewards."
good,"A typical day at work starts with being greeted by fellow employees everyone gets along great. Clock in, see what the sales plan is and head up to the register to work the register, checking out customers, dealing with returns, answering the phones and making sure the front of the store (inside and out) is neat and orderly. "
good,"Its a very busy work place so it keeps you on your toes, my typical day at work consisted of running the register and stocking supplies when needed, I learned a lot about farming equipment that I didn't know"
good,If your into Agriculture this job is a great starting job. I enjoy working for the company because of how much you can learn from farmer to farmer who enters the store. Don't forget this is Retail. Although this company is great as a starter its not for the mid career employee. To be honest the pay dose not correlate or benefit the employee who understands more of the agriculture business. I was lucky to work with great management but I also question other stores management and how they got to where they are. They promote under favorite or easiness. With that said veg as this review is trust me in the fact that you don't get promoted for the things that you know but the time you put in. Which makes a great starting job but middle of the road folks need to find another company
good,"they short-staff a lot of days because they don't want to pay for many employees. When i ruptured a stomach ulcer, i was not able to go home.. I had to deal with the extreme pain. They train in different areas so you are not stuck to one task.  But pay was consistent, and the boss will work with you."
good,"Constructive place to work, good balance work/ school scheduling "
good,"Best retail job I ever had, but it dont pay the bills. The job/workload is realistic. Very laid back ""Customers come first"" environment"
good,"I liked the work at Tractor Supply but didn't particularly care for management. There was a complete lack of respect for hourly employees and we were continuously threatened with losing our jobs, although I did get along great with my day shift supervisor and my night shift supervisor. To me there was no hard part to my job, I always enjoy the physical work. The best part of my job I thought was being able to work alone, knowing exactly what I needed to do and getting the job done."
good,They were very supportive and willing to work with my college schedule.
good,"This is a fun place to work, the attention is on customer service which I really enjoy."
good,"Over work you for not enough pay, and also sign you up for ""benefits"" when you are not even in the same state..."
good,"It was an okay place. I struggled getting time off even though I was a young college student with a lot on my plate. I often felt needed, but not appreciated. overall, it is a good place to start."
good,"The people you work with will be some of the friendliest people you meet. The manager of the store is another story. You will probably learn a fair bit while working there, even if you think you know most everything."
good,"Worked with my changing schedule at school, but past that they felt as if they should of come next over family. the pay was better than some but not as good as others. the fact that they would work around my schedule and were located so close to my school is the key to me working there. a great first job but normally will not hire under the age of 18."
good,Good people great customers friendly faces good management an friendly coworkers very resourceful an helpful easy goin environment lost of new experiences
good,"I loved my job. I loved one of my team members because she was a team player. Always had fun, but also made sure all the work was being done. The hours were awesome, but I was working a lot. I never had time for anything and I became very, very exhausted."
good,"It’s a good place to work while in school, and management will work with you on scheduling. But when you’re out of school they will work you like a dog and while the money is nice, it’s easy to get burnt out quickly. They hire people who aren’t qualified for management positions to work above you instead of promoting employees who know what they are doing and have proven themselves to be strong workers."
good,Tractor supply is a great company to work for. They could pay their employees a tad more. Interesting place to work for and they are pet friendly. two thumbs up.
good,"its a very labor intensive stressful job, required more effort from certain individuals, and at times was chaotic. with the lack of personnel and the change of management in the past 4 years ive been working"
good,"It was a good place to work,reall did like the people i worked around.The only problem that i had there was all the schedule changes and spur of the moment O/T that they called.They changed management to often,this was from the front office down to the supervisors."
good,"Pay is meager for the expected work volume. However it is very flexible for family schedules. Mandatory breaks are not often given, but it's a fun light hearted environment."
good,"Fast paced and hectic call center environment.  There is barely any way to advance your career here, with Tier 2 usually being outsourced.   Other departments are available from within but they don't relate to the IT field.  Good luck if you have any HR issues."
good,Lack of communication on procedures between shifts and management along with accountability. Holding every one to the same standards is crucial a d unfair
good,"Higher up doesn't care about anything but profit. They're constantly cutting payroll then yelling about everything that needs to be done. Most everyone I've worked with has been wonderful, there's lots of bonding time with coworkers, this does lead to some gossip depending on your team. Overall it's a fun place to work, always something going on."
good,"Good company that has been supportive in many ways. However, very lean staffed, resulting in plenty of extra hours. Becoming more flexible in work schedules over the years. Typical day involves lots of time at a desk."
good,Its face paced.. Managment tries to find resaons to give you erorrs when its a slow time but dont say anything when they are in the busy season. Thanks
good,"Typical day is running the register, customer service, putting freight away, running the forklift and organizing the store. I have learned lots of skills to work in retail. The hardest part of the job is the ability to balance home and work. I love working in retail, meeting people and all the animals I get to see everyday."
good,Customers are great but pay is low and expectations are very high. When executive management comes to visit expectation are if they like you easy. If you try something different you regret.
good,"its alot of work but can benefit you in the end. You can learn alot from this job to help with future endeavors. It is mostly standing on your feet for long periods of time, and as well as lifting some heavy items."
good,"Customer service & driving sales."
good,"If you love outdoor life and customers, then this is it. Sometimes hard, heavy work. Not very family friendly but it is retail. Great learning ground for this career field."
good,Once you sign on for salary you have no work life balance. Their so called mission and values go out the window for their store managers. The expectations are ridiculous
good,The management wasn’t very good. The coworkers on the hand were very nice and I thought of them as a family.  I didn’t want to leave TSC but I needed more hours and more pay.
good,It is a good company but is not ran the best. I would recommend to others as a good place for discounts but nothing to stay at for the future. Also good work experience to begin with.
good,"A typical day at work starts you off short staffed in the mornings (3 people), slightly better coverage in the middle of the day, and short staffed at night (3 people). Lunch coverage was always difficult because you become even more short handed. If you are one of the managers on duty (usually only one in the morning, one at night, some cross-over in the middle) your lunches are frequently interrupted. Don't count on your ten minute breaks either, those just don't happen. The customers are wonderful, its a specific crowd that shops at TSC and they are people who all have farming/ animals/ ranching/ in common. Lots of theft unfortunately mixed in with the good customers. Managers on duty are expected to perform a plethora of tasks (price changes, stock resets, ordering feed, supervising employees to make sure their tasks are done, operating the forklift, etc) in a rushed amount of time while also catering to all customers, phone calls, and directing employees who need assistance. On top of everything, they also are required to have a pristine store at the end of the night, ready for opening the next morning. The amount of responsibility and stress that is put on the managers is not nearly compensated for by the sad amount of pay they receive."
good,"Fast-paced if you care about customer service, but there are those who do not care.  The committed employee is expected to compensate for the deadbeat."
good,"Time spent with the company was over all good, good people to work with, and great customers. Never enough people working the floor. Hard to get anyone to do customer service. Pulled in different directions with each turn."
good,"Very stressful but manageable place to work. Phone ringing off the hook, customers everywhere on top of doing your daily job duties. You are given a list of duties to do in between customers in the store and on the phone. The customer is First!!! Love the people I worked with at the time, not many of my fellow team members are still working there. We went through 4 managers when I worked there and the last one was horrible. I felt like I was back in High school. He had his favorites..."
good,"The District Managers ask for stores to do things that are impossible, especially for the amount of pay and number of employees available. Communication within a store is good but from stores to upper level management there is no communication. Cashiers have to ask every customer a minimum of about 5 questions during checkout which makes every customer become impatient and mad. My store manager had to work every day from open to close just to keep up with the requirements from corporate."
good,Teaches a wide variety of skill sets from training to selling to inventory to stocking to customer service. Work directly with the customers with a first name basis
good,"It was a decent place to work, just like any retail job you have your slow days and your busy days so the over all pace of the job depended on the day. The scheduling was kinda whacky while I was there but wasn't too bad."
good,"They cut our payroll, which meant we had less people, normally 3 to cover a 1850 sq ft building and side lot, One cashier, One manager and One cashier. It is not sustainable over a long period of time. Changed our health care plans and pricing."
good,"Good for a high school student, but once you graduate, get outta there, raises are pitiful and rare, while promotions are pretty much unheard of, they hire from outside the company."
good,Loved tractor supply as a company but 3 hours a week isn't enough to cut it even for a student. I would have loved to stay but the hours just made it not worth my while.
good,"Tractor supply always has things for me to do, there is never nothing to do. A typical day for is going to work and doing a dog, cat, and bird pick list. I go to the back room and get the feed that needs to go on the shelves, and then i put it away. After that i go to the feed room and start stocking the shelves and dropping the feed pallets with the forklift. During the time i am dropping feed i am usually getting load outs, which means taking feed to customers cars and loading it for them. Also, filling propane tanks at the same time."
good,tractor supply is a great place to work. but the overtime is mandatory 85 percent of the time out of the year. makes it hard to plan any events around it. and it makes it hard to have a family life outside of work when you work 5 10 hour shifts a week.
good,great people and place to work. i really enjoeyed it here. i worked cash stand and i loved being able to talk to people and learn about there anaimals. ive learned so much
good,"The place was okay, some days were stressful when they would give me a large to-do list but most days were pretty relaxed and some days were boring with not much to do."
good,It is ok A typical warehouse job long hours  The pay is ok and the Managment  change out  every other year all in all it is an ok Job I made a lotta of friends
good,"it’s fun having a strong connection with the customers and growing a relationship with them, tractor supply is a fun company to work for. it is very easy going weekends can be busy."
good,"Low pay, as in retail, but much harder work, especially for the guys. Managers don`t make any money until promoted to Store Manager. Promotions are hard to come by, and annual increases are horrible."
good,this job is very fast paste and stressful i enjoy doing what i do i just would like for management to care about there employees. Alot of favoritism in this company no growth
good,Working for Tractor Supply in Conway Ar  is not a bad job. It is okay for a part-time position. Right now I am currently looking for more hours and higher pay.
good,Very well managed and very set way ways of doing business. Warehouse out of touch with store merchandising. The work is tuff under strict guidelines with very limited employees available to get the work done.
good,"Very similar to other retailers, very regimented. They have procedures and policies that have to be followed. The DMs must approve team leads which is very frustrating.  Store Managers have little power in hiring their leads and ASMs.  Customers are great, team members are great."
good,"I learn how to use almost every piece of heavy machinery out there from working at Tractor Supply. Some of the managers were pretty nice to work with, while others could be difficult."
good,"I really enjoyed working at tractor supply, but after a few years of working at one store and moving onto another the dynamic changed in a way that wasn't fitting for me, and eventually lead to me finding myself at L&M."
good,Fast pace environment with lot to learn about this position. Would like to work more hours than I'm assigned. I'm willing to learn  more and continue education is always offered on a monthly basis as well as going to help out in other stores when help is needed. I enjoy helping out customers and trying to do the best job that I can every day of work. looking for new ways to improve the job is always a plus and welcomed by management.
good,Its great for entry level managers but the pay isn't that great for people with experience.  Lots of work to do and not enough labor to do it all.  They preach balance but in the end it's all about the money
good,"for the work that they ask of a person, to learn to do everything, for minimum wage is too little. advancement to asst. manager only $2.40-2.90 more an hour for much more responsibility. Good hard work, good environment, little pay."
good,A day as a cashier at Tractor Supply was usually uneventful besides ringing up and helping customers find what they needed. Great customers and even better coworkers to help you i any way you needed. The hardest thing about the job was keeping angry customers in a good mood and putting on your best face to make their experience a little better. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home after a long day knowing i was able to help and ensure customer's satisfaction and leaving without any complaints
good,Typical day at work for me was assigning tm their daily task in order to meet the goals of the operation. Checking on the production of the Tm's and improving their overall performance.
good,Upper management not very flexible in general or wise in decision making. Operation is not well-organized and management is not open to suggestions from team members.
good,When I first started it was a good place to work then I transferred to another store that was much more fast pace. It wasn't so fun after that the manager was not a nice person causing me to get hurt.
good,"Everyone that works at this place better be prepared to do heavy lifting as necessary!  You will get your hands dirty.  I took this job starting as a sales associate and eventually learned to place special orders, manage shipping and receiving, and became a master of the forklift!"
good,"There's a saying about Tractor Supply Company, ""You guys do a lot with very little"". The culture in the building is great. Lifestyle's of team member and management are very similar, like minded."
good,"For a beginner in the retail world, this allows you a small hometown experience, and training. You get hands on small town feelings and understanding of the basics of retail."
good,"You are working for a production based company. The hours are good but you will be working a lot of overtime. You have the options to move up in the company. Every one is pretty much on your own, but you will have to make your production"
good,"Management is very unstable, most will work with your schedule. Lifting and moving heavy items on a daily basis along with being detail oriented is a must."
good,Good growth and chance of advancement.  Life/work balance is disappearing within the company.  Salary for western Washington is low.  Work day changes all the time.  You get a chance to help and speak with customers with any and all projects and needs.  Management is ok.
good,I enjoyed working at TSC when it comes to the coworkers I worked with but for the hourly rate they pay and the high demand they expect from you doesn't balance out and it can become dicouraging.
good,"If it only paid that way.   I worked for the company for less than a year and loved it.  The management is always under a lot of pressure for sales.  Hours are cut to the bone in the ""off season.""  My position was eliminated because there was not enough work.  I was released as rehireable.  Pay is below average.  But like I began, you work there because you love the customers and enjoy the lifestyle.  OK for a part time position where you are just looking to get a little extra spending money."
good,On most days customer service is the main objective. Freight days are very fast paced and a lot of fun. We good manager and a really good assistant both are very knowledge.
good,"While working with tractor supply, I've seen probably over 100 employees come and go in just over a year. Job security is there based on work load,  but this company doesn't hesitate to cut the weak links so to speak. Mandatory over time very often, Saturday's and Sunday's included at times. 10 hour work day maximum."
good,This was an overall good job except for not understanding and listening to employees.  Production needed to be looked at especially when most people were struggling
good,"Clicky, real bad, no fair advancement. no one with education can advance whena ll the rest have no college degree.  Only the uneducated could advance."
good,"helping customers, doing paperwork, setting SDI's, and merchandising is what you do every day.  Customers are picky and co-workers aren't always as motivated as you want them to be."
good,"My co-workers are amazing, but there aren't ever enough people there to get everything done. The worst part of the job is that we're not trained properly to handle what will be thrown at us, I wasn't taught how to process a return until I'd been at the register for a week, and there are still a lot of things no one has bothered to teach me. Overall it's really a very stressful job that's not for the faint of heart."
good,"I loved working at TSC, however their hours and schedule didn't coincide with my life's daily activities and work life. The management and the co-workers were awesome to be around and to work with on a daily basis. In my personal experience of being there and working there, there were a lot of good changes going on. I really didn't feel there were any hard parts of getting the job done, and my most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers, meeting new customers, also maintaining and mentoring a good relationship with repeat customers."
good,"A fast pace with many tasks to accomplish every day."
good,"Decent job of there is nothing else. Work hard, abscent co-workers. Schedule changes all the time. Regional manager is very unrealistic. Manager when I started was great. New manager was a dud. Did not like to work and left early all the time. Asm was a sweet heart and really kept the stove running. Glad for the experience but glad I am leaving."
good,Fast paced customer service focused on problem solving and helping people understand how a particular project can be completed.
good,"As a cashier, I learned great customer service and organizing skills. This being my first job, it really brought me out of my shell and taught me how to speak publicly."
good,Wasn't impressed with management at the time. But other then that it was a great place to work if you don't have kids. Fun co-workers and atmosphere minus management
good,Tractor Supply Company has great benefits but low pay for the workload that is expected. Customers are awesome and loyal to Tractor Supply. Tractor Supply does a great job at building there brand.
good,The District managers are not going to help this company succeed. Both I worked with were only interested in self advancement and prone to lying. The job itself was terrific. Hard to promote from within store. Very long hours. If District manager was not liar I would not have resigned
good,it is a great company to work for.  You can make friends and enjoy your opportunities to work with the customers
good,"•Manage all aspects of a retail establishment with 16 employees, generating yearly sales of 4.5 million dollars."
good,"After looking up what needed to be done around the store, we would take product off the shelve to set the shelves for the new layout. After the new mods where done for the month and when we finished what was planned for that day, we would stock the rest of the merchandise. Through all of this we would communicate to make sure we were where we needed to be on our task. The whole time helping customers, and dealing with issues as they arrived. The best part of the job was the work experience, with the fork lift and management training. The hardest part of the job was trying to prioritize with little management impute."
good,"We have grown into one big family. My manager is the best. He's not only a boss, he's a friend and easy to talk to. We always smile and make customers feel at home. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their storys. The hardest part of my job is stocking feed racks but I enjoy it most."
good,CoGos is okay to work for they have no benefits and the company is full of drama
good,"On a typical day at tractor supply was a day that you would want to try a regret, management at all three store that i worked at were not the best, i didn't learn that if i wanted something done or need to know something to call some over the management or ask a team member that has been there longer."
good,"Typical day would be stocking floor with all the different types of animal food, assisting customers, stocking shelves , load outs, organizing warehouse, operating forklift, cleaning store management was good "
good,"Typically my day starts at 6:00 AM, where I make contact with previous shift supervisor, run reports, check emails and plan out the days work load.  Start up meeting with team members to cover previous days production numbers, safety and the expectations and job assignments for the day.  The rest of the day is following up with team members, checking emails, updating upper management, completing safety observations, team member observations and contacting corporate and carriers for updates on oppurtunities or solutions."
good,"Was able to create a great atmosphere up front among the cashiers, creating a little competition amongst ourselves to help boost store sales and accuracy. The hardest part was at check out time getting all the paperwork done for myself and cashiers, straighten the front, and be out on time with a short staff. We seemed to always be short staffed."
good,helping people find what they need. fill all the feed with co workers. make sure all the products have signs showing their price. making sure all daily tasks are completed.
good,I worked here this summer before college and it was a pretty basic job. Not too difficult. I made some goot relationships and it helped me learn new things
good,"At Tractor Supply the supplies were not are stored in logical  storage so it made it was confusion was the customer."
good,Just a very unorganized company to work for. Management is all over the place. They have rules and guidelines but only follow them if it pleases them.
good,The store manager is very unprofessional and will lie to you in a heartbeat. And some team members are lazy. There are a few who actually get the job done. Great company and place to work but management is horrible.
good,I love a fast paced environment while multitasking. Being able to help customers and make sure they have the items needed to finish their project. Helping new employees to learn the policy and procedures of our daily tasks.
good,Learned operations of a forklift and some other equipment. Friendly staff that make you feel included. We had a lot of fun while working together. Good location and flexible hours.
good,I was fresh out of high school I liked it because I was young making some good money. But I didn’t last too long because they didn’t have A/C & I was a picker and I was sweating too much
good,"The work there is fine, just the way my co workers treat me, my hours are cut constantly and my pay is always going down when I have bills to pay. I am currently thinking of quitting."
good,It was a ok work experience. The hours and the work are not worth the pay. Was thankful for the job at the time and I worked it until I found better or something that worked better for me.
good,Not a big fan of the the company. Not the greatest I would not suggest the place to work if anyone wants to make a living they won't do it there good parto time never do full time.
good,I helped open the Tractor Supply in Sparks NV.  It was a fun upbeat place to work.  While I was there I learned a lot about setting up a store from an empty building to a thriving business
good,Nice place to work if you are in school or just need something to do.  Pay is not that great as an associate or team lead.  Staff and store manager was nice to work with at this location.
good,I loved working there just couldn't get enough hours. So i asked for more hours and i wasn't able to get them. So i decided to finf something else with more hours.
good,"Not what I expected, making it work for the time being, Looking for something more suitable for myself. Need something that will provide for my needs and expenses."
good,"I really do enjoy working for this company, but see no way to advance. It would be a great job for someone just starting off. The hours are very spiratic. I think they should pay more for what is expected of you."
good,The company needs to work on how a store operates and giving the stores more payroll or just stop cutting it. As a team lead I was in charge of the store when my manager would leave the the day as my shift started. I had to help customers while cleaning and completing my daily tasks with just one other employee in the whole store and they worked the register.
good,"No help, i felt like i was spinning my wheels working at the Hobbs store. I liked working at the TX store better"
good,Good place to work. Needs more work with their management and the overall running of a store. Needs better flow and procedures on how to take care of problems
good,Tractor supply is a good company but the management is not the greatest I'm looking for a job that is good with management I'm also looking for a place that has good benefits also!
good,"Hard work, moving 50lb bags all day. I hurt my back so if you do decide to work here please lift with your legs as it is very easy to hurt yourself as you are just labor to them"
good,"Tractor Supply Company is a good company to work for as far as retail goes. All retail generally requires some level of commitment to working on Saturdays, Sundays and some holidays."
good,A typical day at work I would mostly have been working on the register. I learned how to work with a cash register and do returns for a big company. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the nice costumers.
good,"Good starter job for younger kids."
good,The training was inconsistent and not enough coworkers to assist you when needed. Pay was low and hours changed and overtime was never offered.  The manager was amazing but coworkers often took off and left a new employee alone.
good,"Fast paced, think on your feet, ask questions to get the sale while providing great customer service. Teamwork is essential so teaching, coaching and learning to be the best is what I strive to excel at."
good,Tractor supply is not a bad place to work but it can stress you out sometimes I love what I do there but I’m just looking for something different   I would recommend a young teenager to work there for a part-time job
good,"Good job environment, good pay, will train you if you need training, get paid on a debit card that is issued to you with your employee id.  Get paid every 2 weeks"
good,"wonderful job and customers great environment but spotty management"
good,"About the same as most indoor/outdoor retail jobs.  Not too bad with the balance of time worked, labor and home life.  Pretty easy to start but pretty hard to keep up with."
good,"Yes, the job is difficult. However, you are working with a great group of people, and you will learn a lot. Throwing feed is the hardest part, and helping customers is the most rewarding."
good,They just need to no some are not fast in some areas where they just want to throw there staff in there need to give there workers time to adjust so they can be fast.
good,It's far better than the restaurant/fast food industry. Stick with it eventually management will fall out and the 24 year old will be managing an entire store
good,"Very laid back for the pay"
good,"the discount is the only good benefit, wouldn't recommend for anyone other that those seeking extra money or if your looking for work while in school,"
good,I have worked for Tractor Supply for almost a year. The Mananger there picked favorts and ruined the Country Mile Logo.Was a very hard worker and could do circles around some of the people employed there....
good,"This company tries to set itself apart in customer service, but is slowly closing the trap door on itself by extending store hours but cutting payroll, saying you should only have so many people per day or shift even when the store is huge. That said I really enjoy the job and the types of people I get to help...just wish the company itself would open its parameters a bit so we don’t constantly feel like we are on the verge of failing."
good,"If the manager was doing her job and following the rules and requirements of the job, and not training the employees the right way just have the employees doing the basic to get by"
good,Overall good company. But there isn’t competitive pay. There are many other places that’ll pay more per hour to be competitive. Tractor supply company outside of pay is flexible with hours and great management
good,"The job was fun, fast paced at times, great customers and co workers but management at the time cut hours so much i was working 3-4 hours a day 3 times a week, of which i was forced to look elsewhere for employment as i was making little to nothing considering travel costs. During my rehire in 2017 I was told by the store manager that I would be getting more than 20 hours per week, but when i brought it up when my hours dropped I asked for a reason and if I could get more, but was then told "" nothing was written and you're hired as part time, which means I could give you anything from 0-19 hours if i wanted to"". Shortly after this conversation I received a job offer elsewhere."
good,back before the new store manager arrived working for tractor supply was excellent. since the management turnover all of the previous employees quit and they cant keep employees.
good,A typical day at work started as seeing you assignments. They would be different everyday very fair when rotation but some assignments were pretty bad. For the last hour of work it would be very slow and it would drag.
good,"I did enjoy working at tractor until they started to treat all of their employees like they were all in high school.They started getting on everyone about not scanning anything for five minutes before the break bells to the people who were known for working the hardest. They never tried to correct the employees who needed to be, but instead went after the ones who worked."
good,"Gave you paid time off, made enough money to start A life with, staff was friendly, had A great work motto. Was flexible if you was sick during the day."
good,This job would be good for you if you have a good farm type experience. As for me I knew just about nothing about this job so it was very difficult for me.
good,"Alot of work, as a team member your pretty much the head of everything, you do all the work and everyone else tells you what to do for the most part. Freight comes in and out and your expected to do unrealistic amounts in a day. such as 9 Pallets of feed unloaded and stocked in the shelves by closing with doing your closing duties. even in a 5 hour shift."
good,fun job. enjoyed the people i worked with. worked my way up from part time to full time and worked up form cashier to warehouse in just a few short months
good,Just follow the company rules. And be on time at all times. Learn much as possible.  Be very productive. Working hard always get your recognize for going above and beyond.
good,"Typical small retail environment. One member of the management team and one team member for most of their shift. Nothing to arduous, or stressful, but okay."
good,Great place to work with farm experience.  without it you will struggle.  over all enjoyable job. pay was fair and customers were awesome.  there was a decent structure to the place
good,"Upper management doesn't support the team. Be an example of the mission and values all the time, not just when corporate is coming  have the same standards for all the stores,"
good,"Although I loved the company itself, at the time I was there the manager was, to say the least, horrid.  They have since changed managers and I would have no problem going back to work for them."
good,"This is a great place to work if you need a job. I loved everyone I worked with, including my managers. But unfortunately I was able to witness the overlooking of employee dedication of my peers by corporate TSC. Putting in the ""extra"" effort will not always get you noticed or appreciated regardless of the years under your belt."
good,"Not much hours, manager is terrible with communication,however, not good with allowing vacation time. Schedule is (for me anyway) only two days a week, another week five days. I will be looking for a new job."
good,Great place to work if management would take steps to correct scheduling problems.  Lack of strong leadership and no direction on how to fix issues within.
good,Good company to work for. Good compensation. Stabile growing company. Good benefits. Turnover is really high. You are expected to work and meet expectations.
good,There are not enough hours for the part time employees  they keep hiring more and more people the employees are nice and helpful but the management really isn’t that good
good,"Overall, my experience with TSC has been negative because instead of feeling like a valued individual, I feel like I am treated as just another cog in the machine. Part-time workers aren't given enough hours to make a living wage and are not given opportunities to get more hours or advance in their careers unless they've been there for years."
good,Tractor supply was not the place for me I really couldn't do the overnight poor management supervisor was harrsing us and was very rude and wasent respectful
good,"overall a good place to work, just drama fell into employee relations. I learned all of my management skills from working with this company. The work isn't overbearing, and it is flexible."
good,The way the store is ran could be a little bit better. There is a lot of favoritism in the store. Certain members take up to almost a whole month off when others can't even get one day off.
good,"Competitive, coworkers were not good team members, manager were understanding, lunches were always mandatory, assistant mangers were not good at explaining a job that needed to be done."
good,"Okay job, with great pay and benefits. co workers easy to get along with and very helpful. management top notch with a killer break room."
good,"For the amount of work that is required,  the pay is not enough,  mandatory overtime should not be needed . Better benefits , pay and work life elsewhere"
good,"Its an okay place to work at. Pay is really competitive for the area and there are shift differentials to make working the night shifts more appealing. They offer 4 different shifts, two 10 Hour shifts, Monday - Thursday 6:30am-4:30 pm and 8p-6a and then two twelve hour shifts, Fri-Sun 6p-6a and 6a-6p. They offer a lot of overtime as well for people who seek out those opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work would me working a 5 hour shift checking people out, help doing load outs, answer the phone, and direct customers to the product their looking for. I have learned more on inventory and stocking, which was hard at first. The most enjoyable part was greeting to know the customers and help them with what they needed."
good,I really liked when I worked there brand new facility and I got a chance to train a lot of the new employees when they got out of oreitation we had mandatory meetings every day and a all employee meeting on Wednesday great place to work
good,"1. You learn how farm products work."
good,Loved working with the customers and handling the job itself.  Management tended to not have a lot of leadership experience and didn't handle anything diplomatically.
good,My store in Troy wasn’t bad to work for. The company itself is. Corporate treats their employees like dirt. You don’t get paid for what your worth and barely get raises.
good,If you like working with people or flexible schedules then go for it. But if your looking for a company that shows they care about their employees or what their customers actually want or if you're looking for competitive wages go elsewhere. The best experience I have had was the smiling customers and being able to get a specific day off when I needed it
good,Loved working there but is was run by poor management lack of respect from the management but other then that loved the work environment and the customer
good,"I had many responsibilities as a normal team member; anything from cleaning bathrooms, to running the cash registers. But, even with many duties, it was kind of boring."
good,This is an OK place to work. And supervisors  have certain people who can go and do what they want. But all in all good place to work if needing a job.
good,"Good place to work. Enjoyable atmosphere, good people to work with.  The pay was too low. More good days than bad. Most customers were delightful. Learned a lot there."
good,They move so many managers around and nobody gets trained properly. You are expected to know everything by your second week. They will hire anybody right off the street.
good,tractor was a fun place to work managers were allowed to run the business. aside from the heavy hauling by hand .. a good place for a career .   Tractor treated all employees fair and the corp. office knows the business
good,Was good at first loved everyone then it just went down hill from there.... the store is a great place to work at its the management that makes this job hard and stressful. I love tractor supply and the coworkers. its just not for me anymore.
good,Great environment with nice break room.Pay is fair. benefits could be better.  Some tasks are labor intense. You have plenty of responsibilities. There is always something changing in the store center court. They are willing to teach and educate there employees.They and  a mission and values plus ethics that is really a big part of the company.
good,"Your standard retail environment.  Pay is middling at best.  You only start to make real money when you are at the store manager level via bonuses, monthly and annually.  It is hard work, lots of moving pallets of feed by pallet jack and stacking literal tons of it by hand.  Your customer base is rather antagonistic, more so than at other retail establishments."
good,Good pay overtime is mandated and is every week had to get used to doing my job and the shift before me job as well for a 1 person pay even if you brought this to the attention of a supervisor nothing was ever done
good,"The company overall is a great place to work for the area. The human resource department lacks any empathy when  it comes to helping any team member with any issue.  The culture and values for the company is great, but the management team from within has a great deal of things to work on when its comes to making the building successful from a overall business stand point."
good,It’s a fun place to work. You get a lot of different types of customers that come in from all types of backgrounds. One customer may need dog food and the next may need oil for their tractor so each day is different based on the customers that come in that day.
good,It is a fun place to work. and the only thing i wished was the pay was just a little better and the bosses were changed. If it was not for that then it would be a god place to work
good,"It’s a fun environment, sometimes can be busy. You learn about animals and farm equipment but the pay wasn’t that great and the hours weren’t that great for what I was needing."
good,"Typically answering the phones, assisting customers, and trying to keep the store organized. Having to deal with distributions messy ship ins are the hardest part, it doesn't typically make sense, as well as having to hang up hundreds of signs every single week for them to only be up for like 4 days."
good,I was a clothing specialist and a cashier it was basic starter position with little room for growth.  The leadership did not promote growing within and made it hard to advance.
good,"It would have been a great place to work, but I could not deal with the constant drama of some of the Co workers. I loved the job itself, however, the way they mistreated a co worker of mine at the time that's disabled is what made me leave."
good,Company doesn't pay well and expects a lot. The turn over was tremendous. I was assistant manager and expected to do all the work of the manager. We were always short staffed and never got our work caught up.
good,It was a nice place to work. It was close to my house. the people I worked with was nice.Over all it was a good experiance for me to work for Tractor Supply.
good,A typical day at work is running register and front facing the shelves. I have learned how to use people skills to increase sales. The hardest part of the job is definitely having to deal with hard customers.
good,"Working at TSC was a fun high school job, i spent my hours on the clock as a cashier and helping customers as needed. "
good,"Nice employees"
good,Not enough Hourly help. Customer service spent a lot of time helping and reviewing products in the store. Other responsibility took a back seat. Lot of meal violations.
good,"nothing was set in stone "
good,I learned a lot from customers and products that the company sold as well as was given the opportunity to be an integral part or the community in which I lived
good,"Tractor Supply is a good company to work for, there is room to improve and advance within the company. There are lots of friendly people and co-workers."
good,very fun place to work. always changing for the seasons and getting customers involved with different activities. always helping customers with the animals and continue to listen.
good,i loved working with the customers because they were pretty regular there. we knew each other by first name bases and would always ask about each others families on how they were doing and things.
good,It was an okay place to work. One of the stores I worked in was better than the other one. The second store that  I worked at used me and then would yell at me for someone else not doing their job.
good,"overall it is a good place to work, but the hours are not the same, and hours get, Wintertime hours increase due to the holiday, but once summer hits the hours are cut, you can get anywhere from 8-20 hours a week"
good,"As one the key carriers, my responsibilities include: manager over rides, counting down registers each night, price changes, printing new price signs, setting signs for ads, ordering feed, and resetting new displays."
good,"Relaxed job, slow work , mostly easy, decent pay for what it is. Hours are just not enough. No money because they only have you work a few times a week"
good,"Loved the job and most of my customers... Retail is a tough industry. Management was very poor. I learned a great deal about merchandising, customer service, inventory control and managing my time as well as my team. I did not enjoy the long hours, being on my feet 100%, working in the cold weather and working nights & weekends."
good,if like doing a hard job every day and break your back for low pay tractor supply is the place for you nothing gets done without you getting in trouble
good,"I was with Tractor Supply for 8 and a half years. They aren't a bad company, but they aren't a great company. They don't really care about their employees"
good,"its a good place to work, very busy, fast place, you work as a team, great coworkers willing to help you they are like family, the mangers are always there for you."
good,"They always tell you to give a 100%; if , you want yo get hired on. The temp agency  Spherion is so full if BS!!!!!!!!!!,They'll Lie Right to your Face!!!!!"
good,The job was ok people were nice for the most part other times people weren't so nice or caring the manager doesn't care about employees health and health problems
good,"I was team member for tractor supply company for two years, I worked for 2 years and saw little pay change nor abilities for advancement, there wasn't enough employees per customer demand. it was a good experience but could have been more"
good,Job pays very well. days are just long. weather outside is how it feels inside. Work is not hard but you must keep up with your production do that and come to work when you scheduled and come on time and job will be easy.
good,It wasn't a bad place to work but the management was like a revolving door. I had 4 managers in a year and went through at least 2 dozen team members.
good,"Working at Tractor Supply is fast paced and exciting. You never know what kind of customers will be coming through the doors and what they might need help with while shopping or looking for tools to fix their farm, equipment, or anything in between."
good,"The work is not bad but their labor budget includes the store manager salary which cuts the hourly employees hours. Not a decent, productive labor budget with this company"
good,"The Derby TSC store is really a great place to work with a wonderful staff. It's to bad that corporate doesn't recognize if they paid better and had PTO and other decent benefits, they might actually make sales plan."
good,Management was fantastic. Best manager I ever had. I really liked my job. Everybody got along great. Really stayed busy all the time. Worked a lot of over time.
good,"Tractor supply is a great place to work pay is low, if they would pay better they would have more employees to stay and work. I lvoed working there i was just Underpaid for the job that had to be done."
good,this job is basic. good for a teenager. not so good for some one paying rent on their own. I'm sure if you stuck it out you could make a  living. I had fun working here.
good,It was fast paced had its ups and downs with the management but overall was a good place to work. You could for sure get a good exercise in when packing 50 pound bags of animal feed
good,"Have seen numerous members of management come and go.  As well as the team members that come in.  The work is not hard, the rates are reasonable, but there are things that need to change."
good,This job was ok. They were hard to work around your schedule. But it was still a good setting to work In. I had opportunitys here to work with customers.
good,I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply Company it was a very good job. If I could work at another one I would. When I worked there the staff were all good people who cared about the people.
good,"helped customers"
good,fun work environment get to be outside and do work not to busy so you have a lot of free time to learn other things and take your time where a lot places try to just rush through training
good,"Crazy, but I like my job because I am a workaholic. And there is never a spare moment at TSC. Customers are really very nice but TSC is chronically understaffed"
good,the work is easy stocking shelves helping customers and cleaning the floors is all to the work one of upsides is the people you work with and the people and there pets you meet
good,Goals of any position could possibly be met but not with staff levels as they were maintained.  Filled multiple roles in attempting to assist customers with their needs which did not allow for meeting daily goals.  There was a large turnover due to unrealistic demands.
good,days are always something new. never a dull moment. hard work but not a hard job. customers always make the day go by fast. You will learn a lot just by helping customers.
good,Tractor supply was ok. The pay was average. They have a rodent problem as they have dog food and other food so there are a lot of rats in the aisles. The hours are average.
good,Very laid back place to work everyone was friendly you grow a custom to the everyday people they make an effort to remember your name almost a homey feeling!!
good,I really enjoyed working for tsc but they slow way down in the winter time and they favor 1st shift a lot so the other two shifts get the shaft. upper management plays favorites with a lot of there employees
good,"While the hours and job is geared towrdtowards younger employees, I still likes working here. It was a better atmosphere than most customer service based jobs."
good,"Are you a redneck with no experience working whatsoever? Come to Tractor Supply where even management thinks their sister is hot! In all seriousness, this is the place where rednecks would get along great."
good,It waa a terrible place to be nobody knew there job the  managers did not communicate well at all you could never find anything that you needed I would never work there again
good,"Our managers weren't always the nicest people, we had to do so much manual labor. I enjoyed my co workers and the people i worked with but no so much the ones i worked for!"
good,It's not the worst place I've worked and based on what your manager is like can be a good place to work. I would work there again given the opportunity.
good,"Tractor Supply is a retail chain they want you to do the most do your very best to make them as much money as possible, but they only want to give you fifty cents over minimum wage."
good,Not loyal to employees. Bonus and benefit package was good. Upper management needs to listen more to employees needs and get back to customer needs and service.
good,A typical day is basically just coming prepping my RC LIFT and getting my proper paperwork in order to load my trucks to the proper stores etc... and my most enjoyable part of my job is I get drive around all day on my power equipment which I enjoy
good,Requires lots of common sense and lifting but a good place to work. Flexible with a schedule. Happy environment. Co workers will make or break this gig. Team work is mandatory for a good store to grow.
good,"Tractor Supply is much like any other retail location. Each store employs 12 to 20 people, mostly part time. Most employees enjoy working there if they enjoy helping people."
good,Get to do a lot of things stock shelves set up display cleaning the manger was a nice person work plce clean and organized the hardest part was trying to put some things together
good,"Fun place to work, get to know your clientele and connect with them. Building a relationship with customers and helping them in what they want and need. I am self taught and I research what I need to know. The most enjoyable is the job itself and the possible opportunities that could provide advancement within the company."
good,Tractor supply was one of the better jobs that I had.  They are big on safety and do a lot to show their appreciation for workers being productive but safe
good,Love working there we have a lot of fun and the atmosphere is relaxed and productive at the same time. Everyone works together and covers for each other.
good,"This was a great company to work for. good money, benefits but the reason I left was the lack of help they allowed a store when all you ask is for one person to be on the floor and they deny you"
good,Tractor supply bases it self on good vaules that well run a company.They also strive to try to keep their employees to stay very productive. It is really all on you to work.
good,"There are really no hard parts about this job, really fun place to work. Management is okay, everyday typically is cool. Pay is cool when you are actually getting hours."
good,"When I worked here I did alot for this company and never got a raise,"
good,It was a fun productive fast paced work environment. You were always moving and people were always willing to stop and provide help when it was needed.
good,I love physical work so that was a great place for me to work. I learned more about different anomalies and tge food they need and different medicines and Foods
good,"helped customers, stock shelves, change prices, greet customers, assist customers, placed new items on the shelves and put out the sale signs."
good,"can cashier, or throw feed bags around for 4 hours straight."
good,a decent beginners job. I learned how to handle customers of all kinds and how to handle cash. I loved all of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having great co-workers which always made shifts fun
good,They teach you one area and if you excel at it they wont move you around to learn more areas. Its all about numbers and favoritism.
good,"Had a lot of lazy workers and people continuously quit and/or just didn't show up for work and it was excused all the time. The people who did work hard were left with the grief. Felt very unappreciated and as a female working in a place where I had to lift things 50+ lbs., a lot of the men didn't care to help. A lot of customer complaints because of the carelessness."
good,"This place was ok to work for. The manager had favorites. The pay wasent that good. THe people that worked there were childish."
good,Great co workers and customers with pleasant environment and great learning and advancement opportunities.
good,The company has grown in the passed ten years. There are many team members celebrating milestone anniversaries. Many training courses are offered and opportunities arise.
good,This is a good company but very demanding. Some work as team and some do not. This add a lot of pressure on the team member/. Learned a lot about team work and process logic changes to production. Work flow application updates in a billion dollar company.
good,"The work to pay ratio at this job is severely unbalanced in favor of work. Unless you work at the registers or are a manager, the amount of physically demanding, strenuous work is high. There will be customer orders that are too heavy for one or two people to handle, however the workers here are required to complete the loadout regardless. The team members could go from several of these large orders and turn around to have to stock several 7 foot high pallets of feed, most bags ranging from 40-60 pounds. There is only one allowed break per day for lunch. Otherwise if a break is needed, it is best just to slip off to the restroom. "
good,"Gaining more knowledge of what the store sells and the different departments.  Always something to learn."
good,The employees were very helpful when customers needed it. It was a great environment. Everyone got along and was very supportive and helpful
good,"Typically all employees, aside from the managers, are part-time employees.  This creates a bitter-sweet work environment in which if you are a high-school student looking for a part-time job you are great and will enjoy your hours.  However for a full-time position without the responsibilities of the management position would be hard to find."
good,"Started as floor sales and customer service. Moved up to warehouse manager. I was 3rd in charge behind store manager and assistant manager. Had full clearance to all job functions. Keys to store, alarm codes, the ability to open / close and run all day to day operations."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the people were nice and fun loving. i felt more a friend than an employee. I had an excalant time here wish i would have stayed."
good,Assisted maintain the front of the store. Worked in customer service.  Signed customers up for financing with the purchase of large or multiple items. Held accountable for fifty percent of nightly closing of the cash drawers and the store.
good,"Great way to get personal with your customers and lots of things to learn.  This job is a retail job, so random hours and cut back of hours are to be expected depending on the store's sales."
good,"Work understaffed most of the time, expected to do work of 2 or 3 people.  Co workers are good people and so is management just hard to have work and home balance when you work 8-10 hours a day.  the hardest part is having 2 boys working opposite of your shift and unable to do heavy like 200 lbs. lifting  and the best part are the benefits are better than my husbands who works for a big box store."
good,"A lot of heavy lifting, bending, and stretching. Its not a hard job, but alot of lifting when picking store orders. Long hours needed overtime from employees often."
good,It's retail. You don't have many options for advancement and you work most holidays. Benefits are pretty good and you meet interesting people.
good,learning new stuff about products you didn't know about meeting new people everyday helping your co-workers and customers when they needed it and having the weekends of to be with my wife.
good,I loved the customers that came into Tractor Supply.  I loved helping them and getting to know them on the personal level.
good,Tractor Supply is a great company that has found a niche with small town farmers and up and coming farmers.  They are small but have a very wide variety of products and base knowledge to help each and every customer.
good,The day to day responsibilities or tasks usually altered to keep things entertaining but staffing is usually an issue to keep everything productive.  There are a lot of tasks that are on a tight deadline that are not obtainable during a busy day with customers.  The people will both make and break that job.
good,Its a great learning experience here someone can gain certifications on heavy machinery. Its very warm during the summer and very cold during the winter. The management are somewhat helpful and the operations manager as well as the human resources will take suggestions into considerations
good,There is no clear leadership with in the store.  I am not a manager and yet I do more managing than 4 other managers. Very often I find myself leading the team to accomplish tasks and helping customers that my fellow employees turned away.  As the Shipping and Receiving Manager there my job is primarily to work from the back but because of the lack of leadership that is not possible.
good,"Tractor Supply was a very demanding, time managing job.  The overall environment was stressful.  You had to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time.  The co workers were helpful and good to work with."
good,"The management could be better with scheduling and treatment of employees. "
good,I learned a lot about the products they carry and gained knowledge on farm living.  Also loved around Easter time they had baby chicks and ducks.
good,warehouse work. co-workers are great. lot of overtime.management very difficult at times. very stressful. healthcare is good
good,"Fun place to work, management was nice. Pay was average for a warehouse job. Co-workers were good people. I enjoyed working for certain supervisors."
good,They only hire full for there team leads so management no full time no benefits no sick days no vacations and no health insurance and they don't pay enough for the type high level of costumer service they expect you to give
good,"management team or divided and are judgmental, the hardest part about the job is not being stero type vs being judge by work performance, I enjoyed my fellow team members and supervisor I worked with ... a typical day clock in by 7 am load the bad wood on a bad wood trail start on my first truck by 7:50 no later than 8 am and grind til 3 pm working on my craft and becoming a leader for my fellow co workers in my department..."
good,"In the early days of TSC it was a joy to go to work. As they grew larger and larger the fun factor was gone and the joy to work with customer and ""Do whatever it takes"" has been replaced with what have you done for me lately."
good,TSC was a fast-pased learning environment which refined the skills you had and developed the ones you did not yet possess.  This was very valuable experience for my career.
good,This particular location has little to no training you just get thrown to the wolves.  Severely short handed and no hiring being done.
good,I don't feel I am fully able to rate this business because of the fact that I didn't work there long enough to form a major opinions. While I was there I enjoyed working and my co-workers.
good,"worked with some very good people there, only partime due to income limits. great place for a young person or middle age to start a career. can go to management positions in very short time for very high pay. good work atmosphere."
good,"its an ok job, the management is not that great and the pay is ok"
good,"Typical day consists of opening the store, price changes, assigning jobs for the days team members, stocking and rotating product, helping customers (orders, loading, sales, returns, research for the right products etc.), going to the bank, receiving Purchase Orders, cleaning, etc."
good,"Hard work is not rewarded fairly.  But, I do enjoy working 1st shift.  I always give 100% everyday."
good,"Things varied from day to day, as one would expect in retail.  The problem being one didn't have the baking of upper management and the future of ones job, and upward movement was not what was stressed in the company values.  I have more experience then others that were hired behind me, yet in all reviews I was given good marks, both officially, and unofficially, and was past up for promotion several times."
good,Great place to learn and work. Great Environment and customers.
good,I was a cashier and it was always a different experience every day that I came to work.
good,"On a good day I am able to give good information, learn something new and be proud of what I accomplish during my shift."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Current manager in Odessa Store on HWY 191, has no managment skills. He is awful to his employees. I worked for this man for a year and couldnt take it anymore. The company itself is awesome and is a company you can grow in. There are several different things in the store that you can do though."
good,Good stable job in tough economic times. Great manager training.
good,TSC is a great place to work with a set schedule. As my first retail job I have gained a great deal of knowledge on things that I otherwise would have known nothing about.
good,"Picture working at Home Depot, Walmart, or any other type of retail store.  Theres a corporate set of rules, regulations and way of life to follow.  Employees are basically robots. "
good,"I have only worked at Tractor Supply as a ROP Student, and it wasnt easy. It was probably because, it was my first time on a sales floor, as the associate, but I learned a great deal, about customer service, inventory and freight."
good,"Stock and sell farming supplies, implements and tools. Responsible for facility maintenance and equipment maintenance and repair."
good,cashier with a personality. really enjoyed working with the type of customers that rely on Tractor Supply for quality products.
good,Working directly with customers andstocking shelves as well as working a cash register.
good,"I learned more about computors how to conduct myself around people. More addvancement in talking and dealing with buyers, vendors and team mates."
good,I learned how to train managers and co-workers. I grew up caring for various types of animals and enjoyed sharing my knowledge with customers looking to find the correct product for their pet.
good,worked here while in college at UTM and it got me through a smester till time to come home. great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my job thoroughly but was not challenged enough day to day. The customers and employees were both very loyal and made the day go by quicker with their smiling faces and every now and then an encouraging word. The people that I worked under not only directed but worked along side all the other regular employees. Because I could not go full time, there was no where I could go with this job."
good,While I enjoyed working with the public and believe that I was able to help most of them with their needs the demands of the job were very physical including loading multiple fifty pound bags of animal feed into customers' cars and stocking heavy items on shelves.
good,I do like the job but there was little to no training. Still dont know how to do special orders. The pay is NOT good!! The hours are LONG!! Benefits are great if you can get on full time. But theres nothing else out there right now.
good,You can learn a lot working at a feed store like Tractor supply
good,Over all I found it to be a great job management could be better prepared.Sometimes they leave the employees guessing what to do next. But overall I liked the job keeps you busy.
good,"Full of drama, the assistant manager was slimy, always doing sketchy stuff. wasn't treated fairly as  most shifts I was in charge of were lower staffed. but the pay and monthly bonuses were awesome"
good,If you work in any department but the Customer Solutions Center. The benefits are great but the morale is terrible. The department is cliquey and feels like high school. They tell you in the interview they promote within but it is incredibly difficult to get out of the department. I know people in other departments and they are treated with more respect.
good,"Tractor Supply bases their company on GURA values. "
good,"Simply put, it was a job. I don't believe that it paid well enough for the amount of work employees engaged in. On a positive note, fellow employees made the job tolerable."
good,"steady paycheck, some good customers, a fantastic district manager, broken store leadership, poor employee work ethic, lots of underlying conflict, lots of gossip."
good,tsc is a good company to work for. They help you learn and grow. It is a bit hectic at times in emergencies such as a hurricane before and after. pest control was the hardest problem to handle. its no under control. its a farm store it happens to the best of them im sure.
good,Tractor Supply is a good company.  They are solid and growing so job security is high. Expectations are extremely high and it is very difficult to maintain store standards due to  payroll limitations in a growing location. District Manager did not have clear understanding of workload as he never worked as a store manager for the company.
good,"My time was not utilized properly , not enough employees to do the work. Need more money and hours. My manager was very good. We were just short staffed."
good,There wasn't much of a hard-working essence there. I felt as if I would work by myself more than I had others working with me. I was recognized by the Regional manager on multiple occasions due to my hard work and improvement of sales. I felt appreciated there but it wasn't my favorite place to be.
good,"If it were not for the strict regulations on employee hours and pay I think I would stay and try to advance my career with this company. But the pay is not great and even the management pay is not great."
good,It’s okay job just not being paid enough for the amount of work that I have to do on a daily basis and the team members are okay but the management is not too organized and everyone does a half way job
good,Good company with a strong history in the farming industry. Over all training is good with standardized SOPs to ensure consistency which is good for constant shift work.
good,"Can be very strenuous, hard work for minimum pay. They only do annual raises and from what I understand it will only be a few cents which honestly isn't worth all the hard work unless you plan on going into management."
good,"I started with little knowledge of the company. I really enjoyed my work environment in the beginning. But as of late, management isn't the best. It's hard working with management that came from outside and doesn't really know the culture of TSC. Overall the work is not hard and it's quite enjoyable."
good,"Had good manager and co workers, fun place to work. I would have liked to have more hours. I relocated to South Carolina to work in welding field. Recently certified though Midwest Tech Institute."
good,This is not a bad place to work if you have the right manager who will enforce everyone to do there jobs. They do have a lot of turn over due to low hourly rate considering what they expect of you.
good,"It's hard work, end of story. No central heat or air. You get two 20 minute breaks. I really don't know what to say other than work is work. If you want to get lots of hours, that's a place to go."
good,I would work more hours than a usual part timer which is perfectly fine but I didn't want to spend everyday there because my coworkers called in everyday.
good,"I was treated fairly and had a great time. It was only a temporary job, and worked well with my school schedule. Management was always making sure we understood what we were doing and how to do it."
good,This is a fast paced company not for those who aren't willing to chip I  and work your butt off. Management issues and lack of team moral are the biggest issues.
good,"Working for Tractor Supply was enjoyable, although the pay was not. The company intentionally makes sure that there are only 4 full time staff members so that they are not required to pay for benefits. While only keeping that few people at FT status, they constantly call asking for people to work and seem upset that you won't come in, or often can't come in. With that being said, the manager and the FT staff are not to blame for any of this. They are actually wonderful people who face the brunt of a tidal wave of corporate mess."
good,"Tractor supply was a fast pace job and hard work. I always went home tired from a hard days work."
good,Tractor Supply is a great company to work for and you'll love working there as long as you have a great team to work with. The environment is amazing and the customers are the best part about the job
good,I really like it at tractor supply it is just that I need more hours of working than i am not and it is not given to me. I get bored quick because there isn't really anything to do besides cash register.
good,Friendly employees but manager left during my first 2 weeks.  The store ran without a Store manager for 6 months but the Assistant manager was great.  She should have been promoted instead of the person they brought in.  He was not consistent in enforcing policies and wasn't there way too often.
good,"Since I worked at Tractor Supply for 4 years I unfortunately saw many people come and go. Towards the end of my career at TSC, the bones of their management team left to move on to other things. What replaced them, in my opinion, almost costed our store which is why I felt it was getting harder and harder to work there. One thing though that I loved about working at TSC is the relationships that you built, not only with your coworkers but also your customers. I had multiple customers that came in on a weekly basis and would talk to me for at least 15 minutes. It felt good to have that ""small town"" connection just by working at a store. It also made it easier for me to help and introduce myself to new customers."
good,Have to be physically fit enough  to handle 50lb sacks of feed all day long. Have to be able to deal with management and hope that you get a good manager that will pitch in and help.
good,"TSC is a very easy and fun place to work in, but lets just say Management pick their favorite workers, HR doesn't even help when is against management."
good,"While working there a typical day at work consisted of organizing the front, checking out cashiers, and keeping the clothes folded and organized. Nothing was learned."
good,"I provided the best customer service, collected money, counted inventory, opened and closed store, cleaned at the end of shift. Counted down drawer at the end of shift."
good,"I work at the Marianna Fl. branch and the manager is more worried about payroll than anything and is rude to employees. Lead one is a temp. and is rude to customers as well as employees.  Team lead 2 spends more time hanging out in the break room than anything. Assistant Manager is the bomb! He gets overwhelmed but gets the job done. Next week all the employees hours are so cut that everyone is talking about how they have put in applications at other places,freight guy already put in his 2 week notice. They are gonna lose ALL there employees because they aren't getting any hours. One person isn't on the schedule at all next week, one is a team lead is off 4 days in a row next week, one employee is only on the schedule one day...It would be a great place to work if we could get a paycheck!!!"
good,management wasn't very understanding of much and some employees where very hard to work with. Customers were okay as long as you had what they were looking for.
good,"Not enough job recognition from the mangers, treated like slaves. enjoyed working with other employers but we were always behind and doing things two or three times due to bad management."
good,TSC is a great customer service focused company. I have personally learned the importance of accountability and time management in my position of management.
good,"A typical day at Tractor Supply would be handling guest transactions, stocking merchandise, helping guest with their needs and wants, and much more. I always try to make the best out of each day, and do my best to create a positive work environment. The management at my job could use a little improvement, but that doesn't stop my co-workers or I from doing what we can to make the best of each day and to make the customers happy. The hardest part of each day is honestly not getting enough hours, I feel like I'm not being worked to my full capacity, but seeing someone leaving the store with a smile on their face because of me is honestly the best part about my job."
good,great place to work if you know the farm life. everyone is enjoyable and will to get along with and they will help with what you questions you ask
good,I would help customers throughout the day. Id answer any questions the customers would have and answer them to the best of my ability. I learned that the customer is always right even when sometimes they're wrong. The hardest part of my day is having to disappoint customers when something isn't in stock. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my customers happy and enjoying life like its their last.
good,Tractor supply was a workplace where it could be stressful at times and energetic at times. More could be done on the compensation package and management being more encouraging.
good,You show up to work get to doing whatever you need to do. You stop to help every customer find what there looking for. You learn a lot about the things in your store to better help customers. Hardest part of the job is prioritizing when you have a lot that needs to get done. If you can handle physical labor and be can nice to people its a good job. Only thing is you'll spend a lot of the day just trying to sell things to customers.
good,The company will not do exstensive back ground checks on employees before hiring. It is a real hands job if you become a manager your running a business that pulls between 5 to 6 million a week and your work force is stretched really then. All hands are on deck and you are never not moving and working Hours are long for assistants and pay is good for them because there hourly. GM are salary and work just as hard. You can always look forward to 18 hour days.
good,Hardest part of my job was dealing with so many interruptions that it was difficult to finish the tasks that I was expected to handle. Best part of job was getting good reviews from manager and learning new things. Enjoyed working with co-workers.
good,"Tractor Supply Company is a good company to work for. As with any company you work for, you can make it a good or bad experience."
good,"I work a lot with great customers, it's hard work, but can be rewarding with the people I get to meet. I receive in merchandise, and zero out items and defect out the damaged items in the store."
good,"TSC is very flexible with hours i would go to school in the morning from 9 to 4pm, and then head off to work where id be till 10pm most nights. They're several task to be completed daily so there is never any free time."
good,Very back bending hard working people in an hot environment to work.Must be very flexible and not have other things outside of work to keep you from not being able to work crazy hours. Must be willing to learn new things every day either about animals or clothing or tractor parts in the store. Must know how to multi-task and deal with anger customers when needed. The most part i enjoyed about the job was my customers and at the end of the day my hard working co workers and the hour lunch breaks.
good,"A typical day at work I am usually on the register. I complete price changes before opening the store. I answer the phone and assist with customers questions. Many times I am asked to help our receiver because I was the receiver for a year prior to becoming a full time student. "
good,Really fun place to work.  Lots of scenery changes lends the feeling of being swept up in the front stage of retail.
good,"get the numbers for the day and go to work get told what area to work in every day"
good,I loaded feed in people's cars or pickups. I quickly learned the business and became a leader. The hardest part of the job was restocking feed or dog food with what little help I had. There were older more knowledgeable people and then there were younger people who did most of the heavy lifting. I would have liked to see a little more team work within the company. The management was very good though and I liked my boss.
good,"Very laid back, Great customers. I got along very well with management. My co-workers were very nice and great people to talk to. Hardest Part was just remembering where all products in the store were, but it was a small store so it wasn't too difficult."
good,"Hard fast pace work."
good,"I worked a team associate. Stocked inventory, cashier, retail sales, specializing in horse and goat care. I really enjoyed working for TSC but could not afford to work p/t. I lived too far for too little hours."
good,As long as you did all your tasks for the day and kept the store clean and neat your job wasn't difficult and management wouldn't give you a hard time. You can learn a lot about farm products and care for animals along with customer service.The hardest part of the job is learning the small items in the store and where they are located and remembering what is on sale.
good,Great store and everyone is very nice. Items sometimes hard to know what to use them for.
good,It is good place to work it's laid back easy lots to do lots to learn it's down to earth it's fun it's challenging advancement is fair n easy to do ok
good,My fellow associates were very helpful with showing me how to properly and efficiently do my work. I learned quick and was able to move up to a supervisor if I had wanted the position.
good,Although most days I was doing some of the same things as always they do however will move you around upon request. The work wasn’t too hard but rather just a consistent work load.
good,Tractor Supply is an established company that is still feeling growing pains. Advancement is dependent upon a certain work history vs the skill set you have accertained pertanant to the job.
good,Was a pretty easy place to work. Job wasn't hard to understand and was easy to complete. Some days you may be pretty bored. Does require some heavy lifting
good,I really love the job wish I got paid more and got more hours. people are great to work with I’m always learning new things.its hot it’s cold it’s fun it’s hard
good,So i have to admit I truly loved my job. My store manager was great. We had a good team. We did what ever it took to get the job done. Being I enjoyed it I had some personal issues and had to relocate so i put in for a transfer. Well after 3 months waiting to hear a final word I was not given my job when there were 2 open positions. They didnt want to pay my current wages so they declined my job.
good,"Most times management  was easy to work for.  They worked with me when I had family emergancy's came up.  When some employees didn't do their jobs it fell on me to do their work and mine too.  It was hard for me to get breaks, but the people that smoked sure got theirs.  New hires wages were almost the same as mine even though I had been there for years."
good,"Nothing special about the company, good people to work with, hours aren't great, neither is the pay. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work there unless they have no other option and are just people persons"
good,This job was a good job for me to get through college as well as provide for my family. I got the opportunity to grow but it was very hard balancing life and work.
good,Really enjoyed my time at tractor supply started out as a order filler then moved to receiving really easy to move departments not the best pay around but pretty relaxed environment.
good,"My year and two months at tractor supply company were full of ups and downs. I liked it for the most part but near the end of my time there it was hectic, not enjoyable, and very stressful. The schedule for shifts was never consistent and made having a social life hard. And the pay was not great either for the amount of work and roles I had to do on a daily basis during my shift I think, and others would agree that the employees deserved more than $8 an hour, my raise after a year and a great annual review was only about 25 cents and that’s pathetic. You can push carts at Walmart for $12 an hour."
good,"Growing company,  with competitive pay and good benefits. The"
good,"tractor supply is a good place to work. they are flexable with work schedule. you will do training videos and be trained to run the forklift ."
good,"Working at tractor supply I learned a lot about time management. I was responsible for unloading all trucks, receiving all trucks, ups deliveries, keeping outside department clean, stocking freight, transfering product to and from other stores, and weekly reports."
good,Hard work stay busy start off p.i.p.program or you won't have a job anymore make rate and expect to pick up hevy things with no help team lift is good if you can find someone around to help
good,"my typical day consisted of stocking the different feed types that tractor supply sells and maintaining inventory. I learned how to do inventory electronically with ease and speed. The management at Tractor Supply was absolutely amazing, they were very helpful and patient as I learned my job and even after that they were always very pleasant and light hearted with me. The culture was a bit much for me due to the fact that its an over exaggerated country atmosphere, but I found my place and exceled while I was there. There wasn't really a hard part of the job for me but, my favorite part of the job was actually my sense of accomplishment at the end of every day"
good,Great place to work . no leadership or management done right though . Can't work without hearing drama about someone and people starting issues . just stay away from the BS and I'm sure you'll be fine
good,"needs improvement in team member incintives ,promotions with in management needs more training in people skills also company need to have more oportunities for employee growth"
good,"Not a lot of pay but as far as retail goes, this was a good job with opportunities for advancement if you could prove yourself. Good for all kinds of people."
good,Worked part time during college for a few years. Had a good time working there. Good company to start with. Management was good and pay was average. Flexible work schedule.
good,"Balance of work and personal life could be a challenge at times.  Team that was at the store is awesome, and very knowledgeable.  Overall a good experience"
good,It is very busy in certain stores and can make the day go by quick. The managers are very friendly and will work with you on any task that you don't know how to do.
good,"As a ""part-time"" receiver at TSC, I did like the people and store manager at the store, but was very unhappy with the store being unable to properly staff the store during the day. "
good,"TSC is a great place to work. I typically work 6 days a week , with a minimum of 52 hours per week."
good,Great work place! Long days but a great first job! Great environment. Learned retail. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,Didn't work with my time schedule. Felt as if my voice was never heard. Took advantage of my work ethic and made me do the things they didn't want to.
good,At first everything was good was getting bonuses and then  bonus started to stop they became more and more picky on certain issues which led to people being unhappy with their decision but that's just what they're about change change change
good,"typical day would be busy especially around pay day.  "
good,while the job of cashier has very low pay and hours. the job itself is simply to do tasks given while not attending customers. I enjoy the environment even though sometimes can be stressful. Other employees are always very fast to help.
good,Great company to work for. Great managers and associates and a great clientele basis. Working with fun people and great customers made it a family oriented atmosphere.
good,Was a good place to work until I realized that I wasn't getting compensated for all my hard work.  Employees who were doing very litter work were getting promotions when they weren't deserved.
good,They take care of their employees and always off many chances for advancment. As wells as good benefits and education assistance. Friendly environment and good attention to customer service.
good,Never a dull moment with lots of customers and stocking needing to be done.  Super nice co workers.  They were very patient when it came to training.  Lots to learn in video schools they have.
good,this place is a great place. It brings your networking skills to another level. this place gives you the basics to have great customer service.
good,"If you have never worked in a distribution center, you will learn a great deal and be trained in many different areas. The trainers are amazing and helpful, almost all employees there are wonderful and helpful. The work is repetitive and not horribly challenging - great for beginners. The most difficult part of the job is the lack of upward mobility within the company. Once you have learned all the areas within the building, there isn't much more room to grow. Outside of that, it is a great environment for new employees and has great benefits."
good,"When i first got hired, loved my job work very hard, then did end of the year inventory and lost everyone i enjoyed working with,  what came with that, was an offer to move up, accepted it, but allso came new members of management, the store manager work very very hard and i was right there beside her working just as if not harder.  the other mangers who should have never been promoted,  slacked off and were never held accountable for there actions , cause they were close friends with the store manger.   I almost never got any credit for the hard work i put in, it was rather what i didn't do. other than that i loved the company and everyone i worked with.."
good,"I really liked working here, going to work everyday. However I got sick and was forced by the company to take a Medical Leave. After a little bit, the doctor released me back to work and was very excited to return. I was informed later from HR that the store was full and there was no longer a place for me at the Weatherford Store. They are in process of finding another store with room to place me as I am employed there, however breaks trust with company. No job security."
good,The company is growing at a very fast rate and needs managers all the time.  Compensation is fair provided that you can keep turnover at your store to a minimum.  At almost minimum wage for most of the staff turnover will happen and happen often.  The manager must fill the shifts when no other staff is available.  The nature of the products sold can make for a very physical day and this is not for anyone who wants to sit in an office and work on paperwork.
good,"Enjoyable work environment."
good,"I ran the cash register, feed lot, side lots, carried out all load outs, managed welding supplies, and much more."
good,Part time job. Great place to work if you need a little extra cash.
good,"Tractor supply is a good company to work for, a typical work day is not to vigorus but can be physically straining on the body. I have the opportunity to learn more and more about everyday items that anyone can be able to use. Although I myself enjoy the work it is hard to get things done when no one has the same mind set and is very lazy which leads to being over worked. No part of the job is too hard when you enjoy and take pride in whatever it is you may do."
good,"Hours approx. 72 a week, to many hours. No life. All payroll, schedules, unloading all trucks, training, weekly and monthly reports."
good,"From the time we start, the day is dynamic and challenging. I push the store to make plans while maintaining store standards. I have developed a team that can go the extra yard in this ever changing atmosphere. It is very rewarding to see the team succeed and ""push"" to the max of their abilities."
good,"TSC is a company that prides itself on a culture of doing the right thing by the customer. Each team member if empowered to make it right for the customer. Its a highly ethical, plain speaking organization that is customer focused."
good,"The work environment is great. You're encouraged to have (safe) fun at work and to build professional relationships with customers. "
good,The scheduling was good and the managers were nice. The company overall is fantastic. They wanted to promote me fairly quickly but the pay raise was not worth it.
good,"Depending on the manager it is a good place to work . I did scheduling, checked the receivers paper work , worked the side lot getting it organized. Helped customers , loaded feed , carried out items for customers."
good,This brand is a pretty cool because i can find just about anything in their stores. Working in the warehouse can be a little fustrated sometimes and if the pay was a little better it would be a great place to work at
good,good company to work for. one manager was ok the other manager had a bit of an attitude and was rude. one of the managers got irritated with one day because I didn't do a return correctly when it was my 2nd day on the cash register and  didn't  know there was multiple ways to do different types of returns. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find exactly what they needed for their pets/ farm animals!
good,"From the moment you walked in until it was time to clock out, there was always something to do to keep you busy.  The variety of products offered also helps you learn about new things."
good,"My typical day was the 2nd shift- checking registers to slips, duty list to my crew, resetting sections, customer service, load outs, front & face store, closing down registers & lock up the store. Learned so much about farming, farming equipment, farm, and domestic animals feeds, paints, and clothing materials for different jobs. I wish I had more computer training there, but the management was thinned out. The hardest part of the job was under staff for what the manager and district manager expected during a shift and safety. I enjoyed going there, enjoyed my co-workers and the customers."
good,Fast paced and not for people that stress easily. It can be difficult but it’s the best team I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. I recommend tractor Supply to anyone
good,"I've worked at TSC for six months and have enjoyed fellow co-workers and daily customers, but have found the side of retail to be draining. Overall, I learned more people skills and to adapt to unpredictable situations in the public eye. In the end, I discovered retail just isn't for me."
good,"it is rough working for tractor supply, in that they demand certain requirements for running the store yet one feels that they do not give the proper training and the proper amount of man hours to accomplish the tasks at hand during a shift."
good,"Don't expect to get rich working at Tractor Supply but if you enjoy agriculture related work, it can be a fun and relaxing job.  I enjoyed working shipping/receiving and forklift duties."
good,"On the weekend shift it's pretty laid back, good pay, with benefits. The management for the most part is pretty good. They try to work with you as long as it's in the guidelines."
good,It was a blessing working there and learning the difference in the different food for pet and also all the different supplies they sold. The clothing was always really adorable. I enjoyed meeting the frequent customers and new people.
good,"It was a nice enough job. I was stuck on the cash register almost the entire time, which meant I really didn't get to learn much. The scheduling is a bit all over the place. I only saw it scheduled out to 2 weeks at the most."
good,Tractor Supply upper managment didnt acually care about you and what wages are they just care about how much money they are making. I really hope that they turn around and see how they have moved from the core values.
good,"I have learned an immense amount of knowledge from working at TSC, but the pay is less than what can be afforded for anyone wanting to live off of the salary."
good,"For the area that TSC is located in, the company fits perfectly. The company is very conservative and retail is naturally a slow beast. That being said, the coworkers truly make you feel like family and everyone has each other's backs. The office is newly built and the location is great for restaurants and walks during the day."
good,Tractor Supply is the perfect place to work for some who loves the outdoors. they range from tires to animal feed and medicine. The typical day can be a struggle sometimes but its all in a days work.
good,If you don't speak up then management will just blame you for everything. The company lacks proper recognition as all the rewards are given to the manager.
good,Good place to work but it’s stressful and some times over whelming. They do things to make ur job simple and less stressful. Always willing to cross train and move you around.
good,"It can be a fun job working with people and pets. The work is honest and enjoyable. Management can be difficult to work with, and there standards of customer service could be better. I tried to make a difference in my store for my customers but management felt I was wasting time. It's never a waste of time to develop a relationships with your customers. We need to listen to their needs and provide the best service we can give them!!"
good,This job was fun and challenging. The only part I didn't like was that it was used as a first time job for a lot of high school kids and I felt like more experience was needed in the products and services offered.
good,This job gave me the opportunity to learn more about the management end of retail.  The people that I worked with were very open and helped me with the things that I didn't about.
good,It was normally a crazy day when at work. Some days were great some days all you wanted to do was go home. There was drama. If someone did not come in the first person they would call to come in would be me. So I guess I did pretty good at my job
good,"While the company has a great mission statement ""Our Mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices""  They fall short in the pay department, even Managers are paid meagerly.  Also if you are not willing to relocate to another location you will very rarely be promoted.  Even under these conditions the team I had the pleasure of working with was always upbeat and positive to the customers."
good,"I would unload the frieght trucks, check in UPS and FedEx when packages would come in. Help customers if needed assistance. I learned on how to run the forklift and fill propane. I also learned alot about some farm equipment and to work in retail. The management was good. If i had a question about how to do something they would help out best they could or explain. The co-workers were great everyone got along and good environment. Hardest part of the job is answering a question about a product your not familiar with. The most enjoyable part about the job is helping customers find what they need and learning about different. things."
good,Place is fun to work at for an easy simple job. I believe its one of the easiest jobs in the area. Work staff is friendly an so are the customers. Tractor supply is a great place to work.
good,"Moving various products around Warehouse, working in modules filling slots and doing other various tasks when assigned by my manager. Those we're the basic tasks of my job."
good,"The job on paper conflicts with what really is expected in the store. They say it is about customer service, but more about bottom line. Very difficult to accomplish corporate goals."
good,Your workday is never the same with any retailer and Tractor Supply is no different. You always have the easy days with great customers and then you have the bad days with the worst customers.
good,"I learned more  about retail for companies. Did special orders, rain-checks, also inventory processes.  Help several customers with variety of needs. Drove a forklift for the first time and learned more about farm and ranching needs."
good,A typical retail job. That help push me into being a better person. Helps teach people customer service and how to handle stressful situations. Learned more about the company.
good,"I have enjoyed serving the farming community. Teamwork, an important part of a workday. Sharing ideas and skills. I love learning about the product for sale."
good,Working with and demonstrating their powered equipment to customers was the most satisfying part of this position. Training of new hires and seeing their eagerness to learn.
good,The company is a great place to work with good benefits. Only down side is it is a physical job. I look forward to going to work and assisting customers on a daily basis.
good,"Busy farm supply store, Multitasking is a must. Typical day in the store included counting drawers, opening store, helping the customer find the product they needed, or recommend products based on the information they gave about their project. "
good,"Good job for those in college, needing part time work, first time jobs etc. Good atmosphere, easy to work with everybody come in and do your duty and you will have no problems"
good,I love my guys that help out in the back room. My Team leaders are great to be around and helpful. My customers are mostly regulars and either come in daily or weekly. I love the hours I work and the job that I do. Management has it good and bad qualities. The hardest part of my day is when others don't show up or call out and we are short handed.
good,You will learn a lot about mixing custom paint for different contractors and customers at this job.
good,Pay is not very good and you usually get assigned multiple tasks at the same time. If something is not done the manager gets mad. Also would get mad if you started doing something else.
good,"I worked for tractor got a little over 2 years and at 2 locations.   At both locations my store manager was AWESOME.   However,  tractor really needs to get with the times as far as pay goes.   The only to way to get a real pay increase is to promote."
good,this a good job if you are not in school and are looking for full time work. and are wanting to work on specific  days of time during the week. there is always overtime
good,I am the shipping/receiving manager and it’s a fun and exciting position for TSC. There are new and daily challenges every day but it’s worth it. It’s a different retail setting than most stores and it’s nice to be able to connect with the customers through similar hobbies like farming or gardening.
good,"Starting out it was a great job to have but retail isn't for me, I was able to stay busy but I did a lot more work than what I was getting paid to do but with little recognition to most team members"
good,"not really have many thing good or bad to say really. got better job offer somewhere else. didn't really have a good work flow, back up and help. no work friends, all business."
good,"Stock shelves and interact with customers"
good,tractor supply seems to be a great company with good benefits if you work fulltime. working out in the heat assembling is tough no cover for shade.
good,Productive fun work place and environment but needs improvement with management in store as well as territory manager.
good,"After store opened everyone's hours and days was cut short."
good,"Tractor supply was my first job. I learned a lot of things such as operating forklift, working freight and stocking as well as recovery of the aisles. Management was laid back, everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was to make sure every customer was happy."
good,My work day consisted of cutting boxes and putting the items up. Sometimes it would get so packed i would get frustrated. Work was constant except in the summer time.
good,a typical day was very positive. My other colleges were always kind and my boss was always willing to give advice in the work place. My colleges and boss were supportive with new ideas as well
good,Had a variety of job functions both working inside and out which I enjoyed.  I was able to help customers but to a limited degree per the company.  They did not give us enough hours to give exceptional customer service.
good,"Very enjoyable company to work for. My position requires me to open or close store. Supervise staff, take care of any issues with customers. I am also responsible to reset end caps and power panels quarterly. The most difficult part of my job is lifting bags of feed and dog food."
good,"In a typical day at work I have many tasks to accomplish and need to delegate to team members tasks that they need to accomplish as well. I take phone calls and answer any customer service and management questions. This includes calling vendors to make and verify orders. The team members depend on me to give them direction in accomplishing their tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customer service side. I enjoy solving customers ""problems"". The hardest part of my job is the customers who second guess my skills because I am a young female working in ""male"" environment."
good,days work was good with the right team the manager brian is a very respectable man with good natured judgement and great managerial skills.helpfull and a good teacher with a positive attitude
good,We work very hard an also we work as a team too.And also they are some good people too.I have not miss no day to we get paid every two weeks.They are some good people to work for too.
good,"The company as a whole is amazing, the customer interaction is high and demanding. So the rewarding feeling of making someones day is daily basis."
good,You work hard but the pay could be better.  You would also think if some one was a really hard worker and they put in their 2 weeks they would try to hold on to you.  I was disappointed that Tractor Supply would just let a hard worker like me go.
good,"Ok great manager."
good,"Management was very unorganized, the store was unorganized, and lack of communication. Schedule was under developed. The store lacked cleanliness. The back room/warehouse was unorganized."
good,I enjoyed the customers at Tractor Supply and when I started there management was great.  Then a new manager came in and was horrible.  Many long time employees left because of it.  They expect ALOT out of you and the pay doesn't reflect it.  I did enjoy freight days but alot of times I was pulled to do the register.  My associate Manager was awesome
good,The work place for tractor supply is very uncoordinated. They dont work with military time and efforts. Had strict time schedule and they wouldnt work with
good,"The company is great to wok for but it really depends on the store you work at,management and you DM on how well your experience is at the location you work for"
good,"I enjoy helping customers,find what they need.  That is the most gratifying part of my job.  At this time however I find working part time and irregular hours more difficult to work."
good,i love working here just need more hours and pay.i have learned about forklifts and assembling merchandise.
good,When I went in for my interview the store manager told me things would happen there which never did. However I loved the customers because it  was usually regulars who came in and I got close to a few of them.
good,"This is a very thankless job, like with any retail environment. Of course, with management not being the best in terms of being a team, it was even worse."
good,"I had been working there for a month, I was off work for a week per Dr's request.. I had a massive heart attack at the end of that week.. My sister called to inform them the next day, that I was in ICU recovering from a heart attack and don't know what my recovery time is.. the said that was a quit.. I never quit.. now I am struggeling with finding a job to pay my bills since my disability cut off.. and they won't hire me back..."
good,"Tractor supply is a great company to work for, unfortunately the uper management I worked under does not value their employees unless you grovel to them. Tractor supply as well as many Other employees and management I worked with were amazing people and the culture of the business is amazing allthough no veterans or senior discounts."
good,"I like the customers there, I like a lot of the people that work with me, not much respect for the main manager, can’t really depend on him. I don’t believe this company looks out there people. I love the job itself , but no job Security there no matter how hard you work"
good,Loved working there just didn’t get enough hours and the people there were nice and helped me do things I didn’t know how to do at first they were very helpful and nice
good,"Discount was helpful since my family owns cattle and was in need of new t-post, fences, and gates. Customers are always rude 90% of the time. They will name call you. It was very stressful."
good,"Easy work, not enough pay. Poor management at the time I was working there.  Hours were not too bad. Just needed more of them. Can't make a living on 8.00 dollars per hour if not enough hours are worked."
good,"Relaxed place, no advancement chances, they'll hire outsiders before promoting. Paid breaks, decent schedule, very organized. I wasn't a fan of management, but overall a good place to work."
good,This company is good to work for if you get a good store manager. They set the pace for the whole store. Mine was great until he left and the assistant was in charge. POWER TRIP
good,Found it difficult to work for. In the duration of my employment they went through 3 store managers and 2 assistant managers. Kind of hard to find balance in that because of the constant change. Other than that co-workers and customers were great to work with.
good,"A typical day at work entails much conversation with farmers, welders, horse owners and mechanics. I have learned so much about each of these different client subjects. I have learned that you must educate yourself on the product before trying to sell it. The management is poor as of late, not very good management, specifics include lack of following company rules as well as lack of work ambition. The hardest part of the job is the constant amount of heavy lifting that is required in a daily work day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet new and interesting people and learn the ins and outs of agriculture and much more."
good,The knowledge i gained from that job i am eternally grateful for but i out grew myself there. Excited for new beginings to take what i have learned and apply it to bigger better things.
good,"My only disagreement with tractor is that you work 36 and don't get paid for 40 like every other weekend shift job....."
good,"Job culture is bad due to the fact that they’re usually racist. There is a lot of unnecessary drama. The truth gets twisted a lot as well. Some people that work there aren’t very ethical, trustworthy or responsible. There is a lot of immaturity there and overall a nasty place to work."
good,Tractor Supply Compang was my first ever job and honestly I loved it. There was so much room for you to grow and understand and learn. I expanded my knowledge to places if never thought of.  I recommend TSC to anyone.
good,"Co-workers are supportive & helpful. Hours vary. The store is pretty laid-back & it is easy to get to know & communicate with regular customers. I like the atmosphere of the store. At times, it can be hectic, but not excessively."
good,Enjoyed TSC but wasn't treated fairly. Was paid less then new hires after almost 2 years of working there. I enjoyed the customers and helping them. Knew all areas of the store and the day to day running.
good,this job had the cleanest floor and the product was getting faced every thirty to forty minutes. customer service was first priority in sales an management was always present or servicing as well.
good,"I have worked at two different stores in the TSC chain. The first one was much better, and i really enjoyed the job, the people (both customers and employees) and the pay was fair for what I was doing. The second store I worked at (I moved and transferred stores, with it earning a raise and moved from team member to team leader) was a nightmare. no one wanted to work, the employees and customers didn't want to be there, management was useless, I worked 10-15 hour days to cover shifts because people wouldn't show up and weren't reprimanded for leavings us high and dry, half the time I did more managing than the sore manager and assistant manger combined.  I ended up leave the company for a completely different position much closer to home because I was tired of doing three jobs at once."
good,"This is a great company to work for but the management at store level is terrible. Poor communication, and no accountability. Those that do a good job are only expected to do more and pick up the slack from others that don't want to work. Working with the customers however can be very rewarding and fun and the majority of the other employees are great to work with as well."
good,Its a great position if you love the farm life and love animals its a good work enviroment. you answer questions for customers so you need to be knowledgable in what your selling.
good,"Very busy worked 7 days a week for 5-7 months. "
good,I enjoyed working with my customers assisting them with all of their needs as well as my co-workers mentoring and working as a team to be successful towards making company goal.
good,"They only had an assistant manager, very poor attitude and very difficult to work for. Would say one thing then do the opposite. Very unreliable and can’t move up unless you lived on a farm."
good,"Enjoyed my 7 years there for the most part. The young employees are not held to the standards they should be. This is often a first job for them, which i believe requires managers to teach them to be responsible. I did not see this, they were allowed to be lazy."
good,I was passed over 3 times for management positions but had to train the outside hires they had for the positions I wanted. They wouldn't make anyone full time unless they were management so working 39 hours or 39.5 hours just under 40 hours so they wouldn't have to give you healthcare or any benefits. I loved my manager but couldn't  get on board with their district managers
good,"hard to get days off even when requested, your days depended on the moons of the bosses and a lot of the time they played favorites. if you worked faster than others you would either get told it wasn't good enough because you did it so fast or you'd get told to do others work and not get credit."
good,It’s a awesome place to work. Just don’t count on it to be a full time paid job that will keep your head above water. Would be great as a part time job but  you won’t be paid enough to live.
good,TSC is a great place to work... just make sure that your SM knows exactly how to do the tasks at hand.When I first hired out with the company I had one of the best  management staffs in the company. Once New management took over things took a turn for the worst.
good,I liked working here because I have animals and know about feed and products. some tools I know. the store manager accused me of a lot of stuff which is why I quit. she played favorites
good,"While I worked at Tractor Supply Company, I was in high school at the time. They had great flexibility for hours, however, management had some serious issues. I went through about 6 different managers in my short year of working there."
good,"The culture instituted at TSC was one of team work. We had a great team and always worked together. Of course, there is always going to be some difficult times but we always managed to get through it."
good,As a part timer is was an ok place to work. I got along well with management and my team members. 
good,"Assist customer with product, special order tractor parts."
good,My first job....it was great. I had to learn a lot but enjoyed it. Customers and employees were very nice and helpful. The hours and pay were not very good.
good,"As a cashier, each day consisted of answering the phone, helping customers at the front of the store and performing store closing procedures. Management was easy to work with, I never had trouble with requesting off or with scheduling."
good,My manager was a great! One of the hardest physical jobs I have ever had. The women would do as little as they could get away with.  It normally took 2 women to do a 1 person job because they were always together.
good,"It's a pretty good place to work at, the pay really stinks. It is too much physical labor for $8 starting out at. The people are pretty good, but the only issue is pay"
good,"The people I work with are okay, but they tend to get caught up in a lot of drama. It's all fun and games, until the district manager comes in and scares everyone into doing their job properly. Overall, if you like working odd hours for okay pay and good customers, go ahead. But otherwise, keep looking."
good,It was a great first job and I made plenty of friends with customers and those I worked with. I still miss working there but I needed a job closer to home with more room for advancement.
good,"I have learned so much over the time I have worked here. Having to deal with customers good and bad, good and bad managers and other employees has taught me to always give my best foot forward and to always smile, no matter what."
good,"Come in and stack feed, assist customers with loading items and filling propane. Help customers order parts or find items they may need. Run register, finish any assigned task."
good,"plenty of paperwork and house keeping for customer satisfaction"
good,I helped put the whole store together to get it ready for the grand opening. I worked with the company for only six months.
good,The company overall is a good company. They have a solid niche market sewn up. But the IT department is a mess. No leadership and heavily siloed. The only reason people stay is the bonuses are good. One group in particular is really bad: retail systems.
good,Everyone at the store is understandable and respectful I was offered a team lead position And had my manager go against his word right now things are tuff at the store due to the store manager being on leave for a couple unknown reasons.
good,It's a team atmosphere they have decent benefits you can move up in the company  you learn a lot of different positions so you can find out what you're good at
good,It was a very good company to wotk for . Could have better management. But overall it is a good place to work. Offer good benefits . Could be a little more fair on scheduling.
good,Overall the place is a good stepping stone for those who want work experience this job will expose you to a little bit of everything and work you in most positions
good,"The location that I worked at was very team orientated. We worked together all of the time and got things done. I really enjoyed working here but even though I was part time, I still had some issue getting days off for school events and family events."
good,Everything is awesome to work at tractor supply the only bad thing is the pay. I believe they can do better but TSC Is just greedy. Aside from the pay everything is good.
good,excellent first place to work and get your foot in the door in the work force. The customers and employees were all a great experience to be around and learn from.
good,Training could be better. Fellow associates can be cut throats and stab you in the back. I worked at 2 different stores and it was like that. DM is in the store at least once a week.
good,Expectations are high while they don't give you enough FTEs for your   team.  TSC is a growth company and is struggling in some areas to grow and change their business processes.
good,quick paced and stressful. Once everything is caught up the store management and other staff are relaxed. There are clicks in the staff so sometimes it is hard to fit in.
good,"My most recent manager was always neurotic, and made working there extremely stressful and a whole shift of feeling like you were walking on eggshells. When I would have problems with coworkers, he would always fail to address it, and would sometimes schedule me for 10 days in a row with only a day off afterwards."
good,"I loved working at tractor supply, I loved the people I worked with; also loved the customers. But the manager was a poor manager and didn't do what she should have, and did not handling things the right way. I would loved to work at a tractor supply again. But would never work under the manager I did again. Thank goodness, she got let go/quit shortly after I quit shortly after I left."
good,"I worked there for almost 7 years, and in that time frame my career didn't go anywhere. The positions are pretty much stagnant. It is difficult to move up into management, as you have to wait quite a long time to even be considered."
good,"Tractor supply is a good place to work, great managers great staff. my only issue is the hours I need something full-time. I have no other issues with the job than that."
good,Running the register and stocking the shelves. Keeping a friendly face at the store front. Maintaining a clean and safe environment for everyone involved.
good,Working at TSC is a good experience.  You get to deal with farmers as well as the general public.  If you know anything about animals and how to care for them your experience is valuable at this job.  Try it you will like it.
good,"A typical day as a cashier is to answer all phone calls, help all customers, greeting incoming and leaving customers. Dealing with money exchange and returning items correctly."
good,Everything besides the people that are in charge are pretty alright most of the managers that work for the company really don't know a lot about what they are selling.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the hours were great and they worked with me so that i could go to school. The people i worked with were great. The manager at the time was super nice and worked well with others. I really miss working here. Really nothing hard about the job. I really enjoyed interacting with the customers."
good,Stocking feed and helping customers and occasionally loading and unloading trucks.
good,"Helped customers with everything from clothing, dog food, livestock, tractors to plumbing issues"
good,"Execution of Daily Planner tasks, assign tasks, lead team members through training, customer service, operational opportunities. Planning and execution of plan-o-gram resets, re-stocking assignments and all other issues as they arise."
good,"it was a fun place to work. poor management."
good,"Different all the time; unload trucks using fork lift, stock shelves, greet customers, assemble go-karts and tractor equipment, load products for customers. Management was very full of themselves and didn't pay much attention to the needs of the store. Co-workers were good people from varied backgrounds, each had something to offer the store. Physical labor and assembling products was difficult sometimes. The atmosphere and co-workers made it all worth it though."
good,"Stores are always behind, expect to be doing a lot of running around. if you are a hard worker then expect to have all the stores expectations and tasks put on you, if you enjoy standing around and getting paid while upsetting customers, this is the place for you. its what my co workers did, including the manger that stands around and smokes more then anything."
good,No job security at all. HR is out to terminate managers so they can have another notch on their belt to prove there importance to the company.
good,"When I worked at Tractor Supply all I would do is clean, and make sure our store looked neat and organized. I would help customers find items that they needed too."
good,Typical day at work with Tractor Supply was to run cash register or help customers load fence posts/Wire and many other outdoor products. Many of the days I would be responsible to count down the drawer and take the cash from sales to the bank.
good,the work and life balance is pretty decent. The only thing they might do is expect you to work a different day last minute but other than that it’s fine.
good,I'm only working there to pay my bills but I need more money and am looking for a full time guaranteed position else where. My hours are low I need to beable to make more than 500 bucks every paycheck
good,"Stay on task."
good,"Enthusiastic work environment, like always has some issues. We were a new store and functioned without a Manager for many weeks on our own and did well. I enjoyed working there."
good,I enjoyed my time working with tractor supply. Wasn't enough hours to compensate but I really did love working for the company . It is a laid back fun place to work!!!
good,I would cashier a lot due to my communication skills. I would answer phones and help when a customer needed assistance. I had the job of overseeing the clothing department and making it presentable.
good,"It definitely is not the best place to work but it is worth what they pay you. the management is loose and vague with what they want done, and only focus on their numbers."
good,"Disliked my store managers work ethics. For a company who has high work ethics, he shouldn't have been able to stay. He expected everything and did nothing."
good,Always a work enviroment that you could get along with the coworkers. Always work together to be able to do the hard tasks done. I was always willing to do what it takes to get the job done.
good,"Work environment is good, coworkers and management at stores are considerate, and most people are pleasant, but hours to be worked are not consistent."
good,"TSC is a company that does value their employees when the value of the employee is know. A typical work day includes assisting customers around the store, stocking shelves, lifting and moving large items, running the register checking people out, answering the phones. I learned a lot about time management and customer service skills."
good,Been working at tractor supply for 10.5 yrs looking for a career change ... worked as a manager at a loan company 9 yrs prior and a bank teller 5 yrs prior .. wanting to get back into banking and loan specialists. With no night  shifts . Hard working and very responsible & reliable  .
good,I enjoyed working with the general public with this job. Helping customers and getting to know them on a personal level is always delightful. Customers are a wealth of knowledge in a store like TS.
good,I was manager of a tracor supply and had to work 7 days a week and long days because we could not find help in area or team members would not show up for work at their scheduled time
good,I only work 1 day a week at Tractor Supply currently but I highly enjoy going in every Saturday to see my coworkers and help customers with their questions and needs.
good,Very good place to work. Great job opportunity for younger people. Good first job for some. Room for growth and improvement. Managers are really nice.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at tractor supply, but I wasn't getting paid enough or enough hours for me to be able to live off of it. the management was always fun to be around and treated everyone with respect"
good,Due to the current management at tractor supply co. the job there has become extremely stressful and the management doesn't care about family life and scheduling around it.
good,"Not a good balance of work and home, could not seen to get a scheduled that balanced home life with work. was constantly having to ask for weekends off to spend time with my child."
good,Loved working here! Great place! Quick paced! Lots of work that needs to be done. Mangememt is great. Everybody works together. Chick days are the best!!
good,The manager and everyone else that I worked for were really easy to work with. We definitely worked as a team! I would recommend this as a great first job.
good,"the management was the worst part of the job, general management and district management is lacking ethics . the company has unrealistic goals to be met."
good,"A quick moving retail store that runs 6% payroll, much less than any other retailer. All employees are hourly, even managers, because everyone does hoard physical labor."
good,They management communicated with the staff very well and the store reflected that. There wasn't any benefits offered due to lack of hours but other than that it was enjoyable
good,"Recent growth in, pet food meets hardware meets home rancher mercantile, market allowed this brand to rapidly become a household word here in the east."
good,"You will assist customer with various types of product and animal feed. there is not really anything hard about the job, and you will enjoy it because the customers are so nice and friendly."
good,My work day started off as opening up store Unloading motor carrier and saving product off truck. Checking packing labels making sure paperwork match what was delivered.
good,"If you don't mind working 10 hour days this is the job for you. Lots of overtime! You are always on the move while on the clock. It can be difficult unloading a container by hand, not enough equipment."
good,"I was pretty much just a cashier and stocked shelves, etc. My co-workers were great to work with.  I wish I had gotten a little more experience of working in other areas of the store."
good,"Great co workers, however a lot more physically involved than you know. Very hard work lifting heavy things all day. They start you with a lot of hours, then drop you down to 2-3 days a week.. you cant live off that."
good,It was a simple enough job even as a manager but it did lack in communication between higher up managers as well as training for the management position. The benefits where also almost impossible to obtain as well as have any money left over for other expenses
good,"Love culture, some managers, and some customers. Sometimes short-staffed, so people get upset. Stressful sometimes. HVAC does not work well while stocking shelves."
good,"Great values, great people and some of the best customers in retail."
good,Tractor supply is not the place to work if you are using it as a sole means for supporting a family. Low pay for the amount of skills and different areas that have to be handled daily. Hours vary weekly and not a consistent work schedule. It's a great company to start working when you are trying to transition between jobs or getting back on your feet.
good,The company is ok they want to work you to death and not pay you for it. They also try to discriminate against female managers. The benefits are good and the discount is 15% I would recommend this as a part time job
good,"Learned to be an affect cashier, supportive assistant manager, great team members. "
good,"Good for a first job, allows you to learn so much about various products and lifestyles.  One might think this job is only for farmers/ranchers, but Tractor Supply sells a variety of products - clothing, pet items, craft supplies, toys, games, automotive parts, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply and being a vital team member. The crew I worked with was great. I especially enjoyed the customers every day and seeing the regulars come in two to three times a week and building a relationship with them. They were like family. Management at the Hwy 64 store left a bit to be desired. The assistant managers however were wonderful and always eager to help you learn something new. I wouldn't say there was a hard part of  my job at Tractor Supply because I thoroughly enjoyed it, I just did not make enough money and could not get enough hours."
good,"Typical day of work includes stocking shelves and unloading new inventory. Checking stock levels, setting up for sales and specials."
good,"Everyone that work at Tractor Supply Co. are nice people, if you have a problem they will help you not question asked. Anyone that want to work there will be lucky to!"
good,"Working here is like working at the place that you love, but the place that you don't like going to. I love the people I worked with, and the customers, but you'll hate how many days you get during the week. Somewhat disappointing."
good,"Typical day starts with punching in and then getting straight to work doing things like stocking shelves of pet food, or jumping on the forklift and moving pallets around the back room."
good,"Not a bad place to work for retail. Upper management could be more understanding about staffing. Hardest part is working trucks that come in. The culture is pretty good they stand up to their values. I loved working with the customers that came into the store, very different from say wal-mart."
good,TSC as a whole is a fun and enjoyable employer. I guess it would really depend on the staff  and management. The customers are usually nice. The only bad time to work there is when you sell live baby birds. Other than that not too hectic of a work environment.
good,Loved the job. Company wants you to learn the customers so you get to spend time learning your customers needs. Need great sales and customer service skills
good,"I learned a lot about farming, and the customers were exceptional. There was always a very heavy work load, and on Tuesdays and Saturdays I was on the freight team. I learned how to drive a forklift, fill propane tanks, register, customer service."
good,"The TSC I am located at is very busy. We are based off of customer satisfaction but not everyone leaves happy because you also have policies you have to follow. Coworkers are awesome and very helpful, training process is really easy to go through."
good,"A typical day at work would include anything from working the cash register, stocking feed from the back room, loading items into a customers car, cleaning up from the day, and counting the tills at the end of the day."
good,I love working for the company but there are certain locations that have poor management and even many poor district managers
good,A fun enviroment to work with. Coworkers work well together and have compatable personalitilies. There are some opportunity to move to management but only if the person is willing to relocate to another store in the district. There are some flaws in the company but that is expected in a corporate company.
good,As a cashier I mostly work in the front of the store. I have to call over the intercom a lot because most of the time when a customer needs something I am the only one they can find. Management has no regards for cashiers needing to take a bathroom break or lunch. the best part about my job is the regular customers that come in and I have got to know many of them. If it was just the job without the customers I probably would have quit much sooner.
good,The work is interesting most of the time. The heavy lifting is getting to be more than I can handle.
good,I help customers in their purchases by sharing my knowledge of animals and farm related merchandise. I treat people like friends by acknowledging them as they enter the store and helping them throughout their visit up to and including the point of sale. Maintain a clean and safe store and keep shelves stocked and neatly displayed.
good,"Tractor Supply is focused on customer happiness while providing a safe, fun and productive work environment, encouraging employees to growth and achieve their personal goals."
good,"There very attentive to new comers and very passionate in what they do. The training process was a breeze. They taught me safety first, which was most important while operating a forklift."
good,"Good Part time job."
good,"It's an easy job, I just ran into some physical problems that caused me 2 miss alot.I  stayed 2 myself, didn't talk much & didn't try to make friends."
good,"More of a short term place to work, and the hours kinda get chopped at this time of year which is why I’m looking for a different job and seems like the managers don’t agree that often."
good,The job itself is okay and like any other retail job at a feed store. Management and coworkers made it good some days and not so good other days. I recommend working here but the hours can be a bit all over the place.
good,It was a nice place to work. The other employees were friendly but there was no job security since I was hired through temp service overall it was a nice experience
good,enjoy working there by helping customers find what there looking for restocking inventory and feed running register staying busy being able to interact with customers
good,"Great company to work for,  Great pay and benefits. Easy work but u have to be someone who Iikes to work  Job requires you to meet production goals and work in different areas if needed"
good,"Tractor Supply Co. was a great company to work for. They extended my knowledge of livestock care, and equipment management. This company provided an educational but enjoyable community to work in."
good,I have enjoyed my time at tractor supply. The work environment is only stressful if coworkers are unwilling to work. The hours are flexible and the pay is competitive.
good,"The overall greatness of the company is reflected in the Management of the Store by the head of the store!  Get with a great store manager, who has surrounded himself with a great team and you have a great place to work.  Work for a poor manager and suffer the consequences ..... When people who drive desks, over 1500 miles away and make decisions on how stores function, they make it difficult  to serve the customers' needs"
good,Diddnt learn much just a working place for strength great place to work just not enough pay............. overall great place to be good overtime pay and avoid starting pay..
good,It’s was over all a nice place to work. It was easy to learn how to use the register.The coworkers were really friendly and it was a nice paced job. It was a clean environment and you get to a little bit of everything.
good,"you work hard, relaxing at certain times, you are able to develop relationships with some of the customers.  you learn how to look at problem and come up with a new solution."
good,Get to have fun with other workers and customers while providing great customer service. you can move up and your time with the company means more than I have seen form others.
good,I absolutely love my co workers but corporate doesn't care about their employees we are always the fall guys and the hours are terrible here and it's hard to stay motivated with minimum wage for a hugely profitable company since it still has small business vibe with low staffing
good,"Good job for high school/ college students who don't mind subpar pay and hours. A lot of work to be done on a daily basis, in a fast paced environment."
good,"Working at TSC allowed me to learn new things, granted I was already very knowledgeable in many of the products and services. I was given room to advance, however I was only part-time and going to school so I did not persue advancement. Co-workers were largely enjoyable to work with, and there was very little drama (the crew I worked with got very close). Each day was something new, which I loved, sometimes I worked the register, sometimes I did stock, and others I was in charge of load outs and helping customers."
good,"Great company, great values, loved every second working here. Felt like I was valued. Any problems that I had were resovled. My voice was heard and that made all the difference."
good,"Working for tractor supply was a good experience and I loved every moment of it. It was my first job and I stayed for a few years, it taught me lot about working and Making money"
good,Working here was great loved helping people! There was plenary of work to keep you busy! You will make life time customers you may even create friendships that are awesome! Tractor supply was a great friendly place to work!
good,"Working at tractor supply was a very good job, the employees are wonderful. The customers are nice to work for as well. The only downfall is not having a constant schedule. Over all I loved working here."
good,"TSC is a company where you will work long and odd hours, get paid fairly well and receive pretty good benefits. There is opportunity to grow if you are willing to step outside of the box and the norm."
good,"It's an okay place to work. I actually like working there. They try to make you feel welcome at Tractor like you are part of a family. The environment is fast-paced because you are on production. If you are not at 100% production they probably don't want you. You work 10 hours day or night shift. You will work mandatory overtime on the opposite shift. You get two breaks one 20 minute and a 30-minute break."
good,at TSC my day started by clocking in and checking with manager or lead on what they needed me to do either stock or run cash register. When register was not busy i stocked shelves with items as needed.
good,Was a great company to work for. Everyone had fun and worked together. You get to see what the farm and ranch life style is like from and outside view.
good,"Very fast paced ever changing environment. Great customers. If you enjoy a work place where you're always o the move, this is the place for you. There is a variety of tasks to complete. Friendly staff."
good,Work environment can be either relaxed or very fast paced and stressful. I would recommend this place as a first job or s a part-time job for someone who is in college.
good,"Tractor supply is a good place to work; people especially team members are friendly, the work is not too difficult, but you will lift 50lbs often. And you always have people to talk to."
good,"I loved the work and customers, management was never balanced out always stressful and there was never a set schedule, hard to love your job when your stressed all the time"
good,"Overall a good first job or easy job for anyone, good teams who are fun to work with. Currently doesn’t fit my future career nor am I getting enough hours to support myself."
good,Tractor supply is a fun place to work if your in college or in Highschool as long as your 18 or older. Very easy people to get along with long standing time and always having something to do 24/7.
good,TSC is a good company to work for but I wish their pay scale was more competitive with the businesses around them. This would allow them to hire that appropriate number of staff to maintain store quality and take care of customer needs.
good,If you are looking for an entry level job this is a good one. Need to be able to lift 50 lb bags of feed. Long shifts on your feet. Love customer interaction. Management is a bit lacking and the scheduling is outdated as they aren't truly mindful of the requests in the calendar.
good,Great company but salaried managers outside of the stores are not equipped or trained to hold the titles they have until you get to the corporate level.
good,Nice place to work for a full time job. Reasonable advancement opptunertity. Flexable hours if needed. 2 20 minute breaks. Provides and training and equipment necessary to do the job.
good,Great place with great people. Management is ok but not the best. All employees are not treated fairly or held to the same standards. You always know what time your going to be finished for the night.
good,"I worked full time in the summer while I was not in college and I worked 5 days a week. When I switched to part time, they scheduled around my schooling."
good,"Fun work place serving agriculture customers. "
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Tractor Supply. People were great, work environment was great. Really wanted to move up in the company but the opportunity did not present itself."
good,"It was a fun place to work from time to time but their policies and politics don't match. Not everyone gets the same training and a lot of times you're just thrown to the wolves to figure things out for yourself. People aren't held accountable for failure to perform, etc but you're expected to pick up their slack. The rules are made up as they go, so to speak. They don't always promote within. Salary is less than desireable and could stand improvement."
good,"The managers werent that great but i enjoyed the discounts. I woukd have like to have been paid more. I liked being a sales associate there, and the customers were fantastic."
good,"it was fine. i stocked shelves and did stuff in the back room, worked as a cashier, and just organized the sales floor. Really easy "
good,"I feel the store manager should have been more active with the workers from day to day.  He stayed in the office asleep the majority of the time. While this was unhelpful to me because I was the assistant manager, it did teach me to run the store quicker and deal with any issues between customers and employees or employees."
good,"On a daily basis you assist customers finding what they need for their hobby farms, tools, parts, special orders, and animal supplies.  Offer advice on items to purchase for machinery, mowers and animal vaccines."
good,"Tractor Supply Co. has a very rushed and fast-paced work condition that is hard in and of itself to handle if you are not willing to do the work.  With my time at TSC, I learned a lot of valuable skills in the retail industry."
good,the best part of working at tractor supply was the customers. but the worst part was the occasional long rushes of the day as cashier. management was great occasionally but the head hancho was the worst.
good,TSC is an good place to work .   There were a lot of specific rules that were timed.  There were to many  timed events.  The manager was hard to work for and satisfy.
good,"Great culture of mission and values. Fun environment to work in and good customers. Cons, district manager that doesn't follow company values. Fast paced high volume sales"
good,"I worked with alot of great people. They did not help those with certain skills or proper education to advance from the department I was in. Overall, the company is great especially their benefits."
good,"The hardest part of the job is realizing that there is a lot of physical labor that most don't realize is present. This is an agricultural store, so there is heavy lifting of three point tractor equipment, livestock feed bags, hay bales, and other heavy items."
good,"can be a good environment but corporate regulations need work, environment is good but no room for advancement. pay rate is above anything else available, but isn't worthwhile unless your getting more than 10 hrs a week."
good,The company was fun to work for the store manager was always out on leave and I had to run the store in her absence but I enjoyed the responsibility only wish I had the pay to go with it
good,I still enjoy working there. The only reason I plan on leaving is because the pay is to little. The people there are fun to work with and try not to make the job  very stressful.
good,I believe that Tractor Supply is a great place to work. The customers are nice and so were my co-workers. My boss was easy to get a long with and the people were nice to talk to.
good,Always something to do and people to talk to. There are many different things that are sold so there are many different types of people that frequent the store.
good,"terrible communication among supervisors and team members, training was mediocre and did not train us under the same SOPs throughout the warehouse. PTO was great"
good,District Manager was not consistent in his holding of Store Managers accountable. Too much favoritism. Guidelines for store perception were blurred and inconsistent.
good,"I enjoyed the customers that came into the store and had great team members. But I felt you got worked way to hard for how much you got paid, and the manger to my opinion takes advantage of you especially if you don't say no. But overall I really enjoyed working there"
good,At the time I worked at Tractor Supply they were going through management change.  It was pretty cut throat at the time.  The new manager has changed the environment to a more professional place to work.
good,"Balanced home life / work time, great team and a overall great environment make working at Tractor Supply a fun experience. I would gladly recommend working at Tractor Supply."
good,I learned a lot whilst at TSC. Everything stocking and sales to quality customer service. Management and coworkers helped make work more enjoyable. TSC is a great place to work.
good,"During the busy season, there were a lot of hours required. Six to seven days were required. Since there is a lot of pet food in the facility, there were rodents in the building. Besides that, the management was ok and it was overall a decent place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply Co. Everyday was different and i met new people. I didn't like the fact that i was part time and wasn't getting enough hours.
good,"Worked with the most responsibility, Manager was seldom there and the District Manager was her buddy. The other employees were taken care of by the manager and were not held accountable for duties. There were drugs involved. I would not put myself in that position again."
good,Overall this is a great company.  Was just not a good for for me.  In my short time here I met great people.  The job I had was just not a good match for my skills and ability.
good,"Management was great to work with! Very busy retail location, with variety of daily tasks to perform: daily meeting with team members, product stocking, customer service, processing transactions, maintaining daily logs of equipment,assist in team member training, and cleaning as needed."
good,Fun and friendly work place with great benefits. Management is strong and willing to flex with the schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help a customer in need and seeing them satisfied.
good,"Great hands on work place"
good,When I first started it was a great place to work. In the seven years I have been with the company they have lost sight of their mission and values. Lack of morals and willingness to work with employees on their schedules.
good,i liked working at tractor supply mainly because i wasnt standing still. the work was fast paced and enjoyable at all times and i always knew what i was supposed to do next
good,"TSC allows management to wear many hats while on the clock.  From working on the register, to handling customer's orders, opening and closing the store, filling in for the receiver and conducting weekly walks with the Store Manager to ensure all are on the same page.  It is a small staff, so all must work closely with one another."
good,A typical day at work was a steady pace.  Management was supportive to staff members.  The hardest part of the job was occasional heavy lifting.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having great co-workers and customers.
good,"Driving forklift"
good,Tractor Supply in Irmo has good management that cares of their employees. They make it a safe friendly environment and the other employees are good genuine people.
good,"I have spent 3+ years with Tractor Supply Company and have enjoyed the people, employees and supervisors that visit my store. Living close to the store and getting to know customers likes and needs and definite plus to ensure top service for them."
good,"While Tractor Supply Company is a stressful work environment, the people are extremely respectful and management is almost always willing to work with you. The hours are sometimes long and if you don't know much about farming supplies, animals, or gardening, this isn't the job for you. You will be asked a lot of questions on a frequent basis and you're expected to be able to answer them."
good,"Enjoyed tractor supply, great employees, but pay was little but went well with my schedule. Would work there again if needed. Worked with employees well"
good,My experience at Tractor Supply was usually very busy. I loved most of the customers and employees. The hardest part was shipping days. Overall not a bad a place to work.
good,One has to have good social skills. It is a great place to work on social skills as you constantly work with different people (customers) everyday. Definitely a job for students currently attending high school or college.
good,"This is a very good place to work.  Managment does not encourage growth, and does not follow corporate processes as designated by District Manager.  Store manager has limited people skills and does not recognize her short comings.  "
good,"Typical work day of a cashier consists of making sure the front of the store (your area) is clean and organized for the benefit of the customer. I have learned communication skills, problem solving, and money management while working here. The workplace culture at this store was a mix of male and female mainly Caucasian with open minds. The hardest part of the job was working freight days which involves unloading the truck full of goods and putting them into their places accordingly all before the store opens. There were times when it could not be finished before the store opened and then it was difficult to stock and also help all of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, the animals of all kinds that came in and hearing the stories from all of the people passing through."
good,"Its a great learning experience and great for first time people that are getting jobs, I recommend it for teenage or high school kids to start off with."
good,This store is a great place to work if your in school. The company does not offer very many hours or overtime if worked. Although they pay $9 an hour. I would prefer another job if your not in school
good,"It is a great company in that you learn every aspect of retail in short period of time. The stores do not have a lot of people so you need to learn quickly how to run register, build items, sell items, fill propane , run forklift, special order products etc. this is actually very helpful if your planning on staying in retail it helps you get a lot of skills faster than other retailer where your stuck on register or in just one dept. and can help you advance quicker."
good,I've all ready filled in this section in detail and have no idea what other information I should add to this section. I have given in depth details and if you'd like to know more just ask.
good,The other employees are easy to work with. Great place to work and learn new things. Great company to work for and be a part of.
good,"Worked Long hours wasn't salaried and I had to work overtime to just meet the amount of money that was guaranteed to me.  Typical Retail envoironment, good employee discount"
good,"With the right management team this would be a good location to work at.  The same can be said about any place to work for, I just fell under others that felt intimidated by my education and work habit."
good,Not a bad place to work. Shifting leadership. Communication not the greatest. Mostly enjoyed every day. Loved being able to have dogs come in the store.
good,"Love my job and love helping my customers, Its a great place to work. Being able to help customers find product and even help load product into their vehicles, is rewarding."
good,Friendly and safe atmosphere. They make you feel like you are important as a worker as well as a person. They have a priority in making sure your work environment is safe!
good,"Working at Tractor Supply was definitely a fun and interesting job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting the opportunity to be able to socialize with all types of people, and animals on occasion."
good,10-12 hour days with too much mandatory overtime. learned WMS. Management not fully committed to the success of the front line leadership. Hardest part of the job was trying to be extraordinary in an environment that accepts mediocracy. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping to develop hard working new talent.
good,I didn't work here very long. I was a cashier and kept the front of the store clean. I greeted the customers and helped them as much as I could. I didn't know a lot about the things at the other side of the store.
good,"Waited on customers and checked them out when they are finished shopping.  Assisted customers, stocked shelves, and maintained store appearance.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was standing on concrete for 8 hours at a time.  The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the customers."
good,"I got along well with my co workers. Pulled orders accurately, stack pallets, operate forklift. Use the forklift to move the pallet to the correct shipping lane."
good,My co-workers were very helpful in teaching and showing me what to do on the job and also taught me new things and ways to help people
good,"I very much enjoyed the work environment and loved the small town country atmosphere that all TSC stores give off. I loved getting to know my customers and talking to all of my 'regulars'. The best part of my job was being able to help people find what they needed and give them solutions to issues they were facing. Nothing about this job was particularly difficult. There were many responsibilities like cleaning every night before close and making sure the chickens during the Easter holidays were taken care of. The only thing that I would have liked to change was the management. There was no sense of leadership or team work from the manager. Often, it was the team members that had to band together with the team leaders to get objectives finished. Although the management eventually changed, the general sense of no leadership did not. Many dedicated hard-working coworkers of mine decided to pursue other opportunities because of it."
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers.  Assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints. Establish or identify prices of goods, services or admission, and tabulate bills, cash registers, or   optical price scanners"
good,"enjoyable lunchroom"
good,"-	Communicated with customers to ensure legendary customer service"
good,"great place to work if you like farming."
good,Typical work nice and calm everybody working together to complete daily goals. Good benefits and raises were better than most jobs.
good,"I like working at Tractor supply, it is a fun atmosphere and i get along well with my co-workers. However i don't like the lack of room for progression in the work place. Having a hard work ethic is good here but it does nothing for you aside from gain the trust of your management team. I feel that consistent hard work and punctuality should be repaid in some form of promotion. As apposed to being stagnant, and stuck where you start. Especially if it is evident that you outwork your team members day in and day out. Other than that it isn't to bad."
good,"	Organizing and setting planograms"
good,"low pay, long hours, pay is bonus driven, overtime is a requirement of salary, enjoys selling chicks and ducks around Easter"
good,Most days I enjoyed working for TSC. I knew many customers on a first name basis and all the employees were very friendly and kind. Management could be hard at times but we always got the job done well and successfully!
good,In less than 2 years I was able to advance to Asst. manager. Great pay and great benefits. Very busy but manageable working atmosphere. Flexible schedules. Great business to work for.
good,I'll have to say that I made some wonderful friends while working here. It's one of the few workplaces that I truly felt like we were our own little family.
good,Great company to work for. Very family friendly and employee friendly. I learned quite a lot about farming and ranching and what people who do that for a living need
good,I've enjoyed working for Tractor Supply Company and I have learned a lot. The staff is caring and supportive. The biggest challenge is the wide variety of specialized products that they carry there and meeting customers needs in every department. I have enjoyed being able to show some expertise in some areas and the opportunities to learn in other areas. Staff has been supportive with helping me to develop in weak areas and strive to be a better employee. In addition they have encouraged promoting with in and have worked with me to improve my position within the company.
good,"The job is production based, but you work 5 days a week and weekend off all holidays off and yes we do have a ping pong table to use."
good,Employees are easy to get along with. You learn a lot of aspects that are involved in the retail environment. Overall a very fun work experience.
good,Good company to work for; not really hard work just help out customers and ensure other associates stay busy on their tasks assigned to them.
good,it was an okay job. they sometimes treated the favorites with a little more favor and the boss was kinda lazy he didnt want to do much just made you do his dirty work.
good,"I typical work day for me is mostly helping customers find what they needed, answering phone calls, making payments, rain checks and layaways. I learned a lot about Microsoft Word, I also took a class in high school, I learned what I real job is and how driven I am to accomplish anything ""what it takes, is exactly what it takes"". Well my management is incredible in my own personal opinion. I was always at least 10 to 20 minutes early to the job just so I could get all my ducks in a row. I am driven to help customers with whatever their needs may be and if we met a problem, I was sure to make the correction quickly and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was honestly just lifting objects over my head and on to the shelf that were just as heavy for me, but I was never one to ask for help because I knew I could get it done alone. The most enjoyable part was the fast pace of the store. I loved having busy days because there was always something to get done and accomplish."
good,It's tough at first especially if you don't know everything in the store but the older employees are very willing to help. I've learned so much working there and it has made it so much easier to communicate with the customers. And the customers are very nice.
good,Tractor Supply Company is a fun place to work but the responsibilities far outweigh the money that is with the job. You will get to know the regulars which will make your work days a little better.
good,"typical day starts at 6am,I jump on the Ten-co (vehicle to transport heavy loads from one side of the farm to the other) i have to gain product knowledge of about 120 different types of flowers. I have to learn all them pretty quickly because i had the most important job on the farm. I was personally responsible to map the carts of flowers on the computer and put it into inventory. (I also had to distinguish the different grades of them too, if they were blown up ""Bloomed"" or if they were too green had to separate because green flowers wont bloom in the stores) if i messed up once i would end up messing up the inventory in the coolers and costing thousands per mistake. I'm really good with computers and learn very fast of product knowledge. I'm also requested to pick flowers and i have to maintain a 1300 flowers picked per hour, when the flowers come out of the coolers to clean up (de-bulb, Pick trash out, (roots, extra leaves, pull brown leaves) i had to make sure the flowers were even so they got cut evenly to bunch and sleeve and prepare to sell to the customers, at the end of the day we all cleaned the bunching room because dirt and bulbs and bad flowers EVERYWHERE! sweeping and clearing out the machines that cut and de-bulb the flowers because rocks and dirt can lodge in to the machine and stop it and possibly cause damage."
good,"TSC was a very structured work environment from day one. At the beginning of the shift the upper management staff explains the numbers along with any announcements, then they hand out assignment for the shift. Once the assignments been assigned the team members work on their assignments the rest of the shift."
good,Tractor Supply is an amazing place to work. I love all of the people I work with. A typical day at work is me on the register all of the time. The team leads are great but management is iffy sometimes. The most enjoyable part about my job is my coworkers and my customers
good,Company offers advancement opportunities to all team members based on performance
good,"Delegated and directed the team members on daily activities."
good,Stay to yourself and complete your work. Ask for help if needed.
good,Great work environment with plenty of advancement opportunities.
good,what I have learn is I buy peoples problems .I take peoples car problems and do it to the best of my knowledge with the help of the people around me I enjoy when they leave with a smile and come back with I different problem for me to buy . You are only as good as your people around you .you build a team from your works then you start with the customer base which always make money . I can build a team .I have cause I am a leader and can bring out the best in people
good,A typical work day consist of helping many customers with finding and loading product. Stocking shelves and unloading trucks. I learned a lot about different feed and learned most of the information from the customers. The management was well handled and they worked hard. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and relocating it in the store. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and learning from the customers.
good,"Part Time 5 to 6 hours a day sales associate."
good,"Assign daily task for employees"
good,Taking care of customers. Management of 10-12 employees. Day to day planning and execution of company direction.
good,I really enjoyed the product that we sold. It went with my everyday life so I knew how to sale and explain it to the customers. I learned about many different types of animals and feeds. I also learned about farming. I enjoyed the customers the most and the worst part of this job was the lack of hours.
good,I was a team lead and they had a habit of hiring young kids that really were not into working and did not complete jobs. You always had to stay on top of them. Not really dependable. Regardless of not being the best workers it was still a good place to work and we all helped each other and had a good time. This job required lots of physically demanding work.
good,"Great company, wonderful management and coworkers. I enjoyed everything about this job."
good,I learned a lot about the farming and ranching business. A fun job with good co-workers.
good,Tractor Supply does a good job of taking care of their employees.  It is a fun place to work and there are lots of opportunities for advancement.
good,A typical day at work is greeting customers and helping them with their needs. I've learned how to multi task faster and be more efficient with my time. The management wasn't very good. We were always short staffed. I had to work later than scheduled a lot. My co-workers were amazing. Very sweet and cared about you. The hardest part of the job was having to stay until midnight to finish plan-o-grams. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and seeing their satisfaction when they found everything they needed.
good,"The management team was flexible with my schedule and worked hard to be accommodating. There is a high turn over rate within the company, but that is to be expected when dealing with the retail world. "
good,"My day at work consisted of helping customers, stocking the aisles, working the register"
good,I really enjoyed working at Tractor Supply. All of the co-workers were awesome and easy to get along with. The customers were great! The job wasn't too difficult either. The only reason why I quit is because my manager was making me very uncomfortable at work.
good,"Loved the social customers"
good,asked to drive 74 miles 1 way to work and when I asked for a transfer or some relief my request was ignored.
good,"I was hired because I was great at running a cash register, and I was super friendly. I knew nothing about the items in the store, but there were many friendly workers who were there to assist the customers until I learned my way around things. Even the customers were understanding about me being out of my comfort zone for a little while. They enjoyed (as did I ) seeing me grow in my knowledge and my ability to assist the customers one on one."
good,"Overall, I liked working there for 5 years, part time (my choice). The pay was low but I knew it would be. Dont expect the company to think too much of you, and you have a good steady job."
good,"Great customers and co-workers. Mostly laid back atmosphere, but heavy lifting and hard work is required. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting required. Lots of standing and running around to wait on customers. Customers are usually really great. Good job to start out in, but be prepared to work really hard for really low pay. Management is good, but sales drive how many hours you get and if/when you get raises. No real money until you get into management which comes with LOTS of hours, do get bonuses but bonus is determined by sales-low sales, low bonus."
good,Working there has its days depending on who you work with. I can get along with anyone but some people may the day pass slower than others. The workers there are underpaid for what all they do. As much money as the store makes per year one would think they would take better care of the workers. Best part of the job though is helping the many customers.
good,"The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by a team member to successfully perform the essential functions of this job. While performing the duties of this job, team member is regularly required to:"
good,"The work done at tractor supply is fairly easy for the pay you get. Its a good job for a part time high school student or a full time adult. Some of the work can be a little physical, but its nothing a person in decent shape cant handle."
good,It is a good company with excellent culture. A lot of great projects people can learn with different departments and different people. Overall a good company to work with.
good,"I enjoy working at tractor, you get to learn all areas so you don't get bored doing the same thing all of the time and sometimes they promote within the company"
good,"If you're not looking for progression, this is pretty great. Or if you're looking for hyper progression immediately. You either get hired into a management position or an associate position, and moving upwards is difficult."
good,Tractor Supply was a great company to work for with great pay. Flexible schedule and the manager strives for employees to perform their absolute best during shifts. Worked around my school schedule.
good,The customer service some of the best the customers always come first and the hours are very flexible especially for college students who are attending or in between going to class.
good,"Overall, Tractor Supply is a great part time job. Management was an issue while I was there but that is not typical for TSC from other experience I have had with them."
good,"Management are well informed of job training and treat employees great enjoy working there.people are nice work environment is good, hours are flexible."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but it can be a stressful environment and you need to have customer service experience. You’ll end up working harder than what you’re compensated for. Schedule isn’t really that great.
good,"Day begins by greeting each fellow team member.  As we walk thru the store we gage the areas of opportunities.  We have a 5 minute huddle and get a plan together to address them and any other task before the store opens.  Working together to accomplish these task help keep a good work team environment.  As customer come into the store we greet them all, as their our family.  Finding out their needs and getting what they want, while suggesting other items that may help get the job done better or quicker.  Afterwards asking if we need to hold the item by the register so they can continue to shop. Thanking them with a smile and addressing the next customer.  Keeping a good positive attitude towards all helps keep great moral for all."
good,"Fun work environment with great coworkers, the tradeoff is low pay and minimal raises (about a quarter a year).  Opportunities for advancement though."
good,"Loved working at TSC. Would not mind to work there again. I enjoyed working there, working with good people and with items and experiences I have used in my lifestyle. It was a rewarding place of employement."
good,Dont say you are flexible or you'll be working a mix of morning and night shift with no set schedule. You are put on register right away you're required to stock boxes of stuff they bring out on carts while also keeping an eye on the register and getting yelled at for not being at the register as soon as a customer gets there. In a typical 6 hour day the only time i get to sit is if i ask for a potty break and i sit on the toilet.
good,Nothing bad to say about TSC. It was a good company to work for. Pay isn't bad for what you do. Most people are regulars and are friendly. The only bad thing I can think of is you have to work 6 hours before you get a break. Other than that it's not bad.
good,Enjoy working with others give 100 percent everyday willing to work overtime to get the job done fast learner i would recommend Tractor Supply as a good place to work at
good,"I wouldn’t keep tractor supply as a first and most important job, but I would highly recommend it as far as schedule flexibility and accommodations work."
good,I absolutely loved working here! Manager was easy going and understanding. Employees always made work fun. Hours were flexible. Absolutely amazing place to work.
good,The daily requirements of the job are very easy and the other employees are very nice and willing to help. Our store manager works hard to work out schedules to accommodate any needs.
good,"Customers always come first, even if they are blatently wrong. Employees are not given enough information and not all rules apply to all employees. Plus this is a job not high school so keep the bickering at home."
good,My typical day would consist on receiving anything that came in on the trucks and stalk the merchandise that came in. I would also assist any customer that needed help and help with load outs.
good,it's alright as a retail establishment poor scheduling  days off are never two in a row.  they short staff sometimes only having two people on a shift
good,"-working with new people"
good,"In the year that I worked there, the store went through two managers and even had a few months where we didn't even have a manager. I was there for almost a year and never got a raise and I worked the hardest out of any other team members. Given this was also three years ago when the store just opened."
good,Low pay for job expectations. Small pay raises. Stressful at times. Good friendly atmosphere. Store managers dont want to do anything and expect too much from lower management.
good,It’s good just rude customers sometimes and the job is strenuous. Sometimes things become overwhelming due to being understaffed. But all in all a good place to work at
good,"Decent place to work. Laid back environment except on days where everybody is shopping. Easy tasks such as organizing, cleaning, and running the register."
good,My time in this company was very fast paced and presented some obstacles when there was a lack of organization in scheduling. Team members were always great and would help wherever needed
good,"I Loved my customers while working at tractor supply company, it was awesome to get to know them and be able to help them find what they were looking for."
good,Working at Tractor Supply was good because my manager was very flexible with my schedule. She ask me if I wanted extra hours when they were available and while I was in AFJROTC and participating in Track and Field she would set my schedule to where I got a thirty minute rest before going to work.
good,"At TSC a day for me would consist of working the register as well as the floor, helping customers with any questions or where to locate an item, work on stock and freight."
good,"A typical day at Tractor supply is go in put downthe rugs, stock bags and receipt paper.  Put the clothes out on the floor if needed.  restock candy if needed.  Welcome customers, ring up sales and welcome customers to come again."
good,"Awesome company as far as it's mission statement. Well run affair. Very driven. But......as far as money is concerned, company lags way behind. Poor payscale. Even managers don't get paid enough to be at store 5-6 days a week. And rest of management gets paid e even lower. Maybe wages ok in South of U.S., not good in northeast. Company needs to rethink payscale. Otherwise, it's a job for bored houswives, kids in school or retired folks."
good,"Wasn't horrible, can either be really slow paced or really fast-paced.  Always worked the register which can be very boring at times. Got to meet cool people. The job was very repetitive but, good overall experience."
good,"This place is fun to work, and has a great environment associated to it. You get to bond with your coworkers more than you would think you would in this setting. However, it seems like everyone gets minimum wage unless you’re a AGM or GM. To make matters worse, it takes a while to advance to said positions."
good,Great team environment and very educational when it comes to animal health and farm equipment and supplies. very relaxed yet quick paced and hard working employees creating a great atmosphere for the wellness of farmers and their products.
good,"Tractor Supply is not a bad place to work. It can be a much faster paced job than most realize. You do need to be able to multi task."
good,"Easy place to come in and be a part of the familty from the beginning. It may get rather boring at times in certain stores. If you are working as a Team Member be able to lift anywhere from 25-75 pounds at a time and you wont have any problems. They will also work you very hard at times, this making the pay seem well under what you deserve."
good,"It's fine, pay is great. You typically work holidays if not enough people volunteer. If you have family, it is easier to move up. Really, I do not wish to write a review, but this site is making me in order to move on to the next step. TSC is a great stepping stone."
good,Great Compnay to work for. Company culture is good and promotes positivity. Chance for advancement is available. Can be stressful at times but also very rewarding.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customer base, however, employee training was lacking. It was a very laid back environment but a lot of responsibility was typically placed on one or two cashiers"
good,"I have enjoyed this job, I have just felt underpaid for the amount of physical labor that comes with the job. Other than that it is fairly enjoyable. There are days where we have fun and are productive but most days I have dreaded going to work. Not a fan of bi-weekly pay either."
good,Great people and coworkers but the pay not so good but everyone makes you feel like family and you have a fun time but management is not enjoyable but you all get along and have fun.
good,Tractor Supply is a very friendly and community based store. Working there really gets you more involved in the surrounding communities as well as life experience.
good,nice place to work however they do not pay enough for good workers to apply. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people working to get daily tasks done. The people that work with me are reliable and close
good,I worked there throughout college. I ran in to favoritism with employees and challenging customers. Management was an interesting set up (the manger was not there constantly). TSC is a fair company to work for if you like a retail setting.
good,"I was recruited to work there as an independent Dog Trainer to help provide awareness to the dog products at the Tractor Supply Company in Romeo, Michigan."
good,"Tractor supply isn’t bad for a part time job, I have learned many things dealing with farms, vehicles and how to build products we sell everyday. It is overall a good environment."
good,I enjoy working at TSC other than the low hours and not much advancement it was a great starter job. Management was fairly tolerable and I was usually able to negotiate some days off that I needed
good,"Tractor supply is a great place for a first job. As they do not offer many chances to advance in the stores, they do value teamwork. Which makes this working environment a great place to start towards a career."
good,"Work hard, decent co-workers.  Manager is great, but grossly overburdened. Pay is extremely low for the area and the level of responsibility. Never enough workers to function effectively and safely."
good,"The company itself is pretty laid back and the work done is not that difficult. Like any store, each manager is different depending on what specific store you are at. Full time has decent benefits but part time doesn't really get anything."
good,Great place to expand knowledge of farm equipment and feed. You will learn everything about animals and the things that are important for taking care of them
good,"Routine job, simple workplace, easy to learn while working about products and customer service. Not much room for advancement, great for a part time job for a high schooler or college student."
good,"Being a Cashier, the day starts off slow but picks up the pace around 10am and is busy until 5pm. I have learned how to multi-task in many aspects, also how to positively assist unsatisfied customers. Everywhere you work, there will always be a fuss throughout management but I still love my job. The hardest part of the job is continuing to satisfy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and developing a relationship with them."
good,"The work environment is pleasant, there are many employees who have been here for a long time and enjoy their jobs. The training is thorough and the management made their expectations very clear. Good work hours, with occasional overtime on the weekends. The job was straightforward and simple and if you ever had any questions they were promptly addressed."
good,Its an alright job just not very good hours and it pays low but its a good work place if you have a gym pass get rid of it you won't need it to the job is a work out
good,by people who know the best products for situation and are always willing to answer questions.  Being able to developed relationships with the people who walk in the doors and will be able to relies on our store again.
good,Most days would be filled with things from the minute I got into work until the time I left for the day.  Lifting heavy bags also included a lot of the day. We had to move skids of feed onto the floor and move individual bags to and from different skids.  I also had to receive and invoice packages that came into our system on a daily basis.  I drove a forklift on a daily basis unloading trucks.  My favorite part was that the same people would come in so you would develop a friendship with them.
good,"With the right store manager this is a great place to work. The culture is fast paced but also pretty laid back. Teamwork is very important at TSC. If the store manger is lazy or not willing to work, be organized or take interest in hiring the right employees and actively show appreciation as well as give constructive criticism, then it can be a tough environment to work in."
good,"it was a typical ratail job, not really a career. as long as you dont mind staying on your feet all day and picking up heavy feed bags, it made for a decent temporary job."
good,I worked at Tractor Supply Co for a Year and a half as a part time job while I was still in high school. For the time being it was alright but I probably wouldn’t work there again.
good,"its a good company to work for but its a stressful mandatory job as well they hired you for full time but it will take 6 months to get any kind of benefits , i work in the back section of the store and here are some of my duty..... stocking, feed,, forklift ,receiving,louding and unloading trucks,deliver ..."
good,"Tractor Supply is a great start if you're just looking for work for the first time or interested in picking them up as a second job. With a family setting in each of their stores you can learn as much or as little in running a store as you like from cashiering to floor sales, maintenance, receiving and running a forklift to even maintaining the health and care of seasonal livestock."
good,Usually always something to do at work. unless you weren't aloud to leave the register your feet would get very sore. we weren't aloud water on the floor with us for a few months either. Went under a few different managements. Stressful times.
good,"Tractor Supply is a great place to work, I enjoy the people I work and the TSC policies. Working part, there is no benefits or paid vacation. However, if you push and move up to management, will get full time and all the benefits and paid vacation."
good,"Decent place to work. Freight is fast paced, lots of foot traffic. Coworkers are all nice, days off are sometimes hard to get scheduled. But they are willing to work with schedules for school and other jobs."
good,Right now I spend a lot of time running cash register. I like Tuesdays and Wednesdays  because the truck load came in and I stay busy and then I feel as if I have accomplished something. If the store is busy with customers I like that also because I am able to help people find what they need. When it is slow and no product to put out then I go on the computer at the register and try to find things and look things up to get myself more familiar with the computer so when asked I can be more helpful to customers. The most enjoyable part about my job is when I know I helped someone out and they go away happy.
good,"This was my first job and I hated it when i was there. But now I look back at it and realize that I loved it. I cleared a lot in the 4 years that I was there. It had its ups and downs. We didn't have a constant manager. Seemed like if we had a good manager they would move him to a different store. Its a great place to work, and great first time job, a retirement job, or even a career job if that's what your looking for. I left because I needed something that was going to pay more so I could live on my own."
good,"Enjoyed Company."
good,Lots of overtime. Friendly atmosphere. Good co-workers that are committed to meeting goals. 2nd shift work their overtime on Friday night. All operations managers have been with the company for less than a year.
good,"Tractor Supply was a really good place to work as far as the customer base and fellow employees. The workload was not difficult and everyone worked well together. "
good,Employees are good and fun to work with helping customers takes good people skills but part of the job vary flexible on days and hours just work do your job
good,"Working for tractor supply was not hard, from unloading feed and stocking the shelves, to doing heavy load outs and normal customer service, it was a relatively easy job, just poor job advancement some people that made it poor. The few people who did their job didn't get recognized for it and was a constant battle everyday to pick up the slack from the lazy people."
good,"A ttpical day at work was pretty satisfying. I learned alot about the history of tractor supply, and alot about sales but didn't get to advance my training. The managers weren't professional at all, one imparticular manager was based off of favoritism, the hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with animals and drive the lawnmowers and RZR"
good,"I was in school the entire time I worked there and they worked well around my school schedule. Its a fast-pass job when busy, there was always something to do."
good,Most of the people i work with are fun and amazing to be with. The interactions with other people you get there is one of a kind because its a small store and you can almost get to talk to everyone that comes in. Its like a second family to me we all look after each other.
good,I really enjoy going to work. This company really believes in customer service and customer satisfaction. They believe in giving the customer a great product at a truly fair price.  They support our local community and youth with various different types of promotions. They hire employees with high morals and respect. They offer you the tools and education to succeed at your job but very little time to achieve them.  Overall its a great place to work that leaves you satisfied at the end of the day. You know with a piece mind that you helped someone make a purchase that satisfied the customer and the selling tactics were honest and the price was fair. In the end it's a win for everyone.
good,"I was a cashier ,stocker on truck days , "
good,"Typical retail feed and farm supply store. Every job has its up and downs. Stay within the company's mission and values and you will be great. Culture is one of work hard, have fun and make money."
good,I love that the company has well laid out plans and policies.  They are pet/family oriented and see their customers as their number one priority.
good,"The employees were always good-hearted, fun, and positive people. The customers were mostly good people who would like to crack jokes and just chit chat to pass the time."
good,"I love meeting new people, learning new things, my customer was the best part of my job. I operated a cash register while handling currency with accuracy."
good,"Customer service is their number 1 focus. Very diverse customer base, lots of animals (many allowed in building) and the ability to get hands on with much of the heavy machinery."
good,While I was there great team work. Management wasn't always fun but they cared about the team members and family first. Work days could be long and hard. If you're over the age of 18 be prepared to be forklift and propane certified... it's needed!
good,"I always felt incredibly happy to be there till I want receiving even hours to make ends meet. Decent pay. Not a whole lot of hours. Plus side, I loved working there because of the manual work I got to do. Wasn't a fan of cashiering."
good,Tractor Supply is the largest farm and ranch retailer in the United States.  They are a good stable growing company.  What makes Tractor Supply successful is their culture and team members.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with the company. I enjoyed my co-workers, and management was great. Inventory replenishment needed improvement, but all in all I would work there again."
good,"Working at Tractor Supply was definitely a fun and interesting job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting the opportunity to be able to socialize with all types of people, and animals on occasion."
good,I love my job and all the advancements that are able to happen. They seem to really care about their employees. Just wish with my job title I could have more time to obtain a college degree.
good,"This was my first job I learned how to do many things from learning how to sell, how to operate a cash register, how to set a plan o gram, then eventually to taking charge of the clothing"
good,"It is a good work enveriment."
good,"run cash register load heavy items, run forklift in the back if the store required to learn things about all items in the store so i can help any customer in need, some days i would learn more things from customers than they would learn from me"
good,"Come prepared to learn, grow, and be physically demanded.  This job is very hand-on and customer centric.  No need to apply if you are lazy or unmotivated.  Building relationships is a must and customer loyalty pays big dividends."
good,"This job provided a very structured place to work it made sure you were working 10 plus hours load outs, feed replenishment etc."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers very much. I really enjoyed the job and would still be working for the company if I could have earned more money.
good,"A typical day at Tractor Supply involves a lot of hard work and a lot of laughter. It' requires physical labor and a good attitude. The managers at Store 564 are awesome. Employees come and go because it IS a stressful job."
good,"In less than a year store, went through 7 managers and 2 assistant managers and quite frequently did without management. The store opened with 2 instead of 9, and closed with a different 2 instead of 4. I really don't know how we were able to meet sales goals and keep the few overworked employees."
good,supervisors could care less about anything going on and will even let temps have the veteran spots sometimes. the guys on the floor with you will help you out whenever and everybody gets along pretty good.
good,"I learned a lot about working and dealing with customers in a respectable way. You always have some customers that are hard to handle, but working here I really developed and understood what it meant to have patience with someone."
good,"For the most part a good company and a fun place to work.  Fast paced with everyone putting in a shared load.  Co-workers quickly become family like, depending on each other.  Great customers come into TSC and appreciate your help and knowledge, even if its just a smile and greeting.  Managements varies greatly from Very Experienced and knowledgeable to ""Experienced at another Big Box store and got hired as management and has no idea about TSC""."
good,"The pay was excellent, but the balance between family life and work was terrible.  I felt as if I lived at the place.  One of my worst complaints was seeing a team member be written up for lack of knowledge of every product in the store.  Believe me no one knows everything about farm machinery piece by piece."
good,"you would help a lot of people in a day "
good,"it was a normal costumer service job in the ranch industry. I helped people with fencing options and specifics of that matter. The manager  was very nice but not a great manager, however I did get along with him and the others well. It was nice to interact with all the people that came into the store, an loved to help them also."
good,Very Fast paced and i loved that. A lot of learning and hands on training and learning to differentiate feeds and hardware equipment and farming equipment. Loved the atmosphere but as many hours as i worked the pay and consideration for myself as an employee lacked. May be different at other locations though.
good,"Busy days, learned a lot about products through TSC programs and customers. Company needs less horseplay and more work ethic and drive. I loved helping my customers both new and aquired regular customers."
good,"typical day working with public, learned alot more about tractors parts, management that was there when i was was poor and lacked leadership skills (reson for leaving) , co-workers were great, hardest part dealing with the public, but other than trying to keep everyone happy i loved my job and enjoyed going to work everyday."
good,"Overall the local Tractor Supply Company is a great place to work. It's run like a tight ship ""by the book"" such regimented procedures result in a highly productive environment. Being a corporation, it does not open itself to new ideas. Suggested changes stall as they go through the channels, seldom meeting the ears of the decision makers. Inovative thinking is considered ""not the Tractor Supply way"" which is stifling to enthusiastic thinking. This company is highly successful. If you are willing to do your time according the constraints of the corporate template, you will enjoy working here. It is a fun environment with a family oriented work force and customer base. I would give it a 5 star rating if it was more open, responsive and timely on implementing new ideas and more rewarding to the individual employee who is willing to give the extra effort."
good,"depending on the work load for the day , i would receive my work to pick on a fork lift for oversize items to large to grab by hand and deliver to trucks. sometimes the day would also entail me working from a pallet jack if i got too far ahead on picking with the forklift so i would then pick off a pallet jack picking smaller items for the stores."
good,"Learned new skills and operations of heavy equipment, effective inventory record system and the bigger picture of retail sales."
good,"My work place was a fun but productive work place,if you had problems you didn't have to worry about getting jumped on for having a problem my supervisor was always willing to help out his employees"
good,it's always busy
good,Job is adequate work for someone in school.. flexible hours and more work during the weekends..mostly working floor sales and retail to customers while helping on registers
good,"Great manager, Willing to work around my availability. "
good,The people were worth working with. My co-workers were always upbeat and made even the worst tasks seem fun. It's a good place to get some experience.
good,"Work as a team to give outstanding customer service, fast pace environment, up beat, and working together to ensure that our customers are happy and return for future needs."
good,Good place to work. I would encourage anyone looking for a good job to definitely go to Tractor Supply Company.  Good pay and benefits. Friendly work environment.
good,"Working on your feet all day. Nice customers. Easy work environment, management was easy going. Paid training on site, you will need to be able to lift over 45 lbs."
good,"A typical work day (usually weekends, morning weekdays) tends to be very busy, between working register, filling propane, dealing with the customer service side of things too can be stressful. Unless you have the means and experience to deal with fast paced environments then all means work here. (This store location is very popular). The management could be dealt with better, from scheduling and time off to typical store drama which you get everywhere. Other the typical retail problems this store is amazing from co-workers to our daily customers i would recommend this place to anyone work and shopping."
good,"Amazing coworkers for the most part, I don’t think there is anywhere you could go and everyone be a team player and contribute the way they should, but here 90% do. The store manager is awesome to work for, he seems to actually care about not only the store but his employees too. The District Manager appears to be that way to. They are great people to work for. My only gripe would be the pay!! Definitely work a lot more than you are paid for."
good,"TSC is a great place to shop for farm parts & supplies, feed, pet supplies & feed, home decor and more. It's a good place to work and gives you plenty of opportunity to interact with the customers."
good,Work is hard work but I enjoyed working there and interacting with the customers. I worked inside as well as outside so you must be able to deal with any kind of weather.
good,"Employees are great. Unfortunately, they come and go very quickly. If you like a fast paced environment its a great place to work. They have monthly training on various parts of the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The best part is the unconditional love you get from the animals that the customers bring in."
good,Everyone there was very nice and extremely helpful when I first started they made sure I was well aware of how things worked and that I was able to do whatever it was I needed to before throwing me out to do it on my own.
good,"Daily work varies with position, however as a team lead, the daily tasks can be tasking with customer service and assigned merchandising projects."
good,"Everyday started as with the same routine, I started on the register and worked for a few hours I would then go to the back and start stocking the shelves, the management at this company helped keep everything going."
good,"The management I have had is quite good, and I love my manager. He's a really upbeat and understanding guy. The work itself is difficult at times, and if you're a hard worker, you can be asked to work to cover others' inadequacies."
good,"The work was not hard at all. Fun people to work with, very short breaks, great coaching staff, Only flaw that I could see was the communication level from managers to staff."
good,"Worked there for 2 years, loved the job but did not get promoted in time, pay was very low, I gave them 2 years to get me into a store manager roll, did not make it. if it had I may still be with them 12 years later."
good,If you like a fast paced enviroment and like to stay in shape then tractor supply is the job for you. the managment is great and they make you feel at ease if you have any questions.
good,"It kept me in shape, and was normally busy so kept you busy. The environment was very friendly and professional. You learn something new everyday. The management was so professional and great."
good,"Working at Tractor Supply was fun and you make money doing it, but the pay isn't the greatest. Would still be there if the pay would have been better."
good,"Everything revolves around customers and the freight truck. Very busy days, always seems like there is not enough help for customers in the store. Good people, but very busy."
good,It was alright  I worked there in high school and they paid ok and gave me good hours on the weekends. Management was willing to work with you and were very friendly
good,A strong company with very strong Brand Recognition and loyalty. A company in growth mode in the brick and mortar as well as online channels. No major competition and a lot of potential to grow further in the years to come
good,TSC did and excellent job working around my college school schedule. I would definitely recommend any college aged people needing part time work to look into TSC.
good,To have an open working environment. Learn from others that have been there for a period of time. To grow with the company and have the opportunity to be a member of a growing team. I have 5 years of working in the pepsi cola company that was a maker called Casa Grande Enterprise
good,"Good place to work if you like retail and outdoor combined"
good,TSC is a nice to place to work.  Most of the co-workers are good people.  There are some managers that need more knowledge on hoe to properly perform their duties.  Most of the customers are nice.  It is enjoyable to see the different dogs an other animals that come through the doors.
good,"Tractor Supply is an interesting place.  The product variety is enormous, encompassing farming, pets and livestock, gardening, any outdoor activity the DELMARVA peninsula offers."
good,"Company has a great culture, and depending on your team it can be a very pleasurable place to work. Often labor hours are low, depends on time of year and DM requests."
good,It was a good job i would work for them again if i could. I moved to Florida to work with horses so i had to quit. But overall a very good company to work for and i still shop there today.
good,It’s was a boring place to work bad management long hours and very stressful and mainly just boring you should wanna go to work and enjoy working where you choose
good,The overall job is arguably one of the easiest ones that I have had. Management does a great job of working with all members of the team and excels at listening.
good,Great place and products. Small and personal. Felt like a family environment. Wide variety of products for sale. Rarely was anything out of stock for long.
good,Always meeting new customers from town or out from surrounding towns. All employees was treated like a family. No man left behind. Worked very well with others.
good,It’s a fun place to work but the pay is way to low and advancements are not offered to often and neither are raises. If the pay was actually given based off of what your experience I would stay but they ask way to much and pay to little. But I did like my co workers and manager
good,"Fexible time and work schedule.  Enjoyed assembling all types of merchandise, ie tractors, mowers, log splitters, and product display units.  Also furniture and stocking hardware!"
good,"Awesome company to work for. The main issue is the pay and moving up is hard sometimes. If you work hard and show your potential it can be very rewarding. If you like fast pace and consistently moving it’s awesome but if you are lazy, it is not for you."
good,"I was at a cash register most of my day.  Part of my job was to upsell, even if I didn't know what I was doing.  I wanted to learn more about the company, but did not have adequate time to do so."
good,I miss working there great experience. I learned how to do things I've never had to do before. Loved the customers. Hated dealing with theft. I made great friends as well.
good,Its a fast paced environment with good pay. Some supervisors lack good management skills. They have good benefits available to all full-time and part-time employees.
good,I believe the tractor supply company needs to catch up with the new advancement of technology being a very large supply of farm an pet life products. Change is never bad.
good,It was a great fun place to work I really enjoyed working there I helped train all the new hires on how to use the power equipment worked plenty of overtime.
good,"Fast pace environment with opportunities.At work by 8 and left when the day was done."
good,Productivity was enhanced by the experience and quality of our Store Manager yet corporate office did not value highly out of the box thinking on merchandising or overall customer satisfaction.
good,With my time at TSC I had a good group of co-workers. I learned a lot from them about the farming industry and what TSC could provide for the consumers. I also really enjoyed what I did for the job. It was a laid back job but it did have it's busy moments which weren't to bad with the co-workers that I worked with. The manager at the time sometimes didn't understand my schedule because I was also a college student and had some conflicts with my schedule sometimes. Other than that the work environment was very good.
good,Excellent company to work for.  However I had the poor luck of working for the store manager at knox in.  She did not have the drive or work ethic to run the store.  She was not confidential and was full of drama.  The district manager was exceptional to work for as well as other store managers and associates.  He tried to work with her to get her to the level she needed to be but to no avail.
good,"My typical duties are money management, receiving, and running multiple teams to complete all tasks and customer service functions. Monday through Friday my team would work off hours starting at 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. complete recovery, feed filling, DC truck offloads and freight, complete all new Plan o Grams and sets, and complete maintenance of the building. I am solely responsible for  the management of all receiving and appearance of the exterior of the building. I am also responsible for maintaining all files for the store. At Tractor Supply everything is about team work and taking care of our customers. The hardest part of the job is the constant changing schedules with out notice. I love working with my team and we have really great customers that make the job fun."
good,Tractor supply is a great place to work. They make you feel like family and since I'm going to school they worked with me on my schedule. They will work with you on the days you need off as well. They are very good about that. The managers are pretty cool too.
good,"Part time, this job would be great, very flexible and the hours are there if you want, up to 30. The lack of benefits is the down fall for me. Advancement is available, you just have to wait for the opportunity to move into a full time position, then benefits will kick in of course. If you like people and don't mind anything else, perfect job!"
good,"Tractor Supply has a wide variety of products for the home/farm.  Animal care is 1/3 of the business.  The customers are top notch."
good,"It is hard work lifting and moving heavy merchandise in all types of weather, most of the time with little help due to budget and payroll cuts.  When I first started, before all the cuts happened, it was fun and still very exhausting work but worth it because we had a full team.  Now its get all of the stuff done, make customers your #1 priority and you get half the time and help."
good,"There are a lot of things to learn about in tractor supply when it comes to farm maintenance and farm animals.  It is nice to be able to learn from other team members about farming.  However, by trying to compete with other retailers, they started selling other items that get away from the farm culture and good customer service.  Like all other retailers, the stores are staffed to thin to provide the proper customer service.  This is where the job becomes stressful.  There are many customers who are not patient enough to wait for someone to be free to help them and they just complain.  Most people show their ignorance out in public now a days.  They have no respect for others and the work that they do."
good,Stressful and very competitive towards other businesses want to keep sales high but they do offer good benefits and paid vacation's and pays very well great employees and great management
good,Good place to work.  A lot harder then what i thought it would be but the people are very nice and easy to get a long with.  Just wish the pay was a little more and they where more competitive on wage.
good,The job is kind of demanding and you don't get much of a steadiness but the people are friendly and the pay is a little better than average. I just don't see much advancement opportunities.
good,This is a job where at first the customers can help you learn as much your co workers. But you can learn fast and be willing and able to pick up 65 pound bags of feef
good,I loved working with the staff and customers. It was fun and interesting. I needed a steady job with regular hours. I went back to school to become a dental assistant.
good,"This a good place to start for a part time job, I have learned about farming and the needs of the customers in this area.The management here is really good and strives for the well-being of the customers and figuring out their needs."
good,Worked full time and was a full time student. Management wasn't willing to promote those who were qualified and promoted those who weren't qualified. A lot of different types of people came through the store.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Tractor Supply but at the time I was there, they hired kids in high school or just out of high that didn't work.  They goofed off more than work"
good,"I'd go and check my equipment every day, grab a ticket to pick from rack non-con, then go to the area on an electric pallet jack. Stacking wasn't that hard, but sometimes it took some time."
good,we never have enough staff on hand and they are making budget cuts. because of this we have to do double the work in half of the time and it takes a toll on your body.
good,"For the most part it is a enjoyable place to work, lots of fun energy, most team members are very nice and hardworking. Could definitely use a better choice of management and choice of workers who will actually do so."
good,Full on Belly to Belly retail selling at its best!!!   This is a place that you will learn almost everything their is to know about retail. Great customers and teams within the stores.
good,Have there own niche lite on product width  need bigger buildings  they also need more staff for better customer service . Could work on more agreesive pricing
good,"A typical day at work would be running the register half of the time, answering phones and assisting customers to find items. The other half of the time I would make a list of supplies of feed bags needed, fill feed carts and re stock the floor.  I learned how to handle difficult customers, organizing the store, and helping customers. The management had ups and downs like many do. The workplace was inviting. The hardest part was being in customer service but it wasn't bad. The most enjoyable was helping customers find items and know they got what they needed."
good,"Very fast paced work environment. Customers are fun and love the out here lifestyle. There is a lot of pressure to make sales and get everything done. Sometimes, it is too much for the amount of time we are allowed to work."
good,Work was easy and kept you busy for your whole shift. Straightened your register when you have no customers and shelves close to you where you can still see your register
good,"Great for Students, extra money income, good Management, low turn around rate, excel opportunity, and GURA is a great core value system"
good,A typical day is going to work and i have to stay at the register if people are in the store. I have learned a lot about working with customers face to face and everything to go along with a retail job. The management is alright we are in the process of getting a new manager and its been such a change from the old manager. The hardest part of the job is probably being told we cant confront someone if we know for a fact they are stealing or trying to steal. Most enjoyable part of the job is everyone is friendly and willing to help.
good,"My days revoled around helping customers and restocking the shelf's"
good,The expectations from the management are high yet with a little honest effort they can be obtained.  Single biggest complaint is how work load is distributed across shifts and departments.
good,"Excellent training program, excellent leadership and friendly co-workers."
good,"I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply for the most part. The hours were good, I could always pick up extra shifts if I wanted to and had the time. The wage wasn't the best that I have ever received, although we were paid a commission bonus each month depending on if we met our sales plan for that period. My coworkers were friendly, supportive and always willing to lend a hand if I needed it."
good,"It is always a productive work day, with people who are laid back caring and fun to be around everyday. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to consider this company as part of your family you care and support you and help with whatever issues there may be."
good,"The typical work day included putting product away helping customers find different products or answering questions and checking customers out at the register. I learned to be more patient with people and machines. The management for the most part was good and I liked most of my co-workers, we could have a good time while at work. the hardest part was dealing with changing hours. I enjoyed most of the customers and most of my co-workers."
good,"Warehouse Loader Moved loads for transport. Checked loads against load sheets. Positioned spouts at the correct times. Ran ship loading/unloading equipment. Used equipment for material unloading, moving, stacking, storage. Prevented cross-contamination of materials. Loaded and unloaded trucks. Reported equipment problems. Followed safety, environmental, and operating standards. Kept unloading areas clean. Hold valid Class C driver's license. Can lift more than 75 lbs."
good,It was a great place to start out with as a first job. I enjoyed working there and loved my co-workers. I just wouldn't want this as a career.
good,Wonderful Co workers and a chance to build strong relationships with customers. I do not like having to work random hours on random days of the week. That could be solved with better scheduling by the store manager. I do not feel that I am getting paid enough for the responsibility that I have and all the hard physical labor that occurs through out an entire work day.
good,"I enjoyed my time at TSC and wish I could still be there.  I was able to help establish and grow a new branch of the supply chain operations in regional cross dock(fast freight) feed facilities as the initial manager who tested the Beta operation."
good,"a typical day includes receiving and customer service"
good,Everybody that I worked with was very helpful and nice. good paying and wonderful working environment. I enjoyed working with the clothes and helping customers find what they were looking for.
good,"love the environment, and my customers and co-workers are great!"
good,"A typical day was cashing people out, carrying 50-70 pounds worth of merchandise, helping people to and from their vehicles with their merchandise. I learned a lot about customer service. My management was good, the manager tried to be too friendly most of the time. I got along with most of my co workers. The hardest part of the job was picking up items more than 70 pounds. The most enjoyable was the animals and people that came in everyday."
good,Stock feed areas and rotate feed bags. unloaded skids from trucks. Learned that company sales more stuff than I knew about. Management was easy to get along with and always had a good attitude. Co-workers were easy to work with. Hardest part of the day was getting truck skids in order. Enjoyed helping customers find things they needed.
good,"Helping customers find materials/tools "
good,Not a bad place to work.Be ready to be physically involved with freight and such even as a managerCustomers are of a better behaved class than some retail establishments..
good,"Working in customer service everyday will have its pros and cons, but having high returning customer basis makes it very enjoyable and you get to know your clientele."
good,TSC was a good place to work. They made it a fun place to work. Management drove a positive culture. They believed in alot of cross training and promoting within.
good,People are super nice. Good paid days off. Management will listen to you.
good,"its a job in retail. nothing more needs to be said. its the same every where,"
good,"There is always something to do, you are always busy which is good if you like to keep moving. Management is excellent, it is a great environment."
good,"I do like my job, I just need a day time job my kid are getting older and I am missing a bunch with my children"
good,"if you are a zealous individual who is drive and capable of becoming a jack-of-all trades then this job is for you.  Every day is a new challenge to be better than you were before.  Currently at the store I work at my boss is amazing, and really down to earth."
good,"Easy work. Boring sometimes and other times crazy."
good,"Production rating is to high in all departments that have production standards. They do not factor a lot  of cons into the numbers. Such as, having to help others get pallets, clean up behind others, periods when you are doing other things. So much....."
good,"I understudy management, fastest way to advance. In a typical day, at at least in my store you're bouncing all over the place. From cash register to service desk to feed to recovery... you name it you do it. Hardest part tends to be lack of communication from management down to the team members. No matter what you do, ensuring the customer is always on top of the newest and most up-to-date knowledge available is rewarding in it's own. Especially when you get teens who are learning, either following the parents or learning something that's a necessity in farming or the like. It's like being a teacher. Only your teaching people differences in product and recommending the best for what they need. DOWNSIDE: Yeah, I'll not go there. The job itself is rewarding, it's the fact that it's retail. Anyone who's worked retail knows what I mean."
good,Great corporate culture with a focus on the experts in our stores.
good,A typical day at work is usually extremely busy depending on time of year. I've learned and  gained alot of experience with working a sap scanner and being  involved with working with the IC team.I enjoy the management team when they are actually around longer than a couple of weeks. The Tractor Supply Company has  a high turn over rate. Which in some cases make it hard to follow the rules and do the right thing. I say this because when you have different managers coming and going the rules are not always implied and taken as serious as it should be. I enjoyed working for TSC because my work family was amazing and we became really clolse. They will be missed dearly it's nothing like good people  who care about you and show it daily.
good,"Awesome co-workers, learned a lot each day. The most enjoyable part was seeing the animals and meeting the pet owners when they come in. If you work in the front of the store, it is very sales-driven."
good,"This job was very fun,the people i worked with were nice and the late night hours on stock days were fun as well."
good,For a student it was a good job. Management helped with problems and provided solutions. I learned alot about farming and the customer base was good. Many regulars that I knew by name. Recommended
good,Good place to work. Having a out going personality is best. Hours aren't great but part time jobs are that way. The worst part of the job is pushing credit cards they really want you to push them all the time
good,"Daily tasks vary depending on the seasons and corporate decisions. Often, one is responsible for stocking, signing, cleaning, and creating product displays. As well, employees are expected to keep the customer as their primary focus to drive the sales initiative of private label credit cards and product protection plans."
good,Retail work for people who live the rural life. Learned many products about life on the farm. Work can be busy and makes the day fly by. My first retail job and do enjoy it.
good,Good co to be involved with  good recipes to follow and be successful need to locate better quality managers and district managers  enjoyed working with the proper interpretation of goals and expectations due to companies
good,Excellent company but lacking on competitive salary scale. Bonus opportunity yearly. Must be flexible on working hours and days. Must be strong in financial knowledge
good,I enjoyed working at TSC and would recommend the job to anyone looking for a good job. The only reason I stopped working there is because of the manger.
good,"Tractor Supply Co has its benefits, as well as it's downsides, as any company. However, I feel that if you are interested and are willing to learn then Tractor Supply could be a good fit for you. There is a lot of manual labor and hard work involved in this job, but if you appreciate the reward of doing a job well then you will do well here."
good,"Tractor supply is  a great place to work.  If you're full time the benefits are good and the copay for blue Cross is manageable.  The shifts for full time are all across the board.  Plan on opening, mid shift and closing shifts in the same week."
good,Good fast-paced retail environment. In charge of hiring and training new and seasoned employees. Not much control over starting salary of new employees. Much responsibility for all store operation processes and procedures.
good,Tractor Supply is a great option for those looking for a solid job with good benefits.  Pay could be higher but the discounts help. Opportunities for advancement if one is inclined
good,"Very good place to work I loved it,they started changing their managers and I didn't agree with a lot of the new products were going with lower grade products for more profit,I finally quit could know my sell low grade products.That was my only problem,that's the only negative thing I had the 7 years I worked for them"
good,Everyone has always been really nice to me working with tractor supply. It seems the higher up you are in the company the more work you have ahead of you.
good,Decent bonus monthly if make plan. Room for advancement. As a team mamber you learn all aspects of store insyead of just one role. Flexible hours for those who are in school.
good,"There aren't enough staff there to answer phones, load customers purchases, stock the enormous amount of stock arriving weekly and still provide excellent customer service."
good,"Tractor Supply was my first job and I really loved it. The managers were great and very reasonable with scheduling. The customers are awesome most of the time and the work environment is fun. There isn't a whole lot of benefits and they don't pay their employees as much as they should for the work they do, but overall a good job"
good,My role had lots of responsibilities side front an backyard plus price changes for all inventory negative on hand inspections pump propane ext takes 45 days to learn my old job
good,"Good hours, and a lot of good people to work with. A little hectic with overtime. However I did feel as though there was a good amount of options for shifts."
good,Working there is great. More advancement opportunities need to be available though. Relaxed environment and focused on sales and presentation. With the right kind of people working it's a great job.
good,Overall I liked this job. My biggest disappointment was that there wasn’t any positions available where and when I needed to move. Store manager was amazing.
good,I like merchanding and there was not enough of that at Tractor supply. Everything was done by planogram. I like doing my own merchandise set ups. Other than that it was ok
good,While working at tractor supply I have met some incredible people whether it be my co-workers or amazing customers that come in. I love working here I just wish the pay was better.
good,"Your co-workers are almost always guaranteed to make every shift go by a little faster, whether it's by helping you out if they've finished their own duties, or some small passing conversation.  It's easy to get to know regular customers and help build lasting relationships as well."
good,It can be a fun place. I just believe no matter how long you been there you shouldn't be  Unsuspected  to do more work than new members when they get paid more.
good,"TSC is actually a fun, quick pace and ""down to earth"" place to work.  The hours are a bit hard with a family, especially on weekends and holidays."
good,I loved working at Tractor Supply. Coming from a farming background I could put my knowledge to use to customers who needed help. The customers were always nice and they made the day go by faster.
good,I was the store manager for this company. It was a mandatory 52 hours a week. It was very fast paced in retail and very physical job. I was lifting 50 pounds or more every day throughout the day.
good,During my 5 years here I can honestly say it has had its ups and it’s downs. When I first started here I had no intentions of leaving until I graduated college but recently I feel like I’ve done all I can do for this company with no interest to advance within the company.
good,"I enjoyed working there, the team I worked with was very friendly and did everything they need to do on time. The manager is very understanding about needing time off."
good,"A typical day at work stock freight,customer service,counter sales,housekeeping,scan freight,inventory control,merchandiser some forklift and pallet jack experience"
good,"Always something to do so time goes by quickly, friendly working environment and 15% discount for employees. Also customers bring their pets in sometimes and it's always fun to see how they react to the different smells and pet toys."
good,"Really nice people, decent atmosphere. Work was hard, but it paid alright. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless you're motivated to go places. Decent place."
good,Good company to work for with some opportunities for advancement if you are willing to relocate..the pay needs to be a little more competitive. It is also a very physical job.
good,Working with customers who are hard working and always looking or solutions to keep their farm or home in great shape. Always satisfying in meeting customers who become like family each and everyday
good,"I loved my time at Tractor Supply , truly miss my employees and customers , with having deep connections with the community was very rewarding.  I gained extensive knowledge from a former District Manager"
good,Work day is always pretty well outline for the employee. The job isn't to demanding but over a year working there I never received a pay raise or advancement. For that reason I don't feel like the good outweighs it cause we all work for finiacial reasons.
good,"Tractor Supply could be a fun place to work the first manager I worked for was very good, once she moved to a different store the new manger wasn't good at all. She woudl pick fights with assocaites and basically didn't know how to be a Store Mananger. The key holders were great to work for when they were acting managers, both knew how to manage people and they made it a very fun place to work."
good,Tractor supply is a large company that offers good benefits and a 401  continues to let us be financially stable.It is a very demanding job turn over is high due to a lot of employees going back to school or just bettering themselves. So those of us that are still employed bust our butts with ok pay and no gratification.
good,Good place to work with friendly team members good enviroment and friendly cust omers makes u feel like family nice clean enviroment and not to bad store hours overall good place to work
good,"I loved my job. Fun, friendly (Most of the time) busy at times an sometimes slow. Always new inventory for seasonal iteams that's exciting. Most everyone shows team appreciation an support."
good,Loved working at Tractor Supply except for having to work as part time.  There were no full time jobs available nor career advancement options. I transferred to another Tractor Supply where i was to be a full time employee and the position i transferred for was given to another employee that transfered in after i did due to being demoted from another Tractor Supply store.
good,Overall it is a great work place. You are always busy sometimes you are running places to get something. Some days you are throwing dog food and others you are at the register
good,"It can be a very physical and dirty job, but you will learn all the normal retail processes. The Management is hit or miss depending on what store your at, but overall they do care about their people and the same can be for the culture of the workplace. The hardest part of the job for me was communication between management, but I feel this is a big part of retail jobs in general. I enjoy the physical part of the job and the fact that we allow animals in the store."
good,"Always a challenge, not always in agreement with corporate decisions about management policies but followed them.  Appreciated marketing department and HR support."
good,If you like tossing 50 pound bags of feed as a manager 4 hours a day every day this is the job for you. no policies or procedures were being fallowed properly. thus making it a hazard place to work.
good,The day to day happenings at tractor supply are fun and quick paced. You get to enjoy working with costumers that share the same passions that you have. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a part time job as the pay is not very good and payroll cuts do not allow for enough hours to make ends meet. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is Chick Days. Tractor Supply pre-orders the amount of chicks that they think they will need and you get over run in the smaller stores which makes it hard to care for them properly.
good,"When I worked at Tractor Supply, i worked in the back room, which included a lot of manual labor such as stocking feed and loading things from the yard.  It was not a hard task, but there was a lot to do most of the time.  I just feel like what I was being paid for the amount of labor i was doing was not worth it.  The store was also usually very understaffed during the busiest days/parts of the days."
good,It’s a fun place to work as long as stay productive. Only reason I left it was just a job until I graduated high school and could work full time. Go for it.
good,Fun relaxed atmosphere. Loved dealing with most the customers. Fellow employees nice and respectful. Actual work to be done wasn't that hard of work. Just time consuming
good,"The manager that hired me was fired due to not working his required 50 hour weeks so it was a stressful time with no manager in the store for quite some time. But, the staff is good and the people care about one another."
good,I had to travel to work over 20mins but it was worth the money and travel my car started having trouble towards the end of my time there so i pointed out. I would work there again though. People were mostly nice i had one incident with racism but none with homophobia. Reported to hr and they did what they could to sort it out but put more emphasis on me reporting it than the people who were being problematic...environment was dusty so it affected my asthma for a bit but i acclimated no ac in summer or heat in winter so that sucked.
good,"The main focus of my job was to make sure every customer left with a positive exierience. at Tractor Supply the focus is on providing outstanding customer service, and building relationships with our customers in order to increase return business for the company. There were no typical days: one day you may be unloading feed or setting planagrams, or working the register. the only consitent thing was customers came first. Management was great, it is a fun and fuffiling place to work. The hardest part of the job was setting new seasonal floor plans. the best part of the job was helping my customers find what they needed. I learned so much about different products and how best to sell them. A fun and rewarding job."
good,This is a great place to work to learn about animals and farming.   I learned a lot about farm equipment and learned how to drive a fork lift.  Customers are usually very nice and you have a lot of regulars so there is a lot of friendly faces.
good,Not a bad company to work for everyone got along with everyone but the store manager was terrible always mad about something that would be out of us as team members control
good,"It is slow paced and relaxed but very male favorable environment and no benefits. I had issues with the employment of minors that were not able to fully do their job, promoting drama and the lzainess of other employees."
good,"Tractor Supply has wonderful Values and stands by all of them. As a company, they are wonderful. They are customer service driven and will go out of their way to maintain the 'local business' feel to local farmers. Tractor Supply supports a positive work/life balance and the majority of their managers will back that up creating a feeling of family within the group of team members. Unfortunately, recent management changes have pulled the legendary customer service away from their customer base and divided the team."
good,"Fun to work at would gladly do it again manager is a great guy who always has fun, assistant manager and workers were good, just had a team leader who thought she was god and would write you up under false accusations"
good,The work you do takes more out of you that the company pays. It's a great place to work for learning experiences. As a manager role they don't pay as much as other places pay for a regular past time employee.
good,It was a great company and had great assets but the manager I had was just a drama queen and did nothing but stab you in the back to make herself seem better
good,I knew that several years ago they had some management issues but they got it resolved. They have great training for when you advance. Also have several locations so can advance
good,Things went well. I work for Traktor for a little over 2years. The work wasn't hard they just limited the tanning on other equipment. Managers were friendly and welcomed you as if you where family.
good,TSC is a great company to work for.  The management is like any other place you have the good and bad. But all in all its a great place. Health care is the cheapest bit not the worst on cosr.
good,Friendly work environment. Pleasant workers. Flexible hours. Definitely enjoyed my job and what my requirements were; however I needed full-time to support my family and it was not available still after almost two years.
good,Good place to work very organized and easy environment. Very flexible and understanding. Good training and get everything you need to do to your job right.
good,"I do not have anything to say about working for Tractor Supply. It was a fine company to work for. I was one of the second managers at the Granbury, Texas location."
good,I enjoyed the work environment and management as well as fellow co workers. Management is understanding of life situations that do arise and are willing to work with you as long you provide notice. The only complaint I had was financial compensation.
good,"I had a management role. I was responsible for the store, monies, alarms, and daily operations. Good place to work overall. A lot of micro-management by the district manager."
good,"On a normal day, I get to work, clock in and go to cafeteria to wait for the daily meeting as to where we stand for production for the day. After the meetings we'll get our vocalects (computer that reads us our desired products for each order) and I get to work. I have been at tractor for a little under a year, but while there i have averaged above a 110 percent on my productivity."
good,I like working at TCS the people there are friendly and the job is tough. The staff likes it when we help with the task around the store and try hard to stay active.
good,It's a great job but pay is very very low for all the work. Didn't always get to work everyday like I had wished. But work with great people and my boss was very  generous.
good,Tractor Supply Co. is an excellent place to work. The environment fit my personality and interests but I was not getting enough hours. I was promoted to Receiving Manager soon after I began work.
good,I've been at Tractor Supply for a few months now. It's a great place to work. The people are great and knowledgeable. The job is rewarding.
good,Loved working with the chicks and ducks every spring.  Loved doing stocking on freight day.  You got to meet people from all levels of farming and pet ownership.
good,"I've learned the whole warehouse experience and face pace way of life, not for everyone but a solid full time job. If your into the face pace and making production numbers this job is for you."
good,I love the interaction I have with my customers and being able to help them with their animal questions and about our products. My co-workers are friendly and we have a good time while we work.
good,I enjoyed this learning experience working here! I enjoyed the work load with a lot of different skills needed to perform accurately.
good,"I enjoyed working at tractor supply, because it was a great work environment. Everyone was nice to work with and their management was good. I enjoyed helping others and meeting new people."
good,"Tractor Supply has a great workforce atmosphere. Everyone you meet, from other workers to farmers coming into the store, are very kind. This makes a work day go by quickly when you have customers who appreciate you helping them find a product rather than directing them to a general area. Working here has helped with my customer service skills in order to talking to customers on the phone to face-to-face interactions; whether good or bad."
good,My job was pretty laid back the only thing I had to do was stock shelves and have great customer service skills. I loved the environment I was in everyone I worked with was a Awesome!
good,"Tractor Supply was genuinely the best place I have worked.  All the employees got along with each other, and the benefits were the best I've seen.  I left the company because I simply could not keep up with the fast pace of Tractor's demand."
good,I was given plenty of opportunity to learn and broaden my skill set and also utilize my experience and expertise. I was never bored at this place and enjoyed the work and day to day challenges.
good,"As a member of the tractor staff for almost 8 years, I enjoyed my time with the company. The growth rate concerns me, as does the balance with work and home. Otherwise, I would love to rejoin the staff."
good,"I loved working with TSC. My only downfall to where I worked was the management not willing to work with me on going to school. was going to school full time, but would still schedule me for times I had class, or would switch my schedule without notice and ruined other plans and job opportunities."
good,"help customers finding what they need, my specifiacation, equine questions and products. Stocked feed mainly, also had knowlege of tools etc."
good,"Its a non stop pace. Constant customer service, Change in store all the time, High agenda's, High Goals. Great people to work with. Hardest part is being able to get job requirments done on time due to lack of time given to do them. Have to have high energy to do this job."
good,Fun hands on learning job. Willing to move employees up within the company. Low key. Easy process on picking up on task. Change of pace daily.
good,As long as you get the job done no one will bother you. Management gives you a task to do you complete it they give you another on. Working by myself is great. Co workers do go when they show up.
good,"it is a good place to work at, if they don't have what you are looking for they can special order it for you or direct you to a place that will have it. management is good, a typical work day is moving feed from the back to the store floor, helping customers load feed and other things they have purchased while shopping, cleaning, and the generals"
good,"Good Place to get a head start in your life, great place to work, management can be tricky though. hated unloading trucks outside during the winter can be chilly"
good,Typical day at work is there is always something to do. Always learning . Easy to get along with co-workers . Most enjoyable part of the job is a feeling of accomplishment.
good,working at tractor supply was the best experience ever. I enjoyed the same people as customers on a daily basis.  the feeling of having an answer to a question and actually helping someone is like no other
good,I truly enjoy working for TSC. I love my team and my regular customers! Every day brings different challenges. It is a constantly changing environment in regards to sales and seasonal promotions. TSC is a great place for small farm and/or backyard farmers like myself to work due to the monthly training program that works to train all employees in the basics of everything from welding to animal feeds and health. I feel empowered and heard by my management team and I enjoy training and mentoring my sales floor team. This company rewards hard work. It is very hard work. On a daily basis I get a harder workout than I would at the gym. Hands down my favorite part of my job is my coworkers. It is a family.
good,"Overall i generally enjoy my job as a part time seasonal employee, i do wish that there were more ways to move up in the company, I have been a loyal employee of TSC for four years now and just wish there was some way to advance in the company even though i am not working year round."
good,"The best part about Tractor Supply is my ability to help so many people with small projects they are doing around their house, garden, or workplace. There is always something new to learn and always someone you can teach. Compensation could be more competitive for similar positions in the area."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with tractor supply. The store I was at had some pretty major issues and challenges, and the crew was EXTREMLY slow to accept new people when I arrived, however if they continue on the path I set, and make the right decisions it should improve dramatically soon."
good,Your day is fulled with tasking and customer service. With that comes your win by completing tasks and a happy customer. The best thing at TSC is there mission and values. This keeps a level playlng field for the part-timer to the management.
good,"Tractor Supply Company has great core values for their employees and stand behind their word! We were taught to treat our customers with the utmost respect, and customer service was (and still is) their top priority. There was a variety in day to day tasks and not one day was ever the same. The availability for advancement was present and the management worked with the team as a whole to help us progress."
good,Most enjoyable aspect of job is working directly with the Team Members at the stores and assisting them with their questions and concerns.
good,"Typical day is fun, fast pace, to work. An average day is over before you know it. Always hiring if you want a great place to work this is the place to go....."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work very fast paced place of employment, some days required more physical involvement than others, co workers were wonderful (some not so much but tolerable).  The hours were not the greatest."
good,"Fun place to work, meeting new people daily. My co-workers were the best, made going to work fun. Great management, very uplifting. The hardest part of my job was lifting 50 pound bags of feed. Don't get me wrong, I can do hard work but sometimes 25 bags at a time got the best of this girl. ha ha"
good,"Too may cheifs not enough indians, responsible for receiving all trucks, move merchandise to floor, maintain all outside areas to include stocking merchandising , and signage"
good,Fast paced and always something to do.  Enjoyed be trained in different areas.  I
good,"Fun place to meet up with old friends"
good,Love helping customers needs operated forklifts stacked pallets and freight on trucks and racks in warehouse and stocked merchandise.
good,Wonderful place to work! The customers are very friendly. My co-workers are like family! Hard part is lifting several 50lbs bags of feed repeatedly.
good,"Typical day into work, run register and help all customers with checkout. Took phone calls and helped with special orders. Ordered parts for customers, in person and phone. Loaded and unloaded trucks. Hang up big orders in store where it fits. Help close and open store. I learned how to work a register, and how to open and close properly, I loved my job here. I just loved the store itself. My co-workers were like family. Hardest part about my job, was when I had to quit. I loved helping out the older generations and putting smiles on faces."
good,"management was fun to work with although the main manager wasnt all the time. co-workers were always a blast to work with. I Learned several things while working there, good people skills, sales skills, and life skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. the hardest was having to lift big stock like compressors or furnaces..etc."
good,"Busy at the cash register, answering phones and checking people out. Ok place to work, learned to deal with people and money."
good,Our day started out with stocking all products that needed to be put out on the sales floor. And most importantly take care of all our customers.
good,"Tractor supply is a store where I know a lot about the products we carry because I grew up on a farm, and used tools and worked with animals. I help people with suggestions and even selections, I keep the backroom in check and try to fit everything in when feed and freight trucks come in. Freight is put out on Wednesday mornings and we get started at five and are usually finished by noon. Days can be hot in the summer when there are large load outs on things like fencing or large equipment, the same goes for the cold."
good,"A typical day at work is easy going and fun. have to keep yourself busy though. I've learned a ton of stuff about retail and customer service, how to run a forklift and how to special order things. The management is horrible and very unsteady. My co-workers are great . We have a blast. The hardest part of my job is the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of helping those difficult customers."
good,"Stock, customer service, sales, and work register"
good,I loved this job but sometimes management had a hard time with scheduling.
good,"Arrive at work.  Receive in merchandise as needed, unload truck, stock merchandise(50+ pounds of food), pet food, tractor supplies, welding, tools, clothing, etc.  Management team was not consistent in dealing out responsibilities.  The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy merchandise for long periods of time.  I enjoyed being outdoors at times and working with my hands."
good,It was a great place for me small town store atmosphere good quality products most of my employees I worked wit were really good people the stores are also well kept.
good,"Management sucks in my area! But the job wasnt too bad really. Honestly under paid for being a part of management, but it was better than some jobs offer."
good,"I definitely feel that Tractor Supply was a great company. Employee compensation is quite low considering task requirements. If it weren’t for such an amazing team and leadership, I wouldn’t have stayed for nearly three years."
good,Pay sucks but the people that work there are like family. Everyone helps each other out. Nothing else to write about. Trying to fill space here and I'm done
good,"Overall this is a great place to work if you are starting out in retail or the work force in general. However, the starting pay is above minimum wage, but the rate of raises could be higher."
good,not a bad place to work relaxing a fun night shift is the best time to have fun with employees pizza and other fun stuff at meetings. cool place to work and learn about things while helping people.
good,"Tractor Supply is a good place to work at. They work with you if you need time off. You learn many in mportant skills such as, customer service, time  managment, team building, how to deligate tasks and many more skills."
good,It was a very good place. i like the manangement. I liked the customers that came in and interacting with them. the work wasnt hard but it was still work.
good,Tractor Supply is a good company to work for. My only concerns are with management at the Distribution Centers they can be very favorable to certain employees.
good,Tractor supply is a great place to work. Opportunity to advance with the company is great. Always willing to work with schedules and requests. Monthly online training to keep you refreshed on product knowledge.
good,I enjoyed my job in the Whse shipping recieving position only left because of pay rate. Was told I was at top of payscale. I had no where to advance to within the store or company at the time.
good,"I was a team leader at Tractor supply company for 3 years. I learned many things over the three years. Became propane and forklift certified, helped load bags of equine and animal feed. Managing employees and opening/closing stores. Everyday was filled with customer service, loading feed, managing inventory and money. My favorite part of the job was the environment and customer base that we had at the store."
good,"Responsibilities As Receiver:"
good,"Tractor Supply is a fun place to work.  You are constantly on the move.  It does involve a lot of lifting and being on your feet for hours.  Personally the pay isn't that great for everything you do, but as a part-time job it's due-able."
good,"We have fun at the job, but its because we have such a good group of team members that are able to make it possible. We work well together and its been a good experience for me because now i know what can be accomplished when we work together."
good,"overall great place to work most of my coworkers are great however I was insulted by a manager for asking a simple question. They are very flexable around my school schedule that typically changes every semester.I only have 2 more years left of my schooling. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, however I learned to deal with them in a polite manner and got them what ever it is they needed. I learned a few things about different types of tools. I also learned how to sell and recommend different items in the store to the customers if I know of something else they may need."
good,the job was ok the workers was very mean bad attitudes they pay is not good. the supervisor was not so nice . I wouldn't go back to work there for nothing in the world
good,As my time with tractor supply I have grown as a person and all my skills have grown in general. I love working with the public and helping people and tractor supply has helped with that I don’t know really how to explain but I love it there but the pay they wanna give isn’t enough for what they ask of an individual I believe in being fair to everyone and tsc seems to slack in that area.
good,Fun place to work and great people to work with. A good work ethic is a must. No prior experience needed but definitely a plus. Inside it's hot during the summer months and cold during the winter so you must dress accordingly. Pay is good for the work you are assigned to do.
good,It was my first job so I don't really have bad things to say about it  . It was a great first experience and I appreciated every moment working there.
good,"Tractor Supply has a great Culture and serves the out here customers, farmer, rancher and pet owners. My team managed the setup of all new stores. The team was responsible for setting fixtures, plan-o-gramming, setting point of purchase signage and wall graphics. The setup team assisted the store team with freight flow. This process took 26 days from fixture to soft opening."
good,At first with no PTO accrued I worked close to 3 months straight with no day off making it hard but after that work became slow and steady allowing me to enjoy my job and having fun while at work.
good,"The manager is a great guy and the team members are very helpful. It may be beneficial to have some knowledge about farming supplies and various motor parts, I sometimes had no idea what the customers wanted (which made me feel useless). Sometimes there were not enough team members present. On occasions, the store would have a hand full of customers that needed help and there would only be three people working. A couple of times during the evening shift, (when I was working there), there would only be two members in total working. But I got to learn about different types of dog food and how to handle customers in person and over the phone (plus learned how to use the computer software to look up items within the store)."
good,Tractor supply is not a glamorous job by any means but it is a good part time job will going to school.  I worked part time while going to college and its a pretty laid back job.
good,"A normal workday for a parttime worker was usually about 4-8 hours, involved cashiering, stocking, organizing the stock room and the floor, and working with customers. It could also involve working with animals, answering the phone for anything from product questions to repair advice, and cleaning the various customer accessible rooms. Breaks were mostly limited to a 30-minute lunch for every 6 hours worked. Teamwork is hugely relied upon as many tasks include moving pallets, foods, and supplies and required organization and leadership. Forward thinkers are rewarded with positions of leadership over small groups."
good,"Once you get the policy and procedures down, everything goes smoothly. As a cashier it is easy: greet and wait on customers, make sure all the clothing and front items are marked and stocked properly, refill the coke machines, and clean up as needed. As long as you get your duties completed it is an easy going place."
good,The receiving position is the only position in a tractor supply store that has a set schedule so if that is something important make sure to make a point to apply for that position OR make sure to tell your store manager that you are interested in advancing to that position. TSC does generally hire from within for many in store positions.
good,"Great getting to bond with the customers and their animals, plenty of room to advance in the field. I worked and went to school and they were very understanding when it came to hours."
good,"I really enjoyed this job. It was hard work, but you stayed busy and time flew by. Great coworkers and very flexible hours. I had a great boss and managers."
good,"Cashier, keeping the area well stocked and clean, helping customers to find what they are looking for."
good,"For my typical day, I work between 6 and 7.5 hours with a lunch break. Restocking the shelves and helping set up new planograms are how my days are spent at work. Time flies when you can keep working and not get pulled away for other duties."
good,"Although TSC strives to provide GREAT customer service, that goal is sometimes hindered by payroll limits.  Also training of new hires is sometimes lacking, there are courses that are given via computer, but not much to teach day to day information."
good,"My typical day is very short, around 4 hours, 6 to 10 am, which is doable, and good for keeping me on a schedule. Coworkers are incredibly friendly, easygoing, easy to work with, and are great at giving criticism where it is due."
good,Don't miss work....! And great benefits discounts.  Overtime..  It pays the bills and company lunches from time to time.  Prosocial atmosphere.  And great location.
good,Loved working here! Great working environment and all of my co-workers and I got along wonderfully. They are flexible in their work hours and will work with you
good,"I enjoyed working at a business that sold equipment and products directed towards those that farm, have pets, or live in rural areas. They have nice affordable products and clothes with name brands such as Wrangler, Ariat, John Deere, Carhartt, and etc. They have everything basically you need if you're and equestrian like me. The co-workers were pretty friendly , the work environment was organizes for the most part and my manager did take time to listen to what I had to say. It is best for someone looking for parts time hours unless applying for a full-time position like manager, assistant manager or receiver."
good,"great friendly first job, always met fun interesting people, allowed pets but people would bring strange pets so it was always cool to see pet goats and racoons come through the door."
good,This was a good first job because it was right next to my school and had a relaxed work environment. I cashiered so I could only go so far from the register. My roles were easy.
good,I did not have a problem doing the Job that I was doing. I would actually still be there if I did not end up losing the job. I would actually recommend people to work their if they did not mind tough environments
good,Our store was in a little country town but it was one of the only feed stores so it was always busy. Constantly filling feed on shelves and breaking down pallets in the back.
good,"Working at tractor supply has been great. I work with great people and have a great manager. I would highly recommend for a first job, they are very helpful in teaching you everything you need to know."
good,"I liked working there. the pay was great and my co workers made it fun. I worked overnight so i didn’t really have too much of a social life, but the job was nice enough that i didn’t mind."
good,I give the job a 5 put of 5 it’s a great job. They people that work there try there hardest to make sure you fit in and learn everything thing you need to succeed
good,Fast paced work with a lot heavy lifting and equipment training/use. Good customer service is essential and being able to work as a team is important. Getting to know regular customers is beneficial and can lead to more opportunities of tips and some possible side work.
good,I really enjoyed everyone I worked with. Management was awesome. Always worked with your schedule if something came up. Very relaxed job. I learned a lot from working here great customer service skills and good communication skills.
good,"Was a good place to work, but had little room for advancement. Customers were pleasant majority of the time. Provided training on products that they sold. Trained you on how to do your job not let you figure it out on your own."
good,"I absolutely love working for Tractor Supply! The environment at the store in general is absolutely amazing! The only downside to working for TSC is that they do not pay very well, but it kind of balances out because it is such a pleasant place to work."
good,"Tractor Supply Company was a great place to work, the company was very committed to customer satisfaction and the employees' abilities to reach that satisfaction and every manager I worked with, put in a significant amount of sweat equity therefore setting a great example for their employees and driving them to work hard as well."
good,"There are good stores to work and then there are some that are just terrible. I have work at  one from the best to the worst, and I rate it from how me and my team got along and how well the store functioned while I was there."
good,"It's a busy place, with a lot of different items, from nails and plumbing parts to feed and pet food, to fencing supplies and three point equipment. Sometimes it gets pretty stressful, but the overall atmosphere is actually pretty laid back. If you like country folks for customers, you can make a lot of friends."
good,"TSC has become a under staffed , but still insist that legendary customer service. sad the employee as well as the customers suffer from lack of coverage. too worried bout their share holders, but they open a new store every other week. been with them 10 years have seen drastic changes on what is expected from the employees. I understand that they are running a business and want to take care of the customers. I want to know why they can't understand take care of the Employee and the Employee will take care of the customer. I do not understand HOW, I after going on 10 years of service , the starting pay at the distribution center is 3.00 per hour more that I am making as a shipping receiving manager ."
good,"Help customers with load outs and help them find what is needed in the store. Laid back place to work for the most part good staff to work with, twenty to thirty hours a week typically"
good,Good for just staring out.  The work is easy to do.  Nice atmosphere to be in.  I got to make a lot of friends with my customers.   The pet friendly place is a big plus.  Fur babies are always welcomed.
good,So far my experience has been awesome. I have learned a lot from my customers about farming and taking care of certain types of pets. But what makes it really good: is  that I have a really good team.
good,"Good place to work if you don't have obligations to meet monentarily. Always cutting hours. Hire too many people that are still in school and can only work certain hours. They tout customer service is first but cut back on personnel and customer service goes down. Focus too much on pushing programs like neighborhood members, power plus, credit card applications, etc. Freight days twice a week with never enough help and process has you handling merchandise 2 or 3 times before it hits the shelf. Home office always updating planograms at least 3 or 4 times a year and never give you time to get it done. Instead of promoting from within they like to hire outside the company. Hence no experience in this type of retail. This company is very hands on at all levels in the store. You do it all. From unloading trucks,  stocking, operating a register, filling propane, customer load outs, to cleaning the bathrooms. If you are full time you can receive insurance. Other benefits include a 15% discount on regular priced merchandise,  a bonus if your store makes sales after 90 days of employment."
good,I worked about six years for this company. I would recommend this place to anyone seeking employment. Fast paced environment many this you can learn including some life skills.
good,Tractor Supply Company is a great company to work for. They are really great about giving all employees the opportunity for additional training and advancement.
good,For the team member it is a great place to work. Management can be fun at times. Tractor Supply really handcuffs its management staff when it comes to being able to make independent decisions for their teams. It has gotten better for management over the years but still has some work to do.
good,"I loved working there, I could always be on the move. Stocking feed, wood, etc; the customers were pretty good"
good,It was a very nice place to work the only thing I didn’t like was they got rid of me for a boguis reason I trained about 200 people on how to operate all the power equipment.
good,this place here is fantastic I would highly recommend working here if you want a send relaxed placed work also the customers here are typically happy to be here
good,"Really enjoy working there, most of the customers are great. Then there are some stinkers that think you are their servant. It all works out in the end the great customers far outnumber the stinkers."
good,"Great company to work for! Managed very well, great benefits and fair compensation. Company offers good advancement opportunities, good incentive to stay."
good,It is a very good place to work. The people and management can be a bit stressful. Bit what job isnt? They pay is good and they offer good benefits! Fast paced!
good,"Great environment with great people. Very laid back but, very consistent. Its an easy Job but, teaches you a lot. Most employees  are easy to get along with & are there when you need the help."
good,"Took charge of the entire store operation from open to close, assist in any aspect of the job from receiving, rtv's, loss prevention, people management and customer service.  Hardest part of the job was low labor hours to work with.  If someone called in sick it was the job of the assistant manager and/or store manager to cover those shifts."
good,"I loved the job, amazing management who worked with you and never abused their power. Great work culture and it really felt like a family. The only con for me was the pay"
good,They worked well with my school. I was able to work here and play sports in high school. It was all simple work mostly just picking stuff up and putting it down.
good,"Fast paced environment ,always busy I learned about the farming industry, selling all types of feed for all types of livestock, and the different types of supplies needed to suit the customers needs such as fencing,wood and general supplies that are needed to operate a farm."
good,A typical work day can be very stressful yet rewarding. I seem to either always be on the phone or personally helping a customer through the store. The customers can be the hardest yet most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Tractor Supply is a nice retail outlet to work in. Especially if you have an interest in farming and agriculture. Team Leaders and management are easy to work with. Shifts are variable as with most retail positions. The company has good ethics and policies.
good,It was fun to work in an environment where everyone has a similar lifestyle. I also loved it when customers would bring in their cute pets. It was awesome!
good,"stocking, driving fork truck, open and close store,customer service,heavy lifting,need to know alot about farmming.can bring animals into the store,fun"
good,"slow past, regular customers, lifting included. nice people to work with. they work with your schedule and are flexible with the days you can and can't work."
good,A normal day at tractor supply was a very fast pace invironment. You came in and were working on something until you were scheduled to leave. We all had fun though with this fast pace making the long shifts go by pretty fast. Everyone was helpful and worked as a team.
good,"I learned a lot. My trainer was brilliant. I loved the different ways I got to help our customers from loading with a forklift to recommending other items the customer needed."
good,"TSC had a management problem.  I saw assistant managers yell at customers as well as saw employees yell at customers in front of everyone in the store.  It kept me stressed out I knew those customers were my payday, with out them there is no payday.   most of the people that I worked with are no longer there so it may be an ok place to work now not sure."
good,i would recommend working there to a friend or even myself again keep in mind there is heavy lifting involved on the daily and forklift stratification is recommended
good,"Been with this company for nearly 10 years and have worked for multiple retail locations. The overall atmosphere is great. It can be fun and easy work while working hard. However, it is very hard to be promoted. Benefits are good with great paid vacation and sick time. That's the only reason I have stayed as long as I have. Pay is not that great either thus far. However, the company reaches out and involves employees and has many life changing assistance. They also give bonus, plenty of chance for overtime, and will work to accommodate days requested off or around school/2nd job."
good,A typical day at Tractor Supply was restockment of product. enjoyed serving people. wasn't really a hard job. I really enjoyed the leadership. Aslo acquired leadership skills
good,Labor intensive work.  You must build a good team and you will have a successful business.  Monthly sales bonuses based on performance.  Customer is number one priority.  Results driven business.
good,"Payroll was always bad, never time for extra hours ajd no overtime unless a bunch of people called out, the store is great and the staff is great but the pay wasn't extraordinary"
good,This company stands for good values and has a good balance between work and having a good time. You make a lot of relationships with the workers and reoccurring customers
good,"Everyday is different. The company is quickly expanding in its product line to appeal to new customers. Very fast growing company. We see many of our customers regularly and have good rapport with them. In addition the company sticks with its values of being family oriented on holidays as in they're closed Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Years, and Easter."
good,"I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply until one of my favorite coworkers moved to another store. After that my work days got worse, suddenly working at Tractor Supply just was not the job for me anymore. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and trying to calm them down. The most enjoyable part was when coworkers and I got to laugh and talk to each other during the slow business days. I learned to get along with every type of person that walked into the store."
good,"Great first job to work through college. Great place to easily get management experience with room to move up in company, pay is just really lacking."
good,Good work environment. Friendly and laid back atmosphere. Good opportunity to move up as long as u are doing your job duties and showing a positive attitude.
good,I loved working there for as long as I did. They were very understanding and easy to work with. I did a lot of transactions and phone answering along with a lot of customer service.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers, running the cash register, rotating feed, stocking shelves, and going through the clothing department. A typical day will always vary depending on if your a cashier or a sales floor associate that day."
good,"Tractor Supply was a good first job, the only downside is that you are only part time and the only way you can make full time is by waiting several years."
good,Tractor Supply is a good place to work with a great culture. I have worked there for 6 years and everyday is something new with customers. I would recommend Tractor Supply to anyone.
good,"It was a fun and fast paced work environment, you learn a lot about farming and old tricks farmers use in place of certain things for equipment or farming and you can use it to help other customers. Management was good just had a few things that I had ideas for and they never were input for discussion on helping the store, that being said management has changed since I left, co workers were fun and made the place a good place to work."
good,I have learned a great deal with this company and advanced into many positions. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know our customers and being able to provide what they needed. I liked that I came in and was able to get started without needing direction.
good,Overall TSC is a great company with a bright future! I love working there but it is time to find something a little different.  I have worked retail for 17 years and I'm ready for a change of pace.
good,"Very friendly group of employees. Easy work, but there is always something to do. Hard to find yourself sitting around. This would be a good first job."
good,easy to learn skills to do any job in store and some opportunities for advancement.  Good work environment as far as fellow employee morale and want to be there.
good,"Nice company to work for. Would work there again. Have lots of equipment for  land owners, and animal lovers. Fast pace place to work."
good,"I am grateful for the doors this company opened and the opportunities offered to me. Though they quote balance in their code of conduct, there is little balance between work and private life."
good,"Good place to work, great co workers. Good hours, decent pay. Not a lot room for advancement.Benefits not that great. Would go back if I had the chance."
good,"Typically you deal with customer service and making sure products reach the shelf. I learned a lot about animal health, vaccines, and farm equipment. Management work hard to recognize hard work and the company offers discounts for employees. I loved my co-workers and everyone works as a team. The hardest part of the job is learning about all the products, their functions, and their placements. The best part of the job is the wonderful people you work with and customers you meet. But the discounts don't hurt!"
good,"Typical day at Tractor Supply was first customer service, making sure all planograms were completed checked off computer. Feed was filled . Freight was put out. Special orders placed.Receiving was checked in and put out. Paper work complete and filed."
good,"Most days can be stressful and demand a lot of hard work, never a set schedule which makes it hard to plan events or attend anything going on."
good,Love my job and enjoyed atmosphere. Enjoyed customer challenges and wanted to make a great shopping experience for my customers a good one. Was happy to make a great day in sales while I worked there. Love to challenge the younger workers for item of the month sales  and I made it often that gave me a very satisfying experience.
good,I've worked at Tractor Supply since August of 2015. The staff was very helpful when training and correcting me. The customers are some of the most down to earth and genuine people I've had the chance to meet. The only issue is the scheduling. I'd rather have a set schedule. The varying hours day to day and week to week is not for everyone.
good,Recieve area for order picking and start filling boxes or pallets with merchendice and a very fast pace and very accurtily. Learned how to use a automated voice system that told you what items to pick for the order and where to send them and label for shipping. Managers were help full and would actually do short orders when availiable. Everyone was very help full when need be but was mainly working alone. At first it was difficult to learn the automated system. After you get the job down smoothly it was pretty easy work and some days when all orders were done we could take longer breaks.
good,Tractor supply is a great place for anyone that wants too get a little hands on while managing a team of hard working individuals.  The company stands by their culture and make sure that everyone else is living it everyday.
good,"Working at TSC has been a educating experience. With time and determination you can learn a lot about the company, it's products, and the customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult customers but the most enjoyable part is when you can help someone and they are grateful."
good,"Great people,easy job but sometimes had to do other people work. Didn't really like my shift because when I get off its nighttime."
good,"Great place to work for, I work part time at TSC while working a construction company part-time as well. Very willing to work around my schedule"
good,"Even though I never got to see the animals I was helping by providing my knowledge to customer about feed, medication, and harnesses I enjoyed my customers telling me stories about how I helped them make their animals happy and healthier."
good,Being a receiver is a very hectic. The fast pace is fun for those who like a challenge. The company benefits for full time employees are also a plus.
good,"Easy-going, professional environment. Physically demanding at times. Growth and advancement potential is possible for those willing to relocate. It appears that many relocation areas are considered rural. The company as a whole is growing, therefore employment needs are high. Wages are low, not liveable, for both team members and leads. Mid-management and beyond are reasonable salary positions."
good,Everything was good because i live on a farm and knew everything coming in. They didn't have to train me for only 2 hrs to show me how things work down there
good,"Great people, work isn't hard, pay isn't great.  Good job for honest people who have farm/rural know-how.  Hardest part of the job is some of the customers you get that aren't friendly at all.  Best part is probably the discounts!"
good,The people are friendly.  It felt more like a family with the people I worked with. Helping customers that came to Tractor Supply were most of the time a joy.  I would return to work there if I could wish I never left.
good,"was a good place to work for, management was awesome and worked with you. it could be long days according to your route, but the more you push the products the more you would make. always had work because people need bread products. usually 7 days a week unless you have it figured out what you use on the off days and a very nice way of making good money"
good,"Opened store at 7am, took deposits to bank, came back counted cash drawer for daily operations.work cah register until day cashier arrived..I unloaded fright trucks, I assembled merchandise, I delivered merchandise if needed, as well as went to other stores to pick up store transfers. I inventoried everything coming in or out of store."
good,I oversaw the day to day operations of a farm/ranch supply store.  The management was very helpful and educational.  My co-workers and I worked on the same page and for the same goal.  I enjoyed most helping the customers and smashing sales goals.
good,Typical day starts with customer service.  A lot of people come in and want to know if we had something they needed.  Good co-workers to work with.  Not very great on Management. This job is a great way to stay in shape.  Constantly lifting and carrying items from 50-100lbs.
good,"I worked in the Shipping Department of the Distribution center. I was responsible for loading"
good,"handling money from and to customers"
good,"Overall great company to work for, the reason I left is because I relocated to Georgia.  I worked with great people and great managers who had ""team player"" attitudes.  I learned a lot about warehouse environment and what it takes to make it all work.  The hardest part of my job was probably not knowing what I would walk in to every day.  As variance clerk I was responsible for making sure that any merchandise issues were resolved before they were put into our inventory and handled in a timely manner, which could be very challenging.  With that being said, I love challenges, it gave me an opportunity to learn and grow as an employee.  "
good,"As a team leader, it was lots of responsibility and very little pay. Not enough employees on floor during peek hours. Loved dealing with customers. Good variety of inventory."
good,"Working with the people and customers was amazing. I enjoyed having the same intrests in common with everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was in the spring when the rabbits, ducks and chicks come in."
good,I learned alot about the back room and gained customer service skills. I also learned alot about the machines and assembly. Overall I enjoyed my job.
good,"Low pressure job, talked to many new people, pretty easy going yet still professional. Pay was minimum wage and they worked around my school schedule. I would work there again."
good,I enjoyed working for this company because it is people friendly. They always took care of their customers. They are very easy going and friendly. Management is awesome
good,Great company to work for with flexible hours for college students. Customer service is key to success in this job. It can be difficult identifying products if you do not have an agricultural background.
good,"Good company great benefit"
good,"Positive atmosphere, Good money, Team work, Safety first, Good benefits, Flexibility, Growth, Family environment, helping the community, Flexible hours,"
good,"I enjoyed my time for the most part.  My co-workers were great, with one distinct exception.  During my interview, I specifically very clearly stated that I did not want to be cashier.  I wanted to be trained in all elements of the floor.  I was excited because I was on the list to learn how to operate a fork lift.  After the first week of training, it was clear that there was never any intention to put me anywhere but on register.  After 4 months, one of my younger but more senior employees refused to give me a bathroom break for the 3rd or so time.  That was my last day I reported to work."
good,"Work there was often what you would expect for working a retail job, busy some days and slow others, as well as certain times of the day being busy. I learned a lot about how to multitask, between running the register, customer service, and helping with loading out products that are in particular large or difficult for the customer to do by themselves. Really good place to work, honesty very relaxed place and good people. Hardest part of the job would probably be all of the lifting you have to do but as long as you take good care of yourself it honestly isn't that bad. The most enjoyable part of my job there was not only was it good environment but the people who came into the store, our customer base is just honest to everything good people."
good,Overall it’s a great company to work for with good benefits. Always opportunity for advancement within. A coworker of mine lost everything in a house fire and the company gave him money to help him get back on his feet in a time of need.
good,There is a saying that everyone should have to be either a waiter/waitress or work in retail at least one time in their life. I strongly agree with that since you get to learn about the public. The main perks about my retail job though is I get to work feed and I usually see a dog/puppy everyday.
good,"not a bad start off job, fun and motivated place to work. there is room for improvement as far as pay and insurance goes, mostly hire part time workers and do not get benefits until full time, very hard to get full time."
good,"Tractor supply is a friendly, fun, productive place to work. They understand that life happens and family is a priority in most peoples lives. Working for this company was a breeze.Training was successful and very understandable. The employer made sure that every employee was equipped and ready everyday before work."
good,Love the company and how the treated the staff. Also gave us bonuses as well as fed us to acknowledge our hard work. I would refer working there to anyone
good,Lots of opportunity for advancement.   Good employee based company.  Pay is decent for retail.  Nice work life balance.  Average of 52 hours a week over the year so some weeks less and some weeks more.  You manage it yourself.  Really a fun place to work.
good,Everyone is really nice and always willing to lend a helping hand. The customers are friendly and understand when things get busy. The atmosphere is normally laid back.
good,"Good company to work for with the right management, been working with them for several years and thoroughly enjoy working for the company, this is largely due to the management that i work with being actual enjoyable people who lead by example instead of dictate."
good,"Work on daily is enjoyable. However, there are some stressful days but that comes with any job. The management is really great. There is always something different every day which you really never know on certains what you are walking into."
good,"Company has mission & values statement that they try to follow. As with many other companies, over time as original managers retire or move on, replacements come in. Their take on mission and values are not always in line with how they were originally intented."
good,"Great People, Customers, Management. Truly a wonderful place to work and a great career for an individual. Its very fast paced and a typical day in the out here life is very rewarding and challenging. Its different everyday and requires a strong back and healthy lifestyle."
good,There was good people to work with. You had to be willing to adapt to varying hours/days of work. Could be busy or slow. It helps you to work on your people skills.
good,"While working for this company was very labor intensive, my co-workers and the management made the job feel like home. My schedule was also fairly negotiable, so balancing the job with school was not as stressful."
good,Pay differential between team lead and team members is nominal for a lot more responsibility . For this reason advancement is not recommended. It would be nice to be paid a living wage for management positions!
good,"A typical day at work here is composed of facing products on shelves all through the day, helping customers choose appropriate products and help those that need assistance with heavy items like bags of feed and heavy farm equipment. 30 min lunch break with 2 15 min breaks. management is pretty good about adjusting hours to work with your life plans be it school or another job even."
good,"I had a good time working for this company. The vibes are always good, there’s hardly ever any bad days. They have thought me a lot on how to work and have gave me a lot of great skills I didn’t have before."
good,It requires a lot of hard work and dedication. It’s a great company to work for. They are fair during the interview process as well. Anyone can apply and be hired.
good,"Good work environment for those that work there. Breaks are short, but well needed. Working in a hot warehouse, but you know what is expected of you for each shift."
good,management was good in the beginning then went down hill good employees and fun to work there typical day included stocking feed and pulling stock forward on shelves
good,"Tractor supply is a fun hardworking environment meant for those who like to work retail/physical labor jobs. The customers can be the most challenging part, but if you take your time and maintain full respect throughout a conversation, everything will be just fine."
good,"in my role I unloaded freight trucks with a fork lift, loaded customers orders if need be. worked freight did price changes kept the outside yard stocked, learned how to drive a forlift"
good,"I enjoyed working there lots to learn and teach people, great coworkers and a very calm but fast based work environment. Helped alot of people and set the up for success in there projects."
good,"The people are amazing to work with, only thing is that we ask for more hours and our manager hires another cashier so we lose more hours than before."
good,Was a great place to work and i honestly had lots of fun tsc has a great pay and good benfits imo if anyone is looking to work part time or even full time i would apply
good,"Friendly, professional atmosphere. Management ensured Team Members performed all available tasks, not just keeping them on one task, therefore keeping the job interesting day to day."
good,"Tractor Supply Co taught me great customer service, also how to work fast and get the job done. Also. it taught me how to work and handle cash and give the exact change."
good,"Compared to all the retailers I have worked for, this one was the better of them."
good,"I've only worked at Tractor Supply for a short time but I enjoy the work. Everyone has been very nice and very helpful so far. The pay isn't good but I needed to supplement my social security so I took the job. Unfortunately, I have to work 2 part time jobs since the pay is so low. Being there only 5 hours isn't long but it would be nice if someone could at least offer you a 5 minute bathroom break after a few hours. Sometimes I feel like it is an imposition to ask for a quick bathroom break."
good,"I loved working for this company, until the new manager came in. I loved going to work every day but when he came in everything changed. Pay was decent but you were payed every 2 weeks so that made some things challenging. Overall a good company to work for."
good,Most people are very helpful and friendly.  The work can be fast paced.  Management gives proper training and then gives you space to perform your duties.
good,good place to work for someone who wants a part time job on the side or who needs money while in college or a senior in highschool. Flexible hours for people who have school and great environment to work with.
good,As a team member you bring your abilities but are also taught new skills.  Occasional opportunities for advancement.  Scheduling changes frequently for part time employees.
good,"It was a good place to work when I was in college the hours were flexible as long as you gave prior notice,pay was decent for part time in my opinion. Manager had some high expectations but overall great manager and person"
good,It is a good place to work if you know anything about what they have to sell. The best thing is most of the customers are fun to talk to and cut up with
good,"Tractor supply is a good place to work, a typical day for me was going in and getting my ticket and then starting my day on the pacer and filling my orders through the headset."
good,"It was a great place to work but I needed more pay so I went back to school but while I was working at tractor supply I learned quite a bit of things when it can to different animals and different types of dog food, lawn care and pet care"
good,I joined tractor supply at the behest of cedar ridge in order to see what it was like and to see if I would like to work there until I can find a job that suits my interest. It was a fine job and I got plenty of experience from it.
good,"You come in count the safe, and drawers. Then run the deposit to the bank. Do the morning openng chores before the store opens. Then throughout the day there are various tasks you need to complete. TSC is a fun company to work for if you don't expect things to be done the same way everytime. You need to go with the flow and you'll enjoy your time."
good,If you have the right coworkers the job is enjoyable. You can make good connections with repeat customers and help make their time in the store more enjoyable as well.
good,Tractor supply was a fun job. I really enjoyed talking with and helping the customers who came in the store. The managers were very nice and always lead by example.
good,"Worked at a Tractor Supply that in my opinion was under staffed for what was expected, had an amazing manger though who always worked with me on days I needed off and hours I could work and is an extremely hard working manager."
good,"hours vary"
good,I loved my time at tractor supply it was a fun job and eight hours never really felt like 8 hours. There was always things to do and for the most part the management was good. Great customers and great people working with you.
good,"The pay and hours aren't great, but the coworkers and management are friendly. Easy job overall. The customers are also very friendly most of the time."
good,"The employees can be a fun group to work with - but they also know when it is time to get work done, they get it done. As with every company, there are those few who will complain, but for the most part, they are good people."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy the out here life style. You will learn a lot from animals to mechanics... All sorts of useful life skills can be acquired while working for Tractor Supply CO.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Tractor Supply because I am passionate about animals and all things farming, so it was easy to help people and feel successful when showing up to work and doing my best. The culture was fun without being excessively fun to the point where I didn't want to work, but it was overall a really great time."
good,"The company itself changes it's layout of the floor plan often. This is indicitive of it's semi aggressive sales perogative, they offer a monthly bonus if sales exceed expectation based on a prediction. It expects the workers to do the work they are paid for and to get rewarded for outstanding achievement."
good,Fun and amazing place if you love customer service. You grow attached to your customers and enjoy being around members. It is also fun to do your job at your own pace.
good,"Good life balance, friendly,  good benefits and discounts, opportunities for advancement, great manager! Training provided. Excellent work atmosphere!"
good,"i work with many different things, such as tools, animal food, animal shots, clothes, many different things. this job was a good job to have as a first job."
good,I like working at tractor supply because the work isn't entirely difficult and it works well with my life style and having a child. I would recommend it
good,"Good store manager, but the upper management including the district manager and regional manager operated on fly of the night operational procedures. Overall good company."
good,"At Tractor Supply I did things like stocking,front facing, janitorial. I enjoyed this when I first started working here,but as time went on it started to become boring."
good,This was my first job. It worked well around my school schedule and it wasn't too taxing. Its definitely a good starter job with available advancement if you want.
good,"The company tries to treat you right but the work is just too hard on your body, especially if you're older. I've seen plenty of people get hurt working here and I have also been hurt here."
good,"Management has scheduled items for employees made out when you come in so you know where and what you are doing.  Small staff, so you do various things to keep things fresh and work doing different tasks."
good,"It’s a great place to work a real relaxed atmosphere. Also the people are great it’s just an all around great store. If it were full time I’m sure I’d love it because they are always there to help ,"
good,"good management, well cleaned workplace. Well organized stock area and well maintained backroom and organized shelves on sales floor.Co-workers are decent with eachother."
good,"You will be given the chance to learn about everything from fencing to taking care of animals. As long as your willing to learn. Also, there are chances to learn how to operate a forklift, and leadership skills."
good,It was a fun job to work at. Sometimes the hours were long and can get tiring standing all day on the concrete floor but wear good shoes with good support and you won't have a problem. My manager was amazing and if I ever had to leave because I wasn't feeling well or had a family emergency they were understanding.
good,Tractor is a clean and fun place to work i enjoyed working with other team members safety is at the top of there list before all else . There fast pace environment made working so much more enjoyable .
good,"the first few days i was their i was treated like everyone one else like i was family. everyday was basically the same it was always stocking cleaning or i was on the cash register. they had really good management when i was working their, nothing really to complain about."
good,"the costumers are the best ever. "
good,Tractor Supply is a great company to work for. They can be strict but the hours and the pay are competitive. I worked 3 12 hour days which was great so that I had the other 4 days with my family.
good,"Tractor Supply is very family like. Everybody is treated very well and treated like family. This is a good job for somebody who is into this style of work and understands ""farm life"" and farm lingo. Hardest part of the job is probably learning where everything is at in the store. Most Enjoyable part of the job would be the friendly people you work with."
good,"had this job while i was in highschool, was a fun job they didn't just stick you in one department you work all of them once a week but at the same time you and your department that you specialized in"
good,A typical day at work consisted of picking stock off of shelves and loading it on a skid then taking it to the loading zone. The workplace culture was fast paced.
good,This job was easy. The only thing hard about it is the lifting. Management was easy to deal with. The customers were great. It was close to home. Thanks
good,"This is a great starter job and got me the gas money i needed, but it's time to go full time or part-time with better pay. Compensation is a little low for all that I do, but it is retail."
good,"Running freight and helping customers."
good,great people and management was always helpful if you had any issues or problems. yes we had to keep up our load rate to 170 packages an hour but once you get the hang of the job its really easy to meet them numbers.
good,Love the people I work with they work great crew Dallas Georgia they'll let us bow was great as always with customers and customers love this was a great place to be I wish I didn't have to leave
good,I was a full time student and the only problem I had there was that they also worked me full time also. They did not work with me on fixing my hours. It was a hard juggle
good,not a bad place to work.  good people good company.  Lot's of hours and heaving lifting.  Early morning shifts and they close for the holidays.  Full time
good,"I help open a store and it was a good place to work and the customer were great. It was hard to leave this place because it was like a family, from managament to the cashiers."
good,"Fun Work Place. Built around ""family like atmosphere"" a very physically demanding job. The company runs as if it were still a small box mom and pop retailer yet offers many benefits of big box chains. The company as a whole is currently experiencing exponential growth and it reflects in the vast array of available benefits."
good,It was very easy to learn and pick up and was flexible with my schedule. It was a very low stress job. It is an ideal job for anyone looking for a first job.
good,"Working as a cashier greeting customers, checking them out, answering phones. On the floor helping and answering questions, stocking shelves as the needed it. Unloading trucks and putting up stock."
good,Good job learn I got most of my forklift driving experience from this place good work environment an I would recommend this job to someone if they were looking for a job
good,"It was fun and productive. I learned a lot about stocking, and receiving inventory. The management was great."
good,"as it is a good place here, I this just isn't my style of work, as i am heavily into technology. I felt very comfortable with my co-workers, and i loved the customers!"
good,"The job was easy and the management was great, always looking to help you improve. The hours were ok as kong as you had the availability. Customerd where nice and polite"
good,"This was an upbeat face paced place to work. Great customers and lots of workload to stay and keep busy. Management is good and trying to turn the store around for the better. Some things that they could work on is hiring more people so we are not always short staffed and be aware of in and out times, because a majority of the time we were busy or too much unfinished work that you would not get off at your scheduled time. Other than that if I didn't move I would still be working there."
good,"Great company to work for. It was a second job for me, but they became my family and real close friends. It was fast paced, and heavy lifting work, but it kept us busy and we got the job done."
good,"good management hardest part of job loading 300 fence posts"
good,the workplace is very relaxed and the co workers are all friendly with one another which make this a great place for someone to get a second job or a relaxed style job
good,My review is this was a great organization to work for. The work environment was friendly and people always willing to help. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,"Working for tractor supply company is a rewarding experience with many benefits, including health coverage, dental, eye care, as well as 401k and stock options."
good,Tractor Supply is a great job very relaxed and calm environment. Typical day was usually fast paced work because i had to meet a ceertain quota. I learned that you cant always work at the same pace sometimes you have to step it up a little. The hardest part of the job was actually staying up because i worked the night shift.
good,its ok if you dont have to make a living at it but I had a family and bills and was not making enough money so I had no choose but to leave but I did meet some great people
good,was a good job i enjoyed working with the local farmers and etc. boring on weekdays and weekends it was a good busy and enjoyed it more. would like to work for this company again.
good,Had a good working relationship with all the associates and most of the management staff. This company values family and works to be able to help employess with work life balance
good,"This is an enjoyable place to work. I enjoyed working with the employees and the managers very much, they were always there in case you ever needed them for a question or if a problem arose."
good,"come in start by doing daily paper work"
good,Would have stayed with Tractor but we relocated.  Like helping customers with their animal supplies.  Hearing the different stories.  Decent hours and a nice discount of supplies.
good,Tractor supply is a caring company with many incentives and scholarships. It's a great place to work for with many opportunities for advancements and raises.
good,TSC is a great place to work! They have great benefits and good team relations. The work is very physical and fast paced. If you like to work hard and have fun this is a great place fore you.
good,It is a growing company.  I just feel stuck in a store I don't fit with. But overall I like the company. Lots of training and information shared to help you learn.
good,"The tractor supply that I worked at was very slow with customers most hours, of course like any store there are rushes which are usually handled with quite an ease. but occasionally I did run two registers (they are right next to each other) to keep the line moving as fast as possible or at least till some one else came to help. When something is asked of me I do my very best to get it done as well as done close to perfect as possible."
good,"Tractor Supply has really helped me understand more about the farm life. Being a team lead has taught me how management really works. Finally understand what it really means to be an adult. I'm always on time, I'm the first one in and last one to leave after the job is finished. Knowing when to send my staff on lunch, understand overrides, money transferred, organization, opening and closing (holding keys) and so much more!"
good,"I typically work 10 hours on weekends but sometimes work 5 hours during the week. What I've learned here is that you work hard, have fun, and make money. The management here TSC is decent I've never had any major issues with management here there pretty flexible working around your schedule. The workplace culture here is typically hardware, tools, welding supplies, farming equipment, and a variety farm animal feed. The only hardest part about the job is that you're on your feet all day but that's part of the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers they're good people to be around and they're always there to help you if you're struggling with your work."
good,Enjoyed working at Tractor Supply Company. The employees were enjoyable to work with. Quite a bit of heavy lifting and constantly restocking product.  Overall good retail store to work for.
good,"It's been great working for Tractor Supply. The people who come in to shop, whether it's their first time or a regular customer, are down to earth and very friendly. The staff is great and fun to work with and our boss is very easy going."
good,TSC is a great company and a lot of fun to work for. You just have to be careful as there are a few positions that are just dead ends with no place for advancement or growth.
good,Learn a lot in a short time. This was a great experience learning to manage in a type of environment. This job was all about planning out the day and following up
good,I loved working this job but it was very strenuous. They were constantly changing store managers. Never fully teaching you how to preform tasks for your job.
good,"great atmosphere and nice people,  hours are long and not idea for a man who wants to spend a lot of time with his kids.  the company overall was very nice and health benefits were good"
good,"loved the customers, some management had to much favoritism among employees, i think they should have more training courses. Always busy, and most of the customers that came in the store was like family."
good,"Great place to work. Meet a lot of interesting people. Opens other opportunities for more part time jobs. Great work environment, reasonable pay for work."
good,This is a very small place with only about maybe 10-12 employees.  That can be a very good thing as you get to know every associate on a more personal level.  Everyone helps each other out.
good,"A typical day would include eight hours of hard yet fun work."
good,"I had a great time working at TSC, aside from the fact that I know little to nothing about hardware or machinery, and I hate country music. At least the clientele was easygoing and friendly."

good,"A very hard working job, but enjoyable at the same time. Good place to work. Constantly working, especially in the feed department."

The management is great with working around personal schedules and gives a great balance between work and family life. We do a lot of working of all kinds and it is nice to have some change in the day between tasks. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of constant walking back and forth, helping customers with different things such as home improvement, equine and other animal projects as well as landscaping. The managers are great and the team that they put around you is very helpful with learning new material. The most enjoyable part would have to be helping customers with new ideas and learning new things that you cant learn elsewhere."
good,"It was a great job, and good bonding. Everyone was a hard worker, and did what they had to do to get the job done. They are good people there, and i am hoping that they will find someone better than me to fill my spot."
good,"As an employee of Tractor Supply Company, the days were never boring.  Customer service was the number one priority.  I was continually learning and being educated about new products so I could provide the customer with the best possible product for their specific situation."
good,"A day for me consisted of either opening or closing the store.  If opening I would count safe and drawers and get the store ready for that days business. "
good,"In the average work day I help customers fulfill their needs and keep the warehouse looking clean and organized. I learned how to operate forklifts, run cash registers, and provide excellent customer service. The management and co workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was the early morning shipments. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they need."
good,I enjoy working and meeting new people. It was in a warehouse environment
good,"This company has great benefits, time off, and competitive wages. The job itself throughout most of the building is not bad. You don't want to be inbound import center or picking bag."
good,Management is very nice and understanding and willing to work with you and your schedule.
good,"A typical day includes cashiering, customer service, stocking product. I learned more about agriculture, fence building, and an animal feed. Great managers, hard workers, and really easy going about needing certain days off. The hardest part of the job is not enough employees to accommodate for customers. The best part of my job is getting along with my coworkers and getting jobs done together."
good,"Performed opening duties of the store to include price updates and signage, restocking shelves and straightening throughout store.  Provided customer service to new and returning customers to include product knowledge, returns, exchanges, specialty orders and cashiering.  Management was good at boosting staff moral.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and we worked well as a team.  Everyone pitched in and was responsible.  The hardest part of the job was redoing an entire area for pricing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and the team."

My supervisor on 2nds was Teresa and then Adam and they were great.  I loved knowing everyone and we all worked very well together, helped each other out when we needed it."
good,"Great Mission and Values"
good,"•	Working knowledge in MS Word, Excel, MWS Production, SCI, and Clear Track."
good,I would begin the day by refilling all of the pet feed. This includes carting 10 to 12 50lb bags of dog/horse feed to the floor and stacking them for display. I really learned how to communicate with people. I was constantly interacting with customers.
good,"The day started out with unloading truck containers and palletizing items then shrink wrapping them until container was empty. I've learned that at the end of an intense labor job, my mind feels accomplished. The management team were friendly and understanding of the circumstances. My co-workers worked hard and were very passionate. The hardest part of the job was the temperature but i got use to it. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming home feeling rewarded for working hard."
good,"fun place to start working with great benefits. enough room for advancement, but needed a better paying job."
good,"Fun, Always had a smile. Nice people, great managment, had gotten certified Hazmat, automated palletjack. Hardest part was keeping up to rate, and the most best part was work at your own pace"
good,Tractor Supply is a great place for young mangers looking into moving up the ladder.
good,wonderful company to work for. Stable employment and a wonderful staff in the corp office
good,Great company to work for. Great people. Company has great values and a good team comradere
good,"A typical day at TSC has largely never been very ""typical."" Retail sales is not my thing, however I selected TSC because of their customers and products. I greet customers, run the cashier, tell the customer I'm a city kid, which allows them to teach me, pick feed orders, and put out freight. I've also received multiple invitations to spend time on customer farms in case I truly want to learn!"
good,"Small 18,000 sq. Ft. Reatil box. A variety of product for its customer base. Prices are okay."
good,"I have learned many things with my time at Tractor Supply Company with being my first real job out of college. I have learned more about what goes into a business. I have also learned how to deal with problems both challenging and not. My boss is very knowledgable about the workings of the business and about the products that are retailed in this establishment. I love coming to work most days because my coworkers make it fun to be there. The hardest part of this job, however, is that it is retail. All in all I gain a lot of experience everyday and it is a great experience for me to get along the road to finding a career that is suitable for me."
good,This company has been by far this best company I have worked for in terms of how they treat their employees.
good,"You begin early, customers need your attention right away. If you take good care of them they take care of you by continuing to come back. You have to be a great multi-tasker. You must be a team player and work with team mindedness. You will learn to think fast on your feet, you ideas will sometimes be the best, and other times you'll need to heed the advice of your co-workers. And be able to adjust. Being able to constantly adapt is vital to work and business."
good,"Everyone there acts as a family to further each other and get things done and you learn a lot of new things. You learn how to put things together and different things about a variety of animals to help customers find out what can best fit their need from things like fencing to animal feed. My store was very inclusive and friendly to everyone who came in, employee or customer, and would do whatever it took to make a sell and have a happy customer."
good,Tractor supply is a very customer oriented business. They will help you advance as long as your driven to move forward. They are usually small stores and it becomes like a family.
good,Tractor supply I loved it there production was a little high but I always maintained it. The management was some what a problem when it came to them understanding there employees. But overall I loved working there.
good,working in the public is great for me so tractor supply is ideal. I can request time off if I need it. Although I don’t usually get 40 hours in a week.
good,"Values workers and costumers, 40 hour work week, time and a half on sundays and holidays. Reasonable hours and tasks. Organized freight process and laid back work environment"
good,"Managment has really been a help to me personally, my boss shows he cares for me and everyone else and tries to accommodate everyone's needs the best he can."
good,"Enjoyed the work and customers. Not enough hours if you need to pay living expenses. "
good,"Tractor supply is a fantastic place to work, if you like a job with flexible hours. I've worked for TSC for over two years, and have never been denies a requested day off. When hired I asked for a specific set of hours, and the manager gave them to me. Overall I highly reccomend working here."
good,"Previous work history. Job security, demanding and competitive field, this company has a great track record and has outstanding core values for their employees. Clean work environment disgrace and a great staff.  Welcome the opportunity for this challenge and growth."
good,"TSC is a fun and busy workplace.  The management is kind and helpful and everyone on the team is awesome, and looks out for eachother.  It is hard physical work.  "
good,Great family company that works around your time and nice people works there. Sometimes the hours sketchy but for the most part they do well on spreading the hours evenly.
good,"Good place to work , fast pace they train in all equipment you get trained in all departments they give you opportunity for advancing nice people to work with"
good,I was a junior in high school at the time with a few after-school activities and weekend events that I had to miss (affected my grades) because I couldn’t get days off.
good,"TSC is a great company overall. I felt it has a low payscale, but I guess it is average for box stores. Managers at each location can be the difference of how your daily experience is. Generally understaffed lacking experienced employees, as they have a low payscale."
good,"All of my co-workers were incredible and nice, definitely an amazing first job fresh out of school, Everyone was very helpful and the job taught me new skills."
good,I love this job. It’s very physical very fast paced and the manger I had before the one I have now was moved departments and I was upset because he really new how to work with his crew and was always there to check on all of his team members. I absolutely love this job and it pays well I make 16.50 right now it has great benefits but within the time being I got hurt a few times.
good,For my part time job through my senior year I enjoyed the experience . The job was great and so were the workers everyone had their mind set and artifice great . We would get all of our take done very quick .
good,"This is a very easy going, laid back job. It is flexible with home/work life. People are friendly and one of the many perks is when customers bring their furry friends. It’s a great place to work if you are an out door and pet lover."
good,"As a receiver you must keep your backroom clean with the constant traffic. Overall a fun place to work. Co workers are like family and you learn your regulars pretty easy. A friendly store and very sociable. This store likes to interact with town events too. Occasionally dealing with holidays, rodeos, and pet events."
good,"One of the most fun jobs I've had, Management was great, they'd make sure you were happy, however due to poor location of the facility, work hours were limited and if you were at the bottom of the food chain, you maybe got 8 hours a week."
good,Animal knowledge is a plus. Great place to work. Great management that don’t treat you as if your below them. Really care for the community and do whatever is possible to ensure customers are taken care of. Definitely a go to place for anything that is needed
good,Fast paced work where every member is needed.  Corporate goals are sometimes unacheivable and often you will go home without completing the tasks needed.  With a good store manager it is a good place to work.  Being a store manager is a salaried position that is not recommended.  If they cut your payroll then the manager has to make up the slack often working 100 hours a week.
good,Good place to work with good benefits.overtime is usually easy to find if interested. Would work there again in the future and would recommend to family and friends
good,"Generally enjoyed working here, you always have the opportunity to interact with good, hardworking employees and there are always the bad ones. I seemed to be responsible for a lot more than in the job description which was never problem unless it was a busy day in shipping and receiving, then it made it hard to manage the back room and cover for others outside of receiving."
good,"Typical day with have you get your truck going, logging into computer and following their moves. You had a radio for request from managers for special task and a phone for private request or radio distance was to far (at the other warehouse). At Hagerstown you would drive one of the positions: Inbound, outbound, shuttle, scaling."
good,Tractor supply company is a great company to work for. Your get to learn alot about the company. You can be a team member and help out with load outs. Tractor supply is a very friendly place to work at.
good,"A typical day consisted of being understaffed for the amount of foot traffic that entered the store. The retail locations aren't allocated enough payroll hours to accommodate the kind of customer service our team, and I strive to provide. An average day consisted of three people to cover the cash, answer all calls within three rings, greet and assist all customers who entered and fill propane tanks (which is a full-time job in itself); while providing carry and forklift load outs and unloading delivery trucks. I learned that all you can do when working under such daily stress is provide your team and clients your individual best.You can't please everyone all the time, but you can try! My manager was fantastic, and we worked well together to create a top-notch team. The workplace culture is strong but is difficult to achieve the kind of work/life balance they deem important. The hardest part of the job was the constant shifting of hours to accommodate our continuous shrinking payroll budget. The team gets stretched too thin, and attitudes tend to sour under such conditions. The most enjoyable part of my job was the daily interactions with customers and their pets. Helping them with whatever needs that pet parents require. I miss my team and regular feed customers as well. The Oxford location is a unique and busy store."
good,Co workers are supportive.The work is enjoyable but not easy there are a lot of things that are expected to happen in these stores and sometimes there is not enough payroll given.Prepare to do a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"I enjoy working there, very fast pace hard work but they have good benefits just wish full time hours were 40 not 30. They have a variety of merchandise for everyone. I like the Team Lead position, directing employees and open and close store ,the merchandising is always exciting."
good,"I love the company, for a retail environment tractor supply is one of the best around. Friendly customers and friendly employees. You are encouraged to move up and they prefer to promote within the company."
good,"Lots of work, good environment."
good,"Overall the work is not too bad, but at times can get very stressful. It is a lot of work and not for people who think it is just a cashier job. There is more to this job than to being a cashier. The cashier will have to be organized and knowledgeable of many products inside and outside of the store. The cashier needs to be good at multitasking. The times that it becomes stressful is when the phone is ringing on more than one line and you have a customer in the store asking questions while you are trying to check people out. The best thing about the job is how you will have repetitive customers and you can build a relationship with these customers and understand the needs of these customers as well. The down fall of the job is also again the customers, some are great but there are those customers that will be rude."
good,"I enjoy the job that I do, I enjoy the challenges I love having a good laugh while at work. Our motto is work hard make money and have fun. I do not like working 28 days straight with only two days off in a month."
good,"No matter what position you hold at Tractor Supply your feet will be killing you at the end of the day. There is no shoes for working on cement."
good,"I really enjoyed Tractor Supply and the constant growing and changing environment.  The team I worked with was great, but the distance from home was quite far, I still love seeing the growth for them."
good,"Clean and healthy job environment,Friendly staff,Inconsistent Scheduling,Poor Time Management,Safe Work Environment,Long Online Training, Positive Customer Satisfaction"
good,"A non stress environment "" Great place to work (part time). There are also a very limited full time positions in the company."
good,"The company is great the benefits are decent but, I wish you could grow within the company. Most hiring is done outside of the company, the company tends to look over team members who have been around for years and have the training and knowledge and I feel it is unfair."
good,Only thing I would ask to increase is the security around the building. I have learned a lot of new things every day while I am working. The most enjoyable part at work for me is the interactions with my fellow customers and my co-workers.
good,"I would typically come in around opening time, get set up at my station and be ready to greet customers. some days there would be customers who brought their pets inside. I enjoyed how easy-going the management was and co-workers became family. I'd say the hardest part of the job was unloading freight in such a short amount of time,but I enjoyed getting paid for being able to have fun."
good,"Working at Tractor Supply Company is an overall great place to work. You can receive expert advice and get educated on specific farming questions right from the associates who have personal experiences/farms.The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers- Getting to interact and build relationships with them is a great way to network and continue keeping the company number one. The hardest part of the job is management, unfortunately going into the store every day and having the fear of not knowing what personality you are going to get on a daily basis is extremely unprofessional and stressful."
good,Mentally and physically challenging job with great opportunities for advancement with hard work and dedication. Great manager training program.
good,"Very good place to work. Kept busy, trained for advancement. A lot of different types of work to do. Sales, carry-out, run cash register, assembly, receive trucks, UPS, and FedEx. Scan items into inventory, put out for sale. Ship things out on truck, UPS, and FedEx. Most of co-workers where great, a couple where a little lazy over the years. Hardest part was keeping up assembling and having to go help out front for sales and carry-out. Most enjoyable part was helping a customer who told you thanks and meant it."
good,cashier - and stock - have knowledge of the products
good,"decent hours. flexible, sometimes understaffed, but for the most part a good company to work for. hard to make 40 hours a week unless you are a manager unfortunately"
good,"Good pay and a friendly group of people. I worked in freight and that was a very physically demanding job, and there was also dust everywhere. Not my ideal job but still a good place to work."
good,"I love the company, but have over many years worked off and on for them and their products are getting cheaper and their pay is getting worse and worse. They're cutting overtime and people. It's a shame."
good,It was a good place to work. Management was very nice and very understanding if you need something. Very clean and items are well priced. They sell A lot of different items.
good,"Good place to work  pay scale for amount"
good,I have worked for TSC. for two years loved it. the general manger that i had at the store i worked at was great the worked with my schedule and the also have great benefits good people.
good,"Not only did I have fun working there, but I learned more about farm and outdoor life than I knew before I started there. The people who shop there are friendly and outgoing and the management and staff make you feel like one big family. I would love to go back to work for the company if given the opportunity."
good,"Tractor supply was probably the most favorite job that I've had, as the receiving manager you get ""the good hours"" 7 am to 4 pm with weekends off! The only thing I didn't like was sometimes management and I didn't see eye to eye and the pay was not so grate for the position."
good,Good place to work but can't live on the pay in this area. Laid back environment. Good managers. Great customers. Cute chicks and ducklings to take care of.
good,"They work with you and your schedule outside of the job. Great people. Strict attendance policy but easy. Job values play an important role so as long as you're easy to work with, they'll work with you"
good,"You get your exercise at walking all day, You get a chance to do others jobs beside the one your assigned and change departments if you prefer. Job postings to advance within are availible"
good,The job is what you make it. Do your research on the specific store you are looking into. The job requires physical activity even if you are a cashier. You have the opportunity to become hired even if your knowledge on what your job will be is not there.
good,"I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply. Management was very flexible about my schedule because I was a full-time college student and they worked around the days I had to request off. The only non-enjoyable part about working as a cashier was being unable to leave the front of the store and not being able to move around the store in order to help some customers, but the other workers were usually close by to help out."
good,There were many opportunities for advancement at the company and they also had many opportunities for travel. The products were very well made and I had learned most of what I know about retail throughout my employment at this store.
good,"In my experience, this has been a tremendous place to work with lots of different kinds of responsibilities. They range from manual labor to inventory tracking, cashiering, resetting store displays, assembly, forklift responsibilities, loading/offloading trucks, loading heavy items into customers' vehicles, etc."
good,"A typical  work day consisted of answering phones, helping customers one on one, and doing the usual cashier duties. I learned how to effectively talk to customers, and how to help them solve the problems they were having. The management is amazing, it was by far the most influential boss I have ever had! He was very fair with scheduling and the tasks that he assigned for the day. The workplace culture was a very friendly environment that I hope to find in my next place of employment. The hardest part of the job doesn't apply to Tractor Supply! All of the work is enjoyable!"
good,Some physical labor included but the employees there are always fun and happy. Working weekends is always a drag and is not what a lot of people want  but that is retail.  If you don't mind a few rude customers every once in a while then this is the place to go.
good,Not enough workers on shift and very little payroll but a good place to work for if you are going to school or only need a part time job
good,"Its easy to give exceptional customer service with such great customers. Answering phones, loading feed by hand or on fork lift and making sales fills the majority of the day. Its a fun and enjoyable work environment."
good,"At TSC most days were fun and challenging, mostly in a good way. There was always something to do, whether it be customer service or resetting of Planograms. My job was to delegate areas of work to other employees all while helping with customer service, making schedules, handling HR issues, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and people whom I worked with. They are some of the best people I have ever met. The hardest part of the job was unhappy customers and employees who didn't show up to work, etc."
good,"It was fun to start the day and work with others,  I learned that everything goes as planned.  The hardest was not receiving in the items advertised in sale papers and employees reporting on time."
good,"ive worked with customers with all my jobs, I just learned how to keep them happy some you couldn't keep happy though and just had to know how to deal with them. Management has always been good to me I haven't had a manager that didn't like me or didn't work well with. Co- worker even if we didn't get along I found a way to or kept my feeling aside. But I get along with about everyone. My most enjoyable part of my job was helping them making them happy and hearing stories that would make me smile and happy. working with people that make your job fun is the best job no matter what I'm doing."
good,"I love my job at tractor supply! My bosses are great, compassionate people who genuinely care about their employees. They work around my schedule and the environment is always positive and fun."
good,We have start up meeting to let us know how we are doing for the week am learning a lot at this job and I get along with my co-workers and it is not a very hard place to work at
good,Tractor Supply is a very interesting company to say the least. They have seen a lot of growth over the past several years and the amount of positions they have added shows that growth.
good,"i come in every morning and up load numbers from SAP. once i have up loaded the number and the out going trucks schedule i calculate how many trucks we will need to load for each store. then i tender the loads in sterling so that our carrier knows how many loads, what day and time each load need to leave and arrive at the stores. i also help stores with any DC iusses they may have each day. i love my job and i love helping and learning new things each day."
good,A typical work day varies depending on the goals that are set for the day. You can expect to learn how to operate a forklift if you dont know already. The co-workers are very friendly and for the most part hard working. The hardest part of the job will probably be when you first start and you're getting used to the swiftness of the work day. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you can step back and see what you accomplished during the day.
good,"The work is pretty demanding, but management does their best to make everything work smoothy."
good,It’s a great company to work for if you don’t have kids  and are over the age of 30  you get put in a point system  the hours aren’t flexible and not forgiving if you miss any time. Management is great and they do a lot for their employees.
good,"You can count on pleasant interaction with the majority of the very loyal customer base. In store management is excellent. As is common in large companies, some directives coming down from home office can feel out of touch with the reality of your store"
good,"TSC had a hard working atmosphere but we all worked together to get things done, There was a lot of room for me to learn and grow, anytime I wasn't sure what something was I could ask another team member, manager or even who was buying the product. This store was also heavily involved in the community. Was just a neat place overall to work."
good,"I really enjoyed the team work at Tractor Supply. We all got along super, and helped/supported each other in making our store run at its optimum best."
good,"Loved working here, but all employees hours are getting cut. Great management & have met a lot of people. The team made it a blast too work, no matter what’s was going on. Good vibes."
good,Relaxed Work environment where positive feed back often given when completing a task. Management is easy to talk to and eager to help make life and work balance. Willing to work with school schedules and other Outside obligations their employees had pr have formed during employment.
good,Tractor Supply was a great place to work. But at times you will get no help when you need it. Other time one might get a District Manager who just wants you gone and when find away to do just that. But all in all we had fun and did our jobs to corporate policy. And the customers was great. Work hard and show them you have the skills and knowledge to do your job and enjoy it.
good,Tractor supply is a very enjoy and happy working environment. Everyone is so happy and friendly. I am so glad I work there you meet so many nice people.
good,"on days where you were not busy, you would literally just walk around the store straightening up isles. which is a good thing. you kept the place clean and tidy, but the whole time you are working you do not get to sit. you have to always be on your feet."
good,"I loved working there, great experiences and job advancement. I really enjoyed being a trainer in the shipping department. The job was very overwhelming at times but I got the job done."
good,This was a good work place and I'd would refer people to work here. they have great benefits and OT is good as well. the employees and staff are amazing and make you feel like you're welcomed there.
good,TSC excels in trying to make the most out of each employee they can. Constant promotions and training is available. Knowledgeable and experienced management to help each store and person working in the store succeed. Hours can be quite demanding especially in managerial roles.
good,"Enjoyed working there, no complaints, enjoyed the out here life style the company promotes. would recommend working there for people looking for retail experience. The receiving position is a challenge, but is the best position in my opinion."
good,"A typical day at work would range from busy to slow but either way productive. I learned how to work with a variety of co workers aging from older to younger, and I learned a lot more about agriculture than I did before. The management while I was employed there was phenomenal and very understanding especially for a full time student. I have never had a group of co-workers that I had such a close bond to personally and professionally not only then, but now as well. The hardest part of the job would probably be the long hours after closing time and the heavy lifting of feed and other farming equipment. I enjoyed every aspect of this job, seeing as this is how I was raised."
good,Typical day included assisting customers and restocking shelves. Management was wonderful and worked well with scheduling considering I was in college at the time. My co-workers were wonderful we all worked well together as a team.
good,"Tractor Supply Co. has been a great company to work for with many advancement and training opportunities. They really live up to their motto of ""Work Hard, Have Fun, and Make Money"". Everyone there is always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,Overall good job to have but not good if you only have a few days a week available. Good people that work there and hard working. Easy to get along with
good,Superb company great people terrific employees. Work flow was always generated between shifts. Strive for employees to be team players. Startup meetings were always a plus.
good,Good place to learn good customer service skills. Room for advancement.  Always changing to meet our customers needs.  Small close knit team of coworkers.
good,"A typical day at Tractor Supply Company is busy, although they're some slow days. Running the register and greeting customers is my job, I also put up freight on occasion. I learned how to run the register, and how to stock shelves. Management is very good. It is a great place to work because of the management. They are really easy to talk to and have a fantastic working attitude. Co-workers are great too, everyone gets along very well. The hardest part of the job is finding an item that is not in the book. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the dogs that come in. Tractor Supply Company allows customers to bring their dogs into the store. Every dog a treat and some loving before they leave."
good,this company is about the best retail store to work for. they value hard work and understand the balance between work and home.
good,It was a fun place to work. Everyone was helpful and welcoming. A lot of experience grown from Customer Service environment. Most important part was the relationship I built with my colleagues and the stores I worked with on the other side of the phone
good,I was loving job that u can work at and help u out if u need days off with ur family.Mangment was good to u at sometime.People were friendly there too.
good,High turnover rate of employees and the manager is a little hard to work for. The other employees are friendly and make for a great work environment if you get past the management
good,Sales-Just worked part time did most jobs in store. sold high end equipment
good,"Job tasks were easy & simple. Enjoyed the customers. Clicks w/in employees. Constantly written up for petty stuff.  Written up for my bad days never noticed on my good days. Final write up a day  before Christmas a single mom  Not LDS, but Baptist 🎯 Customers loved me, was harrassed to wanna quit. Denying my unemployment bc I lost it from the mental abuse."
good,I didn’t really care for working there. It was to fast pace for me. And this isn’t really the field that t wanted to go int any way. The money isn’t supporting me.
good,"Stuck at check out counter most of the time. Could'nt move around the store to help customers. When freight truck comes in, it's hard to put up merchandise and run register to supervisors approval.""Or other co-workers."" Other than that, it is a great place to work and learn."
good,I enjoyed my time at TSC the management was cool and fair. when they first opened hours came easily i was clocking 60-70 hours a week. Hours are based off of payroll sales and if sales arent good hours arent either. i went from really good hours being called in almost daily to one or two days for a two week pay period.
good,"enjoyed the job, but the manager was terrible to work for. she had people like the assistant and team leads do her work for her and if it was wrong we would get blamed for it. they also would tell us they didnt have to honor request for time off. they played favoritism to much."
good,moving 50lb bags constantly and helping load customer's cars.
good,"Great company to work when you are not a manager, but it all depends on the store manager.  I worked for 2 great people and the last manger not so much"
good,I have learned to never work for this company again. They care about you when you work for them but as soon as you try to find a better job they treat you as an outsider
good,The only issue I had with them is the pay and lack of benefits for team members. They only offer part time for team members. The people and culture make it a fun work place.
good,Management doesn’t do well with communication. Very unhelpful in guiding you the correct way. If you need weekends off a lot you will not get them. Management expects you to do things they don’t even do. Manager usually has an attitude towards you. Threatens a write up every time you mess up. Turnover is ridiculous.
good,"This is realistic, you come to work, work, and go home. The upper management is good about keeping you busy. The working environment is good the co-workers work well together."
good,TSC is a very productive work place where I learned a lot about management and a new role i never saw myself being in. The workplace in general is great and everyone is super relaxed but depending on your location or position in the company the other managers do not do their job to their greatest ability.
good,I loved working here! Everyone was super friendly and we all got along! It was a normal paced store and we never stressed about it being too busy! Normal customers are great because you always remember them!
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is greeting customers and maintaining customer satisfaction. I have learned a lot about agricultural tools and products. My Job Depends on Ag!
good,"Great advancement opportunities . Never saw myself working at tractor supply but I’m glad I did, love to help all the farmers and families that walk I !"
good,"Overall great company, pay doesn’t go hand in hand with what I had to deal with. Manger didn’t give me the hours I was promised. Not much room for advancement unless someone quits or is fired."
good,"working for tractor supply company was a great job, but needed to start making full time money so had to move into the factory business. I loved the customers and would definitely go back and work there again"
good,A typical day at work was great you learn lots about animals and tools etc my coworkers were amazing most enjoyable part of the job was helping people
good,They hired only seasonal help and that is exactly what they meant we all were fired after the season was over
good,"A typical day could be anything from running the register, to doing pick lists, restocking feed or dog food. Price changes, getting inventory ready for sale events. Super pegging. Cleaning..driving the forklift , doing load outs for farm equipment."
good,"Some days are slower then others. My manager is pretty good. My favorite part of the day is seeing all the animals that come in, and helping new owmers."
good,was A good place to work the employees were nice and welcoming I loved working with the customers and I loved doing load outs and helping people find what they needed
good,"Wonderful place to work, made some of my bestfriends there. The work place was very peaceful. Not much drama in my department. And I loved the regulars who came in there! And all the animals you would see😊"
good,"This company has great customers, and great team members, However, with new changes in upper management things that had once been important part of running a store, no longer are. The education  that is provided is first class."
good,Tractor Supply provides an accommodating and friendly workplace for those individuals who are seeking part time employment within the city of palm coast.
good,"Fast paced, friendly environment, enjoy meeting many new people,very much tries to achieve customer loyalty. Very pet friendly.  Always new things to learn."
good,Never been more happy working for a company and under management the way I have at this company. If you're looking for a fun and happy work environment this company is definitely for you. And definitely has room for advancement if you are serious about the company.
good,If you want to move up in this company you need to be the boss's pet and do whatever they want. if you are no the boss's pet you get short hours. As long as you have a friendly manner you are good.
good,"Great place to grow your knowledge and meet people throughout the community. Since there is a vast selection of what is offered at Tractor Supply Co the people you meet will range from fieldworkers, business owners, automotive mechanics, and veterinarians and more."
good,"Great environment to work in, The amount of work you do for the pay isn't worth it a lot.  asked to work overtime then get yelled at for it.   They like to play favorites with in the company"
good,I liked the job but the manager is terrible nobody stays because of her  if manager was good and pay was better it would be a good job and people would stay
good,Good job to gain experience out of high school. Learned what a hard working job feels like. How tiring physical labor can be. Definitely will keep me in school so I can get a better job.
good,Sales person very hard working love work wirh new people and nee place to expened tje many new jobs that ate out there.also i love to meet nrw animals help the Customer ar with what ever need.a
good,I enjoy load outs and working on the floor when it comes to pulling feed and handling our nice customers I love when we have poultry in our store and take care of them all day long and give them to lovely homes
good,I loved meeting new people and helping with there animals. and i loved our group of people. I personally have animals so i also learned alot when i worked there.
good,"Like I said earlier, indeed is wasting my time by making me fill out all this useless information that has nothing to do with finding me a new job.  It is a waste of time"
good,Everything is alright my girlfriend is in collage and want a job that can give me weekends off but I’ll work great and show up on time and I have a good attitude
good,"It was a great place to work, absolutely loved working there and the people that were there. I learned so many things and met so many great people. Love that place"
good,"Started as part time then asked if I wanted full time then promoted to team lead, was almost ASM before I had to more. Loved every minute of working there"
good,Helping rural customers find solutions to their everyday needs from fencing to feed and everything in between. Cash register duties and stocking skills a must!
good,I love greeting people as they walk in the store especially when the customers bring their pets. I like helping others. It's an awesome environment to work in.
good,Convenient for those items that can’t be found at other surrounding stores. Very professional store along with friendly staff.large selection .  The facility is well kept .
good,"Tractor Supply has always been known to me for their smiling employees. Once working there I understood why, it's more of a family environment than a workplace."
good,I was only there for about 2 months on a vocational rehabilitation program but I loved working there the bosses were really nice and the associates were even better
good,"I've worked at two different TSC locations in Oklahoma over 3 years and visited many more while traveling, and it's overall a great company to work for. My last store manager and all the team leads were fun, efficient and caring, which is a rarity these days. With such a small team tackling high expectations from customers, a sort of supportive family dynamic developed between my coworkers. We rely on each other - and our customers! - to keep us on our toes learning about everything from animal health to tractor maintenance to fence building. The laid-back attitude about dress and casual approach we're able to take conversing with our customers as we would our own neighbors is unique and creates a great atmosphere full of genuine empathy and humor. Also - animal lovers rejoice! - our four-legged regulars are always welcomed with pats and treats behind the counter. The only drawbacks have been relatively low pay and the god-forsaken ""music"" we're forced to play. But if you like fast-paced, close-knit work environments with lots of hands-on learning and customer service, definitely check out TSC!"
good,"I loved tractor supply and the people there! They worked with me when I needed it most, I loved the environment, the discounts help tremendously, I would definitely go back if it was more pay!"
good,Very task oriented while providing top customer service. Strongly stands by mission and values. Highly structured and productive work environment. Very good company to work for.
good,tractor supply is a awesome place to work for. the bosses are very helpful and they do there job very well. I have learned a lot and they are always there if I need help.
good,"Working at tractor was amazing for me personally. Team work is a huge part of working there and I'd still be there, if not for having to move out of state. You have to want to work hard and be part of a team but the people there are pretty great and I have lifelong friendships from being a part of their team."
good,"Great People, Customers, Management. Truly a wonderful place to work and a great career for an individual. Its very fast paced and a typical day in the out here life is very rewarding and challenging. Its different everyday and requires a strong back and healthy lifestyle."
good,The location I worked at was rooted in the ideology behind what it truly meant to be a team. Support was something that was never lacking. I loved working with my team(s) and absorbing what they had to offer.
good,"Down stack pet food, boots,clothes, stock pet feed and  pet food. Clean floors mop, swep. Help customers with carry outs. Help with farm equipment. Get hey ."
good,I had a good experience and learned a lot had a great friendly staff didn’t have any issues everyone worked hard and stocked the shelves full of food and kept everything neat
good,"I enjoy working at Tractor Supply because it is competitive, interesting, and keeps me on my toes. My usual work day includes working the register, helping customers, and stocking the store."
good,its a great job to learn from they have taught me to work all types of equipment from forklift to cherry picker. The hardest part to me was lunch time we couldn't leave and I love to eat hot meals
good,Management is decent. Hours are consistent. Co-workers are kind. You’ll see a lot of dogs and animals. CiCi’s Pizza is across the parking lot so you can get pizza on your 30 min break.
good,This has been the most laid back job I’ve had i was a cashier I answered the phone put up freight and greeted customers I moved and couldn’t transfer :)
good,worked here off and on for nearly 10 years and have rarely had a bad experience to speak of. My only complaint is the pay. They don't pay enough to keep their best employees/managers around very long thus they experience a decent amount of turnover.
good,TSC is a wonderful place to work.  For the most part the upper management are great women to work for.  I just feel that there is a lack of understanding between work and balance for those of us that have a family.  The hardest part of the job is the load outs.  The most enjoyable aspect is dealing with the customers and the satisfaction of a job well done knowing that you helped and they left your store happier than when they came in.
good,It was a very relaxed setting and well compensated for my work. The management was great and worked with me well while I was employed there and told me I was welcome to come back there to work.
good,I loved working there. Great team and fun. Its a great place to excell and learn at. Lots of oportunity to learn new things and meet great people. Very fair and a great place to work.
good,"i would have to answer phones within 3 rings, cashier, customer returns, stock, and do cash audits on my till.  The hardest part is when other cashiers did not do their duties and they fell on you plus your own work"
good,The company is a great one to work for with plenty of room for advancement. Compensation could be a little better for what is required of the job especially management. Store management in some select locations need improvement big time.
good,"Great  work  place, with a great staff. I enjoyed working here throughout my senior year, as it also provided me the necessary tools to become a hardworking individual"
good,"The only down fall is you can't promote within, only to team leader. Also, you have to work a few years before having full time unless hired as upper management position."
good,"Tractor Supply is a great place to work. Great opportunities, great people, and management cares about their employees. Management reaches out and helps employees reach their goals, no matter what they might be."
good,This was my first job and it was amazing. I only left because I had to move across state. The manager was so much fun and I loved helping the customers.
good,Tractor Supply is a great company to work for. But they're definitely old fashioned. I mean this in every sense of the word. Don't expect to ever work from home and they'll want you in your seat from 8:00-5:00 (or longer) even if it's a dead time. People are great though.
good,"At tractor supply, I was a head clerk "
good,Great Place to work. The atmosphere is amazing. The people are awesome. They are a very family oriented group of professionals.
good,I loved my job at Tractor Supply Company. A typical day at work for me was always very busy. I related to most customers here and I loved being able to help them and keep them satisfied with ease. I learned many sales techniques at this job to help meet all sales goals that were assigned. Management was terrific at first and then fell apart when one manager left the workplace when they promoted someone who was more of an demand giver rather than a manager and co-worker. I loved the workplace culture and knowing and understanding all customers about what their needs were at this job. The hardest part of the job was having to resign because of medical purposes and not being able to keep my job until I was back to full health and come back to work. The most enjoyable part of this job was sharing techniques and stories with customers about farming and animals.
good,This was my very first job and it allowed me to learn how to work hard and be independent. Learned a lot about farming accessories and the ins and outs of customer service.
good,"Was a very fun and exciting work place, I learned a lot from this company. The customers were and amazing part of this job. Everyone that worked there was very upbeat and happy to come to work everyday."
good,"Make schedules, hiring quality team members,  evaluating store trends of product,  control budgets of wages.  Working with customers to complete their projects within their requirements"
good,"I enjoyed working here during my high school career, it was a good way for me to get my foot in the door of the work life, and I enjoyed moving up to become Team Leader, I do recommend this place for employment."
good,"Tractor Supply was an enjoyable place to work.  My manager wants me back, my coworkers became my family, I always got a great workout as I was responsible for restocking the entire animal food side of the store.  Several of my managers and coworkers taught me how to operate the sit-down forklift we had, which helped me get the certification.  They also went through my breakup with my husband, waiting for my boyfriend to get out of jail, giving me a schedule so I could visit him, and being supportive i n most areas of my life."
good,"I loved the environment and the co-workers"
good,"At Tractor Supply, you serve a great community and great people. Your customers are repeat custormers, you get to know them, their families and their needs.  You work as a team and the work is rewarding."
good,Opened the store.  Took the deposit to the bank.  Lined up the employees as to their duties for the day.  Helped customers with purchases.  Overall it is a good place to work with good down to earth people.  The hardest part of the job was at times the AC would go out and it would be extremely hot.  It was an old building so hot I the summer and cold in the winter.
good,"Everyone was very nice, friendly and made customers laugh. learned cash and how to assist. Hardest part was seeing associates slack sometimes in work, but i still loved it there"
good,TSC is a great company to work for. They really follow their values and care about their employees. They value their customers as well.
good,I loved working for TSC and I enjoyed my customers.  Store was very well organized and clean.  All the upper management that came in to observe were always very friendly and polite.  Coworkers were very helpful and knowledgable with customers when they had questions about Tractor Supply Products.
good,wonderful people to work with and also most of the customers are wonderful people from all walks of life! Great hours! and they will work with your school schedule
good,I enjoyed working here. it is a lot of multi tasking however if you are good at that (as I am) then this is perfect for you. The only bad thing was the schedule. I was not getting many hours.
good,Very nice place to work. very fun and energetic coworkers. I would recommend this place to anyone. The boss is wonderful and it is a great environment!
good,"checking patients out and recovery of merchandise was the biggest part of my job as a cashier. I would occassionally work the floor and help patients find what they needed and carry out their merchandise for them. while working on the floor I would also set up plan o grams(changing merchandise around the store),restock the shelves,clean, etc. My co-workers were enjoyable to be around and fun to work with. This company is easy going and a great place to work."
good,Constantly moving no time to stand around and be lazy. I learned how to keep organized and to work with as a team. I was a cashier and i worked on the floor a lot as well. My co-workers were awesome very helpful and always doing their job. There was not anything hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of tractor supply was the costumers.
good,"Assist customers, answer telephone, organize merchandise, stock freight on shelves, create sales floor displays, trained in placing special orders for customers. I learned that it takes exceptional customer service to make the sale. The management team was professional, but did not seem to be as interpersonal with employees as they should be. My co-workers were wonderful to work with, and we were all willing to help each other when needed. The hardest part of my job was having a rude customer, even when I gave them exceptional customer service; I also did not like working on Sundays because I missed church so much. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and getting all of my tasks completed each workday."
good,Tractor Supply is a very good company to work for . Each store has different managers but they are all run the same. Clean and safe work environment.
good,I loved working there. the customers were great the fellow coworkers were great. except for the regional manager. he was very unprofessional and couldnt keep his word. Very disappointing to see that in a company
good,"I help sale products to customers, stock and organize the warehouse with products as they come in off the shipping trucks.  I load and unload feed using a forklift and pallet jack.   It is a fast pace and busy job but I enjoy interaction with customers and helping anyway I can."
good,My first full time job that gave me experience in management and shipping and receiving.
good,The costomers were the best part of this job. Being able to help them on a day to day basis was nothing i could ever explain
good,"Work 7 till 4"
good,Excellent company just have to really be into the lifestyle of the agricultural buisness
good,Working with the public and meeting new people. Co workers are great team players and works together. The best part was working with the team and being around people.
good,"Daily tasks are preformed in order to maintain inventory control."
good,I love working for this company i start out working for them when i 17 and i move to store management once i turned 18 only down fail is that the sold the company to someone else and me and my employees were out of a job
good,start my day by walking the floor making sure nothing is out of place and going around helping anybody that has questions or helping customers at the cash register.
good,Keeps employees updated on changes in company. Is a fair place to work
good,"a typical day just included tasks given down, customer service, and overall just maintaining the store"
good,Fun place to work to work. Everyday brought forth a new challenge. Never a dull moment. One of the best places I have worked at.
good,I learned most of my Customer Service skills with this job. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers. They would help you if things were getting really hectic. I enjoyed helping the customers and giving them tips and information on some things that they did not know.
good,"great managment friendly people, clean store. very good place to work"
good,Great place to work--enjoyed the customers and co-workers
good,"Fast paced job, you have to keep your production average above 100%"
good,"It really was a nice company to be employed at and a very friendly staff. My only problem was towards the end where their was a big lack in work, which ended up in myself getting llaid off."
good,"TSC is a ""Great Place to Work""!!!"
good,Filling feed and loading and unloading trucks helping at times check out customer and loading there vehicles.
good,"Tractor Supply is alone in the companies for which I've worked for knowing their customer to the level of detail which they do. Each and every person in the organization knows who they are serving, and strives to do it in the best way possible to provide the most value to the customer."
good,Fun job and outgoing team members. I enjoy everyday at work and enjoy the task i have to do at work.
good,"I have only just started to work here, but after one month of working, I really have enjoyed working with the employees here and the customers. I feel I am starting to fit into my designated place and getting a better grasp on the store."
good,"Good company to work, opportunity to move up. Doesn't pay a whole lot but, then again that is retail. Customers are easy to work with most of the time."
good,Help customers with what they are needing to find. Help load items if needed or assisted. Help with other things that someone may be having difficulties with.
good,I really enjoyed working here but need a new job and one thing i liked working here was the staff and Learning about Agriculture and another thing that was nice is the costomur that come in
good,"Good place to work. Customers are fun, job is fun. Lots of learning, and they are good about working with my schedule.  Which is nice that they do. Very happy."
good,"When I began working for TSC, I was 16 with only 6 months of work experience under my belt. The manager at the time took a chance on hiring me. Typically a shift would include operating a point of sale system and handling (sometimes extensive) amounts of cash, along with maintaining the registers, areas around them and the sales floor. I was part of the freight team and blitz team for over 2 years. The most difficult part of my job had to be dealing with unsatisfied customers. I gained knowledge not only from my team, but also from my customers. I received my propane certification through the company as well. I loved my job, and I loved my customers. The company helped me grow into who I am today."
good,"I had a great experience working at tractor supply. My manager is the best around!! I was just bored of being stuck on register since you are limited by where and what you can do in the store. It was a good part time job, but I like a more busy type of work"
good,I really don’t have much to say about tractor Supply dc. We work hard make money and have fun. And just like everywhere else there are rules. We also have a great support team. It up to the employees to make it work
good,I enjoyed my work experience there and when I departed and moved on. Working there prepare and molded me future employment. I learned how to accept challenges. And how to focus on the benefits that followed my consistency.
good,Great place to work.. you do not get paid enough for as much work you do. But other than that management is great and the customers are great. Teamwork is great.
good,No room for advancements. Need a secure job with benefits. Little hours available weekly. Nice and friendly place with friendly associates. Customers are helped from the minute they walk in until the minute they leave. Carry out help is offered.
good,Love the physical part of the job. The best part was the lifting boxes and working out. The hardest part of the job was the lifting but still enjoyed it the most.
good,If you’re interested in agriculture and enjoy helping people this is a good place to work. Hours are very flexible and the job is very busy and team oriented.
good,"I loved working here, but after some of the management left, the new management team went downhill very quickly. A typical day was pretty easy; 4-7 hours of working behind the register. Usually solo."
good,This was a fun place to work. The pay was decent but the hours that I had to work did not work out with my family's life. There was a lot of hard labor work to be done there. I really enjoyed the regular customers.
good,"Great people, great environment, got to see a lot of different dogs and even travel. There was always something new to do, the management was awesome, great to talk to about anything. there really wasnt any hard parts to that job."
good,This job was one of my favorite jobs i've ever had. I loved working with the customers and my team. Having the ability to work with the scheduling (within reason) was one of the best things about working here. However when we received new management a lot of this was thrown out. The job became a very different and much more unstable environment.
good,New dm hard to work with. Wouldn't return calls. Good pay. Long hrs. Hard work but fun atmosphere. Fast pace. Lots to learn and grow from. Customer service a big part.
good,"This job was challenging because as a cashier you needed to be at your register but when it is slow I liked to work with the merchandise pricing, straightening, stacking etc. You will learn a lot about animals and medicine best foods for each."
good,"You will constantly have people in and out of there, you will have a day or so that its not busy as ever, and then you will have the rest of those days, busier than ever. I learned how to measure peoples feet, and the width of their feet, and what size shoes they will need. Management are pretty good. Hardest part, I never had a problem with it, until it comes time to put the security locks on the shoes that are needing them. Enjoyable, it would be having everyone in a good mood, but have the job done,"
good,"Tractor Supply is an excellent company with a mission statement and code of values that are excellent and the corporation lives by them.  Local Store Management is less than adequate and does not comply with these Values or the Mission Statement.  I would have loved to stay with Tractor Supply, I thought I had found my last job."
good,"cashier, stocking, customer service were all great, Managers were great. schedules were good."
good,"Treat employees somewhat fair, love to have fun, provides excellent customer service. Learned about animals, and fencing, management is great and co-workers Are friendly. the hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting. the most enjoyable part of the job is the animals who come in and out."
good,The normal work day at tractor supply began with stocking and shaping they are a neat company and enjoy the orderly concept of shelving and shaping. Hardest Part Of the job was stocking.
good,A typical day working at tsc starts with checking at the hub to see what the manager assigned you to do that day. You also help out with load outs and helping customers with locating merchandise and assisting them on any other needs. We also stock on feed which we bring with a pallet jack out from the back room of the store and bring out to the floor. Is a really chill workplace overall but the part that I don't enjoy at times it having to stock on feed and dog food or any load outs because sometimes they are things that are really heavy and your the only one that is out doing those load outs while the other two people are busy with register or helping a customer. The most enjoyable part is just the people you work with. We laugh and joke around while still working.
good,"In my time at TSC I found myself working very fast and often with coworkers that I loved, good people and a very easy layout, I could never hesitate to find something for a customer and could always find it with ease, the management in oswego was 100% the best manager I've ever had"
good,It’s a really good company and really good people to be around but the work I was doing felt like it wasn’t a one person job and at the moment it wasn’t any help at times.
good,You got  to work hard an achieve any result it is all what you make of it.i recommend just trying your  est and the success shall come to you.The opportunity is there just don't give up on it.
good,"Depending on who your manager is, it can be really good or really bad. It very hard work and you have to pick up the slack of other people a lot of the times"
good,"I learned how to drive a forklift"
good,It was really fun to work there. You would see different kind of animals come in. They offer on location vaccinates with a vet. Friendly environment. Easy to find products.
good,I enjoyed working for Tractor Supply.  I learned so much about products that we carried and farming life in general.  I loved working with customers everyday and doing my best to accommodate their needs.  It was a friendly environment except for my manager that had been with the company for 15 years and had an awful attitude with coworkers and customers.
good,"There is plenty of advancement opportunities, they offer benefits and 401k. They don't pay as well as I would expect and raises are few and far between. They do offer vacation, personal and sick pay."
good,"I would have loved to be given more opportunities out on the floor where I am constantly being active and always doing something. I don’t like to just be standing at a register all day unable to move about. For the most part everyone I work with is pleasant and hard working. There are a couple team members who can be the opposite at times, but overall it’s a great place to work. And I’ve enjoyed the time I’ve worked there."
good,AS long as there is a good team with a strong Manager this is a great company. however the District Manager and home office do not care about the store family just about the money they can make.
good,It was a productive fast paced and an amazing job to have. I loved my co-workers and the upper management was amazing i would definitely recommend this job
good,The pay was low but the environment was awesome. The training was good and set you up to be able to complete your job. I highly recommend this company.
good,The customers were great. Other employees were usually very easy to get along with. However people didn't seem to stay there very long. Its hard to advance there.
good,The pay is low but again its fun because of the people I work with. Everyone qualifies for 401K which is a huge plus! After one year you are qualified for the stock purchase program as well.
good,"The work itself was fairly easy, it had plenty of employees to help, but that also caused your hours to be low. Most customers were nice and very easy to talk to."
good,"The job was ok,  was experienced in this field already therefore didnt learn much. Great people to work with. Very fast paced job overall. The supervisors needs to get more involved."
good,"Took daily calls, great life learning skills to use daily in and out of work, great co-workers and management, also fun place to work"
good,This job not only was a large learning experience but had severe issuses in keeping managers. Daily work was stressful being shorthanded. Co-workers were friendly. I enjoyed enteracting with customers even if they were upset. I enojoyed fixing problems and helping people.
good,"I was in high school when I got this job. I learned a lot about farming, and animals. I loved this job."
good,This was a great place to work at in the begging. Then it became a production driven place and safety importance dropped.
good,Good co-workers and good experience. I generally enjoyed working here.
good,"worked around my college hours and clinicals, and my second job."
good,Easy job as long as you work hard and do not slack off. Easy to get along with staff members and supervisors. Just do your work and you will have a good time.
good,This job is one easy job that includes working as a team to get the job done. It is at a fast paced and takes a lot to accomplish but when you do it all worth it.
good,"If you like retail this is a great company to work for, they do make employees feel important. Its a very customer service heavy job though, much more than I've experienced prior. That said it is retail which means retail hours and breaks which are always random and inconsistent"
good,The types of customers TSC attracts makes the job a little more enjoyable. They’re down to earth hardworking people who aren’t afraid of conversations. This makes the job enjoyable some of the time.
good,"I enjoyed my time at TSC, I had several friends I worked with and enjoyed being there. It was just too slow for me most days going from a vet tech in an animal hospital where it was something new and exciting with every case and I was always learning something new to becoming a cashier and standing behind a register. I just needed something more upbeat. I had also been working 12 hour shifts on Saturdays and Sundays every weekend for a year and a half at my vet tech job and when I talked with the manager at TSC about possibly only working one or two weekend shifts a month and she told me that would be fine. However, when I started I worked every Sunday open to close and usually a five hour shift on Saturdays and I didn't think that was fair.."
good,"when i first started working here, i was nervous and excited to finally have gotten my first job.it started out rough, learning how everything operates in the store, but as i worked i got more and more comfortable with everything. my boss and co-workers are nice , and the customers that i help whenever im working are so polite, never before would i have thought that almost everyone that i would talk to in a store like Tractor Supply would be so nice."
good,Awesome costumers great location good co-workers would love to work there again in the future amazing atmosphere with amazing people very organized please check them out
good,I loved working here. Very accommodating and kind staff. assistant manager didn't always comply to all the rules and picked favorites. Aside from that it was a great place to work.
good,They work around you an family schedule. Great place to have fun an make money . I worked with them a month got promoted to team lead. The benefits are Awesome
good,"I loved working here. The people and the customers were awesome, it just wasn't enough money. Employee discounts are great too. The only reason I left is for a higher paying job."
good,You need to be fit and be ready to move no slacking and need to fill everything up in the time limit that you have. You wont get breaks sometimes but when you do you better charish it.
good,Some days were worse than others but there is no other store like the one in Pelham NH. The managers are amazing and make everything quick and easy to learn. You are able to showcase your talents whether they are selling products or informing a customer. Some days were stressful and others were relaxed but I loved it all the more. It is a great first job and a great experience all together.
good,"Very fun job. First job I ever really had, easy if you don't mind working..I would recommend anyone to work there. The pay is not all that great but it was fun!"
good,"it is a fun place to work.I like talking and helping people,with thier decisions to purchase products.to tell them all about the productrs and the features."
good,"Love working for tractor supply, friendly staff and amazing experience to work for such a great company! I just wish the compensation was higher as each team member plays a huge role in day to day tasks"
good,The atmosphere was good. Taught us to work together instead of against one another. I learned a lot about retail stores. Management was good. Never butted heads with any of the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday. .
good,Great place to work if you enjoy treating customers and employees like family.  I loved my job a great deal their and always had customers come in looking for my help on any project they were doing.
good,"Generally I opened the store with 2 employees, did bank deposits and change orders. Then got the team organized for the day on the daily planner, set projects to be accomplished that day and made larger projects more attainable through teamwork. I learned about the different yard equipment, and tools. Equine and welding tools as well as proper merchandising and presentation. I most enjoyed working closely with the customers to help the find what they needed out here. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the co workers and drama they created for themselves and others. Management was decent."
good,I learned a great deal there as far as my management skills.  Loved my customers and was fun going to work.  Never was the same day in day out.
good,The people were nice the pay was good. no benifits for anyone part time which was understandable. They could use a little help picking their management at times but thats any place.
good,"Duties included opening and closing the store using security precautions to insure store is secure, manage layout of merchandise to promote sales, manage inventory and receiving of merchandise to insure proper accountability of items, building of shift schedules for subordinate workers, and professional customer care."
good,"This job has taught me how to work under minimal supervision, stocking, and running a fork lift which is handy. The managers and employees are wonderful very energetic and happy. great customers and customer service which is important"
good,"customers are awesome great place to work,enjoyed learning about animals"
good,"the  hardest part of my job is the small # of hours. I can meet any challenge head on.  I enjoy logistics, supply as I am a hands on person; I enjoy working with customers and to get a job done."
good,Overall a good place to work will give the opportunity to move up I u try and show u want to..we all work as a team everyone gets along well and are great to work with
good,"Its a really smooth sailing job. At times it is pretty slow and may not anything to do at some points to the lack of customers from time to time. The hospitality is great within both employees and customers. Its very simplistic, and you learn what you need to learn nothing is beaten around the bush nor sugar coated. It also has great ethical values that can benefit you at work, home, and future jobs you may have interest in along the road. The management is kind, supportive and will keep you on the right track. The hardest part for me was not having the knowledge of farming equipment and had to learn as i progresses at work. Like for instance, learn about what certain items are and where to find them for in store and calling customers. Overall, its a fun and helpful experience."
good,"Great place to work,management was understanding and willing to work with you.Team members all helped each Other.I was happy to work for such a good company"
good,"Great work culture. Fast paced call center."
good,I have really enjoyed working at tractor supply company. I have learned things working there that I never thought I would. It is a fair company. Has some downsides but overall good place
good,great job just had to relocate and I felt like I couldn't move up in both career and pay management was good work culture was relaxed but had to meet quota everyday not really anything hard and not much enjoyment
good,"I have nothing more to say about tractor supply.all my reviews have already been stated above. The work was at a even pace,and someone was always around to answer questions."
good,I love working here! The company itself is amazing! The management is excellent and is very understanding with personal problems. It is also very easy to advance within the company!
good,"Advancement is easily obtained for the dedicated worker, fun easy going employees, great regular customers, and uplifting manager amazing workplace for anyone"
good,it was a very fun place to work everyone is very helpful and loves to teach they definitely no how to make long working shifts fun and relaxed working there was like a mystery you never knew what was going happen you just go with the flow and it all play out very nicely
good,Stocking shelves and placing freight on shelves is common. Being attentive and helping customers with a friendly attitude is a must. Great learning opportunities for anyone wanting to learn about the agricultural life.
good,Loved helping customers look for what they needed for their farm or ranch. Helped pick items out for their livestock or pets. Kept store clean. Fellow coworkers were fun.
good,"scheduling could be better, sometimes wouldn't get time off even if asked many weeks beforehand due to poor scheduling."
good,"Tractor Supply Company gave me something that no other place has had. TSC is a close-nit company. My managers really took the time to get to know me, and I was comfortable with going to them with issues or problems I had. I learned from TSC more than I have from any other job."
good,"By providing legendary customer service , your customers keep coming back to see you.  I had the privilage to work in two of their stores, in two differant states. Do to non development of my training i chose to move industries. If they would have continued to train me i would have stayed. I love the Company ."
good,"Being the store Manager was good with TSC, the most enjoyable part of my job was our Upper Management . They were great to work for. The workplace culture was good and we learned a lot because we traineda lot."
good,"My most enjoyable part of the day was, helping customers find what they needed and answering the phone by helping customers with the questions they called about."
good,"Tractor Supply has been a great place to work for me. The hour budget needs fixed. There have been to many weeks when we don't have enough people, but we can't schedule more due to the budget."
good,There are many ways to advance with this company. The next goal is always within reach. It also has great employees that work well togetger as a team.
good,I enjoyed working with TSC. There was always a new adventure everyday. I enjoyed seeing the regulars and greeting customers. I loved working at TSC and had amazing coworkers.
good,almost 3 years with the company and ive had my ups and downs with different members of the store however they treat you like family and take care of you within the store.
good,For the most part I enjoy the people I work with but mostly I enjoy getting to interact with the public and helping them find what they need or conversing about their animals and their needs.
good,Easy going atmosphere where the senior management are hard working people who know ranching or tow trailers. feels like one big family where you are encouraged to earn as much as possible to help people. sales are not pushy the idea is you get people the right thing not the most expensive and make life-long customers
good,It was fun the costumers are amazing. The only hard thing is not thinking you live with them cause they make you feel like home. The only thing that sucked was the part time hours
good,I loved working here. The customers were always pleasant and talkative. The staff was flexible just as the management was. If you are looking for a part-time job that helps through school and the beginning phases of life its perfect.
good,"This was my first job! I absolutely loved working here, had a great team, and loved all of my customers. TSC taught me many different things from car parts, tractors, fertilizer, and animals. Overall, the best first job to have!"
good,Overall working at Tractor Supply has been a very positive experience for me. Management is very flexible and works well with employees.  I highly recommend this company.
good,"decent place to work other than retail hours.  Not much time off around the holidays, odd hours for management.  Shipments come on the weekend, which makes it hard to keep family first."
good,"This was a fun place to work at, there are always new people to meet and new stories to hear. There are positions always available to advance in the company if you decided to make a career here."
good,"I wish I could have my job back here, I enjoyed coming to work everyday with my computer workers. I enjoyed also working alone which this job required you to"
good,"You will always stay busy even on slow days, always something to do whether it's, product facing or stocking shelves or moping and autoscrubbing floors."
good,"Good company with good potential for advancement. Great for opportunities for the part-time person. Pay is not very good, except for the Assistant Manager and above positions. For those in management, be prepared to give 52-60 hours a week for 40 hours pay."
good,"typical day was easy going and fun"
good,"I really enjoyed my time there. It was all about team work and in my case, I had a wonderful team. We so many awards and the paychecks were great...I miss working there."
good,"Working at TSC is a nice place to work meeting new people everyday, and see the familiar faces is nice also. Learning about the products we carry is an everyday process. For the most part work is the same everyday. The hardest part is not knowing a set schedule."
good,"A typical day at work for me is fun, all of the employees even managers make the best out of working. As a team we get along great and that makes coming to work even better. We have daily duties that each and everyone of us will reach out and help each other accomplish. I enjoy coming into work when I have just great co workers to work with, while helping customers accomplish what they came into the store looking for. The most difficult thing about my job getting an angered customer, but as a team we help each other to get the customer taken care of the best we can."
good,"Store manager does everything from running register to handling customers problems - customer based company that strives on excellent customer service.  In a typical day you could wrok on schedules, planogram resets, freight, stocking shelves, customer load-outs to recieving.  Have to be able to work at a fast pace and multi-task"
good,Tractor Supply is a solid company with a great future for someone starting out in retail that has a retail background with Ag experience.
good,Get to Work Have a Meeting Get on My Deep Reach Fork Truck Go to the Docks and Start Putting Product Away
good,I enjoyed working at TS.The management is great and atmosphere is peaceful. The company provides outstading customer.service and is loyal to the customer.
good,"Very nice place to work. If you fit in with the tractor life, youll do great. If your learning its kind of more tough, but everyone for the most part is very accepting and willing to teach."
good,"I submitted my application on TractorSupply.com, called the next day and left a message. I got a call back an hour later and they interviewed me an hour from then."
good,"I enjoy working at Tractor Supply company. The work, my team, my customers, everything is great. Life work balance is good.  The pay could be better. No benefits as a PT associate.  20-25 hours per week.  If you’re looking for a job to pay your bills, this is not the job for you. It is ideal for a teenager, a student, a retiree, or someone that just doesn’t have any bills to pay."
good,". you compete against other stores in your district and the company"
good,"Tractor Supply was a great company to work for. It offered training, support, career advancement, good pay, and good work life balance. However, they need to continue ridding the place of the old guard who hamstring it's progress by not sharing processes the insure the company's progress. This travel knowledge haults progress."
good,"Still my favorite places to work at after high school. I enjoy my customer and the people i work with. Always had something new to do, so never stuck doing the same thing everyday. The only thing i wish that could change was the number of staff during shift. There was only 2 people and myself. So I couldn't really take my full lunch. But at least the day will go by fast. This is the only company that i worked for that will promote  within."
good,I love the other employees I work with and the company itself. The company has a customer first based attitude and treats all employees fairly. I would definitely recommend this store as employment for others.
good,"i really enjoyed working here. great employees , management and customers. it requires lots of hard work and working together. very flexible and understanding."
good,TSC gave me a great opportunity to meet many people in my community.  I really enjoyed being able to help out my community by planting fruit trees for all to enjoy.
good,Great place to work . Full of fun people and very nice customers. Very bless to be working at TSC! I would recommend the job to anyone especially college students .
good,"though it can be fast paced, its easy to learn and you can get along with your workers very well. There is always room to grow in job performance and if shown, you can easily assume other roles than just the position you were hired for."
good,"Great place to work, Relaxed place to work, just needed more hours and better pay wished they paid more. I worked part time and really wanted full time. But a great place to work. "
good,"I would greet customers, help them find what they were looking for. Answer questions if needed. I worked as cashier and as lead. Farm life knowledge is a plus for working there. Employee discounts are very nice."
good,Tractor Supply has a good Store Manager training program when planned out correctly and the plan is followed. CEO has a great vision for the future of the company.
good,"Nice customers, easy to get along with. Fast work pace , flexible hours. Discounts up to 15% . 30 min lunch breaks . Management well put together , fun co workers"
good,"Working at Tractor Supply is nice, we have some amazing customers. The staff is very friendly and nice. If you need help they are there to help you, don't be afraid to ask questions, they like to see you want to know more about your job."
good,There are so many good things about this company that I doubt they'll be able to fit in this box. The community and friendliness of the other employees is astounding and wonderful. the culture around TSC is incredible.
good,People here are very knowledgeable about anything agricultural related. We always learn from one another will never stop. I always have a great time here
good,"Great place to work with the opportunity to learn something new everyday. I never realized how big the inventory was until I started working  there. Time passes very quickly and you seem to never stop moving,it's a great workout .The best part of the job is meeting new  people  and their pets as well as learning about their animals , lifestyle and being able to help them by offering our products. I enjoy the variety of pets that we get to see daily.We are a small group of employees so you all work closely together. They offer great benefits and a 15% discount.."
good,"Relaxed and comfortable place to work, organized great customer service and knowledge of products. Open variety of product, open 7 days a week, had great leadership"
good,"Over all a good company to work for. Ethics and expectations changed significantly over the 8 years I worked for them, but we're mostly acceptable. Balance became obsolete"
good,"A typical day at TSC was filled with diversity....many things to do and most important for the autonomy to get it done!  I love working solo (project management) as part of a team.  They provide volunteer opportunities for the employees, health and wellness program, and so much more!  The most enjoyable?  The juggling of the many things that had to get d one!  Loved working here and if I ever moved back to Nashville this is the first place I'd look for another opportunity to work at a great place!"
good,Tractor supply company is a great place to work. Friendly environment. Great benefits. Awesome place to work if you have horses. There 15% discount really helps.
good,"Tractor supply is a good company to work for they are willing to work with you and your hours. Working at tractor you are able to learn something new everyday and when you clock in to work its always going to be something different to do, so you are not doing the same thing over and over everyday."
good,I actually had a great time working for tractor supplys. Sadly some life changes came up aswell as other things forcing me to quite.If I could be hired back I would go back to work there in a heart beat.
good,"You are trained to run the store, you learn about all the things you need to know to run a farm, the environment was great because we all opened to store together, the hardest part of the job may be to convince a customer to purchase a high end item."
good,"Good people, Good managers, Good Customers, good working environment, hours are fair, can be a very physical demanding job, fast paced, retail is not my favorite type of work."
good,Love everything about tractor. Just really wish I didn't have to move. I would and I have recommended many of people to come over to tractor. All jobs aren't for everyone. Overall great place.
good,Material handling  forklift operations troubleshooting situations loading shipping areas precise picking scanning and staging material. Clean as you go is the motto.
good,I loved working for them. Unfortunately I made the mistake of sending out a joke E-mail and was terminated. A typical day involved supervising employees. Taking care of customers as well as overall management of the store.
good,I loved my job it was so relaxed and the best part was wearing my cowboy boots to work everyday!! They worked with my all the time about what I needed off and other things.  So many great people and customers
good,The staff are all amazing and super friendly. All of the customers are nice and were patient with me when I first joined and was still learning how to do everything. It's very laid back and the pay is good. They offer scholarships for college once you've been there for year which is awesome and it's a great first job.
good,"A typical day at work included morning price changes and restocking the shelves. Customer service was priority and took a good portion of the day. Other daily tasks for a Team leader included resetting planograms and seasonal areas of the store. Nightly procedures including front facing the stock and counting down the registers for deposit. "
good,It's a great place to work if you have the right people on your team to work with and work for.  Love the customers that came in and always had a good time making new loyal customers.
good,"Great company to work for, I just couldn't handle the part time minimum wage for the cost of distance to and from work. Active jobs, must be great with people, team environment."
good,"I loved this job! only thing I did not like was being stuck up front on register ever day ALL day for the 6 months I was there, I could never do anything else cause I got yelled at and told to stay on register, even though other employees that started the same time as me or worked the same shift were able to go and o do other things I never could,"
good,"Typical day involved assisting customers with their purchases, recommending various products, stocking, and assisting with loading and unloading merchandise. Management was fun to work with, we worked as a team. The co-workers were all interesting in that most of us owned a variety of animals. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing assigned tasks timely and efficiently."
good,Customers are priority and repeat customers become new friends. Enjoyed the team oriented environment. Everyone worked together and communication was key in completing daily tasks.  Management  treated employees with respect and as human beings.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and being able to provide good customer service.  They had very supportive management and my colleagues were great to work with.
good,I got to learn a lot woking in the store.  I met many fun people and it taught me how to manage my time wisely.  I loved the management and I will take the skills I learned here through life.
good,enjoyable work atmosphere enjoy returning customers and products we sell hours are variable which fits my lifestyle management is always open to hear employees ideas
good,"Very good place to work in. Went through a few managers but ended up with someone who finally knew what he was doing. The manager was very informative, helped out, and was a big part of the team. Everyone knew everyone pretty well, got to be good friends with most of my Team Members. Everyone worked well together, the store had come a long way since I had first started working there. I would have to say Tractor Supply is a very good company to work for."
good,"I had a very good experience working at Tractor Supply, fun place to work and the other employees are easy to get along with. Everybody knows everyone and I appreciated having regular customers."
good,I would clock in say hello to everyone set up my register unlock the doors clean the doors help customers any way that i could was learning something new everyday my coworkers and i always had fun manager  was great
good,"Loved this place!! Moved on to job that was more in ""my wheelhouse"" but would go back in a minute. They take care of their own and don't hold you back from growth. Not the highest paid place but there is growth and tons of potenial"
good,"work culture is good and challenging and good place to work ,job work life balance is seems to be also good management is bit critical  and also job culture is little busy"
good,Great place to work if your looking for a place to work through college or other school! also has opportunities for growth!
good,"I worked for this company when I was in high school and LOVED it; so, when I got the chance to go back as an assistant manager I took the opportunity. Though it took some time to find my niche I liked it once again. However, my old manager didn't teach me the things I needed to know; so, when a new manager came along I was treated horribly and on the verge of being let go because no one was willing to teach me my job functions. How am I to ask questions on how to do my job when I supposedly don't know how to do it or what it is? Those who are below the store manager in training need a more hands on training approach and not just a day or two on a computer reading things."
good,Its a realy big place and its great that they put one in morrisville
good,"Enjoyed every day to work at a feed store. Allot of physical work to do that kept me productive and busy, Learned allot more in farming tools. Managment was great to have. Co-workers were hard working and fun to be with accomplishing tasks for the day. Customers were prpobably the hardest to deal with but not really on a every day to day. Only once in awhile but nothing to difficult to handle. Other than that enjoyed my time working there."
good,This was my first legit job! i loved it! i do wanna work there again.You will learn a lot here.
good,"as a part time job, I learned about customer service and how it important it was in a matter of short time."
good,Lifting 50lbs and up every day was thoroughly exciting for me. I was very well experienced in farming and had a great oppertunity to work at TSC for over a year. I had learned allot from my elder co workers and was an attentive listener as well. There was very well high quality managment and supervison attained. I was mostly working with customers and never had many challenging situations i couldn't handle myself. There was one day out every week where me and my other emloyees had to work frieght early in the am and quickly and accurately got work done in appropiate time. Having fun but being steady at my job assignments was my to priority to be well established in. 
good,In one yr I went from running a register to be an Asst Manager. I loved the job and taking care of the customers. My co-workers were very hard working. The hardest part of the job was leaving it.
good,Fun place to work with a family type environment. They are very supportive of you in your current position and will help you advance.
good,Previous employment from longer than three years ago. Work environment was an enjoyable experience. I gained a strong sense of customer service skills from this establishment while working directly with people. Staffing and management were very friendly and supportive.
good,Working hard to ensure customers are doing excellent and making sure the store is in order. Cross training throughout the store helps prepare you for any task or problems that may arise at any given time
good,It was a great place to work with lots of incentives and fun during a normal work day.  A lot of room for advancement.  Management was always ready to lend a hand to help where needed.
good,I loved this job other than the pay it could have been a bit better for what I was doing loves my coworkers they treated me well and the people were great
good,Has a great working environment. Not the best work to life but easy to get off for life events. The workers are great to be around and over all is just all around a great place to work.
good,Good place to work but standing on your feet all day isnt good They should gives 2 breaks in an 8 hour shift.. You get a lunch break and you never knew if it was gonna be 30 min. or an hour until time to leave then they would tell you. There were no breaks other thatn that. And the pay should be a little higher for the hard work done there. Good people that work there and hard workers.
good,All the people I worked were very helpful during my time there. I learned a lot from my colleagues and almost always had a good time during my shifts.
good,I only worked there for two weeks.i had to move out of state. But my time there was exactly what I wanted time went fast and I did just about everything I wanted like doing stock ormanagement and even using a forklift.it was good wall it lasted
good,Working with the people at Tractor Supply is nothing less than fascinating and fun! The customers who came into tractor supply also made the work place very enjoyable.
good,Working in this job is very fun. Some heavy lifting and customer service could be stressful but very rewarding and relaxed atmosphere. Very good management.
good,"Fantastic support from the management team, there was a real sense of community! The company offers plenty of growth opportunities for motivated employees!"

good,I loved working here. My boss was very respectful and worked with me. I learned a lot and made some great friends.  an over all wonderful company to work for.
good,"A great place for a starter job or 2nd. job but don't get the hours even full time less then 40 hrs. a week, advancement are slow coming due to staff it 3/4 part time"
good,"They work extremely well around other schedules. Lots of training, good attitudes at work. Management is over the top supportive. They make the job fun"
good,"Excellent place to work, usually require nights and weekends to be worked often. Good advancement opportunities and friendly atmosphere. Being outgoing and friendly is very helpful."
good,"Was very fun as you get to deal with new people and new challenges daily, the management staff was excellent in making sure all needs were taken care of."
good,"The staff and management are super outgoing and fun, sometimes work does get a little slow, but they will always have something for you to do.  Overall, very good place to work at."
good,"The pay was average for a retail position, but the culture was relaxed, team members were great, and customers made it easy to help them find what they needed."
good,"The job is rather relaxed and easy to get a hold of. Management is rather friendly and happy to help teach you. Many of the customers are friendly and will understand if you don't know something. "
good,"The managers are all extremely kind, especially the district manager.  You are given freedom to carry out tasks however you wish, but in a productive and effective way.  I absolutely loved working with the customers that came in and out of those doors."
good,"A typical day at work includes taking care of customers needs and straightening up the store. I built a great relationship with my manager and my coworkers. I think the manager could have been a bit more strict about being late to work, but the workplace was great."
good,I enjoyed working here because I am skilled with most everything I came in contact with there and knew what feed was which and what medicine or mechanics were needed for the customers job.
good,Tractor supply offers many opportunities for advancement.  They encourage the team to grow. Their mission and values are the driving force behind their success
good,working at tractor supply was very relaxed and laid back. there's not a whole lot to do all the time besides straighten up the store but it was a really good first job for a 16 year old.
good,Was a very fun place to work at. Adored my customers and co-workers until new manager was brought in. He didn’t appreciate any of the workers and was just a rude man and very hard to work for.
good,I was able to learn very quickly with such a great team. I worked my way from part time cashier to full time feed specialist in such a short period of time.
good,"Was extremely sad to hand in a notice, the team is amazing to work with and the store manager is a laugh.  Very rare to find a manager to joke so freely with and pick on throughout the day.  Unlike other retail where if you are a cashier you are strictly a cashier, working here you have a variety of tasks.  Recovery, freight, working with planograms, handling feed, register, etc. Every day is different.  Most of the customers are a blast to talk to and help, many love cracking jokes as well. The team is very dedicated to their work and determined to get things done which creates a good working environment.  Pay is retail pay, always low and wonky, hours are sporadic but you almost always have the same amount a week. Shifts are often only a few hours long, personal opinion would decide who likes and who doesn't."
good,"Tractor Supply is a great company to work for whether you are starting out as a team member or part of the leadership team. Full time team members have excellent benefits(health insurance, paid vacation and sick time.)"
good,Productive and fun working company. I really enjoyed working with customers and working with the employees. It was the best job I had worked at so far
good,Teamwork is key here. Everyone has the same mindset and goal at the end of the day and are willing to help out in every way possible. The managers are really relaxed.
good,Great company to work for! Leadership is great and company is very family friendly! Great benefit opportunities are available as well as skill development courses.
good,Great co workers and fun work environment . Work is very simple and easy to learn and not extremely strenuous. Customers are good and most know what they want before they come in.
good,I have loved my time at TSC and still do actually . Some positions require a lot of dedication . There are many opportunities with this company and they stand by the values they set forth.
good,Tractor Supply Company is a great place to spend your working time whether part-time or full-time.  Truly enjoy the teamwork and customer interaction.
good,I love everyone from my team members to my managers to my district manager. They have all been helpful with advancing my career and offering advise and truly have your best interest in mind. Its a fun place to work and there is monthly online training so you are not expected to know everything right off the bat.
good,"Great company, a lot of opportunities for growth. It didn’t take me long at all from going from a part time cashier to assistant manager. I started off as a part time cashier and worked and strived hard to get where I am today. It’s a very fast paced work environment and I love the challenges. Staying busy and organized is what I enjoy."
good,"I loved every single moment I had at Tractor Supply. Any piece of negativity I had was exclusively due to one single bad co-worker. Morning shifts - about seven hours - felt like they took a while, but the evening shifts - about six hours - flew by every single time. There are two different shift, a front role and a back role. In the front role, you will need people skills. If you're a cashier, you'll need a custom made script to repeat as naturally as possible in order to keep things as kind and fast as possible. You can try to be as custom as possible, but you will run out of material fast. You'll need to know the layout of the store, but most real problems you can shed off to customer service or one of the floor walkers. If you go for one of those roles, then you'll need to know the ins and outs of the products. In the back, you'll stock animal food, drive forklifts, assemble tools - like wheel barrows - and occasionally help a customer. No matter who you are, you'll learn to be a cashier, so that you can give the full time cashiers lunch breaks."
good,Great place to work. The team is pretty much a family and everyone looks out for one another. The company likes to advance from with in and are willing to work with you.
good,"it was very easy to pick up on things at this company, I learned everything that I needed to know within the first couple of weeks and it was very easy to teach others what they needed to know and the easiest way to do it. the management was very nice and easy to understand. the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"After having worked there for more than seven years, it was the best job I've ever had. The work was never dull, most of my customers were nice, and the staff became as family. That being said, I grew complacent and am now seeking other opportunities to better suit my skills."
good,"Tractor supply as a whole is a good business, I enjoyed working for them and will continue to shop there.  My boss was very awesome and understanding."
good,I worked both 2nd and 3rd shifts while I was there. I liked that they had 3 available shifts so that I could attend school. They take safety very seriously. The hardest part of the job was picking bag in the orderfill department. I believe they do a good job of recognizing individuals who work hard and want to advance.
good,Great opportunity for advancements. Fun work environment. Loved the customer base. Lifting is an everyday occurrence. Management is always willing to listen
good,When I first started I loved the head manager we had but he ended up leaving. Then we got a new guy and he was horrible and disrespectful towards workers and customers.
good,"all in all a fast paced enviourment with an eye for detail,always room for improvement with no mistackes ,they want everything done right the 1st time if at all possable"
good,Typical day would have to be help the customers who came into the store. I learned a lot about the farm equipment and the pieces that need to added to it or replaced. The management there was awesome once we got the right people into place. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the grumpy customers. I loved my job getting to know new people and making lots of friends. Along with having the regular customers coming and asking about you and the family or where things are.
good,Tractor supply was a great place to work for. Relaxed atmosphere and adequate compensation. Did not have to work seven days a week. I regret leaving this company.
good,"Like stated in the reason that I left, the only reason I left TSC was because of the lack of hours and general nasty attitude of our new manager. The company is a wonderful company to work for, and even though I left I still am a frequent shopper and love being back there. I was just back there tonight for Christmas shopping! I highly recommend TSC as a place to work, just make sure to check out the management team first - as with any retail environment."
good,"typical day is stocking shelves and helping customers, constantly on your feet throughout the shift, and lots of heavy lifting of feed bags, fencing and many other things. friendly coworkers and management is both knowledgeable and willing to work with their employees"
good,I loved working at Tractor Supply. My Co-workers and boss were very friendly and helped me alot when i was pregnant. Great customer service. i really enjoyed helping customers get what they needed.
good,"A typical day at work was very early most of the time. It was very organized as to what we had planned that day. Everyone had their own jobs. Once it got daylight everyone really got moving, the customers were fabulous. One of the first things I learned there was teamwork, teamwork makes the dream work baby! The culture is very fast pace, SATISFY the customer no matter what. Management was amazing, she knew how to handle certain situations between employees. She also made it very clear that there was no tolerance for BS. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, but I'm 5'2 and 118 lbs so anything is hard for me to pick up. The best part about it was the good days we all had, with the right team put together we just had a good time together. Joking, playing around, laughing, helping each other. But all the while taking care of business!"
good,TSC is a great place to learn about how to run a company as well as provides plenty of room for advancement. I have learned much about inventory and working with clients and vendors in my 2 years.
good,I was fortunately to have a good manager to train me and work with me on a flexible schedule. That store is now a training store for managers in this district.
good,Love working with the customers that talk to you about  their animals and the stories that they have of their life. It can be a little stressful but also very fun and a learning experience. I have learned how to take care of some farm animals and love being able to answer questions that people may have about them and if I don't have knowledge of it I definitely get someone who does.
good,"Loved this company, the people I worked with are fantastic. Great feel and the customers USUALLY know what they want. On a corporate level they are a little big stressed but it's to be expected with a burst in business."
good,TSC is a company that lives by their Mission Statement and the Values that they set. TSC is a lifestyle that is geared to provide services to small ranch and farming customers
good,This company is so wonderful to work for. They make you feel like part of the family and in turn you pass that feeling onto the customers. You can learn a lot while working here about the products and about animals and farm work. You can also learn about every day problems and the solutions to fix them using the products in the store. The only issue I have is the pay is low and the raises are regular but not very high. Maybe .20 a year. It's hard to advance at that rate and the managers only make one dollar more than regular employees.
good,A typical day is busy and there is lots to do. I have learned a lot about customer service and merchandising. The management team and employees are very enjoyable to work with.
good,Learning about farm and ranch daily was an awesome experience. Everything in the store was most of the time satisfaction to the customers. The culture in the customers was always a different learning experience. Lifting heavy feed and putting lawn equipment was sometimes heavy work but it was a great work out too.
good,"Busy store  helpful and friendly associates, actually care about customer needs as well as their employees!  I have never had such a good experience as a new employee as within this company, and I have 40 years of retail experience."
good,Great Company to work for. Provides great benefits and a bunch of room for advancement. Everybody lives by the Mission and Values of the company which is no doubt the reason for the success.
good,"Tractor Supply is a very friendly, fun and home like place of work. I learned many things i did not know on various topics, such as wiring, welding, ATVs, UTVs, lawn mowers and other products sold at Tractor Supply."
good,Everyone at Tractor Supply Co. I encountered was nice and willing to help me in any way possible. My team leader and director were great examples of how a seasoned IT professional should conduct themselves. They have amazing benefits. Tractor also just moved into a new building it has a really nice gym. Overall I could have asked for a better place to work.
good,A typical day at work I would run the cash register and help customers with their needs. I would answer the phone anytime it would ring and do customer service over the phone as well. When we closed I would clean the back rooms and bathrooms and recover the store. The management there was amazing. I didnt get along with all of my co-workers but never let the customers know. It was a job to get me through high school and it did that without me being afraid that i would ever be out of a job.
good,Store manager was well verse in how the store should have been ran as well as merchandising.  He was willing to help out in the back as well as on the floor when crew was understaffed.
good,Great store to work for. Manager always lets you off work if you need to be and you ask off in a timely manner and nobody else has taken that day yet. Coworkers are all very helpful and there when you need them to help you with work.
good,great people to work with and great customers!! will work with school schedule! great benefits! management is really good to work.
good,A typical day working at Tractor Supply Co. is very enjoyable yet busy. Tractor Supply is a place where you know your customers and your customers know you. Developing a good relationship with your customers plays a major role when it comes to making sales!
good,"At TSC, I enjoy my customers while helping them find their pet needs. I learn new things daily. The management has always worked with me with all my needs. The co-workers are always helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is saying bye to my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is having interaction with my sweet customers. Overall, Tractor Supply is a part time job i plan on keeping for a long time."
good,good place to work nice people easy work ok amount of work to do  to do decent managers needs to give more hours got alot of great product
good,You meet new people everyday and you are always learning new things. Fun place to work
good,"Tractor Supply Company is a very good place to work. I love the customer service that I provided. We had outstanding customers for the most part. My boss was a very good and well rounded supervisor."
good,"A typical work day consisted of helping customers and restocking shelves.  The company was very fun to work for, but as an employee I always felt like the store managers had very little to do with daily activities and projects. Some store managers give very little direction with projects."
good,"This was my first job while in high school, they worked with me and also gave me and awesome first work experience! My co-workers were awesome and would help with anything, we all had fun but still got the job done! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers as they came in on a daily basis."
good,Great workplace. Solid room for advancement.willingness to teach each and every employee
good,"20 years of working with customers"
good,This place is awesome to work. Everyone is so nice. It is a very friendly environment where you eventually learn the regular's names. You work hard and also have fun.
good,When I worked at Tractor Supply I would go in a start my regular day which was getting the store set up for Grand Opening. I learned how to do planogram's and how to build shelves.I also learned how to read the sku numbers and where everything goes. I always enjoyed going to work because it was a lot of fun to me and I got along with everyone great. The hardest part of my job I thought was carrying the feed. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting out of the house and coming to a place where i was comfortable with my surroundings and always had fun.
good,"I wish to become full time someday, it is a great place to meet knew people and see people you know.  There isn't  many benefits for part time employees, and during the winter months after Christmas there isn't many hours to work. But usually around the middle of march thing start picking up. It is a fun place to work especially when you ave other team members that you know, if you don't know them you will get to know them just like family."
good,"It was so much fun - employees were easy to get along with.  Helpful and they all had a sense of humor!  "
good,"We'd clock in and meet in the middle and tell us what needed to be done that day. Go to our lines and the conveyor belt begins to move, and you get your pallet ready and stack each thing by its product. Stack them trailer height of the truck then wrap them with the pre wrap and load it onto the truck then move to the next pallet. I learned how to stack and wrap the pallets, fun co-workers and were very friendly and helpful. Hardest part was standing for 10hrs, most enjoyable was the end of the night."
good,This was a great company to work for. There is always room for advancement.
good,TSC was a great place to work. I learned many skills regarding work ethic and teamwork. I also had great opportunity to advance.
good,"My job is truly an amazing job, with amazing people. They are dedicated to making everyone comfortable. They don’t want to push you to hard but just enough to get you to succeed."
good,The job is fun and easy to do. TSC has a good structured plan day to day to distribute tasks among its employees making it possible to get things accomplished. However the pay is a little lower as it usually is in retail. TSC also has a very good system for taking care of customers except they seemed to be a bit challenged at keeping stores stocked completely and the rain-check system does not work very well. When customers are waiting for items to come in and they usually don't then you see customers getting a bit frustrated. Other than that its a really great place to work.
good,There is an abundance of interesting and challenging experiences working at Tractor Supply Company. Not being knowledgeable in certain aspects of farming and farm animals was quite interesting at first. Thankfully most customers were forgiving while I learned my way around the store and overall I have had a great time working at Tractor Supply
good,Tractor supply Inc mixing center is a great company to work for... Nice people and a chance for advancement.. Easy work and fair pay for the job......
good,Tractor Supply was one of my favorite jobs because my co-workers and managers were always very helpful to each other and me. I also learned quite a bit working here like how to operate a forklift and refill propane tanks overall it was a very enjoyable experience working here
good,Tractor supply was a fun place to work and there are so many people and opportunities you get from working there.  The staff is nice and always helpful to you and customers. You always have something going on and theres never a boring moment working at Tractor Supply.
good,Worked as a team and as an individual. Hours depends on your job position. Dress code was casual. Shifts were flexible but also rotated. Weekends were mandatory no matter which position.
good,"Tractor supply is a great place to work at. They work great with your hours of availability. The work environment is fun, positive, upbeat and friendly."
good,"While this job pays decently and has great benefits, its a very intense and fast pace job that you need to be used to and willing to do. Coming from slow paced and human interactive jobs it would be a hard switch."
good,Trace supply is a great place to work. The atmosphere is nice there are great customers and you have things to keep you busy. I like the people I work with.
good,The managers are very accommodating to your availability. The work environment is positive and fun. Everyone collaborates well together and we always help each other out when needed.
good,I loved working for tractor supply.  If they paid more I would love to go back.  I just needed something that paid better.  Considering working two jobs just so I can work there again 😊
good,I really love my job. Being full time they are now scheduling just above 30 hours..I like most need to have a 40 hour a week job. I've expressed my concerns but nothing is changing so I decided I need to explore my options to grow with another company
good,"Started when I was 17, great flexibility to school and college, did right by me when I had personal things at home. Great upper management in my district."
good,"Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere, and the best part seeing all the pets that come in. The local vet would stop by once a month and do vaccination clinics."
good,Not to sure what to think. I really enjoyed myself  while working there. Liked my job  and the people. Some of the management was not to smart. I felt that I did my job and I did it well.
good,"Would have loved to stay. Great management, co-workers, and customers, but not enough hours or pay. Worked the register, greated customers and assisted with their needs. Answered the phones and transfered customer when needed. Kept front area clean and stocked. My store was great and everything I saw from my store manager and up showed that the company cared about their customers and employees."
good,The atmosphere is fun and relaxed and everyone gets along. By far my favorite place of employment. Management keeps things moving and always has something for us to do even in the slowe days.
good,Tractor Supply is a great place to work. I became close with a lot of regular customers that made my job enjoyable along with my staff. Tractor supply has a mobile pet clinic that employees would also get a discount for as well.
good,I worked here for 8 months and had great Mannager and team leads. The pay could have been better for the cost of living here but over all it was decent. My tractor supply was very accommodating with me being pregnant at the time and very understanding when I needed time off and such. If you plan to live in Lebanon tractor supply is a great company here to work for!
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere. Most if not all are very laid back and easy going as well as friendly."
good,Its a good place to work . The management was team oriented and always willing to work alongside you. I feel its a good first job when coming back to the work force
good,"i loved working at tractor supply i was around the things i love and got to interact and help people just like me. i learned new people skills.  and how to run a register fast and effectively. the manger at the time was very helpful and had a great attitude. the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, which i learned how to deal with in a calm manner. but the good outweighs the bad its normally always busy and time fly's by. great customer service!"
good,I actually really enjoyed my job here I just didn't make enough money to live off of week by week as a part time employee. It's a really friendly environment and actually a very enjoyable job
good,"I enjoyed being a part of the team at TSC. I realized working there how much customer satisfaction truly affects all company's and at TSC that's their number 1 goal. The environment working there was always comfortable, fun, and educational."
good,"I really enjoy working at Tractor Supply CO. The job is fast paced, and the opportunity to learn about many things is a big plus. Most customers know what they want, and if not can usually tell you what they are looking for. Great management is also a big plus!"
good,"A fair warning if you are scared of animals, you will not be able to last long. Animals come in on the daily and also they have animal swap in the parking lot. With this job, you will learn a lot about outdoor activites."
good,I highly enjoyed working at tractor supply! Management was super flexible with my schedule. Everyone i worked with was super friendly. I would love to work here again.
good,The most enjoyable part of my 15yrs with the company has been the customers. I have learned a lot about farm animals and what to treat them with. I have also learned a lot about different feed options for animals as well
good,"Worked as a contractor. The team and company I worked with was GREAT! Great work, life balance. Management listens and understands the employees. I recommend this company to anybody on the job market."
good,the job was a great job but the management was not friendly always doing and saying hurtful things to some of the employes. thats why i left it was horrible
good,"TSC is a great company that will take care of you from the second they hire you to the second you leave. Managers are all very understanding and willing to work with you and your needs. The only drawbacks are that the benefits are not very good and part-time employees do not get time and a half if they work on a recognized holiday. Also, the store is only closed for three days out of the year so if you want any of those other holidays off, put in for it months in advance."
good,"Working at Tractor Supply was a genuinely fun experience. The other team members were very welcoming and made me feel like I belonged there. Although the work can be difficult and hard at times, it is definitely worth it."
good,"I would recommend tractor supply company to anyone who is looking for a job. Great employees as well as a very clean working environment, the cleanest one I myself have ever seen."
good,"The most I enjoyed working at Tractor Supply was helping the costumers and being a team memmber "

good,Regardless of pay and benefits this job was fun.  I knew about animals and their needs and could help customers without problems.  I loved the manager we had and hated to leave but couldn't make it on the pay.  Yes I would go back to working for a TSC in the Houston area.
good,It is ok. i liked it.It was ok. Money was ok. no advancement.had to explain. work hard make money have fun. loved myy job disliked  payroll and percentage allowed
good,"if they handt of overstaff ehen i had first started and laid us all off i eould probably still ne working for them. great pay great benifits, paid breaks. matching 401k. had to keep working so i found another job the day after the lay off."
good,"overall tractor supply company in irmo, sc is a well ran company. The manager is very laid back and really cares about his associates. If you are a student in any grade they work really well with your schedule without forcing you to come in when you do not want to."
good,"Tractor Supply Co. never seems to receive a bad rap, by anyone I've ever spoken to about it. What's more, is that the distribution center I worked at was filled with ambitious fellow-co-workers which helped motivate me. As a team, we pushed each other, and cheered anyone who struggled all the way to each deadline."
good,"Dundee, Michigan has the greatest customers and we are fortunate enough to be located in a farm community where most of us are related and everyone knows everyone."
good,I was really disappointed when I had to leave Tractor Supply. I always had a blast when I went in to work and the culture was so positive and uplifting.
good,Plant your roots here for a great place to grow. A lot of job advancement opportunities. It's a company of great people that honestly cares about each other.
good,"Great place to work, the compensation and benefits are fair, they care about your as a person not just an employee number. Three weeks of vacation, and day one health care coverage."
good,I truly enjoyed my experience of employment at Tractor supply company.It was fun and fast paced. It kept me on my feet and there was always something to do. I made great friends and really learned alot working there.
good,Tractor supply was a fun place to work for.  I miss eing around the local farmers and country people.  Everything there was down to earth and interesting.

good,Tractor Supply is an awesome work environment. The team is wonderful. The management always pushes you to do your best and always makes you feel accomplished. It's more like a family.
good,"The pay is excellent"
good,"It was nice working there, good benifits just that our new manager changed everything up and always messed up the schedule so we had to stay longer or we were short on people."
good,"You go in to work and right away customers already know who you are and everybody wants to know how your day is going. What I learned at tractor supply is a lot to put on this but to sum it up I can say was consistency and patience. Management knows what they are doing and they know how to handle conflicts in the workplace very well. The place is enjoyable and a place you can consider as a second family. The hardest part of the job is handling those ""bad customers"". The customers that tend to push hard to get you to give them discounts for no reason or complains for nothing even though you are going above and beyond for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see a customer leave so happy with their purchase knowing that we helped them achieve that happiness."
good,"Typical day at work includes morning prices changes, running the cash register for customers, helping with stock and freight, answering phone calls, assisting the needs of the customers and coworkers."
good,I love working at TSC.... this is a top notch company that cares about their employees and customers. This company professes legendary customer services and does promote that employees will do whatever it takes to keep a customer happy. Great training is provided each month.
good,"Cashing out customers and helping with their questions they had,"
good,"My time at Tractor Supply was shortlived, but worth it. The management was exceptional, the product was interesting, and the customers were enjoyable."
good,"I have moved to management with in 6 months of working there, I love my job but very hard work and not enough pay. it is retail and you have to work hard, get bonuses IF you make store plan."
good,I did become a certified fork lift driver while working for Tractor Supply. But I mainly was working with stocking. The only down fall was their wasn't a very competitive pay rate.
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday i was sceduled, was able to give my knowledge of horses and other animals to customers that were unsure, helped customers with carryouts when needed. I enjoyed being around my co-workers i was working with, we all got along, management was awesome. The hardest thing was when we would get our truck in and had to unload and restock the shelves, but we all worked as a team and got the job done which i loved."
good,Absolutely loved working for this company. Now the management was crazy lots of people who wanted power over each other and the head manager was quite interesting if you needed days off you hardly got them. I think that it would be a great business with out the head manager there and someone else take it over. Its fast pace and very busy.
good,"A typical day at work was start my responsibilities as a material handler,  keep productivity, being able to do different tasks."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  Their was opportunity for advancement as long as you worked hard and showed initiative.  A typical day at work was uncovering customer needs and trying to provide the best customer service as possible.  I would also set planograms and build displays for products.
good,This is a great company to work for who really care about there team members and reward you for your hard work. There is not much advancement unless you want to move down south.
good,"Tractor Supply was a good place to work and succeed. The General Manager was competitive, but also took the time to teach and mentor. They have a very good program in their Tractor University, which is a corporate based training program that all members of management attend. Very progressive company that is a great place to work."
good,"great job to meet and help people, you learn a lot about the farm life if you didn't know a lot already, my managers were awesome. Fun, loving, outgoing people. I enjoyed being around them and coming into work. The hardest part of the job was knowing all of the stuff in the place. I found a new product everyday simply because people came in and asked if we had it and I had know idea what they were talking about. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. It never really felt like I was at work just because everyone there was always caring and funny. We always made the harder days (slow days) fun so we would actually want to be there."
good,"Hard work, but fun environment so it makes work enjoyable. Teaches you a lot in everyday life. Good management, co-workers are easy going. Self-rewarding job"
good,"Every day I learn something new and it makes it that much more exciting to go into work. I keep things organized and stocked on a daily basis and management is always in order and makes sure everyone's tasks are completed before they leave. My co-workers make every day fun and everyone is always in a good mood. The hardest part of the job for me is not knowing all the merchandise, but with time I will learn it. It's always enjoyable making someone's day."
good,very enjoyable work place that has a very open door and closeness policy
good,"Productive setting, very enjoyable place to work, good people both customers and Team members"
good,"Work was fun, and learned alot about leadership and commitments to sale. Management was approachable and always had an open door."
good,"start my day with a cup of free coffee, get all my paperwork together and start planning for the rest of the work day."
good,"Greet and help every customer, answer phones, order product, merchandise."
good,Wonderful company to be a part of. With the right management you could really advance but as part-time theres really not anything to gain.
good,Able to advance to management levels quickly. Friendly family oriented company.
good,I loved my 21 yrs at Tractor Supply I only wish that the company would listen to both sides of the problem instead of Management. I would give anything to go back and prove myself again that it wasn't all onesided
good,"its a great place to work.  my manager is approachable, fair, organized and keeps the store a great place to work. I’ve worked there two years and had two managers. They both had different personalities with the same goal in keeping the store the best it could be"
good,Just need a retail background and a good attitude and willingness to work hard. The management is knowledgeable in farm and ranch and overall general retail
good,I love my job. I’m surrounded by different types of animals everyday and meet wonderful people. Learn a lot everyday about different things. Fantastic place to learn and grow.
good,The store and company is such a great location and company to work for.  People as a team are great to work with as well.  I enjoy working with my team and my customers.
good,"My overall experience working with Tractor Supply has helped me improve my customer service skills, also has thought me what it's like to workas a team."
good,"Ive been here 6 months now, my review came in and it came back great!  I go in with a positive attitude each and everyday!!  I love my co-workers, we all help each other as a team and get what needs to be done, done!  If someone calls for help on register or loadout, we drop what we're doing and make it happen as customers come first!!  We know our mission and do it!"
good,"Always a new learning experience and something different weekly. "
good,Easy-going and friendly. Hobart location supercedes the rest with an excellent staff. Customers are loyal and manager is flexible and fair. Managers are present and helpful.
good,"I loved my job here, the manager is like a mother to me but the assistant manager on the other hand has to go. I loved the environment and the people I worked with."
good,I love my job at tractor supply company it’s great we treat everyone like family in the store. It’s a awesome place to work for anyone. And you move up quickly
good,Great place to work. It’s to bad you don’t get paid for the work you do. You have to work there because you love it not because you need the money. But they’re really good working with you if you need time off or if you need a day off and it’s usually not a problem to switch with people to get time off.
good,"Tractor Supply was my favorite place to work. I always recommend this place. The management was great and you really get to know the customers on a personal level. I was so sad to leave when I did, but I will never forget this place."

good,Wonderful company. They respect all employees and take care of each other from the top of the company to the very bottom. Working for them is amazing because the company also helps with college and understands single parenting.
good,"Tractor Supply Company is a wonderful place for you to learn and build skills in retail. It teaches you time management, leadership, and empowerment. Tractor Supply has many opportunities within their company."
good,At tractor supply focus is really placed on customer satisfaction. Team members and managers are equipped to help customers. We have regular customers who we have a good working relationship with and it makes work go by smoother to have a good working environment.
good,Besides my manager all my coworkers and i were close like family and i loved working there everyday! I never had a sore moment excpet for when my manger would make me stop my job just to take a shower even though i showered right before i came to work. I even lived 5 minutes away which is ridiculous.
good,Tractor Supply is a phenomenal place to work. I enjoy it so much and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a job. I definitely love my job very much.
good,Tractor Supply Company is a great place to work if you want to advance your career and work with good people in an outstanding culture. if you like constant change and a positive team environment I would highly recommend TSC.
good,Friendly and inviting work enviroment! All members collaborated for the benefit of the team and overall satisfaction of their customers and bottom line.
good,Nice place to work. Good management and nice people. An average day was working the register and organizing the stock. Not much else besides cleaning.
good,Everyday is different you just never know what's going to happen. Customers keep life interesting it's fun to help customers figure out their project needs.
good,"Absolutely love our customers plus it's good hard work that is fun if you make it. The management is wonderful and fun to work with along with the rest of the staff. The best part of the job are the customers and of course the dogs that come in, along with the occasional goat/bunny. The hardest part of this job... no such thing. "
good,"A wonderful company to work for! A lot of retail jobs feel like the workers are dispensable and easily replaced, but I never once felt like they were advertising my position behind my back or the various other tricks retail life will pull. Very straightforward and honest, they will work with you. Teamwork is a must, days can be slow or fast-paced depending on the day of the week and season. Very rewarding job, also one of the few places that formally recognizes employees going the extra mile."
good,"I really enjoyed being hands on at tractor supply, driving the forklift, stocking animal feed and helping customers. I liked the physical part of work, getting a work out at work. The competitiveness of store to store was enjoyable as well."
good,"TSC is a customer driven company, as long as your store is clean, priced and fully stocked the customer is always happy and will contribute to the store using surveys. TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTOMER AND THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!!!!!"
good,I had a really good experience here and would highly recommend some to work here. My only issue came when summer was coming to an end and I needed to change my hours back before school and my manager told me to either deal with the hours I was given or I could find a new job.
good,"My time with Tractor Supply Company was some of the best working environments I have experienced. Day to day interaction with customers was fabulous! Interaction with Management and other Team Members is above and beyond the norm. It is like working with family, all Team Members get to know each other very well, and get along great. I would highly suggest applying for a position here if you like life ""Out There""!"
good,"They had poor management. If there was something going on and you told them they would tell u they will take care of it, but they never do. It was a fun place to work at but not very following through with things."
good,"A typical day is stocking the feed for the livestock, checking out customers at the register, and helping customers with carry outs. I learned how to approach customers and the proper way to provide assistance. The management it great. The hardest part of the job has to be all the heavy lifting. Most enjoyable is working with my co-workers and being around the customers. It's a very great environment."
good,"I had an amazing work experience there, I worked for tractor supply for almost 4 years, pay is great but the PTO is even better. Great employees to work with, and very good culture."
good,Great place to work. If I could get my job back her I’d never stop till I got it back. This was a great first job. I highly recommended this job to anyone.
good,This was the best job I have ever had. The environment was great the people were great. I would work hear again in a heart beat. They were willing to work with the hours and find the best fit for the employees. If I could have gotten more then part time and more per hour I would have stayed forever.
good,Very relaxed but can be fast paced and everyone gets along well. The customers are almost never rude. The times can be changed to fit your lifestyle better.
good,"Awesome environment to work and meet new people and personalities to work with but the management is a little off about your well being.Sonetimes they don't care if you have a personal problem going on at home.If you have a death in your family and it's your spouse,mother,father, or child they will ask you a thousand questions and then ask you are u coming back to work the same day."
good,Overall it is a great place to work. You have a choice of 4 different schedules to work. There is no dress code. The pay is reasonable and room to move up.
good,"I learned to manage my time more, It gave me confidence and skills. I didn't care for working night shift but there was night shift diff. "
good,It's a very quick-paced place to work. There is always something to do and you get pulled in many directions but the management was great and it made it a fun place to work.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. The atmosphere is friendly and helpful, kind and giving to customers. The customers relationships are so memorable and strong. I recommend the experience very much."
good,"I learned a lot from the company,  I came in got my computer head set and my tickets call out my numbers on it to my head set and it tell me were to go pick from rising on my elc pallet jack when I'm done picking my items on my ticket I rap and take to ship lane ."
good,"Nice PT Job - Would like to see FT Advancement for Higher Wages"
good,I love working at Tractor Supply. The work enviromwnt is way better then other retailers I have worked for.  Much smaller then big box store which is good to be able to get to know your customer.
good,"I would definitely recommend anybody to work here. Great managers, and a great workplace environment. Sometimes it was fast-paced, but sometimes it was a little slow. Perfect for first-time workers who think they can work hard."
good,A typical day there wasn't one every day was different. The management was good you could always go to them with any problems concerns or questions you might of had at the time. The workplace is enjoyable. The employees are always willing to help each other out no matter the situation. The hardest part of the job i thought was at times was trying to multi-task while being at the register and cashing people out. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers and meeting new people that came in to shop.
good,"you cant go wrong for a first job they are great in every way, wonderful to their people and really care about customers. and will do anything to go above and byond and they notice the loyal people both employees and customers"
good,"Work was often fast paced but fun due to excellent coworkers. Customers tended to demand excellence, and we provided it. The hardest part was unloading deliveries in a timely manner, which took practice."
good,"the boss is a great leader and very helpful to every thing you had a question too. The day to day was pulling feed from the backroom to the floor with pick listing, putting signs/price cuts."
good,Loved working there but my extracurricular activities caused me to leave.  Would highly recommend working there. They are willing to work with your schedule if you need days off.
good,I didn’t have a problem with my manager but other co workers there. Very laid back environment when it is ran the right way! Left due to lack of hours.
good,It is a fun place to work but does require physical labor.  I have learned a lot about the retail business with this company.  Work hours vary but the manager makes all efforts to ensure employees gets the hours they wish and can work.
good,"it's a great company, I can't really say anything negative except I need full-time work or another part time job. And to my surprise they are willing to work around another part-time job if I could find one."
good,"The atmosphere is different than other retail places, we do not rush the customer, and as a result the customers tend to be more relaxed and friendly. Legendary Customer Service really is important to the company as a whole"
good,I really enjoyed every aspect of my job at Tractor Supply Co. Everything from customer relations to stocking the shelves to assembling merchandise. I enjoyed working with all the fellow employees and the management team.
good,"Really enjoyed working for tractor supply and still in contact with the fellow employs that I worked with, we became family. Can be stressful, just as much as any customer service job can be, people are difficult to deal with, but otherwise great place to work."
good,"My time at TSC was nothing less than great. Good job, good people. Listens to their employees, and always focused and forward looking when it comes to improving working processes."
good,I worked at tractor supply for almost a year and it was one of the best jobs I have ever had. They were always willing to work with my rodeos and horse shows.
good,I started with this company when they just got done putting up the building walls. And we helped put the store together to make it what it is. Which made you appreciate it more. And they let me pick a schedule to accommodate my kids.
good,"It was great working there, great employees, holiday pot lucks, birthday celebrations, and volunteering! Worked pretty independently, but as a group, produced reports, filing, constant contact with the store locations and their physical needs!"
good,"I worked there for several months until I got hit by a car and had to go to physical therapy. They worked with me for a good time but couldn't hold my job because of how long the recovery was. The people there all around are great, I love everything about the place because it was so fun and family oriented. I would really like to have kept working there but I have no hard feelings about it."
good,knowing what i know now i would like working there now. this job would not support my finances currently. i learned people and how too interact with customers.
good,"I would either open or close the store, make sure the register was ready for the day. Daily customer service and answer the phone."
good,A typical day at work was going in immediately starting work it wasn't bad. You pretty much learned something new everyday weather it was new items that were coming in all the way to the simplest of things like new ways to stock the shelves to make them look better. The management was awesome always willing to help you out to better understand what was going on and a better way to do it. My co-workers were literaly the best people I ever met they were not only funny at times but they were seriouse and willing to help whenever you needed it couldn't have asked for a better work group for that job. The hardest part of the job was having to set up some of the displays because some of them had to be put together in a specific way on the floor were they acttualy flowed together but all in all it wasn't bad in the end. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had the chick days stuff going we had baby chicks that were on display and to see all of the kids come in and be stoked to see them they would just go bonkers for these little chicks.
good,"i can't ask for a better job, only issue is the pay is low and part time, it's a lot of walking around but i am use to that. i learned how to deal with customers and a typical day will go fast, sometimes way to busy to even get in a lunch break because i am forgotten a lot. management is pretty good."
good,"I worked with these folks for 5 years and had a great experience in the southern New Mexico district. After clocking in it's customer service and organizing the store. I've learned a lot with the company and became Tractorized. Management was a positive even though they do keep some stuff very secretive, but that's understandable. The older group were some great people but the college kids can distract easily. The hardest part of the job was training people when loading or unloading certain product. The most enjoyable part was the people, customers and crew."
good,Assign Team member task utilizing daily planner.Perform Planogram updates Open & Close store. Handle cash deposits & Customer Complaints.
good,"I work as a cashier and my everyday workday is pretty easy, i put my customers first so check out customers , greet customers, answer their questions, and send them in the right direction around the store. I have learn great talking and sales skills."
good,I learned a lot about customer service and the retail industry in general.  I learned about the products used by farmers and ranchers in Texas.
good,"I have worked here for 2 years and the company is great, benefits are great and the communities that shop this store are great. It is a growing company that is owned by the stockholders that have a vested interest in seeing it succeed. From the Ceo's to the management they are a model company to work for."
good,"Greeting every customer with a smile and a ,""what can i help you find today?"" is a big part of the shopping experince. Making every customer feel important is our goal. Answering questions and finding out answers is an every day task. We are there to assist the customer with whatever project or chore they are achieving. Ringing customers out at the registar and ensuring they are leaving with everything they need and are satisfyed with their visit. The co-workers are more of a work family than anything. The hardest part is of course working with those few customers who you cant please but the joy of this job is getting to take care of those customers you can help and get to know them on a personal level."
good,"Great place to work, very friendly co-workers and customers. Great way to meet people in the community and gain repeat customers."
good,A typical day at Tractor Supply Company would me arriving and going straight to the cash register. I mainly worked the register but I would also put up new items that had arrived and straighten up the front of the store. I learned a lot about farming supplies and really enjoyed working there.
good,"Typical day consists of unpacking tote boxes and putting products immediately on the shelves. Once one notices a customer is ready to check out an associate is headed to the register at a moments notice to take care of that customers needs while also greeting the next customer that comes in. Once the line is back to being empty that associate either goes back to doing the task they were previously doing or they go into organizing the mess another customer has made in another section, or facing the products to the front as needed. Also, making tags for those products with out one, going outside in rain or shine to get carts for customers to use, performing load out for those customers who are either disabled or aren't strong enough anymore to do it themselves. Through this job I have learned a lot about leading co workers and helping them learn the tasks that need to be performed and when. The management is absolutely incredible. They understand what your frustrations are and can either relate or help in some way, they are absolutely easy to talk to and by far the best team I have ever worked with, it is currently like a home to me. My co workers have become some of my best friends; we can joke, laugh, tease, and help each other through whatever is going on. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the negative customers who decide they are going to be impatient and we have very little control over a good amount of things that happen. Also, not going off on some of the most idiotic customers is a constant struggle. The most enjoyable part is working with the people I am blessed"
good,My job at Tractor Supply consists of working closely with customers on a daily basis to identify their shopping needs and to help them with any purchases that are made.  Sometimes customers come in with a vague idea of what they need and my job is to help them uncover what will satisfy their needs the best.
good,"At TSC you learn how to work individually as well as a team. I was responsible for restocking shelves on the sales floor. Keeping the sales floor, front lot, and back room clean and organized. You are expected to practice store policies, take care of cash and credit transactions, and assists customers in any way possible. You are also expected to operate the forklift and baler. All of your co-workers are as friendly as they can be."
good,"I loved working for this company.  They offer huge employee discounts and really want staff to grow and develop.  Had I not returned to college full time, I would still be working there."
good,"Great Company.  Would still be working for them if they hadn't relocated to Macon, GA"
good,"Great Company to work for, very helpful when starting out. Easy advancement within the company."
good,"A very professional, yet down to earth place to work. Very fair and enjoyable."
good,Small store and close group of coworkers make for a more personal work environment and allow for individuals to learn and grow within the company. TSC is growing at a fast pace and team members and management are not always given the right training to advance properly and fairly.
good,Tractor Supply is a great place to work.  My co-workers and managers are fun and friendly and make it a great atmosphere even on busy days.
good,Its a fun place to work if you like the farm life .co-workers were great .I learned alot in this job.
good,"Every day was great, there where so many items in the store which left alot of learning which was fun. Management above me was great"

good,Its a job that I love and have a lot of experience in the field of. I enjoy the customers and getting to teach people new things in the care for their animals. My management and co-workers are always a joy to interact with and obviously truly care about each other.
good,"Help customer, stock shelves, clean restrooms, sweep isles, run register."
good,"Has got to be my favorite job ever! I've always wanted to work here, but school and a job got to be hard while in high school. A typical day is smilin faces, and laughter all the time. I learned how to run a SKU gun and the weird register lol. I loved the management and all my co-workers. The hardest part was leaving, but the most enjoyable was my co-workers!"
good,Always something to be done in Tractor Supply. Very nice people to work with.
good,"Customer service is number one, and at the Joplin location, supervisors understand that when employees are treated fairly, they’re more likely to put in more effort to take care of other people.  The company culture is one to be admired."
good,"I have worked part-time at TSC for ten months, and I cannot tell you how much I love my job and how passionate I truly am about my company. The staff at the store I'm in are all my best friends, and each and every one is dedicated to and appreciative of their role. My SM is absolutely incredible; I've truly never met a more compassionate, caring person. She really cares about the well-being of her store, staff, and the corporation. I am a cashier and I love being able to represent TSC in a positive manner by helping our customers and making friends with all of them. I show up to work energized and happy to be there, and I always leave just the same after a wonderful shift with the best coworkers I could possibly ask for. I strive to do my best and keep our numbers up in a positively competitive environment. I live for our busy days with lots of traffic, though that can be a challenge at times. The days that we're slow are really difficult and sometimes I can get a little bored but usually find something to do. Overall I love the country lifestyle and I feel like I just really fit in with the company and my store in Oklahoma. I couldn't imagine being anywhere else and I'll say with confidence I never want to leave. <3"
good,If you love the way of country life and you like to help people find what they are looking for this is a great job for you. You should know a little bit about agriculture and outdoor living if you are to work here.
good,"Tractor Supply was a wonderful place to be employed at. The hours go by quickly and the team is there for assistance the majority of the time. The hardest part was when there was a rush of customers, but after awhile you will learn how to handle these situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment, with amazing managers and team leads, as well as, the interactions with customers."
good,The moment I started working at TSDC I knew I'd love it instantly along with the work flow and how productive it stayed. As a person who loves manual labor and constant tasks to work with I highly recommend Tractor Supply Co. Distribution Center to anyone looking for a job that'll keep them occupied and on their feet. The work environment is highly positive and the workers there are able to work together there as a team. I am highly satisfied with my job and all that comes with it.
good,Overall best part time work experience I've had. Everyone is welcoming and actually treats you like a human being with feelings. The manager is great.
good,"My favorite job. Everyone was friendly supportive all-around awesome. Right up my alley: farming(small,hobby, or commercial) animal lovers retreat. Tractor supply has it all!"
good,Our store in Eufaula al is a great place to work . All of the co workers are great. Love my job here and can’t wait to move back up with the company .
good,Tsc is a great company that taught me a lot and has a great work environment. Also has very good management. They also try and move up employees as often as possible as well as offer amazing benefits.
good,"Great place to work. Awesome co-workers with peaceful atmosphere. If you don't know just ask, there is always someone that will answer your questions."
good,"I loved this job, found working with the district supervisor a bit challenging but would love to come back and work for this company. Great people, great atmosphere."
good,"I started at Tractor Supply as the assembly guy, putting together all the mowers, chicken coops, and all the other display stuff. After 3 months I had gone from part time assembly guy to the Receiving Manager. It was a great work environment. Sometimes it got really busy, but most the time is as steady and laid back."
good,Working at Tractor Supply is fun and it is team oriented.  Being able to assist customers with finding what they are looking for is very rewarding in knowing that you satisfied the customers needs. A satisfied customer is a return customer.  Managers at my location are friendly and very heplful in learning new things ..about Tractor
good,"It good place to start meet, good people an Beening a team leader. Learning more .an good environment too find what u need an won't. Help farmer an sticking ."
good,"In the location I worked in, the SM was on board with teaching and coaching. I was always being set up for personal and career growth. My only issue was the DM. DM was very unaware of products and expressed terrible customer service while in stores. Other than that, the customers were great, employees worked. It was an over all fun and rewarding job experience."
good,"Tractor supply Company was one of my favorite places to work, the company culture is great and the team is small and very efficient. I would definitely recommend them as a company. A great way to break into multiple job areas, they deal  with hardware, farm supplies, clothing, animal supplies, and machinery."
good,"A  typical day would be to work hard,have fun and make money by providing product services. I've learned to operate equipment machines, to stock product and ship out."
good,I had a lot of fun working there the first few days you spend in the back on the computer training and learning about there policy and about the fork lift. After that you work on the floor. I really loved this job!

We worked as a team to get things done and had a lot of fun for working. I learned a lot about sales and gained confidence moving forward. Bring your patience for the few impatient customers and bring your strong legs because you'll be on your feet standing or walking around the store. I thoroughly enjoyed working there for the upbeat atmosphere and the excellent customer service we all provided our customers.
good,I truly enjoy my job and advancement within the company is limitless. They have an amazing balance between being good to their employees and customers which is difficult to find in a company.
good,Tractor Supply knows how to create a fun and positive work environment while keeping with its guidelines.  Each customer is asked if they need help with anything and always left with what they were looking for or with a recommendation for where to find the item if it wasn't carried.
good,I worked for tractor supply for 4 years and only left due to life changes. They provide great opportunities for growth and the management was always so encouraging and flexible when it came to scheduling around school or other jobs.
good,"I was the closing night floor manager/Team Lead. I worked 5 to 8 hours a day depending on workload. Great team players friendly customers. hardest part of the job was not getting the hours, best part of the job was making the customers happy. I loved my team and i loved my job."
good,"I started at the bottom and it was a great way to advance, but after 3 years working for them I was denied work after I moved. The store manager near me needs some work. 3 years of experience got pushed aside for someone new."
good,"Tractor Supply Company treats their employees fairly and offers competitive pay, paid vacation/sick time, and benefits.  The store support center makes time to bring employees together with quarterly meetings, yearly picnics, and a fun Christmas party to name a few events.

good,"Daily planned work activities, lunch and break periods and a follow-up guide to maintain company requirements. Was able to learn a lot about farming and the products necessary to achieve customer satisfaction."
good,"While other companies are failing at alarming and intimidating rates, this company is the one of the few that is opening new stores, pursuing full-time team members and challenging their team members to achieve more. I have worked for other retailers and the difference here is the products that you are selling and whom you are selling them to. Your customers are mostly farmers or even hobby farmers who are making a living, creating and nurturing new hobbies or just plain having fun by adding more ""Out Here"" living to their lifestyles, whereas most retailers are simply focused on shoving material trappings down their customers throats. It may be a romantic way of looking at it, but it keeps me going in every day and absolutely loving it."
good,Tractor Supply Company is a productive fun workplace that offers competitive pay and benefits for their full time employees.
good,"Things look less difficult when discussing them hypothetically. We can give a solution for an issue effortlessly in theory.

So continue coding."

Tractor Supply really knows how to make their employees happy!"
good,Through the comprehensive training i learned to use MHE equipment to conduct my day to Inventory and audit routines. My coworkers were very easy to work with.

good,every work day was great enjoyed it a lot and looking to keep into the warehouse jobs it was all easy and loved my employers
good,"I worked primarily as a freight team member during the weekly freight shipments. I was thrown into my own section of the store to ""recover"" while the other team members had their own. It was rough at first because the other members finished their sections about an hour before more me; reasonably so, because they had more experience in their own sections. It was a swim or sink situation and I improved quickly to save my job. The other days I worked retail and it was like any other retail job."
good,"Working at Tractor Supply Company is the greatest company I've ever worked for. The day is always constant, and before you know it your shift is over and time to go home. The other employees became some of my best friends, whom I am still friends with after leaving the company. The management team is well organized; the store manager I worked for was an extremely motivated man,of whom I admire. The company does a review of the hours you've worked, if you work more than 40 hours a week (even if you're part time status) the company with give you full time status and benefits if you choose to opt in. Also from the first day at the job you can clearly see that the company genuinely cares about its employees. Unlike most companies this company will work for you the employee. They want the best of the best for employees and are willing to make sure the workers have what they need to make an productive, enjoyable, and positive work environment. They make it very clear from the start what the expectations are of you and go over the ethics, the company moto, and a few other important things you need to know in the interview. The hardest aspect of the job is the physical labor and the demands they ask your body to go through. The most enjoyable part of the job is the over all job. I would GREATLY enjoy working for Tractor Supply Company again in the future."
good,"I really enjoy working here because of the environment.  It's also a very easy job.  There is a slight physical demand, but nothing more than expected at a warehouse."

good,"Everyday was different working for Tractor supply, some days i was a cashier, others i was working the floor or in the back room. I learned about lots of different farm equipment and many things about farm animals I didn't already know. I loved my management, they will always very willing to work with my schedule and help me out when things would come up like funerals or family issues. I loved my co workers, because we were a small store we became like a family and i still keep in contact with most of my old co workers. Stocking feed was the hardest part of my job, it was a task that took all day and was involved a lot of physical labor. Getting to know my customers was the most enjoyable part of my job, I made connections with them and some i even knew on a first name basis."

I love my co-workers at each store, although after I left the Sherman store at the end of summer 2014, many changes were made and many employees are new.

The management was wonderful and helped with anything even if it wasn't work related, my co workers were the greatest, and were always there to count on. This job really had nothing hard, but at times we did have a customer to come in that didn't want to follow procedures on return policies, and that made it difficult for us as the cashiers. The most part I enjoyed was meeting new people everyday and making sure they were comfortable and finding the things that they needed."

good,"Tractor Supply Co. is like a second home to me. It is a well balanced environment where every employer knows each other as if we've been knowing each other for years. My work environment is sort of laid back but when it comes down to getting your work done and meeting deadlines, then the pace of my job becomes somewhat busy. It is very important to stay on task while working their because their is a lot of multitasking on the job, that would be the hardest part about the job is multitasking but as long as you know what your plan is then the job is fairly easily. Having to answer phones, assist customers while waiting for a fax or order to come in for the next customer and having to restock merchandise, return labels, make defective tags and set up a new layout plan. The most enjoyable part about my job is meeting my customers everyday, the new and the old ones. Their is never a dull day a Tractor Supply Co."

The hardest part of the job is when you have that one customer that you just cant make happy, no matter how hard you try. I love working at Tractor Supply Co. because I have been raised on the farm life, and I love knowing about everything that I work around, and the everyday farmers that I interact with."
