bad,"Horrible Management"
bad,"They’re selfish , make inconsistent schedules and refuse to move people to full time even if you really need it . They don’t care about anyone but themselves"
bad,My manager was awful and didn't know what he was doing. I just had an overall bad experience with the exception of my supervisor who I got along with.
bad,"don't Work here. it's nothing but a headache. management sucks, all they do is gossip all day & make the ones that they want to make into supervisors. its not worth it!"
bad,"The HR Group experienced quite a bit of turnover in the almost 3 years I was employed at Genesco.  These changes brought about some good forward progress, but the most recent managerial shifts have not been positive for anybody in the group nor the company.  The new management is very difficult to work with and for.  There is no movement for discussions.  It is their way or get out."
bad,They don't care about their employees. They treat the hard workers poorly and the poor workers like they are gold. Management is very poor. A lot of backstabbers.
bad,"Very unfair work enviroment, hard workers are over looked or treated poorly, poor workers are treated better than your hard workers.pay needs to be increased"
bad,"While working for this company, I didn't take my job seriously because the management team set low standards for their employees. Managers would text on their phones and leave the store for a break when ever they felt like it."
bad,I learned a lot with this company and it was very thankless. I gathered a lot of operational skills but the job overall thankless.
bad,"this company is ver unproffesional,they threaten you,and they play favortism."
bad,They are an American based company in Canada who runs as if in america... They allow managers without full training to run stores and lie about hours worked as they are friends with higher ups.. Worst employer ever
bad,"One of the most stressful jobs I have had yet. I had to relocate to back home and was promised to get paid for my time off that I had saved during my move. Once I moved, I was not given this money. Upset."
bad,"Low pay; only $9 starting and there are people who worked 25 plus years there only making $13! They didn't give me any heads up when they laid me off because they were slow... No heads up. Probably did me a favor. They only pay 1.5 overtime if you hit over 40 hours, but they will work you hard on Monday and Tuesday at a fast pace with overtime... Then when  Thursday and Friday roll around they will send home after your minimum hours you have to work by law a day are up. You'll end up work 28-34 hours. When they do slam you with work... And you work hard or fast, you get nothing for it; no raise, nothing."
bad,"The management is terrible! They say they are an equal opportunity job.....DO NOT BELIEVE! They play favoritism and they will do one thing for one person and not the other. If you have vacation time and they like you, you’ll get paid. If they don’t like you, they will not pay you. They have two sets of rules."
bad,It was always a competition with everyone and they over exceed the amount of sales needed for each worker even when they’re new and haven’t even learned all the ropes yet. Manager had attitude all the time and yells at employees in front of customers. Wasn’t really ran great by the manager.
bad,"I worked for Genesco for almost three years, and not once did I feel appreciated. I was the top sales person in my region initially, and my paychecks did not show it. They low ball the management's salary to such an extreme ($150/wk + 4% commission), that I only made minimum wage despite being the top sales person in the region. The only perk that I can possibly think of is the amount of freedom the management is given in their store. The warehouse work is back breaking (if you work in a high volume store), and the hours (average of 60 weekly) were just awful and unfair. Screw you, Genesco. Screw you."
bad,"So I had been working for Genesco for almost two years when I had been terminated. I came into work one day to start my shift like normal only to find out I was being fired for my ""performance"". Never was I coached or made aware of my horrible performance. In fact I worked more than my store manager."
bad,"When I started as a temp people were welcoming. When it slowed down the workers would literally sit and talk, do nothing. Management of slotting and receiving is a joke. People came in late and still did not work entire shift. Th job culture makes it hard to quit. The boredom and laziness of the workers makes you want to quit every day. When this assignment is up I will never come back unless it is entry level as I'm obviously over qualified for this position."
bad,"I worked there for about a month and after back to school sales were over we were told that hours were cut, after we were told that I didn’t receive any hours at all and not only that I was laid off without a reason as to why and I wasn’t informed. I was treated very poorly and I will never work at another Underground by Journeys again."
bad,I worked here for 5 months almost and it started off great but they promoted in house and our manager became really rude to the staff which caused for a lot of tension in the store. He had no real retail experience and was actually slightly prejudiced. He would never greet our African American customers but instead would tell me to go “deal with them”.
bad,"Management was terrible. Work hours were cut short, not able to pay rent on time. HR did nothing about this even after placing complaints. Manager used personal feelings when scheduling or listening to concerns"
bad,What i disliked about genesco is that they degraded good employees that actually did outstanding jobs while working and didnt get the acknowledgement they deserved.
bad,"I worked for Shi By Journeys, Journeys and Undergroundstation which are owned by the parent company Genesco as a store manager for 3 years. They do not value their employees."
bad,I felt that the training that I received with this company was terrible. I was promoted to quickly with next to no training. The upper management was far too uninvolved with my small volume store. The hardest part of this job was balancing administrative and sales duties there was just far too much for one person to do.
bad,"I would not advise a person to take this position with any expectations of growing it into a career. There is a severe disconnect between store management and upper level management, DSM's."
bad,Operations such as opening and closing the store are no different than most companies. Inventory counts are to be done on a weekly basis in 6 categories. Each category contained one to two thousand units and over 50 skues. Inventory control seems to be an issue within the company. No packing slips are sent and computer problems constantly affect the accuracy of the inventory causing these counts to consume most of your day. This is also a very sales driven company to work for. They hold you to high quality sales standards that most of the company is not reaching. Sales floor coverage is always below minimum needed to run the business.
bad,Take phone calls for customers and resolve customer concerns and questions. Notate any concerns or unresolved issues.
bad,"Open the Store and Count the drawers. Make sure that all paperwork for the day is filled out and bank deposits for the night are marked and ready for closing. Our embroidery machine needs to be maintained everyday and documented. Bulk Count needs to be done once a week which is a small audit for the store and then our charity needs to be counted,documented and put in the till. Evaluations on the employees are done three times a week along with training from the manager (myself) is conducted on a everyday basis. Managers need to get emails from Corp and log into our huddle booklet for weekly assignments such as scheduling,store hours, budgets, goals, embroidery tips etc."
bad,I only worked once or twice a week. They didn’t really announced or discussed with me about me being fired. High expectations for little pay and little benefits
bad,Terrible work culture. Slavery at its finest. You work 80 plus hours with no breaks you. You fall sick no one assist you. You don’t have DM for three months and who cares. No leadership period.
bad,This job is not for someone who wants to have a career .The managers don't know how to manage certain things. The only thing i loved about this job is the discount
bad,"You do tons of work , and you do not get paid for your hard work. They have training classes every week with around 20-30 new hires , within a few weeks there MAY be 5-6 still working here. They fire people alot , walk them out of the front doors for little knit picking things. I think some of the people in the company are rude. Once you are hired on they throw you on the phones with little to no understanding of the systems. Only time will help you with this job. I would not recommend. Oh , and they offer you 11$ to start and tell you will get a raise after 90 days , Im at day 150 ... No sign of a raise."
bad,"Typical day-10/12 hr, often no lunch. Do a management job on a commission compensation. It is confusing to think about what actually pays you versus what a good job at that job would require."
bad,"the employees and management are not held to a high standard. Issues with Store Manager drinking alcohol while at work, stealing females phone numbers from customer information database, no call no show to work, and nothing was done by DM or GM. Although i have management experience through other companies i was never trained properly at Journeys."
bad,"Not much to review, A and B concept . I needed this to get me to C."
bad,The only thing good is your discount which continues to add up as you work. But all hours are part time and with so many employees your lucky to get 15 a week. Use this job for sales experience and keep going.
bad,I hated working at journeys. Terrible work environment. They don’t care about you. And it’s a very caddy environment. Honestly this was effortlessly one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had.
bad,"I love the work that I do but creation can be stifled at times and there is no work/life balance. A lot of traveling with every job, but you are going to great sporing events."
bad,"The only thing I didn't like"
bad,"At first this job was really cool, the base pay is not good at all you really make your money by selling the product but if the store does not get as much traffic it will be tough to sell, Management did things for there own benefit, You could only move up if you know someone. Other than that its just like any other retailer, attend the customer and sell the product."
bad,"Goals were reasonable and you had to work hard to reach daily, weekly and monthly goals. Manager was supportive but tough. Need to be great sales person."
bad,"Such low pay that your next job will undoubtedly make you feel like you’ve made an advancement. The store manager is really great, and understands personal circumstances. The corporate managers are terrible, and look at the workers as nothing more than expendable pawns in their game. There is no room for improvement. A pro to the job is you can get pretty much any sales job with this on your resume."
bad,i loved the people and the enivorment  i learn good customer  service excelent discounts excellent place to  work it was a great place to work overall excellence
bad,"Hours are little to none unless there the teams that are popular in your area are playing well. Most days you put shipment out and size hats. On average, you get 3 hours shifts and when everything is done you basically just talk to the manager on duty. If you like a fast-paced working environment i would not recommend working for this company. However it is easy money considering there isn't much to do all the time."
bad,Great for a side gig but not for trying to save up or support yourself. 40% off discount including sales items in great. Paid minimum wage with usually 8 hours a week if it's not peak season and less than 20 for peak seasons
bad,The training is good they prepare you for customer. You learn what system you need up for each customer and company you work in. The hours can be flexible.
bad,Retail at the mall can be fun and not fun at the same time. It was a small store so most of the time it was just one person on duty. Can be lonely and boring. Can be overwhelming and hectic. Maintaining excellent customer service during the two is a skill in itself.
bad,"As a Manager and Amazing lack of control within your store"
bad,I enjoyed working with different types of customers coming into my store.
good,Overall working at journeys kidz was a fun experience but they don't really care much about the workers and barely gave any hours.
good,I loved working here. But I am a single man with no kids. You have to give your life to the company. I worked as the store manager and you are required to work 55+ hours a week. Usually 60-70 a week. One day off a week. They take advantage of their managers and make them work more than any other managers and pay less. The store that I worked at was Journeys owned by Genesco. it is a base pay plus commission pay rate. They do not treat their managers very well.
good,"Pretty relaxed as far as customers go but the store manager was very immature and hard to work for. Also, because of the competitive nature of this job, some sales associates stole sales from other employees so it was hard to obtain the high sales goal."
good,"A good environment. Best place to work for those who are slow learners. Development team is agile. I worked on a stock count project, where owners of the products needed to make frequent changes to the built."
good,"Journeys Kidz or Genesco is a nice, relaxed environment, if you have no life. The pay for managers isn't that great considering the amount of hours, stress, and time one has to give to that job. By force you have to complete the minimum of 55 hours, with only one day off, and if they need you to come in that day, then so be it. Sometimes, there wouldn't be enough help that having to stay late wasn't an option, it was mandatory. The pay did not justify the hours, and with the ""commission"" one got, it's wouldn't really do much, unless you were store manager or Manager-In-Training. As co-manager, you only got a fraction of what you made, but all the duties of a store manager or MIT, without the pay. Not only were the hours stressful, but you basically had no life. Work took up most of it, with no sick days, vacation days, or paid time off. If you missed a day due to illness and you didn't make up the 55 hours, you basically forfeit the commission you made and only get your based salary. Like I said, the pay wasn't worth the stress. The hardest part of the job wasn't having to sell shoes, since they sold themselves, it was having to keep your SOP's up. No matter how many shoes you sold, and even if you reached your ""daily"" or ""weekly"" goal, if you didn't sell a certain percentage of socks, accessories, and multiples (more than one pair of shoes) then you would still get a write up and the risk of being let go for not reaching their ""quota"" which was really hard considering their socks were over priced compared to other competitors. ($10-18 for a pack of 5 pairs). Many customers"
good,"Not the best, but the Journeys shoe discount is cool i guess. The other agents act like this is a high school environment and speak badly about each other. Not super professional at times. Some management is lazy. The job isn't hard at all as long as you can pay attention during training."
good,"An average day would include if opening to count the registers, complete the basic paper filings of numbers and bank slips. Then would include to provide the sales goals of all the employees working including mine and the store manager."
good,"It was a good first job experience right out of high-school. I was able to learn and grow in what it meant to be in retail. I gained a vast amount of experience in customer service, point of sale systems, and shoes."
good,"Genesco owns different retail companies. I personally believe it was  a good experience to learn about sales and management, but definitely not a job that will pay for all your bills, unless you are a student."
good,"This company is great for promoting with-in. I was able to get promoted after my 90 days of employment to be a Training Coordinator. I work for the Customer Care department. Great things that come with the job are the benefits of working in a corporate building. We have access to a on-site Starbucks, Gym, Salon and Clinic. The department that I work in, is a little unorganized and under paid. The customer care department has a high turn over rate due to lack of employee appreciation. My task change due to my position, currently I come in daily to revamp our training material for the next busy season. The hardest part about working in the department that I am in, are the people. What I enjoy most is interacting with the new hires. I have gained great leadership skills, public speaking skills and wonderful tips on how to run a team. Management in the Customer Care department really is not there."
good,"I had a difficult time being the only member of management in my store, thus requiring me to be in the store from open to close, seven days a week.  This led to a quick burn-out."
good,i worked 6-7 days a week. 60+ hours a week. i had little support. they will hire people not qualified.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much when it was FAIR and i had managers that cared about all of my coworkers and I, i dealt with 2 managers that stole hours and picked favorites ( only 1 of which got fired) and even when they were BOTH caught their was reluctance in actual punishment. But overall my first manager taught me everything i know about retail sales and customer service, all of my coworkers got a long and it was a great team environment. The hardest part of the job is actually getting to the customer first, it was very competitive. I enjoyed many things about this job, It was my first job so i learned i great bit about customer service, my coworkers ALL got along, and at the end of the day we made some people happy. This job was a wholesome start and is great when your managers choose to cooperate."
good,"Associates are expected to manage all aspects of client service, from prospecting and past due collection.  It is a fast paced environment with lots of turnover.  "
good,"While I was working for this company, a typical day at work would be slow. I learned a lot about different shoe brands. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I would make sales."
good,Genesco is a good first job it doesn't pay as well as some of the factories but it is only one shift. Its a kind of community in there an the people are nice.
good,"Generally management works 55-65 hours a week. The salary is low end. There is a lot of pressure. District Managers and RVPs act oblivious until time to establish fault. Recently, micromanagement has become an issue. The upper management has no clue how to actually run a store in today's economy. Advancement is hard. Core values abandoned by DMs and RVPs."
good,"At Genesco, you run the entire business from start to finish; recruit, hire, interview, onboard, train, customer service, sales, human resources, management, shipping, receiving, marketing, merchandising, payroll completion, time card verification, loss prevention, and so on."
good,"the most stressful job in retail hands down,no job security,under paid managers,was never allowed to ask for raises ( district 39)"
good,"The environment of Genesco is mostly positive, but with an ever-changing cast of agents and rules changes, it's hard to have any sense of stability. Call Center jobs aren't easy. You deal with stress and negativity every moment. The easiest way to help manage the stress is opportunities to make more money. Genesco is not the place to go for this. From starting pay to annual bumps, you can make more at competing call centers. It's easy to move up, but by the time you get to a management position, the pay has scaled to meet what entry level positions are offering elsewhere."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is building a rapport with the large amount of employees that I work with daily.  It truly is a family that cares.  However, the lack of proper management, communication and organization will deter anyone from wanting to give 110% of their time and effort."
good,"Great work environment for salaried employees. Fast paced exciting  sports clients and projects. Locations in Dallas, Chicago, New York and Charlotte."
good,Journeys is a fun place to work at. Its fast paced and competitive. The only thing that was the hardest was not having the time to spend with my family. You get the opportunity to grow with the company.
good,call center taking in 75-100+ calls a day for diff companies
good,"Assist customers with sales and ensure everything was restocked"
good,"Scheduled interviews as needed by managers, checked attendance, did daily reports, prepared information for payroll. The hardest part of the job was the closing of the plant and the most enjoyable was the employees"
good,"Work life balance is great, day to day very low stress.  But compensation is low and the company's strategic decisions have it's long term position uncertain."
good,If you are looking for a relaxing entry level employment I will recommend this to you or a friend who is trying to seek work experience  and learn how business works.
good,"I didn't mind working here, it was mostly because of the discount. I worked long hours and didn't get paid very well. At least not for how much time I needed to contribute to the company."
good,"During my time here I originally loved my job, I woke up every morning excited to go in and help people. Over time, however, as management styles started to change due to losing some of the original upper management, the work place quickly turned sour. There is very little communication given to the supervisors and agents in regards to what changes may soon be implemented, and no time to learn new processes before they are implemented, leaving lots of confusion for agents. From lack of communication, to gaps in scheduling and hiring, to decreased morale, this job is just not what it used to be nor what it should be."
good,"The positive:"
good,"I was constantly on my feet completing orders for customers, ringing out sales, and performing various store needs. I learned how to embroider, I enjoyed the time I spent with my managers, the showed me how to be fast and efficient. I learned from the negative actions of co-workers and the hardest part of the job was probably constantly keeping up with the demanding pace, although I didn't mind. I loved working with people there."
good,"A typical day at Journeys as a Store Manager starts by opening the store an hour before your shift, counting registers, reading/responding to emails, fulfilling store transfers and customer orders, and maintaining store appearance by replacing sold display merchandise. Then setting goals for each employee scheduled for that day, including your co manager. Greeting customers asap is a must and taking advantage of each sale in order to reach your store's goal as well as your own. You are responsible for controlling productivity and making sure every employee reaches their goal and standard of performance. Keeping the store clean and organized as well as the stock room. You are also responsible for closing the store on days that your co manager opens, making a schedule each week, and monthly performance reviews for every employee."
good,"I enjoy the job that I do at Genesco; however, the compensation and opportunity for advancement is, in my opinion, not up to par."
good,It was a good job to start off helped me a lot during school they also sometimes work with your availability. You meet very nice people. It’s a good job.
good,coworkers were pretty cool but my co sales lead decided to screw me over for a promotion i wouldntve taken. everybody including the manager got fired from my old store because he couldnt do his job right and so a lot of money and stock went missing. they let you have tats/piercings. overall it was pretty cool when i had a cool manager and comanager but when they left everything went downhill.
good,The start was very busy with plenty of work and overtime and at the end of my stay work was very slow and hours were cut down and we was going home early every day. The work was steady for about three months and then it was very slow for about three to four months and we were going home early every day
good,It was a decent job for my first place of employment. My coworkers were friendly and helped me learn the fast paced environment. I picked up on the skills quickly and enjoyed working.
good,"Poor Management From time To time But Good Flexible Hours. It Could Be Stressful But We Got The Job Done."
good,Standard sales environment. If you enjoy the fast paced sales environment and all that entails then you'd fair well here. Well structured but a very sterile place to work.
good,"Great company to work for.  I sold shoes at Disney World to cast members in the buildings behind the park.  Boss was great, company paid me very well."
good,Energy is positive in the workplace. Staff treats one another with respect and kindness. We are one family and we look out for one another. The work is great and its a different company im working for and i love the vibes here.
good,The culture at Genesco continues to evolve to keep up with an ever changing industry. This allows Genesco to maintain market share while pursuing organic growth.
good,Enjoyed the year I worked there and made me realize that financial accounting is not what I wanted to do. Thank Goodness we moved back to Texas and I started in oil & gas accounting.
good,"Had a hard time due to management, and the pay is not really the best. I wanted to continue my time at the company, but the General Manager was highly unprofessional"
good,"Typically there are meetings once a day to keep everybody up to date on progress and projects in the pipeline."
good,"It was pretty chill, you just need to be friendly and charming to sell and meet your goal. They really want friendly people so you can sell shoes and accessories."
good,"The days were long .Workplace culture was ok.Management was very good.The customers,commission,bonuses are the rewarding parts of the job.Merchandise was very good and well replenished."
good,"Working for Genesco ,started out great the employees were friendly and showed good work ethic! Customers were friendly for the most partManagement was fair and gave plenty of opportunities! However, there was a quick decline as my time there grew. The hardest part was trying to overlook all of the policies that were being broken. The most enjoyable part about working there was the competitiveness that went on making work enjoyable!"
good,Fast paced environment that requires great multi-tasking and goal orientation. Training programs and strategy sessions make all the difference!
good,it was a terrible experience. tried to meet to many expectations with not enough help from higher management. district manager was a joke. hours were killer working 70+ during holidays with only one day off a week
good,"Love working at Journeys. I meet new people everyday, and have customers come back and ask specifically for me. Customers are surprised when you remember what shoes they bought or what event they were buying the shoes for and when you ask it's always a sign of ""Oh my goodness you remember me?"" This lets them know that we don't look at them as just another person, we build relationships with them,"
good,I learned how to be a supervisor.  I learned a lot of valuable lessons about people and how to trust in this job.  It was a great job that I would love to do again.
good,it was fun working there but I just felt that their demands sometimes was out of this world
good,worked for a seasonal job so it was fast paced for the season and after the season ended the job didn't work out
good,As co-manager you work from 9-9
good,"Benefits a plus, no raise in 2 1/2 years and management not a plus."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of 9-14 hours of consistent customer interaction as well as personnel management, inventory control, visual merchandising and achieving sales goals. Learned a lot about myself as a manager and as an employee. Management was enthusiastic yet often made empty promises. The staff and co-workers are energetic and welcoming. The hardest part of the job would have to be the disregard for one's quality of life."
good,"I like the company, but the compensation for managers during slow times are not great."
good,"Loved working here, Good Pay and benefits, but had to move on for personal reasons"
good,"Absolutely loved the culture, as you become friends with the people you work with. However as a manager you were expected to work 50+ a week and 60+ hours during holidays. Pay was extremely below average, were close to no benefits, and PTO was a hassle. If you like retial and culture it's a good place. However if pay, benefits, and PTO are important, I would steer clear."
good,"The hours are great but the pay is very low for a supervisor entry position, there are a lot of different task we complete that what the job description details."
good,"Laid back family-like culture.  Limited career and advancement opportunities.  Pay not very competitive with industry for similar jobs, but good benefits."
good,"clock in, get started picking orders, work in other departments to help catch them up, once main department is finished working, help other departments until they are done. Management almost always cheerful and always very helpful. Co-workers worked hard. Hardest thing to do was keep their pace. Most enjoyable part of the job was how friendly and helpful coworkers and management were."
good,"This was the first job I had in an office setting. I enjoyed my job as a Customer Service Representative, thoroughly. I was in charge of taking incoming calls for several different departments, data entry and talking daily with store managers."
good,"Genesco has grown significantly over the years and consequently, change is inevitable.  I enjoyed many great years there and the culture was great.  I enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis and appreciated the comradery and team work."
good,Very relaxed environment. There is no stress on the job. The task given are pretty easy and it is a great way to learn customer service skills and communication.
good,Genesco had a fun atmosphere and I really enjoyed working there. You always got to meet new people whether it was the crew you worked with or just new customers that walked in. If there was one downfall was that as a manager you would only get one day of a week. I love spending time with my family and after nine years I needed a change.
good,This brand has history and is great they have awesome product and  it's good quality. I enjoyed my time their. no room for growth at the time In Canada.
good,Hard work with flexible duties. Co-workers help create a team environment.  Every day was a learning opportunity.  I enjoyed communicating with vendors around the country.
good,"A typical day at work consists of a shift change to ensure an even cashier till. Then we must great customers using the customer service based acronym called DRIVE. Deliver, Remind, Interest, Verify and End. In my service I have learned how to maintain inventory, cashier tills and the embroidery machine. I have also learned to reach above and beyond customer expectations to ensure the best experience. My store manager is a great leader and informed me that we set a company record upon my hire with the most consecutive months above company standards."
good,"Genesco is good but there was a al ot of changes that wasn't fat for the department . I had to change my whole life schedule due to their change. The company is very good it's self , it's time I explore mt options."
good,"Nice workplace, need better pay and better hours.         "
good,"The company was a fast pace enviroment, neat and required the best customer service to customers.I learned how to provide world wide customer service, and also how to get calls done at at timely fashion."
good,A typical day at Journeys is well me coming in an hour before we open working on the back because nothing is perfect if its not a shipment day then we have transfer outs to do and customer orders and we try to make sure there's not a lot to do when we're open then we proceed to open by greeting our customers and engaging having conversing with our customers. What I've learned from Journeys is that there's never a dull moment with the job meaning that there is always something to do basically no reason to say there's nothing to do. Hardest part of the job is looking for a pair of shoes that's on the computer says we have but we cannot find the size meaning that it's somewhere around the backroom but the most enjoyable part of working there is the customers themselves I've met some interesting people but never thought I could enjoy my day by having a discussion with someone especially listening to their day and let them know that I could help them and hearing good things not about the store but about me specifically.
good,Company has relaxed work environment nice people and good management the pay was good for the work must have a tough skin display customer service great
good,"working with people who have been there 40-50 years that are still living in the past. A lot of cursing, bad mouthing women. I did enjoy the discounts"
good,You got to meet a lot of people on the job. i learned how to open up and be more outgoing. There is a lot of opportunities for advancement within the companies but once you hit a certain level the opportunities start to become a little less available.
good,I enjoyed working for this company in a retail environment. It is great
good,"I loved the team I worked with, but the department manager (who is no longer there), made the job stressful. Also, during my tenure, the pay did not keep up with the increased responsibility I was expected to take on. Otherwise, it was a decent place to work. Hopefully they've resolved the issues I just described."
good,"This is a very laid back job. I enjoyed hour lunches, meal tickets, and also incentives. Would recommend this job for a young adult."
good,"I love my job at Underground Journeys because it's not just a job it'd a home too .for example I love all my co-workers that funny, good people to hang out with to but the reason why my job is so grate because we at Underground Journeys look out for everyone."
good,"It said in the description room to advance, but that was not true. Not the company's doing, only the supervisors."
good,Overall is a good place to work. Management needs more leaders. No raises only 1 bonus per year for entire company. Little room to advance. I learned how to be a better rep.
good,Growing fast and feeling growing pains.  Building is old and out dated.  Aging company trying to catch up with modern technology.
good,"Genesco is a good place to work. It can be a challenge, depending on which department you would work for.  All in all, I would reccomend it.  There ia a variety of jobs that you could posiibly choose from."
good,This job is for someone in school or who have little to no job experience. This job is specifically for someone who is trying to have a easy job while maintain school and a life.
good,The managers are rude and so are some of the staffs. They are not very clear with their words and will change the schedule without anyone knowing. Just very rude.
good,It was a great work atmosphere friendly fast and also irritating and stressful at times depending on the call volume and the type of customer you may have to deal with
good,"It was an amazing job for my first, you greet customers, convince them to buy merchandise, i also did storage putting away shoe boxes in specific numerical order, using ladders, pricing guns."
good,Good place to work in sports and great clients.  Fun atmosphere and great way to build your marketing acumen.  Team oriented.
good,a typical day at work was to sell shoes. I learned how to use my sales skills. management was also great. my coworkers were all excellent people. the hardest part I have to say was keeping up with management. and the most enjoyable was to sell to the customers because it helped me interact with different people.
good,Every day at work was different but there was never a dull moment. Each day consisted of satisfying every customer every time and making sure that I was not only selling at least a pair of shoes to each person but a pair of socks as well. At the end of each day there was either preparation with a new set up for the next day or pay roll or making sure that inventory was always maintained and organized. Also consistently ensuring that there is the weekly and monthly goal was achieved or excelled. And every moment of my job made me feel more and more passionate by the day and that motivated me to always want to challenge myself. There was never a dull moment and even when there was a found different ways to improve or fix something or find alternatives. My co-workers were also just as motivated and they always reminded me that they loved the way that I made the store function. I was always willing to make the schedule and try to assist and make times for my associates and understand that they have lives outside of work as well. Overall I learned how to be a better manager and even though I started out with less experience that expected I picked up everything very quickly and implement them immediately. Overall it was a great job that taught me most of what I know today and I am always willing to learn more.
good,"Great company, many perks! Management was wonderful. Long busy days made the time fly by. Fun interacting with all sorts of people!"
good,the company was great. great benefits and employee discount.
good,If you enjoy customer service jobs that require you to make a quota this is a good job for you.
good,"My experience with Genesco was a positive one. The company allows fast promotion opportunities, helps the employees to advance and supports them. However, since the management was lacking."
good,You have to know someone to advance even if you are a great worker and is on time. I feel temp should b treated as the regular employees.We ar the glu
good,"I have worked at Genesco for 5 years, excellent performance reviews, attendance and processed all duties with above average expectations. "
good,look the job interaction with people and time getting off was great. pay was ok could be better. with in a year I got a my own store and stay on top of my district for the years I had it! but when asked about becoming a corp trainer for asst management I got a lot of turn arounds
good,"Reconcile retail store accounts on a daily basis"
good,I was Store manager. Responsible for all operations of a retail sales outlet. My unit was always in the top 2 stores in my region for sales gains and accessories percentage.Unit lost the lease on my location
good,"This place rocks your will be very busy but, the $ is good. Lots of free shoes and concerts ect."
good,"Great place to network, meet cool new people, and help others! Hardest part of the job is bringing 4 shoes to every customer, and pitching socks or accessories (easy)"
good,easy to connect with employees there. j-Just huge amount of workflow. Good amount of bad call but you will good one every now and then. Supervisor are good there and to connect with.
good,"I enjoyed working at Journeys where I was able to meet new people and become friends with co-workers. The job was very easy and the shifts for sales associates were only 4 hours. What I didn't enjoy about the job is that you are required to make a sales goal by the end of the month and after three months if you can't complete all three categories of the goal, you'll get terminated."
good,A typical work day is taking customer orders over the phone. Co-workers were very helpful in learning the position. the hardest part was learning their system. and the most enjoyable part was knowing I helped someone with a problem.
good,"Great district manager, learned a lot. Enjoyed appreciation. build a great team of employees and very successful sales growth."
good,I made a lot of connections and had a lot of fun. However they did not follow up on promises. I was promised several promotions and was trained to do each one. However they did not happen.
good,• Assigned to different types of events involving celebrities and/or popular companies in need of promoting themselves or a product line
good,fine if your young and single with nothing else to do. very cliquey. feels like your in high school drama everywhere. managers are pad for 45 hours but work 60 plus/ week
good,"my experience as an ASM was great the only problem was that the district store manager did not document a theif issue which was brought to his attention the people are great though .but if you're in a low volume store you're getting treated like a peasant you could be working an open to close for a week,training was barely provided just how to scan shipment"
good,"Working at Journey's was one of the best and most fun experience. My manager and coworkers were very easy going and fun to work with and joke around with, but they all got serious and completed all work goals as needed, even surpassing them."
good,I had to come in and check out my forklift then go to the receiving office and check out a radio then meet with my deportment manager to get the plans for the day.
good,"Genesco was a good place to work, my supervisors were awesome, and I wish I was still there. I lost my job due to a stupid mistake, and I wish I was still there. It had its down sides, some of the customers were a little stressful, but it was alright."
good,I learned that dealing with customers you must always put a smile on your face and help them to the best of your ability. The most enjoyable part of my job was the competition because  always felt the need to out-do my co-workers and be the harIdest worker.
good,"Great work environment"
good,"Other than sub par pay Genesco was a decent company to work for. "
good,"Plan events with my team and figure out how to use our budget to our advantage. I learned how to budget time and money. I also learned how to connect with consumers and help them with their needs. management was very helpful and was there whenever I needed them. I was the manager so I hired my coworkers and they were awsome. Hardest part of my job was finding events in our budget. the most enjoyable part of my job was being with my coworkers during the events,"
good,"In any race one must train, be confident while focusing on the finish line. Each runner has its own specif tools to out wit their opponents. These same strategist rules apply to any manager on the track and field world of retail. This business is based on competitive , healthy  marketing and ruthless sales goals. This however, is a beneficial boot camp for anyone looking to master life in general. In retail management you mist stay in constant compliance with two opposing parties at all time. Engaging and understanding your consumers is laughter and execution. Understanding and executing on behalf of your company is testy and rigorous when the consumer does not agree. "
good,"Journeys is a upbeat,music and people..great for young people getting into the work place for the first time. job advancment is quick and easy to obtain for hard working employees."
good,"A fun fast paced environment that is a great skill building area. However, hours as management require a lot of time within the work area that time outside of work may be sacrificed. Maintaining balance will lead to success in this company."
good,"Genesco provides a great environment to work in.  Management does care about the employee's well being."
good,"Genesco as a whole is solid, looks good on paper. Internal culture needs improvement, communication needs a lot of work. Town meetings are informative for Journey's, let us forget about the other branches that built the company though."
good,Great place to work love the coworkers. We work as a family helped each other with their responsibility.  Whatever it took to get the job done that's what we did.
good,I have nothing but good things to say about this company and how they helped me become a disciplined leader and positive role model for my staff and co workers. I found myself advancing fast and getting promotion after promotion and was directed well by my DM.
good,"A typical day at work includes taking calls, placing and tracking orders. This job dealt with plenty of irate customers and I had to make sure I handled or escalated matters the correct way. I learned at this job and other customer service jobs, not to take irate customers comments personally. They are not angry with me but are rather angry with the quality of care they have received previously. Management was fairly decent. The co-workers were a delight as we all worked as a team to help one another. The hardest part of this job was that there wasn't much room for growth in the company. The most enjoyable part of this company was that we could all work together to get a huge assignment done. The staff was upbeat and when a hard day was hand my coworkers always had good spirits to help get through the rest of the day."
good,"A typical day for me was different from others, i worked part-time. I loved the job i just needed a full-time gig."
good,"Genesco was a great place to work, with a few exceptions. The pay isn't what it should be for managment, and the hours are a bit tough too. It is a fun and lively place with excellent opportunities and a positive energy."
good,working was fun and relaxing easy to make friends helpful management also we celebrated thanksgiving and other holidays they are family oriented and over all a great place to work
good,i love working through genesco they have alot of opportunities to develop and advance you have chances to earn commission and the mangers are very well trained as well as understanding
good,"Working in the call center can sometimes be stressful, but the job is actually ideal for a young person who has a customer service background. They do promote within."
good,"No benefits for assistant managers and low pay for ASM’s. Should be making salary at least for the work they are asked to do, would help with the lack of  benefits. Simply care about their ASM’s more."
good,"Nice company to work for, everyone was friendly and helpful.  Their technology seems a little dated though.  Hopefully they will address that soon and will be more desirable to work for in the IT areas."
good,Relaxed  environment. Many different bonus opportunities   plenty of time off and vacation days given.  discounts on products and free money that grows monthly to spend on product
good,"I was able to obtain a great experience with this company. I was able to move up in management and excelled as a team leader, manager and district recruiter for many years."
good,"Day: Customer Service"
good,"Typically work 4 hour shifts, pretty chill job. Weekdays are pretty slow, but everyone gets along and makes work fun. Job is pretty easy and pretty much the same everyday you work."
good,"I was very successful during my time with Genesco. Our main focus is upselling.  This is something I've mastered over my career.  We also focused on employee development.  Promoting from within was a priority for this company."
good,It was a awsome job to have. I was there about 5 months learned alot and made more friends than ever. I was delighted by the way the treated me there. I am please at the way they run the company. I like the way they train us it is very needed for the job. I feel if they had a smooth team than everything will continue to run right. They are freindly people their. I an amazed by the way some find good workers to fill the spot.
good,Genesco overall good people and a good environment to work in. The work / family time is pretty balanced with the average work day being 8 hours except in the summer. Summer hours consist of an extra work hour during Monday thru Thursday. Friday is a half day which makes for a long weekend.
good,"I am customer service rep. I place, review and cancel orders that customers have place with our companies. I would Provide the customer with all of the information regarding the orders"
good,The company has a fun loving atmosphere around it. They encourage individuality and understand that every individual has something that they can bring on the table. Staff is easy to get along and management has a very outgoing personality that its hard for new hires not to get along with them.
good,"Great Place,Fun environment. Always new styles coming in and a way to me new people. I was given a chance be something great and give support 100%."
good,The company truly cares about its employees. The culture and environment in top notch.
good,"A typical day at the job was interacting with customers and experiencing new things. Something I learned from the job was to approach every customer different but always keep the energy up and stay positive. I believe my management skills was a B- I feel as though there was more I could learn being a better leader to my employees. My co-workers workers made my time at the job one to remember for the rest of my life everyone was full of energy and everyone was a character. The hardest part about my job was recruiting, the most enjoyable part was being able to come up with new ways everyday to better the store."
good,a day at work was the best here. bring people shoes they loved. watching people shop and set new trends. running up and down ladders (personal fun lol). i learned how to give proper customer service along with speedy and coordinated sales skills. the management was great seeing as i was hired right away as management never had a hard time with my employees. the hardest part of the job was trying to put shoes away in the back while there was no one in the front. i always liked making sure i had a part timer there during inventory days. the entire job was enjoyable i found nothing disappointing about working ta this location and for this company.
good,"Met a lot of people along the way. Learned alot about opening and closing a business, not as easy as it looked. Managements continued trust in me to take end of day sales cash and receipts to the bank for deposit and fax all required financial information to corporate headquarters."
good,"The people and managers there were amazing. I loved everyone I worked with and we always had a fun working place. The pay was not fantastic, but it was a paycheck. The discount on shoes is amazing."
good,"Genesco has older, static business operations in need of review and updating to best practices.  Internal communications and relations were in need of development."
good,They pay well and it has a lot of busy work but the company needs to treat their employees better and fix their warehouse and other inside the company operations.
good,Good company to work for. Fun environment get to be yourself while selling shoes. They believe in their culture and live by it through their employees. Promote from within.
good,Genesco is a youth driven company and each individual brand harnesses the employees skills and puts them to use. Going to work is so much fun. You are responsible for your paycheck.
good,Genesco is a great place to work with great benefits.  The warehouse I worked in had a family oriented environment.  Different seasons brought about different work schedules but during peak seasons the work is steady and the pay was great.
good,"Greeted guests, trained employees, hired employees, promoted employees, inventory, shipment, pay roll, scheduling, visuals, sales goals vs ly and plan, auditing, making the store successful."
good,"high energy, customer focused vibe, embrace individuality and celebrate self-expression, numerous opportunities for promotion, great benefits such as 40% off discount, medical coverage, retirement plan and much more."
good,"Great place overall."
good,"Assistant Manager at Store 108. Great team with a great work ethic. Well Managed by the Store Manager and an enjoyable place to work. Customers become regulars and you grow to love your job. I learned patience from my job and not every cooperation is the same. The hardest part of the job is the embroidery machine to ""Create Your Own"" personalized hats."
good,"If you weren't on the floor taking calls, you could definitely just chill out there. Gym. Massage. Cafeteria. STARBUCKS? It rocked. Very relaxed. Loved the people I had met. I can't really say anything negative about my experience."
good,The job is very simple but time consuming depending on which cycle you're scheduled on. A Cycle: works Mon-Thurs 10 hours a day. B Cycle works Fri-Sun 12 hours a day. You will be on production so it gives an opportunity to earn extra money.
good,"I moved up fast but they pick favorites and let others get away with everything. People go to HR for no reason, just to have something to do I guess and nothing is ever done about them lying. I liked it at first but the more higher you go the more drama and child like it gets."
good,It a fun place to work at laid back but you also have to get work done the right way keep the costumer happy and well cared for get to learn a lot and room to grow in the company of you you are willing to put in the work and learn
good,if it wouldn't have been part-time i would probably still be working there today. the management there is very understanding and helpful. the company is very good to its employees.
good,Excellent enviroment when you can easy learn about many subject and help you in life to grow as a worker.
good,"A typical day at work involves on average 30 personal interactions with customers per day. These interactions helped me to learn new skills in how to interact with different types of people and what sales tactics work best when pitching items. This job requires a decent amount of psychological knowledge that management guided us through during monthly meetings: the amount of time it takes for a customer to decide whether or not they intend to buy, how much they are willing to spend, what methods to use when answering certain questions we are asked, etc. The most difficult task of the job is placing shipment items into their respective storage places, especially when we are lacking in space to store them. The most rewarding aspect of this job is the culture involved. At Journeys, individuality an diversity of our workers plays a large role in our success rate and in our teamwork. I love coming into a job knowing that I will not be penalized or have judgement placed on me for who I am."
good,"I have worked for Genesco part-time for 3 years, The company is a great company to work for. At first, it was to pay for tuition for my daughter, 3 years later I am still here."
good,A typical day of work consists of taking a lot of calls answering questions and placing orders. From this job I've learned to have patients with customers and multitask using multiple screens and systems. Management is fare.
good,"SIt down job, accept incoming calls from customers who ordered sneakers, want to track the order, the company is a great company to work for"
good,"8a-5p"

good,Journeys was an awesome place to work.  I feel that it is for a single person Ideally. A lot of time and hard work goes into this job.  Commission and bonuses are great.  Awesome place to work.
good,"Overall it's a laid back job . Just do your job and go home. I hate that they do shift changes now ! Weekly checks , around school time theirs lots of overtime also theirs room for advancement ."
good,the location closed. management was fine. location not in business any longer. very relaxing place however. customer base was great. overall worth it to apply.
good,"Genesco provides a family-like and very casual work environment. A typical work day consisted of taking orders and addressing customer concerns via telephone. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the call volume during rush seasons (i.e. Back-to-school, Christmas, etc). The most enjoyable part of the job was we were always being fed, and freebies (T-shirts, etc) were always given out."
good,"Depending on the day, slow or busy there's always something to do. Manager is understanding, and people you work with are easy to get along with. Always a fun environment."
good,"Great place to work at. A fantastic experience. But if you're looking to pay your bills with the paycheck you're getting there, you will not be able to pay all your nessary bills."
good,My overall experience at journeys was a pleasant one. I loved my employees the customers the style and the feel to it. Ultimately I learned a lot there.
good,"management was strict but didn't make the job difficult ."
good,"Lids was a great job as well, a typical day at work consist of helping customers and keeping the stock room neat and organized. I learned a lot about hats as well as embroidery and a lot of other sports memorabilia. Store Management was great, it was just our district manager who made the job hard. Awesome co-workers, this job was not hard at all and the most enjoyable part was the everyday functions of the job. I loved it."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 4 pm. "
good,It's a good place to work.They do have a very strict point system.But as long as you do your job and show up on time you could have a very good career at genesco
good,Selling shoes over the phone to customers all over the world. Great discounts. the people that worked there were very diversified.The hours were great. The drive to the job was very stressful. My manager was new and had favorites in the office. My overall EXPERIENCE WAS VERY PLEASANT.

good,"While at the Journeys division of Genesco I was an Area Manager and traveled to many stores to hire train and also fire under performing Managers. I was also a certified Auditor which allowed me to conduct Audits in stores without the supervision of a company LP Auditor. I would report my results directly to my assigned LP Auditor, Zone VP and District Manager."

good,i loved working here. If they would have paid more than 11 an hour i would have stayed. Everybody was so nice and so sweet. They were always willing to help
good,Genesco/ Cox Communications was a pleasure to work for. A typical day would consist of working on site at retail stores at local apartment complexes to inform and educate customers on the companies switch to digital. All of my co-workers were great to get along with and were always there to help. The hardest part of the job was explaining the switch to digital to uneducated customers and helping them have a better understanding of the reasoning behind it. I really enjoyed working and meeting new people throughout the process though. In the process I learned a lot about communicating with people efficiently and ensuring that each customer left satisfied.
good,"Good place to learn, friendly management, challenging job, good perks,most enjoyable part of job is  learning and presenting as a team lead"
good,When I worked for Genesco I worked my way up from seasonal part-time sales to management in the matter of months. Here is was giving more tools to be an outstanding manager and built business networks I still use today. The working environment was unmatched and the customer base is always rememberable. The only down fall was that they went out of business.

good,"A typical day at Journeys would be replacing shoes in the wall, pricing them, accepting shipments and putting those shipments in the wall by brand, size, male, female. I learned a lot from this job from everyone i worked with to all my customers. There was some really boring slow days but there also was amazing slow/stead/fast days. I have to say, this was probably one of my favorite jobs i ever had, when i first started my team became my family. unfortunately people got promoted or left, but as the phases kept passing the culture hardly changed. This company is one i worked from high school (senior year) to college (freshman year) i got promoted 2 times within the 2 years i was there. I became assistant Manager at the Journeys Kidz and i had a blast."
good,"A.E. is a great working place. It keeps you young and refreshed with fashion. I learned that fashion change daily. Your co workers are young and fun to be around. The floor sets are challenging."
good,Work this every time they come around. We normally work race events. Great fun times around awesome people. Very easy work with a lot of perks.
good,"I would arrive to to work around 8:30 am to prepare to open up the store at 9 am. During the day it would be slow in the store but in the evening is when the business would pick up. Monday was when shipments would come in and my two employees would unpack shipment, put away in stock and put on the new merchandise on the floor. I learned the management side of the business such as balancing the books and completing payroll. The store manager was young and was understandable about my school schedule and social life. My co-workers were a joy to work with and made it worth while going to work. The hardest part of the job was terminating and writing up my employees for not following company policy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the many different i would meet. "
good,"I had a lot of fun working here.  The people are cool, the atmosphere is great. Downside is that if you are in management there will be months that you dont get a day off and youll have to work quite a few open to close shifts"
good,"The hardest part of the jobs is when you're the manager, and in the end everything ends up falling on your shoulders. But when you sit back and always analyze every single aspect that you hate of your job, its always refreshing to know that even though its hard it builds self appreciation and knowing that you're successful is why I love what I do in helping new people each and every day."
good,Genesco Inc allowed employees to be involved more with the companys decisions through fashion set-ups in stores and such. Company connected more with kids than any other store. Genesco Inc was definitely my most favorite company to work for!
good,selling and distributing shoes and providing excellent customer service. learned the ins and outs of sales at a manager level. co-workers were fo a younger crowd but all the same hard working. hardest part was just staying on top of co-workers on the schedule dealing with a young crowd and all. enjoyed the interations made when selling products.
