rating,review
good,Okay place to work but just so far to travel to work. Excellent cultural balance but slow growth process due to changes within company direction for the future.
good,"Technology, as a call center, is naturally incorporated into the work day so skill set is continually growing. Management is fair and open with employees."
good,"Answered 100 plus inbound calls during peak periods a day, assisted employees with information in regard to forms and documents required for dependents' health care eligibility. Audited all incoming documentation for dependent health care eligibility. I learned to effectively multi-task while maintaining company's benchmarks for customer service performance and data accuracy. Staff consisted of multi-cultural environment and although in a fast paced enviroment, family atmosphere within co-workers existed. The hardest part of the job consisted of maintaining perfect level of performance in customer service, which was monitored on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing I was good at my job, I did it well and it was acknowledged through my performance reviews."
good,No job is without obstacles. So be prepared.... The unexpected is what keeps the job fun.

good,A typical day at work consist of answering phone from customers with problems with their cellular devices. I learned that there are alot of different ways to help people. My managers were very helpful and were able to answer any question I had. My co-workers were friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was the low interaction with the customer. The most enjoyable part was to be able to help customers come to a solution.
good,Would cold call and also leads were generated thru Xerox. Sales reps were trained on the copiers . Product demonstrations were done on the sales floor. Written proposals were done before the client came in. Depending on the volume of copies and other factors we would propose a contract. Follow up product presentations after the copiers were installed by a Xerox tech.Times were good and Xerox was the copier indusry leader.Good commisions and great people.
good,helping people with verizon accouts. I learned alot about communicating with other alot. Co-workers were very nice.
good,Go to office at 9:00 stay untill late in the evening.
good,"Empresa de nome conhecido no mercado de trabalho e multinacional, com benefícios bons. As tarefas diárias não são de complexidade alta, mais não deixando de serem importantes; trabalhamos em conjunto para atingirmos as metas impostas pela nossa supervisão que nos apoia, coordena e direciona de forma simples e objetiva. Nosso cliente é muito exigente e por este motivo a equipe tende a ficar em alguns momentos sob tensão. Mais porém ao chegarmos ao fechamento da nossa fatura recebemos gratificações que variam entre valores e favores concedidos a todos da equipe."
good,"very busy call center, great team leaders, very casual and laid back atmospher"

good,"work from 8 to 5,the managment was very easy,pretty much let us do our work with out supervision ,we all knew what to do on the daily"
good,"The best part about working for Xerox Corporation was going thru their 'Sale Solutions' training. Learning to understand the customer and their company overall goals, BEFORE offering any products, was a valuable business lesson."
good,"6 to 8 weeks of training, in production you take anywhere from 50 to 100 inbound calls daily or more depending on the length of the call."
good,"laid back environment, no micromanager, compensation was good, friendly co workers"
good,"Friendly enviorment, coworkers and managment. I enjoyed working for Xerox."

good,Assist customers over the phone regarding their supply orders. Interact with my co-workers in between calls. Small group but very close.
good,Xerox is a great place to work in
good,"2001-2002 Xerox Copy Center Philadelphia, PA"
good,"During my time at Xerox, I greatly enjoyed the professionalism of the atmosphere, collaborate with co-workers, and everything I learned in my position. The Ink R&D Dept was fantastic. The management was some of the best I've ever experienced, the team was very supportive, and the work we did was quite exciting. "
good,In the technical field you must be able to multi-task your day to day activities.  The hardest part of the job is time management.  There are always available resources to you from your peers or management.
good,"Good Company as well as the management. "
good,Enjoyed the tech savvy knowledge I received in helping customers with their new phone set-up processes. Help to troubleshoot issues concerning the devices by sending refresh signals.

good,"Awesome and friendly place to work for."
good,Global company and allow remote work opportunities.  Promotes inclusive environment and work teams consist of people from vast array of backgrounds and experience
good,"Xerox is the best company where i had been working for two years,"
good,I spent almost 28 years with Xerox.  I worked for them 8/1978 to 1/1986 in direct outside sales.  I was rehired by Xerox in 1/1993 and retired at the end of 2012.  My career was very rewarding.  I think Xerox offers a great opportunity to succeed in career advancement and income.
good,The managers really worked to improve on processes with the help of employees because most I worked with came through the ranks so they invested the time and energy in helping to improve the work till the point that our jobs were outsourced to another country.
good,"nothing to special about the job had an amazing manager for the most part work was fun, but is also stressful due to angry customers, but in all it was a good place to work will it was still open."
good,"Decent working environment, although it gets a little loud in some of the places...just bring headphones. Lots of interesting projects to get involved with..."
good,"I grow with the company and learned alot in terms of building a team that shared for the progress of the company. The management handled us well and we had a healthy environment,"
good,"I worked within my territory to identify opportunities for Xerox hardware and software solutions within a variety of industries including healthcare and technology.  I would discuss their processes, current workflow and discuss inefficiencies and bottle-necks.  "
good,Worked from home.  Independent working role.  Management had confidence in ability and allowed autonomy in position.  Leadership partners allowed team members to be a part of division decisions.
good,"A typical day at work would find me taking calls from customers and helping them out with their verizon accounts. This could include anything from helping them interpret their bills to helping them order a new phone."
good,The staff and work was great however there was no way to progress or incremental pay. I would recommend this for a short term period. Other than that it was great.
good,Good company to work for longer years and good employee benefits. They provide Sodexo and double pay when you work in public holidays. Management plays a political role as well but again that depends on the process to process.
good,"Una empresa con excelente valores organizacional, se aprende muchisimo. ."
good,"I very much enjoyed my superiors. All were eager to help and teach. Up-training was often enough, that I never felt lost in the information. Hours were steady and absence policies were lenient."
good,"Very fun and relaxed place to work, but hardly any room for advancement. Constant hiring as a revolving door in a call center environment. A diverse environment."
good,Xerox was a great experience on what in bound sales call center was like. The ability to follow Xerox training and interact with customers on a daily basis was great.
good,I had a great time working here. Its a call center job so you have to be good at talking to people while be calm and collect. A Super easy job that paid well. The coworkers I had and my Supervisors were great at would always help if I was struggling on a call. You can move up the ranks if you are a good people person and know what your doing. Super flexible hours and overtime if you wanted it
good,"very nice work enviroment with loads of people to assist you."
good,"Fun loving people at Xerox, always help each other out. The executives are also very humble to offer lunch to employees and during the meetings plus the appreciating if you take part in any of the activities."
good,working with customers on billing and upgrades of their cell phones and ans any qusetions about the billing and also adding international plans as requested by consumer
good,It was a job. All they carried about wan numbers. Been there done that. I felt like a number it was a very unhealthy environment.  The environment was like working for a machine shop some of the people were nice but over all I wasn't happy.
good,"Although I learned a completely new skill at Xerox, it was a stressful job.  That was the nature of the industry, due to dealing with the public. It was a number driven job (state quotas to be met) and that added to the stress of the job."
good,I've learned things from my previous work through trainings. The hardest part of the job was that the managers are too strict. The workplace was not yet fully furnished that time and no sleeping lounge and incomplete pantry.
good,Not a bad place to work for. Very demanding and can be stressful with customer complaints. Need good computer and typing skills. They have benefits if work long enough. Must have a positive attitude to work here.
good,My time working at Xerox which is now known as Conduent  was a great experience working with new people and knowing how to meet customers exceptions to it's highest level. the management was good. i was able to go to them with anything.
good,"Management is very good, work life balance is there, job security is also there, i was on contract through kelly services , permanent they don't do it usually , very less chances. rest all is good."
good,"hace muchos años que trabajé en Xerox y fue en Irlanda, dentro del depart. francés, pero puedo decir que la empresa me trató muy bien y tanto los incentivos como el salario eran satisfactorios."
good,Is tends to get a little crowded with hundreds of employees but if you work hard you can go far in the company.There are multiple positions and duties to be filled
good,Call center environment experiencing different cultures while servicing customers assisting with placing refill orders for medications that helps the community become healthy
good,Culture was very professional especially in service to customer and appropriate  attire. They offered various training to supply required services along with added objectives and goals.
good,"Xerox invests a great deal of time and training in their employees. It has a relaxed culture and a very structured environment.  Employees receive additional education and training at Xerox University located in Alexandria, VA. In addition, they offer a great benefits package to their employees."
good,"When I worked there I had to know how to troubleshoot from 5 different modems. I also had to understand changing password for customers, we had to understand which unit to transfer calls to."
good,My experience at xerox gave my my call center based experience. It is really a high passed job depending on what you do there. You can really learn a lot n there good with job security as long as you do what you have to do
good,I enjoyed my short time at Xerox (Conduent).  Other group members were easy to get along with. in fact the only reason that I quit was the comute: it was too long.  I felt like a real team member and my voice cunted when in a meeting or just in a discussion of general topics.  A typical day would be developing .NET MVC applications.  Management was great and fairly minded.  work culture was also very comfortable.  Hardest part of the job was learning a brand new domain since previously my domain was that of Factory Control where now it was Medicare Documentation and Procedures.
good,"In my 20 years with Xerox I had a great opportunity to apply my skills and learn / develop new ones. Hard work and commitment was recognized and opened doors to advancement.  My intent was to stay with Xerox, unfortunately I was retired early due to corporate restructures."
good,"Got my certification in powered equipment there.  I was working temporary and was promised a full time position.  I was laid off, was asked to return, only to be told there was not a full time position available."
good,"i love working here but i am seeing if i can find a company that i can relocate and move back to the Chicago-land area.  "
good,"When I first started at Xerox I've had no experience in their primary industry. Through the coaching and supportive executives I was able to expand on my role and create many meaningful additions to support the company operations. Overall, despite my age gap with my co-workers, everyone at the office I would consider a close friend."
good,Working in a call center environment was my last position which was very stressful as it involved sales.  Numbers had to be met on a daily basis to keep your job.
good,Aggressive deadlines though I build my software in such a way that I create APIs that are used throughout all of the processes that I build so that lightens the pressure.
good,"provides healthy working environment"
good,">Una llegada de cordialidad frecuente."
good,everyone was very pleasant and the job was pretty fun.I learned how to handle calls fast and also it helped with my customer service performance. I would highly recommend.
good,It was a good Job I just had to leave due to an unexpected move. I always had plenty of work and got on well with my co workers and management. We all had lots of team building time so that the whole call center worked well together and were always encouraged to help new employees adjust.
good,Constante monitoreo de equipos y sucursales y apoyo a los usuario en sus instalaciones de equipos
good,"GLOBAL SUPPORT FOR SAP USER, that was a good work life balance. with highly customized environment to learn. Management ans work culture was good & helpful."
good,"I was only project based but the pay was cool and there was always opportunities for over time. my supervisor was very helpful, understanding, and dedicated to her team."
good,"Performed quality work in the mailroom, copy center, and site managed, general machine maintenance operator. Performed other duties as assigned by management."
good,"Being apart of the Xerox Family i learned how to manage my time more efficiently. The hardest part of the work would be, when im able to assist a customer. Situation arise where its beyond my control. The greatest part of being an employee for Xerox is meeting and socializing with different people that have different personalities. This how ever has taught me how to deal with anybody. Enjoyable part would be distressing after a long day, and attending work events with co-workers."
good,"A normal day is 8am-5pm, Monday through Friday.  Other contracts and areas may vary some, but otherwise they're similar.  Options to use either personal phone for a majority of service call related work and company-supplied laptop, local parts drops, and extremely quick supply requests (next day air) help to reduce time spent on sites.  This job has helped to improve focus and provide an improved level of attention to detail.  Small errors or missing observations can cause service calls to lengthen when otherwise they wouldn't.  Management is overall favorable; company imposed performance goals challenge the daily grind.  However, in the last three years, I've gone through five different managers across three different contracting agencies.  I regularly have phone access to that manager, however it is difficult to be able to find a quality feeling of long-term support with regularly shuffling leadership.  The hardest part of the job is normally not the technical aspects, but being able to get the machine to perform to the customers expectations.  In an office environment, being able to help improve reliability when 20-30 people use the machine makes it a challenge.  Humidity changes, paper-quality changes, and third-party print server support challenges are an often occurring demand which thankfully is normally able to be solved with training and experimentation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to (usually) work at a pace that helps keep machine reliability, customer satisfaction, and technical skill levels high, while also giving us enough time to take a breath"
good,"Management in Canada amazing."
good,Set goals individually and for team. Weekly trainings were provided and knowledge of offers. Such as insurance  for roadside. Activities provided that gave training in approaching calls of different disputes.
good,Relaxed job atmosphere if you're a self motivated individual.  Not the best wage for the amount of work that is required.  Management is very helpful and supportive.
good,it was a very good experience .I did enjoy to work in team with my coworkers and assited customer with their inquiries.I will recommend xerox to whoever wants to
good,"Typical work day was setting my own hours, typing, being able to listen to music, podcasts, etc. Ability to have flexibility between life and work. Decent communication with management."
good,"very laid back, management is alright. some mandatory overtime is required. plenty of room for improvement. quota is easy to achieve. over all a very good place to work."
good,"Company provides good technical training for his employees. "
good,"Good working culture, and a place what promotes internal development and progress. It is a laid back and fair environment to work in with approachable and understanding  management."
good,"Pretty good job."
good,Wish things would have worked teacher was great the hours of training was okay really early should be more lenity on single parent trying to provided with what they are dealing with we all need a job
good,I really enjoyed working for Xerox.  I received the best training which helped me to excel at other companies I have worked for. It was hard to get along with senior techs at first because of their big heads and me being a rookie and asking for help when I was stuck. After the first year I had a good grasp of how to do my job well and not have to ask anyone for help.  From then on It was a great experience.
good,"Good Job, they pay okay. The people that were there were kind and straight forward. Management was decent, diverse, good hours, and you have to go through training."

good,"- Très bonne écolé de vente"
good,I worked as a “Project Procurement Engineer” in Consumer Electronics Division and handled all the procurement and other cross-functional responsibilities as above included.
good,"If you're a good performer, the management is very considerate and helps in the best way possible to provide growth opportunities. They are always there to guide and support in your day-to-day activities as well."
good,"This is a good job the only thing that sucks about it is the hours in my opinion . This job pays good even for training hours. This is a good job if u can learn fast and you do your job right,"
good,"Buena empresa para laborar, hay estabilidad y buen ambiente."
good,"* dealing with customer inquiries concern"
good,"We have a nine hours working day and its very tensed and a challenging day with a great exposure and the hardest part of the job was to make sure almost $2 billion payments are paying very accurately and precisely in one month.The response from the upper hierarchy is very cooperative and motivating. the atmosphere inside the team is very energetic, motivating and enthusiastic with a positive mind set.The most enjoyable part of the job is its immense pressure and tension that will push the employee's maximum upto the limit."
good,we are processing health care domain. Our company has very good culture with the employees and support too. We are very flexible to do the work in our company and we working here to privalege us.
good,I never truly appreciated how Great a Place to work Xerox was until I became a Canon Tech. Xerox truly made you feel valuable and appreciated they realized how important your personal life is and seemed to keep staffing levels high enough so you always had adequate time off and personal time. Canon seems to care less about any of that! Canons people are expendable and unimportant!
good,"* My typical day at work"
good,"Training was very informational and they made sure you knew what you would be doing. "
good,"what's great about this company is the awesome teamwork each department has. supervisors treat their staff well and are very communicative and are quick to resolve issues.  There are team builds to help the employees de-stress and have a few hours of fun."
good,"you have a set schedule and time of working between the hours of 6am-6pm during the week only. management is nice enough. I've learned about the 125 cafeteria plans- fsa, hsa, commuter and cobra as well. work is very quiet because of what we deal with on a daily basis- lives are at stake. hardest thing would have to be not being able to help the way we would like to. the best thing is we get weekends and holidays off to be with our family. I was there for almost 6 years and only got 1 raise when I moved up to a supervisor but that only happened because the previous supervisor quit."
good,"Very comfortable environment to work, friendly coworkers, resting area, and game room... cafeteria was great. Management could be better, and by that i mean more consistency. Besides that, everything was great!"
good,La estabilidad laboral asi como la familiar es lo que mas me gusto de esta compañia
good,"The various positions and opportunities they offered really furthered my abilities, they offered a constant variety of training as well."
good,There was an excellent level of cohesiveness and teamwork when it came to unloading the truck. Management checked on us frequently and made sure we weren't hungry or dehydrated and gave us acknowledgement for both good jobs and bad jobs we have done as a team.
good,"Working at Xerox was an interesting learning experience. I had never been in such a conservative work environment before. I learned the importance of appreciating every aspect of your employees, whether they have similarities with you, or not. I learned that crunching numbers allay was not that much fun, but I loved the advancement opportunities being with a major corporation gave me."
good,In the short time I worked there I enjoyed the enviormant and the staff. Chill work place and not to demanding of a job. Overall a fun place to work. Really awesome experience.

good,Worked with engineers that valued their work and others.  Very smart and hard working people.  Worked as a team.  Flexibility is good at Xerox especially when you have a family
good,"Work balance, during holiday we can work from home.  We have the option to work less 8 hours on any given day provided we work 40 hours per week.  Basketball tournament is also provided by company"
good,"Strukturierte Arbeitsabläufe, viel Eigenverantwortung und viel Kundenkontakt. Flexible Arbeitszeiten und Gestaltung von Mittag. interne sowie externe Weiterbildungen werden gefördert und unterstützt. Tolles Arbeitsklima aber fehlende Kommunikation von Management."
good,"Un bon établissement de travail dans un super environnement, un cadre d'équipe très sympa"
good,Xerox was fun to work at and I enjoyed our customers. All customers eventually appreciated everything you did for them even if you tried everything you could and nothing worked.
good,"Various divisions of the company. Management is helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  The work life balance is much appreciated with Xerox. I enjoy working for this company."
good,Typical end of the month closing can get extremely stressful and hectic when invoicing and trying to meet your plan. But when you have a get relations ship with your vendors all things fall into place at the right time.

good,"usually worked 8 hour/day taking calls to  answer questions and complete requests regarding Medicaid eligibility and HMO enrollments,"
good,"Xerox was an exceptional place to work. I had great co-workers, and for the most part, awesome management. I enjoyed the job itself, as I  like talking to diverse people and I thrive on being able to problem solve for the customer. The hardest part of the job was working with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to resolve the issue for an angry customer. I don't think the compensation was equal to the skill requirements of the job."
good,"A normal day consist of login into your phone taking phone calls and helping the customer get the best experience they can get. You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break. It's a pretty simple day, once in a while you get customers who give a hard time but usually its a simple and nice job."

good,Xerox always treated me very well/they were always there to help their people improve their skills/xerox does alot for their community/we gave to the homeless and tots for tots just as a example/hardest oqart of my job was my customers frustrations when they couldnt get their medicine

good,"I worked most of the time I was there in the same group, which grew from about 30 people when I started to over 100 when I left.    There were a lot of foreign engineers and there was a lot of friendly discussion spiced with occasional friction over difference of prespective.   Early on, it was like a family and we had regular friday lunches attended by most members of the team.    "
good,Everyone is a team player and easy to get along with. Management is very knowledgeable in all areas and also willing to pitch in when needed. Overall it is a good company to work for but not a lot of room to grow career wise.

Most of the time you need to work hard and these tasks makes this job very interesting, but there are also a lot of routine operations as well. Your colleagues and managers always can give you a hand with advice, and overall atmosphere is very friendly and positive."
good,I would recommend this company to those who are looking to make easy money. One can easily increase rate through bonuses offered. The hours can be long sometimes as most work weeks are more than 40 hours. This means that overtime is always available.
good,"Great place to work if you want the call center experience."
good,"Challenging and rewarding environment; many opportunities to learn new technologies and business processes; fantastic co-workers; long hours to accomplish goals but worth it!; struggle to convert from ""legacy"" systems to newer ""all-in-one"" solutions"

good,"not only do you get good benefits but you get a simple enough job. it's not hard to follow what we are to do and just do it. sometimes, you have to really think about the issue on your plate and figure out why that phone isn't working or how a charged happened. I like working here but for me its a bit boring. I'm used to moving around and going from one side of the store to the other or running to be sure students don't try to leave before time, etc. Overall, a great place to work at if you are looking for something easy to do and sit for eight hours this is the job for you."

good,"Xerox is a 3rd part vendor for Verizon wireless I loved it , co workers were friendly a typical day at work was taking calls from customers who needed help with their phone or account the hardest part of the job was not knowing the answer to the customers question an there was no one to help you. It was a great job though"
good,"A lot of advancement opportunity, Very helpful supervisors, beneficial training. Multiple shifts to bid on to have a schedule more to your needs. General Manager is quite good at meeting new hires and allowing them to know the work place."
good,"Learn much more technologies"
good,"This is a good place to work and a great place to advance your career. I consider myself lucky because I have great team, work with great people and I have a great manager."
good,This place you have to dedicate a lot of time to. If you can then you will make a good bit of money but it demands a lot of time. Good chances for advances up to a certain point. Can be fun and rewarding for those that have a lot of time to delegate to work. Not as flexible as needed for those with kids or a lot of other engagements.
good,"Taking incoming calls from members about their plan and there medications. Verifying Hipaa, and verification with members where calls are being recorded and graded."
good,"It was a great job having offering part time and full time opportunities, but they closed the part time departments and now only carry full time. The work environment was friendly and quiet. The workers had a lot of freedom on how to do their job and they were very lenient on the breaks."
good,"- Chegava da faculdade, almoçava num ambiente ótimo e descontraído, batia o ponto e cumpria os devidos intervalos ao longo de dia. Atendia clientes que muitas vezes apresentavam a mesma questão ou problema porém, o demonstravam de maneiras totalmente diferentes. O maior desafio era esse: saber lidar com isso. "
good,"Com esse trabalho aprendi a atender melhor as pessoas e corresponder as necessidades delas, trabalhar com vontade e dignidade, a parte mais agradável era que no final o cliente saia com satisfação e que agente conseguiu atender as necessidades dele."
good,Good ownership.  Good opportunities for financial success.  You are given the tools to succeed however the management can at times micro manage the sales team.
good,"opportunités de développement,salaire correct,bonne écoute ,"
good,Northeast Copier Systems was a great place to work with great incentive based bonuses.  Management was very professional and easy to go to with questions.
good,"I absolutely Loved the job, and the people I was surrounded by. It was very laid back and friendly environment. I'd go in, work for a bit go on my breaks, work some more , lunch, back to work and by the time I look at the clock its almost time to go home. It was fun and enjoyable. I think that's what made the time go by so quick. I think the hardest part of the job was the breaks in between calls. I have nothing negative to say about the job. If anything, it showed me what I enjoy doing, what I'd like to build my career out of."
good,"Long hour shifts but the employees there were great and easy to get along with. Management was good but kind of confusing at times. Hardest part of working there was the additional 5 hours of mandatory overtime that you had to get in on top of your 8 hour shifts working 5 days a week, with two kids it was hard to find a reliable baby sitter which was why i had to quit."
good,"first step on the sales career path , well professional; company , this company was the school that delivered every sales rule strategy plan trick to me"
good,"My experience with xerox gave me a awareness of how important customer service is. a typical day you will be changing phone plans, assisting with tier 1 troubleshooting with phone issues and answering billing questions. There are easy and hard calls but with good customer service you can help even the most irate customer feel better about the service by relating and showing empathy to the customer"
good,I was a Customer Care Rep i answered calls and resolved any issue the customer had.
good,My main position is taking calls from Apple customers to troubleshoot phones and computers. I've learned a lot basic troubleshooting steps to help resolve customer calls. The management at the site was great. The Supervisors and Quality Assurance did their very best to assist me further on how to handle customer calls and help resolve customer issues. One of the hardest parts of my job was dealing with customers who were irate and not familiar with their phones and computers. But the hardest part of the job is the shift bid every few months. Dealing with irate customers is not too hard to deal with because I managed to build rapport and assure that I'll work with the customer to help resolve their issue.
good,"Skilled management."
good,one of the best things was when I fixed t difficult problem and got the machine up and running for the client

good,"I have learned how the people receive they money that are on child support and all the detail that is involved with making sure the payments are received and posted correctly. When I get to work in the morning we take a mail tray of mail, sort it out, then jog the mail before we put it on our machine for slicing. After we set up our machines then we proceed to slice the envelopes, take out the paperwork & checks, then scan them. We have 50  line items per batch and once we reach 50, we close the batch and put it into a empty tray to be QA'd after all the checks have been scanned. I work with 4 other co-workers, 3 in the mailroom and 1 in B & R. We are a small group of people, but we always make our deadlines and work well together. I would say the hardest part of the job is having to be in so early on Monday and Tuesdays. I think one of the most enjoyable parts of the job, is knowing that we make sure the people who receive child support are receiving their money. One other thing I have enjoyed, was being able to learn how B & R works and how I can help them out when someone is on vacation or out sick."
good,"Productive place of business. I learned a lot about Health, Medical, Dental and Disability Insurance and how to process claims.  Co-workers were amazing and always willing to help and worked well as a team.  The most hardest part of the job was resigning."
good,"A Gerência criava uma clima de leveza apesar de toda pressão que sofríamos por resultados devido a situação da empresa, que acaba sendo responsável pela dificuldade de conseguir promoções e/ou aumento de salários."
good,Xerox is a great company to work for. I have been with the company for 12 years.
good,I loved working at this job too bad the project ended and we all have to move on. I got to help people travel and work as a close team to some wonderful people. When you enjoy work you don't do it for the money.
good,"Most days I'd prep documents, scan them, check them to make sure I had them completely and correctly scanned, and put them back into the folders exactly as they had been.  All parts of the job were things I had learned before.  Until the last few days I was working with people I really hit it off with.  Right at the end we had twice as many people working at the same time, working in teams.  For some reason that stressed me out so much I couldn't take it.  The things I liked best about the job were the physical security and the nice co-workers.  Also, my supervisor was very helpful."
good,"En el trabajo diario se busca cumplir con procedimientos."
good,na casa da xerox eu aprendi como tratar as pessoas melhores fazer novos amigos ser mas feliz com avida . e aparte ms ruin do trabalho que era a carga horaria que era das 7;00 horas as 19;horas
good,"Bij Xerox werk ik onder het project eni. eni is een gas -en elektriciteitsleverancier dat iedereen kent van de reclame met de hond met vijf poten."
good,I honestly hated leaving this place. We actually were like family. We worked great as a team and the management cared about every one of their workers. The hours didn't allow me to be at home with my family as much as I needed to. hardest part of the job was keeping up with Software updates and changes for products but I actually loved that part at times as well. Overall Awesome place to work. we had a lot of good times there and I made a lot of loving co-workers.
good,"I've worked at a number of call centers, and Xerox is the first one where I can honestly say that management will fight for you and treats their employees with respect and compassion. Not all supervisors are created equally, but all of them try their best to give you what you need and deserve to get your job done and maintain your mental health. It's not easy to talk to people all day long, get raked over the coals and have your bonuses based on customers' reviews of your performance, but the environment at the Tigard location is outstanding. Co-workers are always willing to help, lend an ear or back you up. The only downside to working at Xerox is the pay; it's not competitive, which makes you feel like you are easily replaced by someone else willing to work for the low wage. I think that this low wage keeps more qualified workers from applying and pushes them into the arms of competitors. The bonus structure is laughable, but as long as you're not relying on it, everything works out okay."
good,"With my particular job, I have the opportunity to work from home.  This allows for some flexibility with my work day.  This also allows me to work extra hours when needed with little inconvenience.  I do have daily contact with my manager  either through email or phone.  With being a team lead, I have learned much about being flexible, and the importance of being patient and understanding with people.  I have had to do payroll, and make sure employees that I am responsible for are working there hours, and that they're quality is where it needs to be."
good,"The best part of working at Xerox CQS was the other nurses and support staff.  No departments divided.  Everyone pitched in during high customer demands and all levels supported wherever the greatest need was day to day or hour to hour."
good,"The compensation package for this customer service position in Salt Lake City can be very lucrative based upon your job performance. There are also many overtime opportunities to where you can earn $20+/per hour. The majority of the management team is committed to employee development and creating a good culture. "
good,"A typical day at the office would be answering the in bound calls for SC Child Support Enforcement Division's clients. I learned a lot about the state of SC child support guidelines, procedures, and laws. Management is wonderful with working with and near the call center reps. Co-workers are friendly and a joy to work with. The hardest part of the job is the pay. We are paid 0.60 per call, and on some days we do not have enough calls for all of the staff to have the needed means to continue to maintain our life's financial responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is my work environment, the clients and my co workesr."
good,it was a good job I learned that working for a health insurance agency can be stressful and hard at times when people or crying and upset about not being able to afford their plans or medication. The best part about the job is I love multi tasking and you had to do a lot of that. I did work long hours so at times I felt like I lived at work. I loved to be able to just have a job so that is what made my job fun and being able to assist customers.
good,"It was frustrating at times but supervisors were more than helpful , tenured agents around helped me as well. The only bad things were the surveys. If someone gave you a bad survey even if you did everything possible they're real hard on you. I just did my job and plenty of room for advancement I was only on the phone for like 2 months got put on esc. line as well as walking the floors. They were always providing free food, Walmart gift cards other tax free gifts tvs ipads good stuff easy to win too!!"

good,Working for XEROX is a great experience. co-workers have friendly environment.as I work in production environment every activity will make me curious and exiting.but coming to celebrations i promise there is not much.
good,"My day at Xerox was typically easy. I would take technical calls for Apple's iOS products. Which entailed typing key notes and issues customer had with the product and tried to resolve those issues if need be. I received payment for the purchase of the new product or support plan through debt or credit card and e-checks. Management was management... they did their job, they weren't there to be your best friend. In most situations they were understanding. My co-workers were some of the most friendly and helpful people if you did not know or understand something they did not have a problem assisting you. The hardest part of the job to me was when the customer gave me a negative score on the customer satisfaction survey because they had an issue with a previous advisor or did not agree with Apple's policy. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job would have been assisting people with their issues and knowing that I resolved it as well as made sure their perception of the company was still in good standings."
good,I was a cashier in a hospital cafe so I learned how to run a cafe. The management was nice and so was my co-workers.. The hardest part was standing up for 8 hours a day the most enjoyable was getting off early
good,Good team of people and always ready to help and guide. Learned allot from co-workers and able to get promoted internally.
good,Great balance between work and home life. benefits were great. Experience and training gained during my tenure is invaluable.
good,"A typical day at work for me is getting to work by 8:00am,starting up my computer, checking messages and returning calls. Then I would process and mail out my claims and then do my daily reports. I learned how to bill and process claims and also be of help to the customers on a daily basic. Also I satisfied my customer's. I and my co-worker's where a team and got the job done. There was not a hard part just a more challenging part at work and that was making sure everything was done by the end of the work day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customers."
good,it was very good company to work for and I wouldn't mind do it again
good,lead a team of workers on a daily basis. got along with employees
good,"Xerox is a good place to work, but there are a lot of factors that tie into your pay. They tell you that you can make 14.50 a hour which is true but your pay is based off of surveys, attendance, handle time and etc."
good,33 years of service. great place to work! wanted to move on enjoyed my time.
good,"Every day at Xerox is a fast paced work environment, constantly prospecting to build up my pipeline for success.  Managerial support was 100% there for any questions and proposal building.  Had weekly traveling with direct manager to take to new potential clients.  I worked mostly with Non-customers to gather cold calling experience. Worked from home 75% and have perfected time management and successfully been the #1 salesman for 2 years and running.  The hardest part of copier sales is the competition, since there are so many options, it has almost always come down to price and Xerox isn’t the cheapest in anyway but learned how to change the talk track from price to customer support and with our price we bring value and become more than just a vendor. I learned a lot about B2B sales and communication with customers and non-customers. I graduated from the world renowned Xerox training that helped with my day to day activities.  This was a great opportunity to learn outside sales and prospecting.   The most enjoyable part of this job was the managerial support and personalities; they worked with us like co-workers and not a superior at all times."
good,"Empresa sabe valorizar o funcionário."
good,"I manage my own day to day routine. Mapping out the best strategy to schedule appointments with key clients who can grow my business by allowing me to manage theirs through their print infrastructure. I cover a wide territory from the out skirts of Berkshire MA to Dutchess, Putnam, Westchester and Ulster Counties.The hardest part of my job, is tackling my bonus every quarter and staying consistent to reach the right people at the right times. Through the dedication the job requires, I've learned to set goals and focus on them until they are exceeded. The most enjoyable part is the flexibility to work from home during a storm or sick day also to know that great incentive is promised once you reach your targets."
good,"toen ik begon met werken, had ik totaal geen ervaring in de caalcentre brance."
good,"Work is mostly fixing copiers, keeping an inventory and lots of driving, co-workers are usually nice, management if really good, the hardest is wen we can not get parts or fix a copier, you learn to deal with customers and the enjoyable part is wen you get a smile/thank from customers......."

good,"A typical day at work was sitting down behind a computer screen, ansering phone calls from providers: pharmacies, doctors, etc. helping them in processing and billing Aetna insurance company. Management was very well-trained just difficult to reach at times when a member requested one. Co-workers were all very excited and outgoing and caring to the needs of the members and providers.

good,There was no typical day supporting XMS. Days varied from routine number crunching to presenting financials to the executives. Learned how a team can work together to pull through tough times. Management genuinely cares about all levels of the organization. It is a smart staff with a very bright future. Toughest part of the job is the constant organizational changes. That is tempered by the family feel of the organization.

With that part time I was really able to use the skills I recieved from previous jobs in fitness facilites and also with my major in college. I juggled between two different brances with this company. The management was excellent but there were not many co-workers, it was typically myself and the management. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to use my experiance in fitness and health care and use it to help these individuals improve their daily living. The hardest part about this job was there was quite a lot of down time, especially towards the days were they ended up closing the facilities for good nationwide."

I am new and all I know is the the management team is there to support you if you get stuck on a question, or need help. Typical day at work is log in, and answer calls, and emails. The hardest part of the job is when you have a caller, and you need to send emails, and you kind of have to catch up with yourself. Phone calls are at a steady pace, some fast days, and some really slow days. The most enjoyable thing is being able to work from home. Try and pick a schedule time frame that best suits your needs with you family, and your personal life. Wish we had more breaks, but thats life! Just try to enjoy it, you will be talking to mean people sometimes, but if you have the Customer Service skills, you will be able to overcome it. This is a great job for people who need steady income and will be able to know that they will get a paycheck every two weeks! you will need to learn a lot of information and really listen and understand what you are doing. If you are a person that just goes off of memory this is not for you. You need to understand your calls, and every caller is different! You need to go off a script as well, so this may be a little tough, but follow your script and do what your told, and your set."

The only disadvantage is working in a graveyard shift straight - 4 years. But our rest days are fixed to weekends which is also one of the good things. Bosses are so approachable and easy to work with as long as your meeting their expectations, especially when your exceeding it."
good,Goede werkomgeving met veel leermogelijkheden. Ik kreeg de mogelijkheid om binnen een aantal maanden op 4 verschillende plekken te worden ingeleerd. Hierdoor blijft het werk afwisselend en uitdagend.

Lo bueno era el espacio en tiempo después del trabajo ya que se podía estudiar o trabajar en otro lado."
good,"Management team is good.  I would work with this company again."
good,Being a Trainer for Xerox in Customer service was Great.  Being able to help to shape and direct agents to the proper way for handling customer service for our client.   The ability to be able to work and improve my way of teaching and working with individuals with direction from boss but basically being my own boss.  (freedom as long as stayed within guidelines)
good,While working with my prior companies I learned patience and listening skills. Working with divers customers you have to be patient and listen careful to there concerns so that you maybe able to addressed them. I work very closely with co-workers on daily basis. My most enjoyable part of my jobs was meeting different people either in person or over telephone.

I felt like I was a member of the team and always felt good working for Xerox and the way they treated me.
good,Management was great - people/culture was fun. Lots of team-building and training/learning opportunities.
good,"The job is a data entry type that requires research trought humana systems, is a simple job. The best part of the job is that it is one in a relaxed atmosphere, also and all the people I've met. The worst part is when it comes to high season, meet the deadline when overworked."
good,"I loved my job at Xerox and I believe I was very good at it too. My surveys always came back great and I was always one of the top representatives in the center. My issue with this job was my supervisor, as he was not supportive or helpful. He seemed irritated any time I had a question to ask. I have tried several times to work for Xerox again, but no luck.... Please hire me back Xerox! :)"

good,"Xerox highly values its employees, especially the people who take calls.  There are lots of continuing education opportunities and growth opportunities abound."
good,"In de magazijnen werk je in ploegendiensten. Je hebt met jouw afdeling gezamelijk pauze en er is gratis drinken te halen. De collega's zijn er erg leuk en je wordt geholpen met al je vragen. Het is wel flink doorwerken als het druk is, maar ik zelf had daar geen problemen mee. Je moet wel veel tillen, dus met een zwakke rug zou ik het wel afraden te doen."
good,"I worked in a copy-center/mailroom account.  The job was different every day.  You have to be able to change your work schedule at a moments notice to make sure the job gets done.  Management here is very empowering to the employees.  They lets make our own decisions on how to best please the customer/client.  I learned that when ever I was going to be off the next day/week, There would always be a company wide letter that had to go out that night and I would not get it till 3:00pm or 4:00pm and my hours were 8am-5pm. But that would mean some overtime on my next paycheck, so all was good in the end.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up on who was and who was not employed at the site(s).  There was a lot of mail that was trashed, but I got approval from my on site contact to call the places that were sending mail in these peoples names to discontinue those names.  My contact was happy that I took it upon my self to take care of this as they were very into recycling and reducing waste.  The reaction and the faces on my customers when I completed their jobs a head of schedule was one of the most enjoyable parts of being a contract employee at these sites.  Also, being thought of as one of their own."
good,It was a great experience working for them. The company had very poor communication.

good,"-typical day at work answering phone calls and helping members"
good,"Planner zijn bij Xerox betekend dat je constant klaar moet staan voor een uitdaging, de puzzel kan elk moment veranderen en daarop moet je dan handelen. Het kan aardig hectisch en stressvol zijn maar de communicatie met de collega's en de engineers die je plant zorgen ervoor dat het toch gezellig is."
good,on a typical day i learned that our superviors really didn't care to speak to customer so that meant we had to make them happy and keep the off the phone as much as possible. i also learned that with great patients come great benefits. the hardest part of the job was when the customers were rude and keep cool is what you had to do no matter what they said. i enjoyed xerox because it was a comfortable work space and meeting new people .
good,"At work we have our own space to work in. The day starts off early for my team and I. Since, we are the first team in the building; it is important for us to arrive on time and be prepared. Dealing with Sprint customers for the past 3 years; I have learned to be patient and understanding. One thing I had to learn was that I am a customer too, and the customer is calling  for care. Knowing that I can provide the best customer care makes my day easier at work. Since, I take pride in resolving customers issues each day at work; I am one of the top agents in the call center. One of the hardest parts of my job is trying to please an unsatisfied customer. Even though I may have been kind and answered all their questions; when they get the survey if they did not get their way, they can fail me. When I fail surveys, it drops my bonus pay and my bonus pay is how I get paid the top pay. I would for the base pay to be more than $9.00 per hour, so surveys wouldn't hurt me so bad."
good,irate customers who receive violations for going thru an an ezpass lane without having an ezpass account. and customers who have an ezpass account that go thru lanes without having money on the account

good,"A day at work with Xerox was heavy call volume and I enjoyed the job. What I learned from the job is that there are all kind of personalities and you have to be very patient with individuals, but overall working with the co-workers was a pleasure"
good,"Work starts out fast pace and ends usually just the same. Management was fun and helpful everyday. Co-workers are pleasant to be around and helpful when needed. The hardest part would probably be handling angry customers but i can handle angry customers when i know what their angry about and i know my work, that would just be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with hours that i wanted, management and co-workers."
good,This was definitely a job for those who can work long and hard and enjoy reaping benefits from their efforts. The training is excellent and you are prepared when you get on the floor. Duties include taking calls from customers and providing customer service and or troubleshooting. Management is always very helpful and you are in an environment where it is easy to make friends and form bonds with co-workers. The hardest part of this job is balancing this job with life at home. The hours I was working made it difficult to do household chores because I got home late at night and where I live we have a curfew for running dishwashers and other loud appliances. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers learn about their new products and help them resolve issues they might be having.
good,"My experience with this company was helpful, an experience, fun place to work at. The staff and co- workers was respectful and very exciting to have me apart of the company."

good,When I first came to Xerox I didnt know what to expect. After about a few weeks I became very comfortable in my position as a health benefits representative.

Although Xerox has taught me alot I now hold a Bachelors degree and feel that I must move on to a profession that I will have longevity in.

Daily we would start out with a sunrise meeting to discuss the part shortages and target the daily build, absenteeism and review quality and field reports. Co-workers were specialized in their area of expertise but would lend a hand when needed to make the work flow continue smoothly. The hardest part of the job is the changing customer demands required for European builds but we always met the challenge head on and succeeded. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the satisfaction of our customers."

The staff was very friendly and although the call volumes were normally high, I still managed to have an outstanding day with a wonderful team by my side."
good,"answering multi phone lines, enjoyed meeting new friends and helping out customers when they needed help figuring out their bills, or wanting to changing plans to help save the customers money"
good,"Nice place to work, lot of knowledge to soak in training is 9 weeks, have to be able to separate work from home because customers are upset sometimes and you have to remember they are upset with company not you"
good,"A great first job, friendly environment, I love to cook and eat. I love to make people happy!!"
good,"Xerox is known the world over for it's printers. They do so much more, as such this is a company to work for. Yes, Xerox is an amazing company. Management is friendly."

Excelente trabalho em equipe e agradável ambiente de trabalho."
good,working for data entry meant you had to work long hours on some days but then other days you might only work for like 4 days so checks were very Inconstant.
good,"the more money you want the more you work. mandatory overtime all the time. fast paced , 30 min lunches. if you want to be on the good side don't talk do your job."
good,I love indeed.it is  a great site to find a job..they always call back promptly and the site is easy to use. Unsure as to why its telling me to write more in a review because there is nothing more to talk about.
good,"Xerox is a great company to work for, in the past years working there I had learn lots of things. I enjoy going to work. the hardest part about working there is dealing with negative people)not the customers) employee and managers"
good,"ganhei bastante experiencia em vendas, entrega de notas, emissões de notas."

good,"Prós: Refeição na loja, salario sem atraso e pessoas maravilhosas."
good,"Not Xerox of past, fun place to work, but it is union and they have no power to do anything but take your dues every to weeks, You have operators making more money than skilled trades, very dirty"
good,I have learned many of things in my journey from ACS which is now Xerox
good,"learning a new idea""s to improve my efficiency , also produce work with 100% quality with a given period of time"
good,"I would enter the office and review all emails, follow ups and revised proposals. Review lease report to look for new opportunites and also teleprospect and cold call for new business. I learn to work in different situations in terms of industries, customers, document management. Co workers are amazing and very helpful. The daily problems with existing accounts, also the new sales cycles you have started can be rough as well. So at times things like this becomes overwhelming. Coming across those nice people while cold calling can lift your day and motive you for the rest of the day at times."
good,Management was unprepared for the influx of help they took on.  Especially through its transition period.  Which created stress in work they weren't they really sure how to do. They made it through with flying colors I'm sure.  We all learned something from it.
good,i would say it is a nice place to work but there alot of supervisors who have no clue of what they are doing. And most of the time we are left to find answers to question asked by the cx on our own.
good,"Experienced extreme racist comments from co-workers, told I didn't belong there because I was white.  Informed management, no actions were taken.  Project based... didn't tell anyone if they were being kept until a half hour before the end of their shift on the last day of the project."
good,"a gerência deixou a desejar pela falta de comunicação e incentivos aos profissionais. muita cobrança interna, porém, sem muita dedicação com apoio externo"
good,"It's a pretty lax, friendly workplace, and for the most part I enjoy my job very much. Working with customers isn't too challenging, however there are often too many cooks in the kitchen."
good,"productive work place, good hours, great environment and people."
good,"A typical work day for me includes processing new and existing applications, data entry, income verification from 9-12:30pm and form 12:30-5;00pm I take incoming calls from parents assisting them with information about their premium payments and eligibility status. What I enjoy most about my job is research and resolving complex situations with accounts. I've learned how to be a team player, excellent floor coach for new hires and how to management workflows"
good,Fantastic foundation for future positions; work - life balance is tough; work never ends.
good,Foi meu segundo emprego onde aprendi mais sobre o mercado de trabalho.
good,universidade de vendas em porto alegre sem algo parecido
good,Xerox is an ok job to work for. The pay is very great the job is very easy. At times the managers refuse to take calls when the customer would ask to speak to one
good,They need to embrace the future and move past managed print services.  They were one of the first to embrace cloud internally but have been unable to position their strengths to new clients.
good,I worked in the assembly field and it was easy work and hard work depending on the team you were working with.  The overtime was great when you wanted it but could be a hinderence if you have small children and the hours are outside of daycare hours.  The benefits were great
good,"Management was up and down; some were great to work for, others were horrible to work for. Most days went by fast because of friends you could make and sit down by. Until management changed everything and it made it harder to go to work."
good,I worked for them for a long time when Sprint backed out the were able to find another company at the time pay dropped so i left not sure how it is now.
good,"En mi estancia en esta empresa me senti muy bien ya que el ambiente laboral es relajado, y el horario se adapto a mis necesidades."
good,"The supervisors are sweet and professional some more helpful than others. My overall experience was nice. However, coaching needs work, training needs a lot of work as far as the actual job. They expect you to sell but don't really teach how to use system or codes. So, it takes forever and is intimidating to try for a while. They're all about numbers even if it is not you that's bad. The numbers are most important.  I will say they do the best they can with the turn over of employment and time frame to get the next class on the floor."
good,I worked for them from 2005 to 2007 and never have a rise. Very low wages and if you wasn’t blood related with one of the member of the management team you will not go anywhere. They are no longer in business you realized why.
good,"Pretty good company, when I worked there they was just opening up and starting, so there was still a few kinks that needed to be worked out."
good,"You have to be fast at this job."
good,The hours were very long required daily overtime. Management was not very personable. It was a fun environment would recommend it for single person home
good,"Work is fast paced and intense, lack of face to face interaction in a windowless building can be stifling."
good,It was my introduction to corporate America. I worked full time and went to college full time. It was a pretty flexible job. Great entry level job. I dont recommend long term unless you anticipate on being a manager.
good,Xerox is a wonderful place to work.  Great people to work with.  Working from home is the best benefit.  Stressful at times due to workload.  enjoyable part of my job was working with such great people.  the people that are there are extremely talented
good,ur on a computer for 8 hrs a day making changes to health insurance plan and then submitting them so yeah that about it and if u didnt do it fast enough they got mad
good,"Working here at Xerox was a new challenge everyday. I enjoyed the flexibility we had , but i dislike the fact that there was no career movement , no place for suggestions."

good,Xerox has been my home for more than 9 years. It has seen me grown from a high school teenager to a Professional. It is a great place to work.
good,"A typical day consisted of Inbound/Outbound calls, Project management, Data Entry, customer consultation, data collection, interviews, and training new employees. The most enjoyable part was that they were my family away from home. The hardest part was no benefits and my contract assignment ending with short notice."
good,It was an ok company but some of the management was handed there position due to who they know not on job performance and it could some time be a very unprofessional
good,"Taking phone calls isn't all that great, but it's easy to advance and get into operations management or support staff. The training department was a lot of fun :)"

good,A very flexible work schedule. I have learned so many billing experience with Xerox. I enjoy working with all of my co worker and there is no hardest part of this job. I do enjoy everthing with Xerox.
good,Always on the phone with different customers all day long. I enjoy customer service the most

It is a great place to work.  The pay is OK, but below market rates.  The company is struggling with revenue and profits, and is unable to pay market rates.  New hires will be compensated competitively but do not expect long term competitive pay."

Whilst I enjoy my job, I feel that it may not last indefinitely, because Xerox's purchase of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) has led to a change in the Corporate ethos, and I am concerned that my sector of the business may be phased out before too long - Managed Services at smaller accounts is receiving much less attention than before."

good,"overall good it is ok ,management also ok,salary is not good,but work life balance is really good.overall comfortable to work but not exceptionally good."
good,"As with all call centers, too much emphasis put on number of calls taken, rather than primarily focusing on quality of calls. You can have the highest success of solving customer issues, however be taken to task and asked repeatedly how you will improve your time on the phone if you don't fall into their strict benchmark.Also you are hired on through a placement agency which means less pay, then you wait several years to be 'converted' into an actual Xerox employee."

good,"A typical work day is unpredictable. Its a changing environment so one must be alert and prepared for change. Multitasking is key factor and completing daily reports was mandatory, not doing so would create a serious overlap and increase work load for the previous day. Accountability is key, it is an important part of my job. Work very well with line staff and management. Work related conflicts where dealt in a professional manner. There are some really funny co-workers who possesses great Team Spirit, you can always count on them to share a joke and debate on some interest topics (of course multitasking).

The hardest part about working at Xerox (the ACS division) is getting up-to-speed on who the 'players' are and working through everyone's extremely busy schedules to accomplish your goals or tasks.

The employees communicate well with one another. Most employees had issues perceiving hard work as favoritism, for those who made progress for themselves; when in actuality, everyone works hard in that facility. The culture is diverse, a bit too open for some. I personally felt disturbed by seeing some men in women's clothes; that was the hardest part of the job for me."

good,Xerox is a nice company to work for under the right management. Enjoyed the work that I did with the clients. And the hours were adequate to suit my schedule.

good,"Friendly colleagues, intelligent teamleader, intresting research programs, extensive lab instruments, beautiful company building, convenient communication with company branches worldwide, free coffee."
good,"Interaction with other staff members only happened at the original training and then we got sent home to work. In my case that was 11 years ago. So all our interactions and communications are done by  emails. it works perfectly with a mum with young children, and I was one of them and I am very thankful for the great opportunity.(i.e the ability to clock out any time to drive out to pick up a sick child from school and clock back in to complete your shift). But as i mention in my resume i need a more active job to be healthier."

good,The company is not bad of a company but the people they move up ia because they are related or you have to kiss alot of butt
good,"Wonderful company with great employees but limited growth opportunity. "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be 5 hours handling prior authorizations when all projects have been completed. The other three hours I am multi tasking, training, prepping training classes, up training, and a  floor walker. Although my title reads Pharmacy Technician, I am also a Subject Matter Expert, apart of leadership as both a SME and Quality Control. My co-workers are the best because when they see I am tired just the praise alone boost my energy up to continue on. We have an A-1 management team from my Site Manager who is hands on all the way down to our supervisors. The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of my job is one in the same which is Management putting me in the position to Coordinate projects, and assist with the trainings because putting all that trust in me is, and me being able to deliver builds my confidence. However when I am to be on duty as a floor walker I get pulled and my agents may not get the same treatment I provide them from the next floor walker. That's not to say I am better than anyone, but I just deliver in a different way."

good,I worked at Xerox when it was fun and innovative. Over the past several years the culture has changed. Independent thinking and contributions seems less recognized on all levels. The company needs stronger and compassionate leaders.
good,"Xerox was definetley a goo workplace overall but lacked in certain areas. Benifets were good. A typical day at work would go by fast because of the diffrent types of calls i was getting. Management was fine, The hardest part of the job was the advanced policies such as ""clean desk"" The most enjoyable part was the overtime we could do."
good,"first I would go to my work space and bring up all the system that i need to operate during phone calls with the customers, then i would log into my phone so that the system would know I'm logged into my phone so that I'm able to receive calls.i learned about health insurance and life insurance policies.I did open enrollment for doctors,nurses and house staff. i had really great hardworking and eager to learn co workers. we all worked together as a team.the hardest part of the job is making sure the customers understand their benefits a lot of the times they will try to rush you off the phone and don't read the benefits that was offered and they will call back upset because they didn't know certain details about the plan. the easiest part of the job was having a customer who wanted you to explain each plan the was presented ,choosing their plan and enrolling them . the most enjoyable part of my job was hearing the customers appreciate my hard work and them being satisfied with their choice and my service"

good,I cannont get into details about the workings of the company.
good,If there was more communication and structure in the organization the goals would be achieved. We are also lacking in a comprehensive benefits program and lack of 401k or other incentives. Bonuses are never awarded even though they are spelled out in the offer letter.
good,Quando trabalhei na empresa eu era representante. O salário dependia muito do meu desempenho. Quando a empresa fechou na minha região eles fizeram o acerto comigo de forma correta. Uma boa empresa. Voltaria a trabalhar lá tranquilamente na área que atendia.

good,During my time working for Xerox Canada I learned many valuable skills and gained incredible experience.  I am very grateful for the training and certifications Xerox provided.
good,"Xerox, like other copier manufacturers, is struggling with the transition of accounts to the channel partners.  I think the dust to settle now, and things are smoothing out."
good,Working at Xerox was a nice job for me because I was working with friends and my supervisor was very helpful if we needed anything. The only downside was that your job depended on if the customer liked you or not and what kind of score they'd give you in their surveys. I learned very fast that some people were just mean for no reason lol but other than that it was great training ground and ork place experience for me to use later in life.
good,"Buena, empresa de servicios, tecnológica, impresión de documentación"

good,This is the ideal place for any professional looking to get into sales. This training was second to none. Your in the ring of pure B2B sales environment. What I was able to learn there allowed me to grow dramatically in my sales career.
good,"Enjoyed over 6 years at Xerox, but the business is being badly managed now and the staff and customers will see a negative effect. I had two great clients who were open to innovation and we all achieved a great deal."
good,"This was a great company to work with. I enjoyed my team, Team lead and management was also great. the most difficult were the calls at time but once I gained the knowledge of the job assisting each parent became easier every day."

good,was an employee for 22 years. I have a varied and extensive experience in many copy center situations. have done and been in many types of copy centers.  the Xerox experience overall was positive
good,Great company. I started in 1978 on assembly lines and was able to work my way up to an advanced financial position. Xerox paid for my education and provided advancement opportunities.
good,"Xerox gave me an amazing opportunity to grow my business skills."
good,"Take every task serious and follow all directions. Fill in the blanks in your own, just keep the client and Xerox cash flow in mind. The ability to be flexible is a major plus. Be on time and teach others you'll get recognized. Management that didn't as phone agents are the worst. Xerox is just a good paying option until their goal job calls."
good,A typical day at Xerox was exciting. Everyday I started my ay a  different client's location. Customer satisfaction was my number one priority. I learned how is it was to put a smile on my clients face.  The fact that you had a deep understanding of the clients needs and wants and is able to deliver the product honestly increased customer trust and satisfaction. Management was very hands off. I was empowered to sell suites of products within the confines of Xerox's policies and procedures. The hardest part of the job was terminating staff and losing a client to an other vendor. The most enjoyable part of the job was being empowered. At times you almost felt that everyone in the company supported and encouraged everyone's success - Teamwork!
good,"Typical day was busy and the dress code was dress down. I enjoyed my time working at Xerox, but company went through a restructure in the beginning of 2017 and split into two companies and our site was close"
good,interesting/exciting workdays which always provides an opportunity to troubleshoot and solve major technical problems. The high level management was really professional and appreciable but lower Management was less fitting for the job. hardest aspect was having to deal with long journeys and bad roads however the job execution and completion makes all these challenges shortlived.
good,"Uma empresa nota 10. Benefícios bons, salários sem em dia."
good,Great union. Good place to work. Great pay and benefits for full time employees in union. Not easy to move into management. Three shifts to choose from.
good,"I definitely don't regret it and would love a second chance at that call center, honestly it made waking up easy for me. They even gave several breaks and host free events and chances at bonuses. It really had a great diverse community"
good,"When I began, I would say I love this place.  Of course that changed further into my temporary employment. They offered me a full time job based on production rates, less that what I was making and driving 25 miles."
good,"Great work environment, capable of growth throughout the company, flexible family life but upper management makes decisions that affects the employee negatively, there's no reason for the decision. Layoffs occur yearly, sometimes twice a year to make it seem that the company is doing well. Not sure if the company will last much longer."
good,"Loved Xerox, the management was HORRIBLE. Would go back in a heartbeat if the management would change. This was a wonderful company to work with before they changed management."
good,Call center environment. I learned about health care benefit enrollment. The hardest part of the job was not knowing when they were laying employees off.
good,It was a great experience at the beginning but you know thats new job jitters . Very professional place quiet  and very busy especially  during open enrollment.
good,"Xerox is a good company. A typical work day involved troubleshooting customers issues and handling RMA requests. Cases were required to be created and product upselling is apart of job culture."
good,Gran experiencia como crecimiento profesional y personal.
good,As an employee at Xerox the  experience I received were very helpful and knowledgeable. I have experience in regulations and safety rules. And also I learned federal and state guidelines. The management is very good in just being there to help you out with issues as needed.
good,"I start off my day driving to my first call, arriving at 8 A.M. Having called the customer the day prior they greet me and explain what problem they are having with the machine. I then begin to troubleshoot the problem narrowing it down to a specific cause. Repairs are made or parts ordered and the customer updated on the status of their Xerox machine. I then call my next customer, give an ETA and drive to that account. If our calls are slow I send unused parts back to the warehouse. I couldn't ask for a better supervisor and the people I work with work well together. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family during the week. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the machine fixed for the customer."
good,"I liked working for Xerox very much. "
good,I liked wor4king there I worked for sprint taken payments and handling any issues the management was good and there were a variety of different cultures the hardest is part was the shift bi9ds the enjoyable part was being able t6o help nmy6n customer
good,"sometimes while doing development work our PMO will come and he will add more changes to that work and that we need to finish in the same timeline "
good,They hardest part would be when you would get an upset member and they wanted help yesterday. I enjoyed working with the people that worked with me they helped when you got a bad call. I would go in and take calls send out road side to members in need.
good,"Easy, loved working multiple printers, pay was good, independence, long term, proper training needed is provided, hands on, understanding management team."
good,The management here was very unprofessional and somewhat immature...you could move up pretty quickly and pay was pretty good considering some sections were contracted by the government.
good,Xerox is a great place to work if you are a people person. you come im contact with people all around the world who are calling about the same information or type of problem. The pay is good you can always earn more at Xerox. The hardest part was handling  new situations on the calls.
good,"Xerox is an excellent company to work for, they have a strong family culture and are very flexible with working from home.  Only drawback is they are in a mature industry that is shrinking and is causing them to run leaner."
good,"Was not much opportunity to expand my skills at Xerox or move up in the company as the availability was just not there."
good,"Great experiences driving trucking which i didn't believe i could do it. After learning how to drive a fork lift i really enjoyed it. I was good at what i learn to do and it will always be uplifting to thank about my journey at this company. My day would start of by clocking into the job, getting my scanner, scanning the bar code to see which way my orders would be dropping. If each area had orders i would start with the area with the most orders and end with the area with the least order. Once i finish picking the order in each area i would deliver them to which i would process them and put them on the converter so that the customer would get their order an a timely manner.."
good,The management was horrible. Very rude. The hardest part of the job was the constant incoming calls. I learned a lot of patience while I was there for the simple fact that I had to be the one to calm down the angry or upset callers.
good,Not bad for a call center. I just moved on from it because a call center isnt really my cup of tea. very fantastic workplace and intriguing people.
good,I loved the benefits and the people I worked with. We were provided with many lunches if we worked threw our lunch. Also we received 3 paid hours for every 80 hours worked.

good,I am enjoying the days of work in this office. I learnt a lot of things mainly leadership. Mangagement wast very good motivating me to grow in work field. Co-workers are very friendly and helping me to maintain the team without any issue.
good,It was ok to work there it has a high turn over rate I think that is because the location is so far away. there are a lot of young people that work there but it isn't hard to move up quickly in the company. If you come to work on time and do your job within months If you desire to move up to a different position you will or they will come after you and strongly suggest that you move up to a better position.
good,"The hours I worked  didn't interfere with my family life and I truly enjoyed the people I worked with. The office environment was pleasant and cordial."
good,"It was a perfect experience for a young professional. It was all good.  Sell smart copy/multifuncional to a big companies using technical knowledge, I could use what I have studied a universit to really work, to prove that I was capable to perform a good job."
good,"Realizei a tarefa de líder de produção, em constantes reuniões com clientes e administradores de sites. Estava sempre disposto à atender e ver a satisfação do cliente. Mas, mesmo com o cargo de liderança de equipe, não recebi promoção financeira e isso me motivou a desligar-me da empresa."

good,A typical day in the company always is always centered around our customer. Whatever position u hold the customer is the main focus.
good,"My day starts promptly at 8:00. I do my morning walk thru to check the mdf and 3 idf's that covers 2 floors with 5 different departments until 8:45. At 9:00 I start reading through 56 new e-mails. That’s not counting ticket updates that need attention or all of the group e-mails - counting those brings the total to over 200 unread messages in your inbox.  I along with 2 other analyst sit in on the daily 9:30 conference call with about 15 team members from other states.The meeting lasts about 45 minutes. I then go out the floor and tackle various job tickets from audio issues, password changes in active directory, folder redirection issues, printing issues, and citrix issues. The hardest and most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with different personalities. I've always been a people person."
good,"a typical day at work started with commuting to work by bus, due to the price of parking in downtown Rochester.  I was responsible for processing checks to be mailed throughout the country where Xerox machines were considered property taxable.  I would also open, sort and distribute incoming tax forms from companies throughout the country.  I could spend an entire day just filing forms, but I enjoyed this task as it meant other coworkers could spend their time doing more important jobs, after all, I was the temp.  I found the hardest part of my job was trying to understand how to do excel spreadsheets that were set up by a coworker who did not communicate well.  I finally asked her to write down instructions for me, which helped.  The problem ended up being that their were many exceptions to the formulas and unless I had been employed through many tax seasons, it was not an easy process.  I really enjoyed the teamwork when deadlines needed to be met, which might mean working late into the night to get the returns done.  My Manager was the best.  She would be right there working with the employees to help get deadlines met.  She also was patient when I asked questions and she helped me to understand."

My co-workers were awesome to work with, although I worked from home, we had great connections.  My managers were great.  The hardest part of the job, Xerox was going through so much financial turmoil, they would role out several programs to correct the issues... customers were not impressed. Unfortunately, these programs didn't work, and downsizing was the answer.  I did enjoy working for a large corporation, meeting goals, understanding the benefits of processes as guidelines,"
good,"Amazing co workers, great atmosphere, fast pace, learn in 6 weeks training and you get hands on experience over phone. hardest part is if your not a fast typer, then you either become one at this job or quit.  i like helping others over the phone or off the phone."

good,"O dia a dia, é sempre com muito volume de trabalho diversificados. Há muito o que se aprender nesta área de marketing, por ter diversidade de atividade, dinamismo com colegas e confiança no potencial do funcionário contratado. O aprendizado é muito grande, pois se passa por diversas situações e os eventos são constantes. Os colegas de trabalho são unidos e estão dispostos a ajudar quando preciso. A parte mais difícil do trabalho, seria o volume de afazeres em épocas de evento e conciliar isto com os estudos.

good,"In deze jaren de ruimte gekregen om mij te ontwikkelen en door te groeien."

good,"Working at Xerox (now Conduent) is a very refreshing yet challenging experience.  A typical day at work was comprised of receiving in bound calls from Medicaid recipients and providers.  We assisted them with all claims and benefits issues.  Working with Xerox has taught me the importance of performing as part of a team that is set on reaching the same goal as a group.  The workplace culture can be a bit relaxed at times and management is not always hovering over your shoulder.  They give you your job and expect you to do it and if you need assistance they are there to help.  If I had to say there was a ""hard"" part to this job it would be having to stay professional in the very stressful situations you may come into when dealing with people and health insurance.  However, the most enjoyable part is handling those same situations to the satisfaction of the customer and feeling their stress level drop off with the feeling of having their issue handled."

Management also take part in these for encouraging them.This keeps the free mind towards the management int he minds of employees and it will positively effect the productive spirit of the employees.
good,"Xerox is a great company to work for, great overtime hours and opportunity for growth. Theyre training in customer service is far beyond proficiency, in my opinion."
good,I worked for General Physics and switched to Xerox 8 years in because of a contract with Eli Lilly. General Physics was amazing and i truly enjoyed every part of my job. Then Xerox came into the picture was very hard because they where learning the systems and promising a lot at the time. Talking to friends things are better and managers are no longer there.

The leaders are understanding and help the best they can. The head of the team was a little hard to work with since he wasn't too knowledgeable in the information we needed to know. But outside of that he did a good job managing and taking care of scheduling.

Once everything is up and running, I would open all the programs needed for the day and when it was my time to start working, I would turn my phone on and begin to answer phone calls. My co-workers were wonderful, and the management wasn't too bad. We all worked together as a team to try and exceed the requirements asked of us.

We were taught everything about how to fix people's Verizon phones, and if they needed a replacement or not. The reason I left is because I had tons of anxiety, and stress due to the phone calls coming in. Customers were rude, angry, and most of the time were lying about things that they had used on their phones. They would be charged for data overages, and they would say that there phone had not even been on. So we would tell them ways to reduce data usage, but the charges would still have to be payed. Yeah that made a lot of people IRATE. I couldn't do that anymore. I didn't want the people to think I didn't care, but at the same time I couldn't do what they wanted from me. I want to help people, and I wasn't making much progress at Xerox."

I learned how to use new software tools and trained users on how to used those tools.  Management was excellent and provided support to advance my career.  My previous employer provided a positive workplace culture that lead to better employees, increased productivity and provided an excellent  work/family environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all levels of management and knowing that my role played an integral part in making the company profitable.  The most challenging part (occasionally) of my job was working to complete tasks when other departments were running late completing other tasks that had to be completed before I could complete my tasks.  Knowing that this would sometimes occur, I proactively completed many of my tasks ahead of scheduled."
good,"Xerox is well known and highly respected.  Excellent employment opportunities, especially, if you're interested in living within the NE part of USA.  Great benefits."

good,I have worked for Xerox for over 8 years and have seen a lot of changes.  Some are for the better and some are not.  Xerox cross-trains all employees in case someone is absent.  Sometimes they are short staffed and one person maybe doing at least 3 people job at the same time.  This can be very overwhelming. I enjoy the teamwork environment.
good,It's been a pleasure being a Technical Chat Advisor. I learned a lot from every person that I've been with. Going to work everyday makes me excited than what I was expecting at the first day.

good,I would recommend this job to anyone who likes an easy going workplace. For the most part I liked this job. but management was horrible. Management was too close with employees causing them to pick favorites and treat certain people better than others.

good,"Best job I've had in 30 years. Good working conditions, good people to work with. The job itself was very easy. Monitoring network copiers and printers. The machines create their own service calls."
good,Each day you had your number of clients that you were solely responsible. Clients that were from the investments portfolio to the healthcare. Each had a different contract structure with different goals and timelines.
good,Management was not always professional. Pay differed very much. Pay depended on how much calls you received in a day. Very busy during the first two weeks of every month. Mandatory Overtime 10 hour shifts.

good,"Todos os dias, algo diferente para fazer surgia. O trabalho raramente caía na mesmice e quando acontecia, os gerentes, junto ao estagiário, encontravam uma forma de mudar. Trabalhar com benchmarking, pesquisa de market share, tradução de documentos, participação na criação de e-mail marketing, produção de relatórios semanais e gestão de estoque, me proporcionou uma bagagem profissional que talvez não conseguisse em outra empresa. Fui estagiário de três gerentes e nunca fiquei sobrecarregado - atendi às demandas dos três sempre nos prazos estabelecidos. Se havia um grande trabalho, reestabelecia o prazo junto ao gerente pedinte. As pessoas eram amigáveis e receptivas. Fiz amigos lá. A parte mais difícil era a incerteza de efetivação. A parte mais agradável era o clima de trabalho."
good,"Era un trabajo bastante cómodo en un ambiente amigable, y a la ves divertido. Buen el trato con las demás personas mucho compañerismo."

good,"Would have loved to have stayed with Rank Xerox but marriage and family took precedence.  A great organisation to work for, management and all employees were supportive and a pleasure to work with. The days were quite long and could be challenging but the as a company most staff worked hard and then played hard.  It is a shame that restructuring closed so many of their satellite offices as I would now like to try again for a position but there are no sites near where I live."

Flexibility was the most enjoyable part of the job since I was able to work from home."
good,"Great company back in it's time, wish I never had to leave but to advance at a rate that was acceptable, I had to move on. Every day was a new exciting challenge. We focused on People, Profit and Customer which is still the best approach to business success"

I went to work for customer service for 6 months to an opening came open in data entry. applied, but never got an call for interview, gave my two week notice and left."
good,"I worked as a customer service representative for Acs , then bought out by Xerox.  Training was terrible. We basically read some papers for a week or two then we were thrown on the floor. Management is terrible. I watched this place go from ok to a place of employment that was struggling due to poor management  all within in a years time I was there. The job itself was ok. They continued to change policies and pay which became frustrating. I had several co workers quit and later come back due to the viscious cycle of employment available in the area. If you can tolerate angry management always on you then good luck to you. I sat there ignored what was happening,  concentrated on my job and made the best money I could. Disbursement was fun at times. You are sometimes scheduled odd hours, but if your talk time is in line with everything you can make anywhere from $10.52 - $22.00 an hour. Quality also has to be great. In training you are paid $10.00 phr ,then it it will drop after training to $8.00. Then your ABC pay begins."
good,"In the scale from 1 to 10, I definitely say 9. It is really a good opportunity to develop your skills in technology, they always are willing to help you and providing online trainings.,"

My co-workers were very friendly and the management was very good at making sure I was doing my job to their standards and to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of my job was being on the phones; whereas, the hardest part of my job was overcoming objectives over the phone. I did learn a lot and it's a skill I'm willing to perfect."
good,One of the best companies to work with. They sell franchise to dealers and thing change dramatically. Is hard to work with starting managements ego. I love sale.
good,You never know what each day will bring. It may be extremely busy or it could me more even keeled.  Their training programs are excellent.

I loved working with the participants every day and helping them in any way I could.

Updated our dashboard with current production data to be used for billing purposes. To ensure all secure practices were adhered to.  I have learned how to become a better lead person. To be able to listen and resolve any problems or conflicts that may arise. I worked with a lot of diverse people.

good,Handle escalated issues. Provide customer service and assisting pharmacies with prescription benefits for Aetna Insurance. I learned how to handle escalated problems that may occur. Work in a call center environment. The hardest part of the job is not being able to resolve an issue within the same call. Co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job because there are so many personalities that are around you. And speaking with customers from around the world.
good,"Working for Xerox Call Center has been a great experience. We work for Verizon Wireless answering calls for our customers, We assist customers with their bills, questions about their account, devices."
good,"This job required confidentiality and special attention to the medical forms we would copy or scan for the company. I only had 2 co-workers but were very friend and helpful. There was never a hard part of this job, the work was repetative and very minimal supervision. Loved working for this company.

good,"I worked at Xerox for a little over two years, 3 months on the phones answering calls, two months as assistant supervisor and the remaining time as supervisor. On the phones it was sometimes hard to find the assistance that was needed and leadership seemed lacking; I did step up to the plate, however, and worked as hard as I could and it was a quick process to being recognized and promoted. As part of the leadership team I made it my goal to ensure employees got all the assistance and attention they deserved. Every business unit within Xerox is different and will all have their pros and cons (as well as some taking a short time for promotion and some being a very long process). There was many times that the rules were not clear, consistent or enforced or new procedures were set in-place that weren't communicated across the entire call floor. "

good,"Great place to work, good environment and group of people to work with."
good,"Great work environment, only draw back is most units are contract based. If the contract doesn't get renewed it means the end of the unit.

I would get calls regarding issues related to the parking system (hardware and software) then will try to resolve them in a timely manner to minimize impact on customers. I also do daily equipment maintenance of all parking equipment. My managers were very friendly and supportive of the daily operation. The hardest part of the job is working outside in the rain and wind when trying to fix system equipment alone."
good,Il est agréable de travailler au sein de ce groupe qui sait être très professionnel.
good,"algehele waardiring is positief. "
good,Xerox was a good and fun place to work. I loved working here but my son was having health issue and I really needed to be by his side.
good,"I do my daily QA. Upload CD's and Large Files as needed. I answer any questions that anyone may have that I can answer. If not I find out the answer. I sort the emails and faxes as needed."
good,"Although the pay was lower than what I was originally used to, the management, the amazingly fun, energetic and positive work environment with absolutely no drama was so refreshing and had I not moved out of state and cross-country I would've stayed at that job and most likely still be working there."
good,"Working at Xerox was a great experience, from the very beginning until the end of my employment they were always hands on, very respectful, willing to train, and ready to help. I enjoyed talking to the customers on the phone, it felt good to know you could make someone's day by simply fixing a billing error. The supervisors and the coworkers were always friendly, I never felt out of place. The hardest part about Xerox was maintaining the certain criteria that we were assigned, especially getting 10's on our surveys, because even if I liquidated all the options that I had to help the customer I could still receive a 0 if the customer was not pleased. Overall I loved working there and would go back in a heart beat."
good,"Monitorando a produção em vídeo supervisório,aprendi a ser dinâmico e pontual com as soluções de problemas técnicos,gerencia sempre participativa e de portas aberta para o chão de fabrica."

good,"A empresa Xerox é uma empresa ótima para se trabalhar. Com um ambiente de trabalho leve e descontraído para que os funcionários se sintam mais a vontade, com Gerentes sempre presentes e dispostos a aceitar opiniões e a tirar duvidas. A unica coisa com a qual não gosto muito é a constante mudança do sistema de trabalho."
good,"A typical day of receiving calls from customers about billing, technical support, and trade in submissions."
good,"A typical day at work was to be in the office early to open programs to be able to clock in and start taking calls during the start of shift. When taking calls I was either performing technical duties such as troubleshooting different apple devices like iphones, ipads, ipods and cpu. Also taking inbound calls for iTunes accounts and billing mostly refunding customers for accidental purchases. I learned a lot about the apple world and their devices. Management was great The hardest part of the job was being early to start the day on time due to the long drive. The most enjoyable part of the day was hearing the satisfaction in the customers voices after being assisted and getting great reviews."
good,"Internal management and even client management were good at communicating needs. Being the only on-site desktop support, I handled a mass variety of tasks that involved 200+ employees being able to do their day by day jobs.

I prefer customer service over the phone and feel that I can give satisfactory service better that way. I enjoyed getting an all green card emailed to me everyday for getting a 90% or above in all ares of my position (schedule adherence, Q.A, etc.). A typical day at work involved helping customers receive their benefits and what exactly they needed to submit in order to get these benefits.

There wasn't a lot of interaction with co-workers but the few that I spoke with were very interesting to have a conversation with.

Each one aimed at pursuing the client to order Xerox equipment for its premises while the buyer had to import the goods himself since Xerox was not LLC but Rep office based. The job was interesting due to hard market acknowledgement and getting to know key players. On the other side, very challenging, as it asked for sale of expensive (versus Canon as e.g.) equipment. It took lot of personal skills to make positive results."

ACS Enterprises, a Xerox owned company, started a new division in 2013 called EES, where research on homesteads were performed to ensure that they were legally eligible for the exemption, if not, then we would provide a report of reliable detailed information from the research we gathered if the exemption appeared to be ineligible, we would then hand it back to the appropriate county. Everyone worked independently and as a team including management. Weekly team meetings were held to review our productivity and  discussed how the division was doing. If any changes needed to be made, we all pulled together, team members and management, and made them. I can honestly say it was a very positive workplace environment where management treated everyone and their ideas equally important. The hardest part of working for Xerox/ACS Enterprises was leaving there due to the elimination of our department."

We dealt with customers who were in very stressful situations which required an extensive amount of patience and problem solving skills. As a supervisor I worked very closely with my managers and I must say that they were the most supportive group of people I've dealt with within my last 5 years of my career. One of the most challenging parts of my job was to help deescalate some of our irate customers who were either traveling because of death in the family or business critical situations. Typically these customers are verbally aggressive and at times it can be very overwhelming to a representative, especially when having to speak to irate customers on a daily basis. The rewarding part of this project is that there is a sense of accomplishment when you've been able to assist your team with ways to rescue a customer and get them back on the road to their destination efficiently while maintain their professionalism. The overall professional and personal development of the agents was the highlight of my days."

Management left employees alone - as long as the job got accomplished ahead of schedule and correctly. That was the best part of the job - the level of empowerment and freedom.
