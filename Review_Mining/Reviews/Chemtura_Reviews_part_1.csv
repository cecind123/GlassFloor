bad,"Not a very good place to work. Hr controls the whole plant, can't trust anyone , they will stab you in the back in a heart beat."
bad,OK place but they are not too quick to hire competent people. management is reluctant to make important decisions
bad,"Typical day is composed of managing priorities for the 3-4 positions you are expected to cover.  Had the opportunity to deal directly with Fortune 500 customers. "
bad,Chemtua has given the opportunity to do multitasking. I am presently in to the leadership team. This company was not known in South Asia in specific seed treatment and after my joining created awareness among the seed industry
bad,"This is a great place to work especially if you need flexible working hours . I am able to work this job while attending college and working two additional jobs ! I get paid here every week direct deposit which is a plus! The work load is light compared to most places, and you always have the ability to change anything you do t like ( location, time, days of the week) I also love that you can pick up and deny shifts at your leisure. Just woke up and have nothing to do for the rest of the day? Call and pick up a shift! Need extra money for something that came up? CALL AND PICK UP A SHIFT! Literally that simple! You get paid weekly so you see what your making right when you need it !"
bad,Morning starts with a safety meeting.  Next a Near Miss review meeting. Then to a production meeting. Chemtura has a lot of good safety programs in place.  Hard to stay on top of production with all of the meetings during the day.
good,"Smaller company, but good employees.  Just not much room for career advancement"
good,I had the best supervisor that was extremely supportive and provided any training and outside resources when needed.  Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.
good,"Was a good place to work before they lost there patent.  Money was good, no life outside of work. Plant is now closing."

good,"Served as primary interface between IT and Customers (Internal employees). Provided necessary support and"
good,Hardest part of the job is having everyone on the same page and understanding.
good,I enjoy the work greatly. You learn a lot and have opportunities to grow there.
good,"En el periodo que yo estuve, fue una gran experiencia fue mi primer contacto con mi ejercicio laboral, aprendi mucho de lo que ya conocia en teoria; su gente muy colaborativa y siempre un buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Full disclosure, they are outsourcing our whole department. Though there were some awesome people it seems that this department was plagued by years of bad leadership and bad decisions. Not everyone was was treated equally or held to the same expectations. I for one am glad to be finding an opportunity elsewhere."
good,"good work environment, project deadlines were a challenge, and I enjoyed learning something new."
good,"My job was outsourced South America.  If not I would have been happy to remain with this company!!"
good,good place to work flexible with your time the people are great to work with the good culture. would recommend to others to work. I have no complaints
good,The people and the management are great. I liked working there its just you had to be cautious because the chemicals we worked with contained acid.
good,"Atypical day at work is having a sting in the nose from the smell even with a face mask on. I learned that if it affects your health, pay the signs attention. The staff worked in a very professional manner at all times. The hardest part of the job was knowing I had to go back to plant #4 and twist,twist,twist, bottle caps even though I had blisters from the day before, just take a deep breath and get on with it. I must say the most enjoyable part of it was when the biscuit man came in with breakfast even though I would've eaten before work, I knew I could make the rest of the day as long as I could get a hot biscuit that seemed to cover the fumes connected on my stomach linning."
good,"As the Process Excellence Leader I helped install Lean Six Sigma at this site.  My work day consisted of either Kaizen events, Six Sigma project support and leadership, or installing Lean tools.  Management was very supportive and the rural culture was friendly.  My coworkers had to be sold on Lean Six Sigma but they worked hard at it.  The challenge was the initial culture change but it was enjoyable to work with people who considered the change.  The salary was fine.  My only reason for leaving was corporate bankruptcy and management change which jettisoned Lean Six Sigma.  It was truly a great work environment but be prepared for a rural lifestyle.  The promotions were limited on site and would require relocation.  I also cannot recommend the new management."
good,The work is enjoyable bur the nepotism and favoritism deject the  work environment and increase stress which affect work nature
good,"My work day starts at 5:00 am.  I start my shift with a Safety Briefing and then discuss production schedule for the day. I receive feedback from operators on production schedule and on any constraints not completed from previous day.  This usually last 15 min.  The operators and line employees record production numbers hourly and give down time reasons if production falls below hourly goal.  This gives the Supervisor, Maintenance, Quality Control, Engineering and Plant Manager the opportunity to help resolve production line issues timely.  The culture at Chemtura is collaborative.  The philosophy of management is to support the hourly employees on the production lines.  The hardest part of the job is getting familiar with the smell of the chemicals that are being packaged. The most enjoyable part of the job is the support that each group gives to each other."
