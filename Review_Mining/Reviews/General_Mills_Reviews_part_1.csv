bad,crescimento profissional mas deixa a desejar em boa parte
bad,Sucks they need to pay more for the job that u do working in that environment...they do not try to move you up wven if u use to work there and u know what you are doing they have favs
bad,"verificar la asistencia del personal, dar brakes de lunch, saber cubrir todas las posiciones"
bad,You get one day off a week as long as you aren't drafted. Other employees are always against you. You will be very lucky to be able to use your vacation days when you want and pretty much when you can't take anymore the plant shuts down for a week or two and you don't get paid.
bad,Absolutely no opportunity for growth unless you're an MEA that the company has already spent entirely too much money on right out the gate. Reverse discrimination is prevalent with this company. Rules are bent for minorities while others have to jump through hoops and still not achieve the simplest of goals. Corporate makes all the decisions & knows nothing about the plants.
bad,"Working either 36 or 46 days in a row with 2 days off. Child management, such a disappointing set of benefits. Short term disability is basically non existent, better pray you don't have to be off work for a surgery or something. Personal days have to be scheduled and then they just took one away. No work life balance at all. You are just a body."
bad,*uck general mills. Honestly just a horrible place and they pay shi*ty. But I mean go work there if you liked getting fuc*ed In the a$* by both your managers at the same time.
bad,"Disgusting... and leadership and bosses a lot of confusions............... Good luck."
bad,"If you go through the temp agency General Mills uses, expect LOW PAY  and NO CHANCE for advancement! It is very difficult (if not impossible) to get on full time. They make it much harder than it should be. If by some  miracle you do get hired, you are only a ""seasonal employee"".  Long hours, usually working 6-7 days a week.  The least minor infraction can get you fired suddenly and without notice!  As far as the pay, temps now make more that they did a few years ago, however it is still not enough to live on. Management (both General Mills and temp agency) are indifferent to employee concerns and if an issue is brought up it is immediately dismissed. If you afford to wait and take another job, you would be much better off in the long run."
bad,"The people were ignorant, gossiping, not qualified to run company, cheating liars and rotten to no end.It was JUST a company losing any  possibility for growth or respect from the employees running it."
bad,All management do is stress you about numbers when half the stuff is in the wrong place and you always have to call and ask someone to bring you the right product to ship out one of the employee at the job wasn't paying attention and was under the influence and sit a clamp on my foot I lost my toe nail....
bad,"Not women friendly, especially on the production floor. Very physical, loud, hot, wet and sometimes cold. They will dangle the proverbial carrot in front of you for years just to get a raise. Management requires a manifesto of your performance to prove your worthy of more money. An anonymous group, that doesn't know your real work performance decides whether you are worthy or not. If you don't get a raise, they deliver an anonymous letter with the sometimes bogus reason why you didn't get it. There were some good people there but a lot of backstabbing and 8th grade politics abound. The temps were treated poorly. Read some of the other reviews. Many of these reviews across different plants sounds hauntingly similar. Buyer beware! I think I'd rather work in a sewer plant!"
bad,Everything was going ok at general mills until I came out about being transgender. Then everyone tried to do everything they could to get me in trouble. Reporting things that didn't even happen just to get me in trouble. Horrible management
bad,I have nothing good to say about this employer.  I trained for a long period of time but never got paid for it..  They don't care about the employees at all.
bad,"Doesn’t hire you on, 12 hours consistent work.. favoritism, they want you to train new employees but you don’t get paid for it. They want you to stay over until the next team comes in to relieve you, and you don’t get paid for that either."
bad,My work experience at this company was great if I still was living in this area I would still be there. The work environment was great the people I worked with was great I wouldn't change anything about this job
bad,they work you alot of overtime without notice you have to dont get any free time to do anything and dont have alot of breaks i wouldnt work there again
bad,"The food waste was unbelievable, and the working conditions were inhumane. I was worked like a dog and treated even worse. I will never ever ever go back."
bad,"The job itself is very overwhelming!! Horrible work place very hard on the workers, no good benefits, quick to fire , don’t eeally care for the people that’s working for them!"
bad,General Mills had one to many problems going at that company. Almost every other week there was an new person filling in the supervisor position. The company didn't pay well.
bad,"The company does not care about safety,they had 3 forklift accidents because of quotas too high,everybody in fear for their job to the point people are unsafe on forklifts."
bad,I worked for them 21 years they fired Me for paperwork and the union didn't do anything.  I  had perfect attendance plus I'm a vet. No warning just get out.
bad,"don't hire temps full time , no room for advancment  and make you work on your days off  an you can only work for through the temp 1 year and then they move you to another job."
bad,This job was only a temp job. It was very hot and sticky mess. Pay was only minimum wage. Break times where okay. Everyone else that had worked there for a long time was very rude.
bad,The hours are way too long. The breaks are too short. Treated like slaves. Demands over time on off days. Does not pay well at all and will send you to another job within 1 year.
bad,"General Mills has been the worst job I have ever had in my life poor management, poor resources HR is cutthroat they're out there for the company not for the worker. There pay system is a joke. Do not apply at the Albuquerque plant this place is bad news."
bad,when working here the management like supervisors are on you the time you come in and where every you work at you have to stay working there until the shift if over. Its really a easy job just have to keep to yourself and don't let any drama make you lose your job.
bad,Empresa consolidada e com projetos dinâmicos e estratégicos.
bad,"long hours, seven days with little to no time off. very strict not very flexible. I do not recommend working here if you have a family. Or have other things you find important."
bad,"Typical work day is very busy.  I have learned to load and unload trucks, railcars and run machinery. Management is understanding. CO-Workers are easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is working 7 days per week, no days off. The most enjoyable part of the job is running the machinery and operating the forklift."
bad,productive work place we always get lots of overtime. I really learned a lot working at general mills. There are some supervisors that don't treat everybody equal
bad,they work 7 days a week 12-16 hours a day. the employees are not respected at all. Everyone is dispensable. They push you to your limit and as a result they have a very high number of safety issues. However the pay is excellent for the area.
bad,Great Place to work. Ability to think outside the box. Excelent flex schedule. Great benefits. Travel away from home. This is hardest part of job.
bad,Worked too much and got payed too little. Did not like the work or the environment.
bad,my spanish was not good enough for this job. most managment spoke spanish. Since i couldn't understand they treated me bad. in fact they sent me home without pay when i was working so hard.
bad,"before they relocated it was a good job, dealing with different people"
bad,Although General Mills has good products they are one of the worst companies to work for. The people there are simply out for themselves and advancement is never in the cards unless you are a minority - instead of utilizing talent that is worthy they place people because of color - reverse discrimination.
bad,The company will probably be shut down or sold within the next couple of years. They cannot keep any employees especially good ones because they are a horrid company who does not take care of the employees
bad,"This isn't a bad place to work if you're just looking for a paycheck between parties, but there is seriously little to no room for advancement and no opportunity provided to prove yourself and learn more. I practically *begged* to be trained in the SAP warehouse software, especially after practically living in Manhattan WMS at my previous gig, but nobody at General Mills ever bothered to even look at my resumé to see what I had been doing at other jobs. "
bad,"A typical day is very stressful because there is no work/life balance.Managers work Monday through Friday, 7am-4:30pm and have every single weekend off, but anyone who is not a manager, works 6am - 6pm or 6pm - 6am  with rotating days off.  One week a non manager will work in the am and the next week work during the pm. Because of this there is no feeling of comradery or joy at work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers after one of their many meetings.  The easiest part of the job is clocking out after another long, uninspiring day at work."
bad,Since the new regime of management has taken over this place is not good to work for or recommend anybody else to work there the culture has gone down in the last 12 years that I have been there plus the benefit has been reduced workload has increased plus pay scale has been frozen
bad,rude co workers disrespectful dishonest racist no communication bad environment people over you have free will do what they want when they wanted to just overall not good
bad,Cases are the most important thing to them. Management don't know how to do the job of the people they manage. Favoritism is everywhere and very unfair. Plan to have no life if you work here I worked 6 days a week for over 3 years straight.  The place is very dirty for a food  manufacturing co. There is no hope for advancement...dont ever get hurt or you will be fired!
bad,General Mills isn't a good job period they have you show up at six in the morning for nothing because they   leads pick the people they know already to work in send you home what a waste of time and gas..
bad,"I worked there for a couple months a lot things were dirty, it didn't feel like a clean surrounding. The breaks were too short I start off at 8.00 An hour ."
bad,"Empresa Internacional de grande porte, onde tive a oportunidade de conhecer pessoas bacanas, e o mais importante, que apesar do curto período empo, obtive muita experiencia."
bad,I had a supervisor break a piece off one of my machines and then write me up and supend me for three days. When I made a harassment claim through the union the company agreed to pay me for the three days I was suspended... And take thR suspension off my record.
bad,Too much politics. Managers talking bad things behind your back but say all the good things when you're in front of them. Seems everyone wanted to be in power.
bad,They bring in interns to be your boss. College kids that don’t know anything about manufacturing or about the people that work there. They stopped caring about the workers. And the union sucks and doesn’t do anything for you.
bad,They work you atleast 7 days a week. Mandatory to stay 12 hours. Union is horrible. Overall a poor place to work. No management and no respect for employees or family. Saftey is not even a priority. All the time I was there they preached saftey and production but never addressed saftey concerns and always pushed harder for production.
bad,"General Mills used to be a top place for marketers to work. Due to company struggles and massive layoffs, what remains is a culture of fear in a mature company in serious peril. Turnover within is the highest I've seen in any company. Marketers are extremely unhappy, not just a little discontented or worried. The negativity is warranted and really toxic to be around on a daily basis. The work environment has become hostile, especially toward people lower on the pecking order. GMI is no longer dedicated to training new employees but rather expects you to ""fast start"" and ""learn on the job"". If you are hired off-cycle to replace someone who quit, all the worse for you as there is no process at all for these ""external hires"" as they call them, which is a very illogical title that serves to brand these employees shamefully and never fully integrate them into the system. Managers are intolerant of mistakes, making it difficult/nearly impossible to overcome any negative first impressions. In fact, they do not onboard new marketers at all. There is a two-day training class managed by a central marketing center that you may or may not get in your first months on the job, and that is it. You are on your own to figure the rest out. Your manager will not help you and it is perceived as a sign of weakness to ask for help. Their own jobs are stretched too thin and they are drowning, so why would they bother offering you so much as a life boat.They are super disorganized and don't provide as much as a checklist or bare bones 30/60/90--you make it yourself or never get one. They fundamentally"
bad,Very poor management and a very poor union.  There are very poor relations between company and hourly employees.  The company is also struggling to keep up in the food market where younger people want to eat healthy.
bad,"Empresa bastante agradável,motivadora e incentivadora!"
bad,"From upper management to account team"
bad,"*Troubleshooting is something all positions are encouraged to do."
bad,"I have worked at General Mills for 5 years, and I've watched it deteriorate. From taking away benefits without knowledge, reducing bonuses and doing whatever they can to save a buck which includes automation without considering the workload of their operators. Product is more important to this company than their workers. From working 13 days straight to one day off, to working 27 days to 1 day off, to working 6 days and then 2 off, and working a traditional 5-2. They will test the waters to see which schedule provides them the best at reducing headcount and saving them money by taking away voluntary overtime. Managment has been shifted so many times, I have probably had more than 10 team leaders from my time there. So no one ever bothers to care about you, because they never stick around to get to know you. Do not work here unless you are bug on inconsistency and being lied to by managment on multiple occasions. I am glad I got out when I did."
bad,"I gotta admit, they seemed legit, at first. They offered a package which for the benefits seemed okay, but I did take a pay cut to be there. It was a unique place to work with very unusual ways to advance. The long hours, the wet envoirnment and the high decibel levels should be compensated for a little more accordingly. The shifts are 12 hours long with extensive foot travel up stairs, ladders,  and wet surfaces which include the perils of electricity, chemical exposure, and heat exhaustion. Any previous knowledge that you've come in with is quickly dismissed, such as a state issued journeyman card,  and decades of knowledge in mechanical applications. The micro management style of the plant gives you the knowledge that your being watched, and, that in turn nsures higher levels of morality.. The possibilities for advancement are dismal. "
bad,"No job security if union operated...you are only a number. General mills don't care about the families, community and employees they effected by closing their doors. All for money"
bad,"Management/Managers were poor. There was no direction in my on boarding. Told just show up to meetings and ""listen"". Was never set up for success. Was not aware of being hired during a restructure/reorganization. Got laid off 3 months later due to merging regions. They relocated me and left me high and dry. "
bad,Closed all plants that had unions.  Did not rehire those people that had a voice and wanted to make the company more productive or wanted to improve the horrible environment.  You will be okay if you don't have an opinion or want a life.
bad,General Mills was not the right work environment for me.  You work 10+ hour shifts. If you don’t volunteer for overtime you’ll eventually get screwed and have to work on your day off with no choice. Management is a joke. They do not know anything or how to run their machines or fix them. Constantly going in early for meetings or staying late after shift for meetings.  They constantly change your schedule. If you don’t like having a life besides working and sleeping then this is the place for you.
bad,"Worked at General Mills for 7 years. They preach how big they are on safety and how "" were one team that works together"" I can tell you that's far from true. You have hourly employees on the floor and salary as in management. Management dont like to be told how to do their job. If you raise concerns about safety concerns or improvements it's one ear out the other. If you push the agenda to try and make it to what they preach about daily on safety and keep mentioning those concerns they will look for ways to get you out the door. You have team leads and leads out there whom team leads are part of the salary family and instead of them leading by example and being out on the floor they are in their office 90% of the time, at least on 2nd shift and nights. Yet will be first to criticize you on your job performance when they have not a clue what is even going on or how hard alot of the jobs are since they decided to eliminate some adding more tasks to jobs in the areas. Leads job title is considered working leads as in they help out if needed but that never happens. They rather do nothing even if it means someone having to do extra work. Hourly has been working 13 days on and 1 day off for the last 2 years while management gets guaranteed weekends regardless. I've been gone from that place for 3 months now and my family has noticed I'm more happier then when I was working there. Since my departure 3 months ago they have fired 4 people and 2 quit just in the department I was in. The turn around is bad and main reason MANAGEMENT. I'd recommend looking for a differnt job atleast in"
bad,They run three different staffing agencies there and as a result if the staffing office you were hired through doesn’t address your problem no one will. They play favorites and can’t keep anyone because of it.
bad,I worked for General Mills for 36+ years. The factory changed a lot over the years not for the better. The management was never consistent and overall the morale of the work life balance was not where is should be in order to provide a modest income.
bad,Working at general Mills  can be overwhelming because of the shifts that they offer. Pay is good and benefits are great. Overall the attitudes are very poor and the turn over rates are very high due to the fact you are treated like a number not a human. They also change your work schedule whenever they feel necessary and you have no choice but to except your schedule.
bad,The general attitude of the workers at general mills is solemn and zombie like. The younger people coming in to take charge of the lines are the only chipper like people -- but that is because they are engineers coming in making a lot more than the people on the lines are. A lot of people feel like they are stuck here because they make so much already and can't afford to take a pay cut finding a job with a better environment elsewhere.
bad,The mill manager is unfair and disrespectful in his punishment. They let some sleep during working hours but  punish others for smaller infractions . Any time you are talked to its a coaching that goes into your file.  Union is terrible and sides with the company unless you are buddy buddy  with the union president that works there.  I would not wish my worst enemy to work under that management.  The employees are almost always  in a bad mood or engaging in some sort of gossip.  It's 7 days a week with no days off except holidays or during slow time.  The pros are pay and benefits.
bad,"Current employee"
bad,"This was the toughest work experience I ever had to deal with, very unwelcoming to experienced new hires.  Most people have been there their entire career and everyone tries to validate their position.  Take ideas as their own, do not give you accolades for accomplishments you have, etc."
bad,This job got paid every week I was able to pay bills in timely manner they are understanding and they give hours as well aoverttine they didn't complain at all
bad,"It was a great company to work with."
bad,The 12 on 2 off is crazy. Management is not on same schedule. They can FORCE U TO STAY. even after u punch out. To many temps. They make life very difficult. Schedule cleans require 8 people for 12 hours. Only 5 in cell forcing you to have 3 stay late and 3 come in early. Unless u r desperate and have no life. DO NOT DO IT.
bad,You will work your life away working there. No weekends off even after working there for 20 years you will not get a weekend off. Work 6 days a week day in day out putting up with poor communication and decision making by poorly trained management who just came from college with no experience in manufacturing and they won’t listen to your opinions.
bad,"Lots of forced overtime with little or no exceptions. Poor culture in the plants, but excellent culture and benefits if you work in upper management. I would not advise this job unless you are upper management, or want to work crazy forced hours and endure layoffs in slow periods."
bad,"Same job different day. Training was adequate, The culture was safety first.Tthe hardest part of the job was the long hours and double backing, But once you get use to it you're fine. A lot of great people everyone there becomes one great big family."
bad,"Typical day at work is 11/2 hours of driving"
bad,job was fast paced production line. Superivised 45 employees. Learned how bread products were made. Quality control. Inspection ready. AIB certified. Overall good benefits
bad,"Productive fun to work for, team work atmosphere. All co-workers were very helpful and willing to teach. Management was very explanatory on safety. The hardest part was working on old machinery and keeping it running smoothly. Most enjoyable of the job learning from every co-worker."
bad,"Forced overtime, intimidation,untrustworthy, backstabbing environment.Cynical, miserable, resentful staff, advancing themselves on the backs of others."
bad,"I learned how to date their product, the hardest part was trying to stock your boxes, trying to keep up with everyone else , everyone works at a very fast pace, the most enjoyable part was thee hours i was able to work , due to my schedule of trying to start school"
bad,"Classic example of a job that is totally alienating. Extremley slow paced, you will have to FIGHT yourself just to stay awake. 3 paid one hour breaks!"
bad,"Ok place to work, good environment but lacking in leadership, was Fired due to an accident on the interstate, called ahead of time and my Boss told me to park my car on the side of the road and start running to make it to work on time, enough said"
bad,general mills is a horrible place to work. I do not recommend anyone to work there at all. management was horrible and so were the coworkers. it really sucks.
bad,I went through a temp agency and found out I was literally getting paid HALF the amount of a employee who was hired on directly through the company same time as me for the same job! Also for temp the hours were horrible and inconsistent. I wanted a full time 40 plus hour job and was told that's what I was getting. Never Happened. My advice try to get hired directly through the company on this one.
bad,"Obtive grandes resultados dentro da empresa,trabalho bem feito,fui reconhecido."
bad,"good work/family balance"
bad,"•	Responsible for coordinating, scheduling, and making presentations that promote General Mills’ product line"
bad,"Follow up of all the correspondence of the Department."
bad,Left hand does not know what right hand is doing. The compensation and benefits we're good but not worth the micro-management.
bad,I feel like I did not make enough for what I did I ran the machine but got paid as a temporary I was hired on as a temporary crew member but ended up working and running the machine and a crew and was told I'd be hired on permanently and make more also they always had hour cuts and also they would keep us 12 hours at times just to finish back orders
bad,"Harassed by managers, no support from HR, always getting threatened you were going to lose your job and you are replaceable. Favored the lazy employees, no recognition for the hard workers that actually showed up for work. Line managers never would spend our reach money on us, company took away our sick hours and made us use our vacation as a replacement. Always changing our schedules, made us rotate, made us be responsible for everything in the plant, then when managers made a mistake they would blame it on employees. Had no work life balance."
bad,"After 2 weeks of working here, say goodbye to your social life! They’ll mandate you to work OT at least 12 hrs a day for several weeks straight!! It’s not worth it! Very stressful work environment. The other forklift operators treat newbies like trash, and aren’t willing to help."
bad,I was a temporary hire there for 4 months and didn't get hired on. They don't care about the employees and the supervisors would say that in front of us.
bad,"General labor is exactly what the job is. We are there to follow there orders of the white, black and green hat workers. This means they are hired by the company and you are to do what they ask and also keep up with shipping packages."
bad,"not as fun when i first started, they will be laying off in 2015 a lot has change since i have been there six years now looking for a change."
bad,"You will work as a seasonal for 80 hours a week, 5 months straight.  Only to be let go in the end.  It will not matter how hard you work.  Team Leaders will not notice.  They will only listen to the union employees who will make things up about you or bash your work ethic.  You shouldn't work hard because it will make those employees look bad.  If they look bad they will get you fired.  This is what happened to me.  It will happen to you too."
bad,Empresa exige muito e o retorno financeiro e muito pouco
bad,it was hard and they cheated me out my pay and the place had no struture at all people was doing any and everything there they aint check on you nor did they train well nor showed you around the facility
bad,Nothing to say this job was just something to keep me busy while pregnant. But it wasn't that bad with work it was they were very picking and choosing who would work the full week. Managers wasn't fair enough...and the pay wasn't worth the work we were doing so I dismissed my self from the company.
bad,Não foi tudo o que eu esperava ! Tem que melhorar a gestão de alguns supervisores !
bad,"Packed and labeled boxes for shipment, Prepared boxes for shipment. Ensured accurate count in the boxes. labeled the products to be identified."
bad,"There are so many challenges in GMI on the daily basis like space management, manpower handling & manpower shortages, working on material shortages & its planning, work on operational issues etc."
bad,"I started with General Mills as a part-time merchandiser and worked my way up to a Sr. Business Team Leader after 11 years.  I learned all about CPG, category management, selling, and managing accounts from little to large and how I can affect market share as well as sales by doing my homework-literally.  I worked full-time and got my degree at night and weekends while working at General Mills, moving 2 times.  I had a great mentor and felt valued as an employee, however, the pay was not equal with my experience, and another opportunity presented itself which I accepted. The challenge of a direct store delivery CPG company was a good experience and helped me propell my career in a new direction"
bad,General Mills is a good place to work if you’re looking for a good pay check. If you want to have a life outside of work i wouldn’t recommend it though.
bad,"Work from home depended on the manager so not everyone had equal benefits. They had restructuring  every other year, meaning lots of layoffs. Not a lot of job security."
bad,"I really enjoyed my job, it was very east to load/unload trucks, but unless you did certain things, you wouldn't get promoted or . All of management currently has no idea how to run the place, they pretend, but the employees are doing a great job showing how incompetent all of management really are."
bad,This company does not hire you if you work for contract company.  Does not treat contractors the same as regular employees.  Gives cereal to General Mills employees only.
bad,"General Mills was a good job because it was close to home, I felt that it was very unorganized in the beggining and things have gotten better. I dont like the inconsistency of the job because you never know how long you are going to be there. The work isnt very hard and production was easy to keep up with as long as you have a good team. The management there picks and chooses who works and I feel that thats unfair."
bad,Basically at General millsyou were a robot! If you were broken...Get yourself fixed quick or you will be replaced! Long hours in hot conditions.
bad,"Will lay you off in a heartbeat in it comes down to profits for the shareholders or the board of directors.  When our facility was closed, insider leaked that it was mainly because it was a union facility."
bad,"Very bad experience was placed on a team where only about 1/3 of them would even talk to me. Ended up being terminated because I didn't meet their expectations, or so they say. I'm pretty sure it was a force out because the old boys club were threatened by my skills."
bad,I worked there from 12/2016 to 05/2017 as a material handler. In that short amount of time I found out that if you don't fit in you don't advance. I was injured due to the neglect of my trainer. He would actually sit in his office talk and play games on his phone instead of train like he was paid to do. After that everything went to bad. The treatment was pretty terrible. The worst thing is that you only advance based on peer review. not performance.
bad,High school mentality too many cliques my position was not challenging.  High turnover.  Looked down on low level employees hard to get ahead.  Had 3 reconstructions of the organization while I was there
bad,Way to many layoffs we would work one week layoff one week work 3 days off one week i have bills cant pay them with layoffs and this site has way to many word minimum
bad,Typical day at work was overworked understaffed at third shift.  A great deal of entitlement attitude from the staff with extended work history and large number of racial cliques.
bad,The politics of company management makes a fairly easy job almost unbearable. Production TL's will blame maintenance and equipment for down time instead of scheduling time for routine maintenance.
bad,Manger was great but needed to be more hands on and the lines that I worked on were supervised by line leads and they were rude most of the time i worked there and it was very stressful.
bad,"No way to be thanked there, just a pay check for a temp worker.  Minimal breaks.  Took almost all the break time to get to break room.  Pay was minimal work was heavy and fast pace."
bad,Stay to your selfand you will be ok every week pay is a plus you can not get hired in no way at all i feel the work we do we should get paid more money and have benifits with that but you a temp not to hire
bad,"Because of union environment, employees are not held accountable for work not completed or they do not complete tasks on purpose so that they or another person can receive overtime pay for the unaccomplished task. Management is in fear of union backlash and employees are not held accountable. All uncompleted work is left for overtime or the next shift to complete, which bred resentment in both respective areas. Hard work is looked down upon by peers and work hours for junior employees run a person into the ground. I did not value benefits and pay over work hours and workplace culture so I chose to leave."
bad,I worked with some very talented & supportive people during my employment.  The culture has changed quite a bit in the past 5 years.  Not as inviting of a place to work as it was years ago.
bad,General Mills used to be a fantastic place to work.  It felt like a community where everyone cared about each other.  When the company's results started declining it became extremely cut-throat and a lot of work was moved to India because it's cheaper there.  The quality of the results of that cheaper labor meant additional work for the workers left to redo the work done in India because Management demanded that the work done in India was top notch.
bad,The company people only care about themselves and could care less about the union workers.  Can barely make a liveable wage unless willing to work 70-90 hours a week.
bad,it was more like a soap opera always being pushed back of my goals and being stabbed in the back and every year to lose a friend
bad,"If you are part of the production floor employees it can be very hostile for women. It is male dominated and very hard to be accepted as an equal even if you have done this type of work before. 12 hour shifts are exhausting because you are on your feet all day or night. "
bad,"General Mills is completely driven on safety. No work like balance.  They constantly are adding duties to the team members and mandatory meetings not during normal working hours.  If operators say no, they are looked unfavorable."
bad,"In the early 70""s it was a good place to work. Then new management started coming in and it became very difficult to work with a lot of them. They were fresh out of college and had a know-it-all attitude and started telling people that have worked there for years how to do their jobs. It always ended up causing bad production and wasted product because the mangers way was the wrong way."
bad,"Horrible scheduling and management. Extremely dirty plant, considering you’re making food products. A lot of forced OT. A lot of negative reinforcements. Coworkers are tolerable, when they act as a team member and don’t just stand around. If you’re a hard worker, you will work even harder, get burnt out and eventually get fired for ‘tired mistakes’ or missing time for being so run down. If you’re the type of person that moves slow, but not too slow, doesn’t miss days, and lives to please higher ups. This is your job."
bad,"I'm really surprised this plant stays afloat. If you cherish family life & work balance, DO NOT work here. You will be forced over & in early constantly because every worker have & abuse FMLA. Coworkers screw each other over @ every chance. The race card is played way too much so that management are told to not to mess w/ them. If you want to make a lot of $ quickly & move on, this is the perfect job. But to stay here more than that, u will find u missed a lot of love. hmorefeyearscuople years is a life sentence you won't"
bad,Good starter company to get training then move on to a real career that cares about their people and advancement to the next level they are bad about picking favorite's
bad,"I would not recommend General Mills to family or friends, poor management, poor work conditions, work attitudes among co-workers, incentives very lacking."
bad,I worked for a total of two years at this plant and I found that the the moral of the General Mills Employees and that of their temp workers was not very high. Mostly because of contentions between the General Mills Employees and their Temp Workers. Since my working at General Mills the treatment of their temp workers has improved and I hear that the moral has gone up. So hopefully it has become a much better place to work in Hannibal Mo.
bad,"They talk a good talk, but after you work for years and give your all, they will give you the boot without batting an eye. Promoting a ""home-work life balance"" is nothing but words on a projection screen at meetings. You are not allowed to voice your opinion, for fear that you'll be retaliated against. They preach safety, but the minute you practice what THEY preach in the meetings, you are chastised for not meeting their performance standards, as you have caused downtime (wait...didn't you guys just say in the meeting that safety was top priority, but now I'm getting in trouble because I stopped the process for a safety concern? Irony anyone?). In addition to all the hours worked, you also have to participate in extra projects, which are outside of your normal work hours, taking even more time away from your family and life. They also have a nice habit of cutting full-time employees out and adding temporary employees in, causing more stress on the production line, given the fact that a temp will not be as experienced as a full-time employee."
bad,"Obtive muita experiência dentro da empresa, não tenho o que reclamar."
bad,very stressful and running around all day and orders are stocked to the brim with lots to do and I really never liked this place to work for myself to be honest
bad,its was okay i just got hurt a lot it wasn't the job for me. i didst feel like the job was worth all the work they had me doing.then i didn't get any sick paid or unpaid
bad,"When I first started at General Mills, it was a great place to work. Now there has been an increased pressure to cut costs from corporate, and the environment has severely declined. They are finding any way they can to reduce staffing and create more work for people in an already high paced environment."
bad,"General Mills will be your life, no time for family. You are there every weekend. You get a lot of breaks. Clean environment. Nice people to work with but , not worth your family life"
bad,good pay.  very hot had to gear up in yellow rubber suits to clean.  you worked 13 on 1 day off  in two weeks.. you only received 2 days off a month.  good food in lunch room
bad,The new work schedule is devastating to a family unit. It pretty much obstructs any ability to do continuing education or family functions that the rest of the world enjoys.  Unless you are salary you are subject to being on call on your days off.  There is a clear class distinction between management and hourly employees.  The turnover rate is very high and they have to resort to using booths in the local mall as a recruiting device.   The benefit package is fairly decent but is being whittled away every year as a cost cutting measure.  Research how many plants have closed in the past 8 years before you jump aboard this company as your future.
bad,"I worked here as a Line Supervisor on 3rd shift.  I took the job knowing it was not long term.  They catered to the union and the location in New Albany, IN was eventually closed because of the inflexibility of the union.  It was sad, but Management wouldn't stand up.  I only worked here about 10 months, and couldn't get out quick enough."
bad,"Overworked all that matters is the results, poor business decisions made continuously. Misleading information from corporate, that lead to basically no bonuses. "
bad,This is another job that really miss you p everyday I would come home with scratches and bruises on my hands and arms it was horrible that don't pa you enough the labor work at all I wouldn't go back there..
bad,I was working there as a contractor for a few months. They ended up notifying me toward the end of my contract that they will not extend my contract. Leaving little to no time to look for another position.
bad,"Fellow employees never smile, everyone uptight from management. Forced OT day or night, weekends etc. Very little training, but yet expect knowledge. Good if you like safety but other then that not a enjoyable work place."
bad,Not interested in keep employees that work hard but instead keep the employees that are paid less.  ---------------------------------------------------
bad,"ocupava um cargo no qual não tinha qualidade de vida,trabalhava de segunda a sábado, exceto nos domingos e feriados, isso se o feriado não caísse no sábado ou na segunda, caso contrário, a empresa ordenava que nós tínhamos que trabalhar no feriado e folgar outro dia sem pegar 100% de extra do feriado."
bad,this job requires lots of standing and moving at a quick pace back and forth loading machines as long as you find a good motion it  is very easy 12 hour rotating shifts
bad,I liked the work I did but knew it was a short term project.  The hardest part of the job was being treated differently as you were only a short time employee.
bad,Management at the Belvidere Illinois plant do not support their maintenance staff.  They treat them very poorly and will write them up for any infraction at any time.  There is a ton of management employees here who make much more money than maintenance and will still ask questions of the maintenance staff since they do not know anything about machines.
bad,"There are too many changes going on these past years. Many employees were offered severances, so dont see this as a good sign.lo"
bad,"Dificuldade em ser reconhecido e a empresa não obter plano de carreira. Mesmo ela sendo uma multinacional e tendo vários valores, ainda falta mudança em sua gestão."
bad,"I worked one week then fired. Started with two days of orientation with all safety and introductions to a wide variety of people.  on the third day I was shadowing certain workers who jobs I wiould be learning..Great, on my fourth, fifth, and sixth i was training to be on the supply side. At the end of the sixth day I was called into the H.R. Office not really knowing why I was called in. I was told I was being let go because some employees had observed that I didn't have General Mills attitude and that I was gossiping, which was untrue the only thing that changed within the seven days I worked their was that my limp got progressively worst. Im telling you this story today and still have no idea what was going on. Through the 2.5 months to check my background to working just one week I did enjoy some of the people who worked their. This is just a cautionary tale which is all true and happened in Carson, Ca. They said we care for our employees but I wasn't fired for performance or anything like that I was fired because of hearsay. I have two kids and they just stole food out of their mouth I especially want to thank Production supervisor ,who never worked on my shift, and H.R. Dept for their hypocrisy."
bad,na
bad,"I was hired for a position although corporate had intentions of selling the business I was being hired into.  My fifth week with General Mills they announced they were selling the business.  Many people at this factory had 20+ years with the company.  No one, other than HR, kept their job or was offered a severance."
bad,The managers breed a toxic work environment that doesn't promote a positive work environment either. The work can be back breaking and often too fast paced. the team I worked with was great aside from the managers.
bad,In this company I did not like working for them because of the way they treat you and pay. The workers there are so unprofessional and so are the managers
bad,"Watch your back at all times, someone is always ready to run to the boss to create drama altho it Doesn't get them ahead. And the management  is a bunch of want a bes interns."
bad,"É uma boa empresa porém tem um plano de carreira e salarios muito abaixo do tamanho da empresa poderia ser melhor neste ponto e nos beneficios que sao muito poucos , também poderia melhorar a gestao de muitos supervisores de merchandising que nao tem nehuma visao do que seja ser supervisor ."
bad,"The culture at General Mills is not nearly as inclusive and welcoming on the inside as it appears on the outside.  ""New"" and ""differential"" ways of working/thinking are said to be valued, yet new employees are often penalized for not conforming to ""the General Mills way""."
bad,Everyone talks about everyone and it creates problems in the work area. Everything is fast paced and if you are going fast enough they tell at you instead of helping you
bad,I worked on a line and made excellent pay.  The people there were not friendly and I didn't learn a lot.  The breaks and lunch were right on time and never denied.  The down side is that you can get told to stay after your shift and you don't have a choice so if you have a family or other obligations then it's hard and stressful.
bad,"Great training and work life flexibility "
bad,This company is in such a cost-cutting mode that it is no longer going to have long-term technology development activities.
bad,"hot everyday, everyday there something new, your break is nothing but 30mins cant go out on your break unless u work in the office so most likly if you didnt bring it with you or you know someone in the office that can bring you something back on there break, your not going to have it. I did learn alot from working from this place learned how u control a forklift, lift beams they do have it where they'll let have what they call grab day you'll get a full box depending on how much of the product has been shipped out.management is good for the most part if you work hard it'll show everyones looking at you in the warerhouse, hardest part of this job is the heat the most enjoyable meeting new people mostly everyday and the tranning"
bad,I got along great with the co workers
bad,lots of stress from other worker as a new employee were willing to help a couple of times but after that ur on ur own to figure it out some employee are rude to new employees also
bad,I think that General Mills is a good company that pays their employees well but pays the staffing agency workers poorly when we do all the work. I go home and cry from the pain every day.
bad,I worked for General Mills for almost 3 yrs. Never offered or given a raise. Never was offered a position with gm no advancement. A dead end job with no hope of making it a permanent position.
bad,It's a laid back job not to fast paced friendly employees . Has good people as managers it's not a hard job an it teaches you work skills in warehouse work
bad,It's not a place a person shouldn't be proud of working. Needs new management. Place stinks people who work there steal. Not a good place to to work.
bad,Great for fresh grads & less than 2 years experience people. Experienced people keep away.More than decent amount of politics.
bad,"Definate breakdown of who has college and who doesn't and if you don't have it you are not getting promoted. Forced Overtime and massive breaches of contract are the norm all the while playing lawyer to get you to do what they want. A true ""Do as I say, but not as I do"" Company. Whats worse is they will lie to your face and then deny saying anything at all."
bad,The company just announced its closure. Which affects 430 families. The moral at general mills is low. The company itself is good to its employees.
bad,"Its a job you really have to get use to. "
bad,it sucked working there.everybody was snoody or stuck up.then i had problems with my pay.it took almost 3-4 weeks of complaining to get my first weeks pay.
bad,I was excited to start work at General Mills . The first day I started no one knew that I was going to start work. Management never told anyone. It's a fast pace environment and we work 12 hour shifts. Makes the time go by.
bad,I worked here for a total of 56 hours a week never had time off if i wanted it off i had to call out and take a point very unprofessional. i worked as a welder for their 6oz cups working very hard and got paid less than i should have.
bad,"Company cares more about stockholders then actual workers that produce the products that make them a ton of money to give to stockholders. Seems like when the products that are deemed growing products are failing, cuts and other plants are closed to improve their bottom line. Even manufacturing plants that make money can be closed......always wanting more."
bad,Not for people looking to grow in their career. Very very relaxed culture. No clarity on work. No clarity on growth path.
bad,"Personally, I dreaded going into work. The jobs are monotonous and the factory depleted my soul of any desire to live. The compensation is good, but the soul crushing depression induced by going into work outweighed the benefits."
bad,"I don't work there anymore but it was a good place to work. Not much room for advancement, but I knew what the position was when I accepted the offer of employment and was happy with the hours and compensation. If you like driving forklifts or order picking then this is the place for you. It's located right outside of fort Wayne passed airport expressway."
bad,"They say safety first but don't back it up if it cost to much."
bad,de superbes marques et une entreprise en pleine transformation
bad,Empresa excelente no trabalho para seus funcionários
bad,"A typical day at work was spent collaborating with sales teams in planning and executing both onsite and offsite meetings and customer events."
bad,"Pay is no good "
bad,"I understand it's a business, and must continue to run as such, but not being able to plan for family or other functions for the weekend does put a strain on a person.  You may not know you're working on that weekend until 3p Friday.  Not a week ahead, not 2 weeks.  But only a few hours.  I have learned a great deal from them, good and bad.  My company is closing soon, and just like a previous plant closure, I will probably miss my co-workers the most.  Most of our management staff could use a bit of brushing up on people skills, and not just micro manage and go home for the day at 3, 4 and 5p while we're there 24hrs a day.  My direct supervisor on the other hand is probably hands down the most dedicated person I've ever encountered.  And she actually does consider us in my dept, her family."
bad,We just packed and stand up the hole time u u have different parts you work at everybody clean up at the end2 of the lunch break you get paid and u get over time when ever u want
bad,"If you like quick work and long hours you’d like this job, lunch area is very nice but the employees were rude. Its far out but they provide transportation"
bad,"The company provides great benfits, vacation, health insurance,401k and pension. Most of the employees are easy to work with. The work was overall easy."
bad,"if you like the smell of cereal, then its a great place to work. its easy work when working like a team. you got three thirty minute brakes. its a good work environment."
bad,Its a 12 hour job 6:30-6:30. It's an alternating schedule that switches every 2 months. it is a lot of work especially when your co-workers are lazy. You want to get there maybe 20 minutes before 6:30 or you risk being sent home. You also have 5 days off in a week but you are paid weekly.
bad,"I learned how to wrap pallets, palletized and build display shippers. Everyday we do different orders so were not doing the same thing everyday. I would like the workplace to be more diverse."
bad,Good place i enjoyed my job there. Hated to leave. Hope to return when my children are older i worked 3rd shift there for 5 years. I really ejoyed cleaning and tearung down the equipment. It was a gun job to see something  that big handles by so few good employees
bad,"NIce to work here, Co-operative in all terms. Got a very good support from seniors. Very good management and HR policies"
bad,Very long days & very little time off. Paychecks were great but it was hard to have a life outside of work when being forced to work so many hours.
bad,everyday is just like they day before drama after drama a few laughs here and there
bad,This job was ok but the pay did not fit the occupation. The work was on a first com first serve if I did not make it on time I did not get any work.
bad,"General mills is a great place to work if you are hired on through the company itself. The pay is like 20 something an hour with great benefits and advancement opportunities. Depending on the plant your hours rotate from days to nights with available overtime. If you see the parking lot you can tell the employees get paid very well. However, the temp workers are of course exploited concerning pay & benefits, taking advantage of workers as well as a hefty percentage they get off of every dollar you make. There is almost know way to go temp to permanent even with great skills and attendance. When I worked there I was making about 9.50 or 10.00/hr. Once you find out how much the full time people make in comparison you probably will think to yourself ""why can't they do this, they make triple what i do""."
bad,• Place product on production lines
bad,"Slow moving company, too much planning and not enough focus on execution. Really need to focus on performance management as a company. Minnesota nice doesn't grow a business."
bad,Packing cereal packing gardettos packing checkmix have to be at work at 7  to 2:30 working with all type of food its was amazing how much food we was working with
good,It was fast pace but I was able to keep up my job title was a packer but they insist on making me do other things like lift over 50 lb boxes when they had males to do it I didn't feel that it was a safe environment cuz they didn't even provide us to wear steel toes back then.
good,"Working as a temporary employee was the worst thing you can do. They don't care for the people they bring to work at different companies. They mistreat you (Temporary Agency), and uner pay you for 13 hours a day work hours."
good,Good job ..and good experience with them..but no limit of Duty time..some time 24 hours duty with out any  overtime..
good,The people I worked with were very nice and they taught me alot. The management could use some human relationship skills.
good,"Plant cutlur and treatment to employees not good uneatable organisation. Always stressed, blamegame and harrasment to employee but no one taking care."
good,In my almost 3 years there i had over 10 bosses and i was never formally trained at what i was done. after being there and teaching i was let go due to downsizing.
good,1 was their 3 years a different  job every year.  The last year I was there I was unfairly let go you were let off for holidays 1 or 2 weeks at a time hard to get caught up on bills
good,Empresa proporciona a oportunidade de se trabalhar em várias áreas.
good,"All your hard work is based on a computer system that is seriously flawed! What ever happened to just being able to go to work and do your job and go home? I had such great expectations for this company but they were soon demolished! At least once a week I'm called in the office to be scorned about my( L.M.S ) 'THE SYSTEM'.  ITS bad , I have been there almost 6 months and I am desperately trying to find another job.Did i mention that since I have started there have been at least 25 people either fired or quit! Highest turnover rate I have seen in along time."
good,a typical work day begins with an employee meeting where we told the numbers for the night . given safety briefing and sent to our forklift to begin working. picking cases and loading trucks with minimal to no damage while meeting productivity
good,This job kept you very busy always on your toes. It only became a slow day when the machines would break down but it was easy money. I didn't like the way management would go and tell your personal business when you aren't around. It was fine to work with some cool and friendly people (other than the boss). The part I liked was when we took breaks and hung out with some of the other coworkers.
good,it was up to the mark. cuz i am MBA in HR so i want to go in that field.
good,"it used to be a really good place to work, but in recent years, the management team consists of mainly recent college graduates. they are mostly young girls, who are trying to prove themselves and show what they know. Rather than listen to experienced employees, they talk down to them, and demand that they get respect that they haven't earned."
good,"I loved working at General Mills! Great environment nice people, but the management didn't and was not doing there part! Hours where great but did not see any growth coming in the future!"
good,my typical day at general mills would be to sit and wait to call to work from a attendance sheet and you were not guarantee to work if the work load was light and that section was full for that night.
good,"Too much favoritism, no room for advancement, verbal abuse from  management. Coworkers were very helpful and team work was a must.  Aside for management not too bad a place to work."
good,"They pay well and have great benefits, management is terrible. They preach safety but dont really mean it and they also preach work life balance then work you ridiculous hours"
good,"Awful management, terrible co-workers. Worse place that I Have ever worked. Never got days off, never enjoyed a day there."
good,"This factory made sure you knew you were a number only. eg: G518873. A training platform for college inturns that would come in every few months and try to make their mark on the industry by fixing tons of things that weren't broken. Over 6 years and 4 months the paperwork, material handling, safety requirements, etc became a quagmire of miles and miles of red tape that would make the New York City building commission balk. "
good,"Working at general mills the job was great and there was a lot of team work there, but when it came to management it really wasn't y that good they would sit in there office and complain that we weren't going fast enough and we were going as fast as we all could . The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the convayor  belt because it is like have a bunch of small toy cars coming at you all at  once and it was very hard to keep count and check the product to see if it was bad or good. I enjoyed my job the most is when we would all get there we would just chill and  talk about how the team was going to do that day or what we all needed to work on to make our jobs easier that night"
good,"Work you to the bone, closing the plant and act like we owe them everything. Pretty sure they are contacting seeking employers and hindering the hiring process. Giving employees false information. demanding we be up front and inform them off all job opportunities yet I cant even get a letter of recommendation. They will only verify employment. If you decide to quit and not tell them ahead of time the harass you to sign a non disclosure."
good,"steel toed shoes, laughter"
good,Falta mais reconhecimento profissional e financeiro com os profissionais.
good,"Loved working for them, the people there were great to work with, there just was no job sercurity."
good,"General Mills was a great working place,,just hot once your working for a long period of time...Great employers just didnt have to many benifits"
good,Processed daily and weekly reports producing vendor receipts based on vendors purchase orders using Red Parire software. Managed the replenishment of vendors supplies based on customer demand. Processed daily shipments using various logistic companies comparing shipping and handling costs to accommodate customers. Respond resourcefully to customer’s requests and concerns while providing great customer service.
good,Supervisors were prejudice and wouldnt put you on the schedule out of spite even if you are a Top employee. If you arent able to work a particular day or if you are sick they wont put you on the schedule until they feel like it even though you are a dependable employee. Your efforts arent appreciated.
good,"It was ok I didn’t like the 12 hour shift and the manager is inexperienced for the job he has and take it out on the employees, but the labor was actually pretty East"
good,Good enough for experience as a first time packer and to keep you afloat as someone who still fits in a single tax bracket; as long as nothing in life ever goes wrong. They do not have enough cleaning personnel.
good,"They are very ""safety minded""..."
good,"hours can be flexible"
good,I enjoyed doing my daily jobs which were filling for anyone that was not at work. each day was a different task.
good,"A typical work day would be me coming into work putting on my goggles and hair net. Standing in my area waiting for a box to fill up so I can pick it up and put it onto the next line. I really didn't learn much from this job. The actual job that had me doing can be done in everyday life, I believe. My co-workers were quite friendly. Very respectful. The hardest part about my job would probably not being able to work at all. There would be days were the employees come to work and would get sent right back home. This could happen for many days before some of these employees can even work. Just a lot of wasted time was involved. The most enjoyable part would probably be the use of time. If you stay focused and pay attention to what your doing, time goes by fairly fast. You would also get a lot more done and possibly be a head."
good,"the job was ""okay"" meaning it didnt bother me much but it was alot of overrated work the job wasnt hard at all its that they asked for so much in so little time so it kinda gave them a stupid reason to fire other employees that had responsibilitys, i learned how to use on-hand work i used my hands alot opening boxes, there wasnt no hard part of the job cause it was so easy to do, the most enjoyable part is getting to know all the people i met,"
good,You will like this place if you will do whatever you are told. Other then that you are bullied by management and you have no voice. You are told that you do but that is not the case.
good,"Poste en 6/4 rythme difficile à prendre."
good,"Working for General Mills was okay, they really don’t care about there workers I got hurt on the job and they didn’t care or anything wanted me to finish there work and I was hurt badly"
good,"Ive worked in many warehouses and I never seen "
good,A typical day at work starts off with gathering up ppe equipment. Once your protective equipment is gathered you'll meet for a meeting with the line operators. They'll tell you what you'll be doing and how the other shift has ran. You'll work for 8 hours on the production.
good,"They just hired a bunch of people,  just to lay them off and offer buy outs. The employees are great but management sucks! Overtime is last minute and mandatory."
good,"Salaire de base peu élevé"
good,Ok place to work but they shutdown plants a great deal.I was well trained and had many benefits but the plant I worked at was sold and I lost my retirement.
good,"I really liked my job. The company in general looked to destroy the older Union shops. We we're willing to take consessions in order to keep the facility open. In all the climate surveys, we were asked then reassured that management was doing  everything possible to stay open for years to come. THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NOT TRUE!!!"
good,"There's two paths to advancement, one for new college recruites and one for veteran employees.  New College Recruites are protected and advance and veteran older employees are ignored."
good,Management never lasted more than a few months in their positions and thus the work distribution among employees was poorly executed with those who were responsible in fulfilling their duties asked to help others who made no effort to perform their own tasks. Those who under performed were rarely reprimanded for their mistakes or lack of effort to do their job right.
good,"Great company, I wasn't lucky with the management in the process of M&A. The management was complicated, nobody stayed after some time. Some great people work there, its just my view of a specific department at a specific time."
good,General Mills offers great benefits but not so great schedules and no advancement even though they like to make you think that you can always move up.
good,It's a hard working environment. U stay working an u don't get paid for ur breaks. No matter what an I don't get any benefits at all.an no matter what u can't go use the bathroom that much even if u got to use the bathroom
good,"At General Mills, consideration for advancement is less about your work performance and more about who you know. The roles available are very mundane and somewhat boring."
good,"If you work third shift it is a relaxed environment, the employees are fun and most generally good at working as a team. But if you work here be prepared to live here. You work 6 days a week and will point out and get fired if you call off more than 8 days in a 6 month span. the hardest part of working third shift would have to be attending countless unnecessary meetings."
good,"Good work life balance, but not very stable. Great people, super fun environment, but industry and company not going through a good moment now. Not stable at all."
good,"Worked at GMI for years. The people, opportunity and culture were great when I started. "
good,Easy work but very pour pay. I felt that I worked way harder than the actual General Mills employees for 7.75/ hr. when the operators make 20-40/hr. and they work half as much
good,"Muy buena empresa par adquirir experiencia, pero con muy bajos salarios y beneficios."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, onde se aprende muito, trabalho em equipe,"
good,Worked for 12 hours rotation day & night shift. the most exhausting was the hours & did not pay well only $10 is not enough to get by. The people I was working in the workplace was very nice & easy to get along with. The most enjoyable was breaks. Management kinda sucks.
good,The hardest part was working night shift. I made a lot of good friends there and learned a lot about factory work. It was my first job like that and it was definitely informative.
good,Benefits are fair but are also changing. Promotion potential is becoming scarce. If you are hired on the off shift it will be a long time before you obtain a day shift job.
good,"A typical day in general labor involves either boxing or stacking/palletizing General Mills products such as cereal, hamburger helper etc...(light things). The job itself isn't hard, but they only pay minimum wage and for a company like General Mills, that surprised me. The onsite agency you go through for them pays $11/hr for general labor, and $16/hr if you're a forklift driver. If they'd pay around $14/hr for general labor, it would be fair."
good,"Very unproffesional management no human comunication skills or knowledge of job, I think they look for people with special disabilities so they can be management with lower pay seen a 10 year old with more sense of ability."
good,"Very little drama among coworkers. If things are running well, lots of time to gossip.  Management knows more about your job than you do and experience doesn't mean anything to management"
good,General Mills in Kansas City has really good benefits.  The pay is ok.  They make absolutely no effort to give any regular time off.  At this point I have been here more than 15 years and I am compelled to work 7 days a week for the most part.
good,"overall it was a good option for a part time job all though, scheduling was a bit confusing since they would change it every couple months. the job it self was fast pace and easy to work, and most of the job required team work"
good,"Management needs to understand that tenured technicians know there job and by allowing a newly graduate person placed into a position that they know absolutely nothing about jeopardizes the whole process. "
good,"Read the fine print: ""AS OTHER DUTIES AS ASSIGNED"". If your expecting to repair/ diagnose problems, maybe 25% of your work, the remaining 75% is filling in for operations lack of staff or skill. Tools, uniforms (if you want them) are provided. Being a GMP plant there are regulations to follow.  Clean the tools, the tool boxes etc. Inspections done in lockers, your tool boxes to insure these regulations are being followed. 12 hr. work days, weekdays and weekends. Within the same week expect a night shift and be asked to also work a day shift, or reversed. The pay is slightly below average, but every year drops lower as the annual increase is low. The benifits are on par with any other plant so there fair. The work environment is cold, wet but relatively clean. Coverage is1 electrician and 2 millwrights."
good,"My tenure at General Mills was a memorable experience. When I first started it was a job I enjoyed (even with ALL the OT). Time changed and so did management, I began to loathe. I appreciate General Mills for the opportunity and the financial stability it provided for me and my family."
good,"understaffed have took work a lot of overtime, benefits are good but continually get worse every year. They may be looking to move to 12 hours shifts."
good,"good place but don,t care about employees . All about stock holders"
good,"General Mills/Pillsbury offered above average pay and benefits. These benefits included free healthcare,  payed holidays, vacations and overtime."
good,Great company to work for. The food industry is challenging. General Mills is competing more and more with smaller brands and it needs to adapt its structure and modus operandi to respond quickly to market changes
good,"The Pillsbury buy was the end of the creative at GMI. Went more process and lean, thus the ""new"" went with that. Now GMI has to buy other companies to be on the cutting edge. Marketing keeps inventing spin offs of current brands that are fading."
good,Not enough hours working.Co workers were nice to work with. Machines broke down alot. Management was ok to work for.I learned alot about Warehouse and packaging.
good,Enjoyed the work and the people. Unfortunately the plant is closing and I have to move on.  Work weeks were long with forced over time does not make it easy to have time with my family.
good,"The harder part of the job is the union environment and the plant culture. However, the salary team is very innovative and full of talent, to drive change."
good,"Used to be a good place to work. Tough place now. Lots of tension everyday. A mix of good manager with really bad ones."
good,"Meu primeiro emprego aprendi a lidar com o publico e  perder a vergonha."
good,"The company was a decent place to work. A typical day would involve lot of reporting, adhoc requests and work in various domains. The team was a fine team."
good,"Always busy which I loved."
good,Standing for an 8 hour shift watching Pillsbury products. Cleaning and sanitation nights once a week.
good,-came into work
good,I left to join the pipefitters union. Enjoyed my work there for the most part. The long stretches of working several days straight without a day off played a big roll in me leaving. Also on those long days i was on second shift and would get drafted so i really didnt have a life
good,"This is a great place to work if you enjoy coming to work to do the same thing every day. You know what the day is going to be like, not many surprises, and work flow is consistent. "
good,"If you did your job and kept a low profile you were usually ok."
good,Fun working place good people. Great training provided. Would get two bounces a year and great pay. However time off is very strict. Attendance is based off a 7 point system.
good,"High talent people doing their best in a challenged industry. Trying to change, but sometimes struggling with that. Proud to have worked there, but glad I left."
good,"General mills pays their employees quite well, especially for the easy work. The major problem I had with the company is the extreme amount of days and hours spent there and the absolutely problematic management. I do not know where to even begin describing the ridiculous overhead and the lack of understanding what operators do on the production floor. The management coordinators basically acted as glorified baby sitters who would sit at a desk all day just to take out their aggressions on the people who put all of their time, energy and life force into this job. They had the audacity to tell the production teams how to do their jobs without any kind of knowledge of what really happens on the production floor and quite frankly I just couldn't take it anymore. If you can handle such an environment with the occasional slackers that somehow made the cut then this is the job for you! If you need a job that requires you to be there 7 days a week with occasional 12 hour days, this is a good place to get that. Other than the ridiculous management, which may have changed since I have parted ways, the people that you will work with make it more than tolerable. The benefits are outrageously nice as well! Overall, not so bad, just not my kind of joint."
good,"A typical day at work would start off smooth, its later in the day and the night seem to go by fast. The thing i loved the most about working at General Mills is that smelt cereal all night. It was noting hard about the job. The management was very fair."
good,"Is like any other work. It has it's good moments and it's bad. It's simple work. Some days stressful, others relaxing. Hardest part of the job is when you have to lift very heavy boxes."
good,"packing food in boxes"
good,Fast paced environment with the ability to get pay increases with productivity. Managers were helpful and training was adequate. Working alone and with others was not a problem.
good,If you like to work all the time and have not much of a family life then this is the place for you. some of the people are fun to work with but the managers are right up in ur business all night
good,Multinacional de grande porte líder no segmento alimentício
good,Great place to gain experience for new coming labor workers. Friendly environment. Sometimes the work may be hard because the packing items are heavy from time to time but you’ll get used to it.
good,It was a good place to work there was no advancement in the maintenance department. The union destroyed this plant with poor performance. Management did not help the situation with all of the forced overtime for no reason witch gave employees a poor attitude the plant is close now but could have been a great place to work
good,"At the GM production floor, employees have the option for overtime if desired. GM also cross-trains employees in other job tasks, this allows an employee to be more skilled in all production areas."
good,"People come and go here, seems like under a lot of turmoil. It's OK If you can block out where did this one go I was starting to talk to, hope they found another job! That sort of thing."
good,A typical day working for this company consist of boxing and preparing orders for shipment to local grocery stores and inspection of products before loading and shipping to proper customer to ensure that everything is accurate
good,Productive fast-pace workplace optional work weekend bi-weekly no benefits available recently raised pay-rate stressful environment on occasion 8/hr shifts
good,It used to be a better place.    Several people that have been there for long time mentioned how the company has change.  The work life balance is OK but the company tries to be so nice that it doesn't address poor performance and attitudes.
good,Working there was a headache bosses have there picks and there is no type of leadership there.people take breaks when they want and are very lazy and the management sucks.
good,"A role that provided learning into a MNC and horned in my influencing skills. "
good,Great place to work early in your career but as the company has become leaner it they are becoming less and less of a family company.  The people are what make the company worth it.  Great group of individuals.
good,"Havia um bate papo conduzido por mim com time no inicio dos turnos sobre resultado do dia anterior e também sobre algum tema abordado referente a segurança, trabalhei em toda rotina de recebimento, armazenagem, separação, conferência, expedição, devoluções e retrabalho. Aprendi sobre controle de pragas, parte mais desafiadora era reduzir número de devoluções da empresa e a parte mais gratificante era atingir as metas estipuladas. Enfatizo que a empresa foca de maneira muito forte na segurança de seus colaboradores com muitos programas específicos."
good,it was a very stressful place to work. they are not people persons at all. and they don't appreciate there employees at all. and all they think people do is work 24 7. no time to spend with family at all.
good,"A very fast pace working job, didn't talk much to other Co worker due to not having much time to actually talk  , leads with kinda rude other from thathe okay job to work at"
good,"Uma Empresa muito boa, com benefícios como Unimed, vale alimentação etc"
good,"After working in my position for 8 years I have found that the customer will always get what they want before the employees do. Causing an overwhelming workload and a poor work life balance. While the paycheck and benefits are good, you loose touch with your life because you are always at work, especially if you work night shift. Although there is a lot of information to learn, and the work is fast pace and will keep you on your toes, knowing that you are just another employee can make you feel down. When working with so many employees it can be hard to feel like you've made any impact. But between some of the work relationships with co-workers and the financial benefits it makes General Mills a place worth working at."
good,"*Operating machines"
good,"Factory is closing. Learned several machines. Great co-workers. Some positions had very heavy lifting. We had one 15 minute break in the morning, a 35 minute lunch, and a 15 minute break in the afternoon."
good,"My time at General Mills Was Good, Good Benefits, Great Pay, but Long Long Long Hours. Also three rotating Shifts! But if you are looking to making Great Money, General Mills is your place,"
good,"New Albany, Indiana General Mills, Inc. plant is closing. Like the people that I work with, made a lot of good friends while working there."
good,The facility I worked at was small and managed poorly.  It has since closed.
good,Overall I have enjoyed my time with GMI.  Like any job there are pros and cons.  It’s an enormous company and people have a tendency to get stuck/lost if they are not able to lay out a plan and communicate with their manager next steps and career plans.  Company is currently going through a large scale restructuring plan.
good,"My work day begins at 6:00 in the morning and ends at 2:30 in the afternoon. During this time I'm usually opening boxes or moving cans  to be placed on pallets. I'm constantly on my feet, and carrying product distances up to 20ft. "
good,"Use to be a great place to work things change as people do. Really liked working their have learned alot over the years, great people hopefully will have the opertunity again."
good,"The job has good pay and good benefits. The negative is that there are too many down weeks (weeks where employees are not working), so sometimes its not a very dependable/stable job, doesn't provide a stable dependable income."
good,This job was exciting for me because i meet really great people and i learned a lot since it was a multi-taskful environment.. i learned quickly from desk to desk.. began at the outbound .. proceeded to delivered loads.. it was very few people in office but we were like a family..
good,Typical workday boring if your a introvert good for you. But for extroverts terrible what I learned how to palletize how to be extremely bored doing the same exact thing over and over again management is garbage. The hardest part of the job is staying awake. The most enjoyable part of the job break time
good,"Good pay and benefits.  Management was ok.  Some were really cool, others stab you in the back so they get their ""golden tickets"".  Plant closed in December 2015.  Nothing in the building since except a patio furniture place."
good,As a temp you are treated horribly and do most of the cleaning and heavy lifting. All the while the actual employees get to sit around and watch a screen.
good,6 week shift rotation every 6 weeks you will have to move shifts so u will never be on a regular scheduled shift. From morning til night. And the pay is awful
good,"Work every weekend. Money is good. Management constantly changes, they all have their own agenda.New department head every two years. You see your co workers more than your family"
good,Foodservice region managers vary greatly and too many of them are poor managers. They tell you to do things differently than what corporate tells you to do.  Most of them haven’t sold a biscuit in years and don’t understand commercial operators and the need for decent pricing.
good,"I was fired from my job while I was off work sick.i got sick ended up in the hospital.had to learn now to walk,talk,cook and clean again.and I was fired while I was sick.they told me to reapply when I was healthy.i did that and they never replied back or return my phone calls."
good,When I started there were 33 pple on shift plus 1 supervisor per shift running 2 lines.  5 yrs later there were 22 pple per shift and only 1st shift had a supervisor running 3 seperate lines.
good,A challenging place to work. Not much chance for going beyond the production floor jobs. Compensation was good but some in  management didn't put the well-being of workers above production.
good,"Great place to start a career to meet some very great people and make life long professional connections that will be sure to jump start a career."
good,Job is awesome if you're only looking for a job. Not a place to consider for career. This was a temporary type of work when I was working there. Things may be different now. I learned a lot and picked up extra skills
good,Good place. I really do not have much to say i just want to look for a job but i have to fill out this stupid thing with one hundred and fifty letters wth.
good,General Mills is a great place to work as long as you start right out of college. I would not recommend to a seasoned professional. GM gives you the opportunity to learn many different roles and move to multiple locations if you desire.
good,"Pros:"
good,Muy buen lugar de trabajo pero debido al poco cumplimiento de normas establecidas por casa matriz el negocio no podía ser rentable ni llegar a los objetivos planteados.
good,"Have to follow US Shift timings - 1530 HRS - 0030 HRS"
good,Good compny.Been around a long time. Excellent products. Easy to promote to the customer. I liked that I made my own schedule just as long as I made my schedule and completed my region.
good,Hot as when your outside fun coworkers have to work at a very fast past some lines you have to work with heavy boxes some days your line will do rework from other orders
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar."
good,"This is a great job as far as pay goes but everything in the building is old. The system is outdated, the forklifts are raggedy and all the management have NEVER WORKED IN THE WAREHOUSE BEFORE. they have a bunch of airheads with degrees running the building and don't have a clue what they are doing. Everything there is just slow. Your doing multiple jobs at once. For example, I was hired as a forklift operator but they had me picking, staging, replenishing, put away, inventory, cleaning and so much more. They need better management and a better system."
good,Overall it is a great place to work especially if you have a family. Management switches WAY too much and bad managers are very easy to come by. Little/no advancement opportunities as a technician.
good,Excellent job in a manufacturing plant and paid well. good great awesome loud clean happy wonderful repetitive nice wow almost done filling characters
good,"Produits très intéressant à présenter dans les épiceries, très bonne clientèle d'établie, toujours des ventes répétitives de produits mais beaucoup d'annonce circulaire pour appuyer les ventes.  Budget pour le bill back à offrir aux clients, très avantageux pour les gérants.  Trop grand territoire, et beaucoup de kilométrage.Objectifs réussis depuis le début (2 ans) à 100%."
good,I enjoyed working there . if they have temp to hire then i would go back . And if they hire felons that do not have theft should have a chance to get hired .
good,"General Mills is a good place to work but, the only thing about it is the time you are at work the schedule of 13 days on 1 day off gives you no time  left to spend with your family.  This schedule basically gives you two days off a month by the time you get your day off you are so physically tired that your day off more times than not are spent sleeping or just being lazy.  If they would come up with a better work schedule it would be an awesome place to work. Family is important to me and I felt it did not matter to upper management.  All salary management had every weekend off so this schedule did not affect their everyday life if they had to work the same schedule as hourly employees they would soon see what we all have worked for years."
good,"6 months of training, on the machine. When the machine goes down you fix the problem or call maintains. The hardest part of the job is getting along with different peoples attitudes and how to read a person when they are having a good day or bad day. Knowing when to stay away or jump in and help others."
good,"Everything is going downhill! That's all I can say! But if you need benefits, great deal for ya!  They promote people with little to no qualifications.  Also they have no idea what they are supposed to do in their job, while the workers still have to deal with them and they try to make up rules and regulations to make themselves look better."
good,"When I started with the company, it was easy to fall in love with the benefits and culture. After more then 10 years and 3 rounds of layoffs in the last 6 years, morale is down and the shine is gone. Leaders are more concerned with the bottom line than making employees feel like they matter. You are a desk with tasks, not a person."
good,"The job itself is great, but poor management and workers make the job hard.  You're constantly cleaning (2-3 times a week).  Working here means no social life because you're working every other weekend which doesn't include days when you have to work 12 hrs."
good,I accepted a job with General Mills Inc. because it was close to home and I was tired of traveling and working insane hours. I still work the insane hours but I'm closer to my family.
good,"Good company. Management do not recognize talent. They have there way of promoting people. If you are a chosen one then you will move in the company. If you express your opinion, you are doomed forever."
good,"Forced overtime hours, flexible, fast changing  work environment. Food plant with all cons and pros. Lots of change overs, cleaning(sanitation), stressful work load and fast changing work environment."
good,"over all a good work place, good people to work with."
good,"I am in a 24 month program, encompassing three different job descriptions. The first year I was a System Engineer for the Fruit Shapes Processing/Packaging system.  I was a technical resource for the system proving support with troubleshooting, downtime, and goal setting.  I initiated productivity saving projects, and did loss time analysis to justify capital expense.  I also worked with the maintenance and operational leaders to guide future improvement plans on the system.  I helped lead packaging plant tests and the refresh/ initiation of two production SKU's.  Since May 2015, I have been working on third shift as a Operational Team Leader.  As a team leader on third shift, I manage the people,the machinery along with packaging commitments.  My primary systems are Fruit by the Foot and Fruit Roll ups, additionally I can provide support for our Flex packaging lines, Gushers, and Shapes systems.  I support my teams, by being a liaison to first shift resources and as a direct resource for issues that occur on my shift. I am responsible for changeovers that occur on my shift, ensuring we hit our packaging commitments, and I also schedule the operators nightly. Additionally, I motivate my teams to hit high performance and safety goals."
good,"It used to be a great place to work. However, two major reorganization projects have left a substantial trust gap between management and individual contributors. Unfortunately, it is no longer fun to go in everyday."
good,"hardest part of the job is having being responsibile for the actions of those that do not report to you"
good,"General Mills is a good place to learn about how fortune 500 companies work, to see there good areas and there bad."
good,"easy work, pay is very weak and co workers are very funny or hard to work with"
good,Good job just the 12 hours seem forever to come and go and the part of only getting 33hours per week I didn't like. I think if we are full time then we should at least get 40 years a week. But the job was really easy and the co worker were really nice and friendly and also they supervisor was too.
good,I help make the filling that the pizza rolls arte made with. I sometimes run the machine that makes the rolls.
good,Great people to work with in the shop and around the plant.
good,"I worked there as a temp from staffing  agencie , never had opportunity to become permanent as General  Mills does not hire there temps as I was led to believe by the staffing agencie."
good,Good Company with parent company support. Culture is good.  Cross functional opportunity and external connect.  Scope to do varied activities for relevant aspects
good,"The company offers great benefits. you get 120 hours of vacation in the doors. Benefits start the very first day, this includes 401k and health insurance."
good,"While working the assembly line at General Mills, I had to work at a certain pace and make sure all of the packages I Received weren’t damaged and were the right weight before putting them onto the pallets to be shipped to the stores"
good,"Great job, fun people , just needed different hours , easy to catch on and easy to move up if desired , overall I would recommend it to people looking for a factory job ."
good,"Lugar bom de trabalhar, ambiente agradável com pessoas profissionais.Aprendi que o trabalho em equipe é essencial para uma boa produção."
good,Overall great place to work. Management is the problem in this factory. They are to concerned with production numbers and being the first innovation plant that they have lost sight on what's really important. They don't think things through or properly plan. Benefits were decent. Time off was fair. This factory is a union factory.
good,"You will work a lot of overtime. The job/life balance is non existent.  You will work 6-7 days a week, with one day off throughout the week. The pay is not bad for the area."
good,Learning New experience to add to my resume. That qualifies me for new jobs. Also prepared me for new work challenges. Also the ability to work 12 Hour shifts.
good,Heavy favoritisms for certain employees willing to kiss the managers butt! Long hours but decent pay and rotating schedules make it difficult to have a home life
good,La calidad de los productos falicitan su comercializacion
good,"just didn't like it, I am a female and it was a lot of males that was in competition and the other half was lazy. I didn't get in recognition for doing a great job. especially as a female."
good,"work on the line with others to get the job done."
good,I would run different machines and how to watch for bad product the management was really nice the work place was kind of stressful was standing to long in one place at the end of the shift you took paperwork down to shipping
good,"General Mills is an upbeat place that focused on improving how they work and investing in their people. There is a strong connection to the brands, which provides connection for employees."
good,"A empresa boa tem excelentes profissionais,e uma grande empresa."
good,"Empresa onde cresci muito profissionalmente, com um ótimo ambiente de trabalho. Visa muito a segurança do funcionário."
good,"The internship itself was fine. Learned a lot, but didn't love the culture. Absolutely zero diversity, so people of color are made to feel like outsiders."
good,"General Mills had competitive pay and benefits but lacked time off. Your life was your job and it could quickly become draining. It was also difficult to communicate with higher management, leaving serious issues unfixed. Timelines for 3rd shift could be stressful but possible to complete through teamwork."
good,The younger crowd kinda messed the job up for me I don’t like when other don’t act there age but other than that it’s a cool company just don’t plan on getting a raise
good,Company overall a good one to work for. Upper management strategies are hard to understand with work culture suffering as a result. Company performance also on the decline.
good,Must have the ability to communicate with other people. You want to communicate with the employee who was doing the job before you started your shift. Get an update on what to look out for and how production is running.
good,"The most enjoyable part I liked the most was learning new people everyday and being able to communicate with them, interact with them, and get to know each other."
good,Good job with good benefits. Lacks off time and career advancement. Typically only off 2 to 3 days a month. Union based business that offers no opportunities to advance and learn new skills.
good,"The people at General Mills are some of the most amazing coworkers I have had the chance to work with, with positive and friendly people across the departments. However, with the plateau of CPG in the marketplace, the company is in a tough position to raise market share, so a company that was once able to fill all 3 floors of its Canadian office can now fit everyone onto one floor. The expectation is for everyone to take their work home with them in order to complete their daily tasks, which leads to a hard work/life balance."
good,"I think General Mills is well rounded company , because it’s job anyone could do. The managers were very respectful towards the workers, and not just coming to work to get paid, they actually get to know the employees."
good,"I'm working with Role outsourcing so not yet had chance to work directly with main company. But with whole the time I worked in, that is big company with many opportunities."
good,Must manage your time well due to the pace.  Management is very separated and doesn't pay close attention to employees.  Every project is behind before it even begins.
good,"Wonderful team with opportunities for growth.  The working space is open, bright, friendly, and flexible.  There is a focus on diversity and development."
good,"General Mills is very fast-paced, you have to be paying close attention to the products at all times. You have to wait for someone to take your place on the line before you go to breaks or leave."
good,The whole experience was fun and I enjoyed the work place the people and the envirment..it was great.The only part with the downfall was lack of work then came the layoffs.
good,"There are plenty of job/roles within General Mills, some of which include documentation, weigher, table, case loader and so on. There are typically 3 rotations throughout the shift, so nobody is ever in the same place twice. Even in cases where we have ""down time"", which simply means we aren't currently running product, there is still plenty to do, whether it's sweeping the floors, throwing away scrap that has been sitting out too long and/or general tidying and maintenance in the meantime. The job itself wasn't bad at all, but many of the temporary employees, myself included, felt it unfair to be making only $10/hr. whereas full-time employees were making around $15-$16/hr. For folks like myself, $10/hr. and being the only income is/are not livable wages. Perhaps if a 2nd income were a factor, then any one person would have been able to afford a living, hence why many thought it unfair. The work was never too difficult, but it did keep me on my toes and even caused some stress from time to time. Overall, working at General Mills was a different and unique experience and had its ups and downs, as all jobs do."
good,Uma boa empresa para trabalhar. Com oportunidade de crescimento e um bom ambiente de trabalho.
good,Not much different between other large companies I've worked for.  Very similar in structure and responsibilities.  They spend too much time trying to justify what went wrong instead of fixing the problems.
good,Lack of clear direction from upper management. Every Monday you could come in and there could be a new direction. Leadership does not have a clue on how to run a successful company in today's day and age. They continue to operate as if it is the 1980's. The market is constantly changing and General Mills continues to chase opportunities based on competitors successful verse adopting a forward looking mindset and anticipating what is next.
good,essa empresa e boa de trabalhar mais nao tem muita chance de crescimento na empresa
good,You get out of working here exactly what you put into it.  Advancement is few and far between if you are looking to advance into a management or quality position but it is still good work.
good,I feel that they lacked training and the supervisors did not push and watch for safety concerns.  They would promote people that did not follow the safety protocol.
good,"It was a good place to work,but the hours and pay were not good. It is a fast, intense work environment as well.It was difficult for me because there was a lot of heavy lifting and standing involved."
good,"empresa com ótima cultura, e clima controlado. "
good,The Buffalo plant is not very progressive with today’s employees. Time off is not flexible and the work is not delegated fairly. Different rules for different departments.
good,Free environment to learn and implement knowledge gained through various training's. Provide assistance to complete tasks. Employees get chance to participate in various activities other than regular work.
good,I would recommend some people to work for them if they are fine with standing and doing the same motions everyday.  It is a full time Job and the management is good.
good,"Pleasant co-workers, friendly work place. Job is demanding if you are not use to picking orders.Management can be difficult at times, they are under pressure at times to make sure numbers are being met."
good,"Very Competitive production staff but most willing to help out with big problems."
good,"working at general mills was a normal pace environment. the management was well in order.  people in there were friendly.there are 2 things that i didn't like,the break some times be cut short due to every where that has to break. the other one is if they dont have enough work for you they will send you home"
good,they shut the doors and left everyone unemployed so they could get bigger bonuses. They also told us that it was a family oriented company ant that they would do the right thing all the time.
good,Ideal para comenzar como vendedor en consumo masivo y continuar una carrera
good,"Provided payroll and HR support for the offices and production facilities Canada wide.  At the time my employment completed, the payroll department was in transition to the company's U.S. office."
good,"Left company due to the commute.  There was many opportunities at General Mills."
good,It's culture is not equipped to cope up with the fast-pace landscape of the food sector. There is dire need to change the organizational structure of the firm and hire fresh blood.
good,En esta empresa me capacite mucho sobre sobre GMP y TPM.
good,"I would never work out here again,  due to low hours . I like factory work but didn't like general mills.  I would like to get into a factory thought. I have open options at this point."
good,General Mills is a Place where alof of experience come I. If you have none going in working here you get a CDL package stocker or maybe a management position it's a great place to work if your interested in factory work
good,"Work Culture- Great "
good,The plant is closing so i will be out of a job soon but it was a nice place to work and meet new people. The hours were ok and the pay was great.
good,"Company culture is supportive of its employees and their development. Significant organizational changes have happened over the past few years and are continuing to occur, causing strain within the company as the changes are defined/understood. Employees can grow within the company, but must primarily drive the efforts themselves. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team to achieve results, and make products that are on shelves worldwide. The hardest part of the job is the work pace and requirements, and adjusting to the multiple company direction changes."
good,"Enjoyed working at General Mills. Good people, efficient and hard working. They have a great campus. Staff is open and kind and promotes a strong work ethic."
good,"Not stable work load, production planning can be  changing a lot in short time notice, many times per a month or even per a week. Stressful and demanding work environment. Low profession mid range management stressing the system and people."
good,"It was fun being able to intern with General Mills and see our projects go from ideas in our head to actual products on the plate. I like how much free reign they gave us with our project, I wish we had not had to sign away rights to our ideas though..."
good,"Working for this company was a good experience,because it showed how well u can work with others at a fast pace.The only problem was the pay for third shift was not enough."
good,"They don't recognize my contribution to the company."
good,It was a great place to work at.the hours were good.there where three sifts.Not a bad place to work.the building was climate controlled which is always a good thing.At the end of the month the employers would have a food give away.
good,Could be great place to work but human resource manager an idiot and low-life. General Mills would never replace him. All sub-level management and employees felt the same.Great people to work with and enjoyed my 26 years there.
good,the company made me feel good about the sanitary of there products. I would eat any of there products just because I have worked there and know how strict they are.
good,"the whole day is planned"
good,"Muita publicidade e funcionários atualmente desmotivados que não acreditam em seus valores. Precisa investir mais no preventivo, pois, assume muitos riscos desnecessários, por conta de decisões vindas da diretoria. Diretores vivem no mundo da fantasia do Market Place e happy hours, enquanto deveriam estar mais próximo do mundo real, ""chão de fábrica"" e administrativo efetivo."
good,A typical day at work is stacking boxes of General Mills products. Must have lots of agility. Management is good. Just do your job.
good,Difficult management to work for in family run plant. Many infractions by management covered up. Employees treated with much disrespect and harassment.
good,"chances são poucas para crescimento dentro da empresa, pouco aprendizado,falta espaço,"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is troubleshooting issues with the ammonia or utilities systems.  The plant is large enough that there is always something to challenge you every day.
good,"Nice work place,got along with everybody,clean and simple,management was nice and respectful I would recommend this job to anyone"
good,Worked for over 5 years in the DC. Overall great atmosphere. Great pay and benefits. Unfortunately they are closing my plant.
good,on a typical day at work I would build boxes for different kinds of cereal. we had three breaks every 3 hours . sometimes the machines would break down and we could have the option to leave work early or stay to clean up spilled cereal in certain areas.

good,"Machine Operator/Supervisor"
good,"The day-to-day at General Mills is quite pleasant.  Great work/life balance, exceptionally talented people and a great campus.  Although this is great, it is difficult to get promoted and truly take your career into your own hands."

good,"The day goes by very fast because of the non-stop work."
good,"I really enjoy working with great brands and great people."
good,Involved organization of shipment pallets to various store chains in the US
good,"producing cereal and snacks, i learned how to set up the machines"
good,12 hour days hard labor long standing. Its a factory job so you need steel toe boots.
good,"Come into work go over paperwork, morning announcements and roll call burns anywhere from 10-20 minutes off my first hour. Gives other orders to do myself while working on my actual project with my line. general labor pays $9 max and Line leads make $9.50 max."

good,* Getting good technical exposure
good,Working with people that are very easy to approach. I feel that my co-workers are friendly and very diligent. They will lend a hand whenever its necessary. I enjoy working around those that have a dilgent mind set.
good,"I would rather not give my opinion on this topic,"
good,"I will say, if overtime in my position was more strict I would quit, however, at this moment in time the money is the only thing that makes this job bearable. In my current position as a Technologist advancement is difficult and next to impossible. You're better off leaving the company and then coming back if you really want to move up. I think once you get to a certain level, then more opportunities become available, however, until you reach a particular plateau you might as well be dirt."
good,I enjoyed my time there for the most part but the culture there was very inconsistent and biased....there were sometimes unrealistic expectations placed on employees with management but the pay is worth the hassle I can honestly say depending on what your job title is
good,very fast paced and overtime opportunity is excellant. job can be fun running forklifts. The employees are all working together. Work force was grear to work with
good,Consumers and the business are changing and company is struggling to adapt. Seemed to be cutting back in wrong places--eg: too many layoffs. Need better LONG TERM strategy as every decision lately seems way too short-sighted.
good,"Industria alimentícia, agradável de trabalhar."
good,"This is a great place to work for people with a family where work is not your #1 priority in life right now.  There is little to no incentive to work hard, so people don't unless they are trying for an impossible to attain promotion that takes forever.  "

good,I learned how to keep up pace in how to package things using different machines I normally never used. Its a friendly nice fast working getting the job done type of environment.
good,"There is a good work life balance in most parts of the company. Culture has declined over the years with multiple rounds of layoffs and stagnant growth in its products. Still good opportunities to advance in the company, but you have to be willing to play the politics to move quickly."
good,"Not a bad place to work, just wasn't the right fit for me. Almost all of their categories are in decline yet they still have outrageous growth targets year after year."
good,General Mills is a huge company. I worked with Pillsbury that was acquired by GM. It was not a good experience. GM is a solid retail company with little knowledge in food service.
good,"Management emphasizes team work then favors the people that do not have any work ethic, they push off work for those people onto people who are doing their job and can't keep up doing there own job."
good,Management friendly and patient.  Very educational with you moving to different stations you broaden your skill set.  Breaks very short and low pay.
good,This job was pretty fun. The workers made the job worth it. Management was amazing. They tried you on many different jobs so they can see where you fit great. Hardest part was learning something new everyday.
good,"Like many large food manufacturers, the company is at a cross roads. Still led by management that has steered the business into stagnation. The company must find a way to reshape it's portfolio to once again become relevant to consumers."
good,"Leaderless, attention to detail lost as cutbacks are occurring, losing a successful culture of people development, changes needed to happen but its taking its toll"
good,Over all General Mills is a great company with strong cross-functional teams and a wonderful culture. The only area the company could use some help in is maintaining employee diversity.
good,"*Buscamos antes de que acabara el mes cubrir con la cuota asignada"
good,"Great work environment for motivated team players. The hardest part about working here is you can't find job security on the hourly 40 bases as often as you may like. However, you can take advantage of learning more than one warehouse work environment skill set."
good,I liked my job and I was a great worker and now just wanted to change my job and my career
good,Good place to work.Never a dull moment. Very small spaces in the departments. Have to be very cautious when operating equiptment.Management very friendly. Nothing have about the job. Going to work everyday was very enjoyable.
good,"Very fast paced company. I learned how to work my way up the technical ladder from hard work analyzing samples in the lab using various laboratory techniques, then worked in method development for short time before being asked to manage the HPLC and GC labs.  I worked with many types of personalities all with the same goal - completing our responsibilities on time and to the best of standards."
good,The people you work for are great depending on which team u are on .
good,"Working the production line, long hours and mandatory overtime."
good,Good company to work for straight out of school. Slow advancement due to backlog of employees at higher positions.
good,"Nice place to work, especially if you are a younger person. They offer a variety of jobs for young people, non married, and willing to move. I find it very difficult to move up due to the fact that i can not relocate. So basically i am stuck."
good,Empresa dinâmica ótima para trabalhar. Salário e benefícios bons.
good,Exceptional opportunity for entry level employees to learn the business and advance quickly.  Several different roles that can be explored.  Expectations are not alway clear.

good,"Working at general mills was a fast paced environment that consisted of grabbing large boxes and making them into stands, but the management was poor and didn't treat others equal."
good,"Unless you work first shift, you’ll never have a life outside of work. Great pay, great coworkers. Temps were a bit of a hassle at times but when they were good they were great. The constant turnover of leadership and management was the main headache as there was no consistency in regime or agenda."
good,"Mostly a good experience, though it seemed they did have thier clicks of workers they ""liked"" and those they didnt, didn't see a whole lot of room to advance."
good,Good job and good benefits. Not a bad place to work everybody gets along and works together to get the job done. If you love to work they give great overtime and plenty of ways to advance.
good,"One of the good company i had worked."
good,Very hierarchical company that manages in a very serious and closed minded way. There are many 'life longers' and they tend to be closed to change. Very insecure about perception. Meetings before the meetings. Slow to make changes. Buearocracy. Leadership is not very approachable.
good,It's really good environment to work and there everyone work as a Team. The people are very supportive and guides for any new work. The quality of work is very good and we get a lot of new things to learn.
good,"Fast passed.  Technical community is very good. Food market is very changing constantly and big food companies struggle to meet demands of ""non-processed foods""."
good,Gen Mills India Pvt Ltd is a good company from learning standpoint as no hierarchy is maintained across all levels. Right from an executive to a director level person is well approachable.
good,A great company as far as pay and benefits are concerned but don't expect to feel valued.  General mills has shut down several plants last year so I'm not sure about job security.
good,Really good safety classes and learning abilities. Co workers are very friendly and helpful.  Easy work loads. Multiple job opportunities.
good,"* Good Organization in learning and development."
good,"Good job, but need to be hired on through the company for good pay. Clean place. Good work environment. Has three shifts. Typical work day goes by pretty fast."
good,"Strong company. Great people.  Probably overstaffs for the roles in terms of horsepower.  Can be difficult to navigate the highly political culture.  There is a career path but its adherence is often subject to ""business needs"""
good,General Mills has good benefits and pay rates but the room for advancement is very limited. They give you more vacation time than most companies but you are forced to use it during downtime in order to maintain a 40 hour paycheck.
good,"General Mills provides a good work life balance. I learnt a lot of softwares like essbase, SAP, etc. "
good,"en este caso ya que es una empresa grande, los dia tipico y ya con algunos meses experiencia de  produccion (trabajo) los dia pasa ser rutinario. se aprende a convivir con los compañeros ya que el fin de todos es tener un tiempo de trabajo agradable y terminar bien la jornada. la parte dificil pasa cuando un compañero  les asignan o les ofrecen  un puesto mas.  ahi la convivencia tiende a no estar bien. lo bueno es que siempre hay mucho por aprender y eso esta en cada uno si le gusta el trabajo, o el tiempo que estee en el mismo.."
good,They need to give more technical training. I have learned alot about computers and computer operated equipment. I still have trouble with trouble shooting some equipment. It is a very clean and neat place to work.
good,It’s OK it’s not a bad job you spend a lot of your time at work I want to make some overtime environment is pretty clean in the people that’s pretty coolManagement is understanding about things and then I will be willing to help you with certain things

good,"- Amazing people around"
good,"boa empresa de trabalho, multinacional de grande porte"
good,Place was crowded & mostly busy. The people there were cool. I had no problems with anyone.. well a couple people. it always smelled good on the factory line. when you needed help someone was there most of the time to assist you.
good,Good company to work with. Better work culture and fun environment than other companies in the industry.
good,"An average food company."
good,General Mills values individual development. It is a relationship-based company that emphasizes work-life balance. It is a big-company environment where it is difficult to efficently take action. The levels of management are complex and difficult to navigate.
good,"General mills is a good work place. It pays very well and its very laid back. All you do  drive around the warehouse to the location it shows you on the forklift screen, go pick up whatever you need than go drop it off at the new location."
good,In a factory its far different to normal everyday work. in a typical factory like this has a fun environment you can let your hair down and just be your self plenty of fun while doing your job colleges are also fun but also helpful.
good,"It was very fast paced, and was a good stable job to work at. It was ok pay. You basically picked the products and packed them into displays for companies."
good,"Great work/life balance and the company rewards loyalty. If you are looking for a fast track or challenging work environment, GMI is not the place for you. Like most large CPG companies, very bureaucratic and a set career path."
good,They were very good at listing to what I had to offer them.Also they were very interested in me because of my leadership skills and my eagerness to get started to work for them.
good,"operated machines from the mix room, running raw dough through the rolling process to a finished product ready for shipment to the customer."
good,"I enjoyed working for General Mills. I wish the training was a little better, I felt like they just threw me into the position and decided to see if I would sink or swim."
good,"Um bom local para se trabalhar, com ótimos benefícios,  a direção, gerência e RH são péssimos quando o assunto se trata dos funcionários, mas fora isso, é uma boa empresa!"
good,"A typical day at work is when the boxes & bags come shooting down the line. Then we will have to get them all before they pass us up. I learned how to run the machine. Management was good. My "
good,General Mills has very employee friendly culture. Always welcome new and innovative ideas. You always get to learn something new everyday. Best thing about working in GM is to access to new and useful services  and tools.They always push themselves to be one step ahead of competitiors
good,I was a contractor who was treated very well by General Mills.  Great work environment and people.
good,"Was a good job, then more and more companes got consolidated and hours got cut. used to be able to support yourself and pay bills on the job, to a bonus job for extra SPEnding cash"
good,I would work with a team of 4 to 10 special packers to ready food for shipment. The management and supervisors were very unorganized and did not treat employees under them very well. The hardest part of the job was loading box cars from the bottom to the top. I didnt enjoy the job at all. It was very low pay.
good,General mills was one of the best jobs i had in years its flexible. Its an easy job i had. Fun at the same time .. Management is great love the way we worked our butts off
good,There is a major problem with the culture there. Everybody is always in a bad mood. There is almost always overtime. I routinely worked 60-80 hours a week.
good,The managers are fresh out of college with no real world experience. All the floor workers are lazy and will not help you if you need it.
good,"Pros"
good,"Cooking,Cleaning, outing tasks like grocery shopping,meals etc. Combing hair doing  nails. Taking walks setting outside. Playing games making it feel like home and being comfortable"
good,I had the chance to assist with processing documents and reports related to importing raw material for their food products. It was my first contract job after university.
good,"It's a easy job. not much to it. But they are laying off a lot now, and I like to WORK. So i'm looking else where. I made pizzas and pizza rolls, drove forklift, worked in all different departments of the plant. Love to learn."
good,Working at general mills and kraft was a ok job at first i was getting hors then it slowed down alot.
good,Era muito bom mas sentia que poderia melhorar muitos por conta que lá ele dão dão valor aos funcionários somos só números e não pessoas pra eles...
good,"I was not a permanent hire on, i was hired through a temp agency. I mostly enjoyed the people I worked with. Sometimes the job was monotonous. It is a somewhat demanding job, depending on what position you occupy."
good,I worked at General Mills through a temp agency and was contracted for a year. Working at General Mills was a fast paced job but was not stressful. I enjoyed working with my coworkers but felt management at the temp agency did not appreciate their employees.
good,"As a CPG company with heavy dependency of the US market, General Mills has struggle over the last 5 years to bring value to the American Consumers. "
good,"You always knew your coworkers had your back. One giant working family, always there to pick you up on down days. Always rallied when a coworker needed help outside of work."
good,"Seasonal Job, long hours, good money, fast work pace good people to work with. No benefits when seasonal. Work towards becoming full time. Pros and cons."
good,"Non climate controlled always busy, fast paced, fun."
good,I worked therea year. The pay was good but the hours suck. You were there more then at home. And everyone there does nothing but gossip and take smoke breaks. Most of the team leads are great but the bad ones were horrid!
good,It was an alright place to work. Management was friendly. The only issue I had was that they only allowed part time employees to remain there for 90 days.
good,"Overall GMI is a lean running company with a lot to do in most leadership roles, so lots of hours at work not much for home. Great for younger upwardly trending folks, not so good for those with families."
good,I worked inside of the welcome center where I will greet and sign in visitors. I also signed in truck drivers and gave them directions to there loads. check and send email and answer phone calls. direct visitors to there destinations.
good,"Working for General Mills Food Service helped me understand all of the marketing aspects and the importance of the consultant aspect of selling to clients. This position helped me build a mindset that there's always a way to position yourself and present your firm in an appropriate manner to whatever kind of client that we encounter in our careers. It may not be that first time in front of that client that brings us success; but, seeing that persistence along with having a plan will always gain the win in the long term.  And, in the end...Your Client sees that its a win-win for him, as well."
good,"Very busy and focused work environment, given opportunity to showcase your skill set and lead other projects. Workplace culture laxed and friendly. Enjoyed summer hours."
good,Uma boa pessoa pra trabahar en equipe responsavel disponibilidade de horario manha e tarde.
good,"ok pay,poor management,good benifits, co workers usualy have bad attitude due to working harder than they should have to for the pay they recieve,shorthanded,and mismanaged.managers newere rotatated every year or so...revolving door so to speak. to much time spent in meeting to inform manager what is going on with the work load."
good,If you like walking many miles in one night this is the job for you!  People are nice and i worked in the recycling department and it was very physical but i enjoy it.
good,"A typical day at work would involve working a assembly line for multiple hours on foot"
good,"Need to focus on task at hand, and not so much on being best friends. better teamwork and communication needed. Mange people calling off better."
good,When I worked there it was mandatory 7 days a week and we had to either request the weekend off (rules established team members to give each an opportunity) or use a vacation day.
good,"Company policies are in a constant state of flux. Be ready to adapt to new policies every month. That being said, the pay is great and the benefits are some of the best around. Work life balance seems to be getting better with new policies being implemented. These new policies will limit the amount of overtime employees can work. Easy job as long as you are willing to do manual labor."
good,"I didn,t actually work for general mills i technically worked for remedy staffing.  The job duties included but were not limited to palletizing boxes of product for shipment, filling out paper work and cleaning."
good,"I like the work because was repetitive and I was well trained, the co-worker most of them were temporary just like me. I was working about 3 days and I did like it."
good,My experience there went pretty well. Reason for leaving is because the plant is shutting down next year. Some pretty nice people there some what family oriented.
good,"Really fast pace. they give you assignments that make it impossible to meet the quota bonus. The number of picks are "
good,"They do not care that life happens. Once they feel you have violated company policies they do not blink an eye and your job is over. I was never explained the company policies, how to clock in properly or even where my work area would be and how to even get there. And due to not using the proper procedures they fired me without even giving me a chance or an opportunity to join another training class. When I tried to communicate after the fact (was let go at 2:30am) and explained I had 72hrs to fight it through the H.E.A.RT. program a week after several calls HR finally contacted me, was short, rude and never even let me ask what I needed to do with my uniforms. I was also given a cashier's check back that I have yet to be able to refund. And they did not care! I was very disappointed because it could be an awesome well beneficial company to work for. I would have been a loyal, and hard working employee. If I had known the proper policies or even my supervisor or leads names! All of it could have been avoided."
good,Working at this company has been a great experience. I still work for General Mills but I want to transfer to another state. I have been busy with my life and my job has been a blessing from the Lord. I really like this company and the people I work with.
good,"I started my career with GMI.  It gave me a lot of background in the CPG world and gave me foothold on everything from sales to logistics to demand planning.  Eventually most careers peak due to the competivness at the company, but it's a great starting point."
good,"Quite the mix of blue collar and white collar workers. Quick paced, lots of action, hard working employees. Lots of overnight workers who are very sleep deprived!"
good,We work 6 sometimes 7 days a week.  Insurance is good. Retirement is getting better with the 401k now being offered.  It takes about 5-7 years to get to first shift.
good,"It was a great place to work! We got great benefits including dental, medical, and vision. It was a safe place to work and the people are great! If I wasn’t moving I would stay at the company."
good,Easy job. We rotated jobs throughout the day to make it less boring. Friendly staff and management. The hardest part of the job was working the taller conveyer belt since I'm short but supervisor was able to accommodate for me.
good,"Empresa ótima para trabalhar, porém alguns funcionários não aceitam que pessoas novas entrem e façam seu trabalho da forma q eles fazem assim criam um grupo de pessoas com mais tempo de empresa formam um grupo onde os novatos praticamente não são aceitos de qualquer forma a pessoa tem q se esforçar ao máximo e mesmo assim ganha descriminação"
good,a typical day at general mills would consist of me making sure my line was up and running efficiently with no problems.  I learned a lot about how to operate big machinery to produce a product.  The hardest part of the job was fixing some of the problems that could occur on the line.
good,"There really was no life outside of the job. There were many weeks that I worked nearly 90 hours in a single week, leaving time to go home and sleep before reporting back to work."
good,"typical day of getting up 430 producing high volume of products."
good,I enjoyed this job. people where nice management was good. only problem I had was lost transportation so wasn't able to get there. overall I enjoyed the job a lot.
good,"Um dia Tipico era um dia calmo, os colegas eram muito legais e animados,"
good,"I used to think the corporate head quarters leadership cared about the Vineland employees, until they announced they were closing our plant last July as of this August of 2017.I now feel we were used and penalized for being a union shop and the cost of operating in New Jersey so they are moving all soup operations to Hannibal MO.They had a commercial stating Vineland home of Progresso and all about the companyies roots. Then Close us instead of Hannibal Plant"
good,"I would come in have my job task for the day."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buena infraestructura, horario flexible"
good,"Not for the feint of heart because it's fast pace with constant repetitive movement,  but because I work as many hours as I wanted most times it was a good place for me to be at the time."
good,"Management is inept at best, they hire kids fresh out of college with no experience or knowledge of equipment and its workings to manage employees who have been there for a lifetime for most. Creates disrespectful and hostile environment at times. They have a run until failure mentality which makes PM's a thing of the past and creates down time, which the company throws back in the employees face and says they need to cut costs while increasing them by not following general PM procedures regularly or fixing problems before they become disasters. Most employees have been there 30 plus years and are disgruntled and talk constantly about how it used to be......"
good,loading and unloading trailers. alot of my friends are my co-workers
good,Its good to work there everyone treats you well.its a nice place and its not hard to find. Its not to bad of a drive. Its easy to get a brown hat there.
good,Position held was in a region office.  Over all a great and well known company. Many employees are harvested right out of college and provided promise of a lifetime career. Most difficult part of job was lack of collaboration. A lot of turn over.
good,I had a nice expérience at Général Mills. A typical day in a fast paced environnement. Stacking product for shipping. Making sure product is scanned accuratly. I Learned how to troubleshoot and reset computer also. I also learned how to package product and weight and inspect product for shipping.
good,Right now I'm looking for something that's going to be maybe 50 hours a week job security and the commute is not so far also something that's going to have job security so I can take care of my family responsibilities

good,Need to update machinery so things can run smooth. Supervisor there need more customer service skills and learn how to deal with the employees they hired.
good,Easy work. The environment can be cold and wet depending on which station. Long breaks. great culture. management was okay. hard working long hours in freezer.
good,"Company policies are bent to work out in the favor of the tenured employees. Company policies are not followed, and everyone does not receive the same type of treatment."
good,Good place to work and has nice people on your team. It’s a team work environment and they help others.  As long as you go in to the job with a positive attitude you will have a great day and love the work...
good,"General Mills is a nice place to work but it was a long term temporary assignment with no growth opportunities. I was punctual, professional and ready to grow with the company."
good,"Good job! unfortunately, You are role structured... meaning you are hired for that job with little or now room for advancement.  Management is rotational-Corporate puts recent college grads in management roles with little or no knowledge of wholesale/retail grocery business.  I had 9 supervisors in 11 years!  Great work life balance as you are remote and work from home.  Good benefits"
good,It is decent company to work for. I wouldn't recommend it for young starters though as the culture is too light and you might feel that it is same things you are doing over and over again for long time. For experienced professionals it is good but not great in terms of career advancement. The management team could be really slow at times and ruthless too.
good,It was apparent while I was there that males got preferential treatment. They were given jobs before the rest of us knew they were available. Several people were the pets and got everything.
good,"Very focused on relationships with people and doing the right thing.  The company continues to invest in their people and provide many opportunities to learn, network, and train."
good,i loved working at general mills. i love the fast paced environment. i worked at the end of my line as a machine operator. the hardest part is cleaning the lines you may have to come in early morning or late night just clean them and most times its hard work
good,was a great place to work lots of room for growth good pay and good benefits. also had great pension plan. and always got to taste the samples from the lab.
good,Come in and put on all the proper PPE. Them wash your hands thoroughly. Then look in the system to see what orders we had to do today. The have to print off all request for the day. After that we had to get started on our request so we stage all the ingredients we need. then we had to determine what type and size of packaging we needed for the order. Then we had to complete the request in the time giving by the manager. then we had to do more paper work and document what we did into a computer system. The clean the work area and log out of all system. There is MUCH more that goes into it but that is just a general explanation of what goes into a average day at work.
good,good worker's and fast-pace. people are great. we work as team's. if you work slow then you have to move to different line's. we have 10 line's. and we do difference things  not just cereal.
good,"The people and benefits were very good. Unfortunately, General Mills decided to close the plant in which I was employed. The management was fairly good."
good,"Everything is easy , only one break and depending on the orders you don't get a full complete day."
good,"trabalho de produção, separação de produtos......."
good,"Monitored the production line, watching for problems such as pile-ups, jams, or glue that wasn't sticking "
good,General Mills is a very nice place to work. The teamwork was unbelievable. Everyone helped each other out whenever needed. That really helps the learning process for someone just starting.
good,GM invests in building individual mastery.  Our people are among the very best in our industry.  I have especially appreciated the opportunity to have a cross functional assignment.
good,"A company definitely dealing with the rapid changes that are occurring in the food industry. The HQ campus is a nice place to work, if you like open space environment.  Job Security is questionalble."
good,Tough environment.  Good compensation.  People are very good to work with and smart.  The continual layoffs make the culture a steep hill to climb for most.
good,I was mostly there as a contracted employee so I'm truthfully not really sure what the work environment was like there but during my time working with General Mills I enjoyed my time.
good,Ive dedicated 12 years of my life to this company for them to just one day say they are packing up and leaving me without employment. the disrespect in this place is incredible
good,"Great people to work with, management is constantly changing so no the best. On paper we are encouraged to have a good work life balance, but you are expected to work around 10 hours a day."
good,"I was at General Mills for almost a year and it was actually quite fun, if you exclude the coldness of the factory and repetitive bending. I would definitely recommend this job to someone who can handle a challenge."
good,Excellent company that is really people orientated. Excellent work environment. Very knowledgeable people with great attitudes. Benefits and perks are outstanding.
good,"Basic job duties and laid back work environment.  The chance for job advancement is pretty low, despite what the hiring manager says during the interview.  The team aspect of the job is very laid back, and often times members get away with not pulling their weight.  But the compensation is pretty good for a a straight forward job."
good,"A typical day at work is getting yelled at for not doing your job  when you are. An having managers with poor skills running the place,"
good,Good working conditions and holidays. Good rate of pay and working hours. Benefits and friendly working atmosphere. OK
good,"Environnement de travail agréable, travail interressant"
good,"Lots of great perks, healthy environment. Gorgeous sprawling campus. Many departments in perpetual transition, made for instability and inconsistency. Otherwise, fun place to work."
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar,"
good,"Uma ótima empresa, com um relacionamento com os funcionários muito clara."
good,i work on a operating line that packages single serving cups of cereal into packages of 60 count quantities. i work with all the machines and trouble shoot and fix the machines when they are down and not running. i perform quality checks on the cereal before it gets packaged every hour. I've never been in a factory type of environment before and this job has taught me a lot. i learned to communicate better in fast paced environments and to work with high powered expensive machinery.
good,I enjoy working at General Mills and love the work environment. The workers are nice and very helpful when needed. Overall its a very comfortable work place and i enjoy working there.
good,"I learned to complete OSHA quality checks.  I enjoyed all my co-workers, the hours were enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was the bump process."

good,It was fast paced everyday we would pack the cereal boxes int containers which was placed on pallets and taken away by a fork lift.
good,"Field Customer Specialist at General Mills"

good,"nice people and good place to work, learn how they make the bread for different companies"
good,"this was a very physically demanding job, however, I worked with some great people. Management could be better at discerning when to be so strict with policy!"
good,Decent place to work.  Was a little unorganized and there was very little opportunity for advancement
good,"General Mills is one of the largest food producers in the world and provides their employees opportunities to match.  A Minnesota culture dominates the white collar work force and each plant possesses its own culture.  Coming in as in outside hire can make the transition difficult, but for the most part a really caring group of professionals dedicated to safely producing safe and quality food."
good,Working at General Mills was a really good experience and was a great way to learn more about my field.  I managed to dive head first into product development and work side by side with some of the best in the field.  I was challenged to think creatively to solve problems and ended my internship there feeling I successfully accomplished what I set out to do.
good,"It was a valuable experience. I enjoyed working in the lab, as well as traveling to the plants. I would have preferred to work in more of the natural and organic brands, but location wasn't ideal."
good,"Learned a tremendous amount about brand management.  Enjoyed being surrounded by highly intelligent, motivated individuals."
good,This is a job with a high wage but it is repetitive boring work
good,"working in the freezer"
good,"My work as a package handler was more than just a day unwrapping boxes; the physical demands of carrying products, as well as the mental dedication to the consistent hours of doing so, taught me a great sense of discipline."
good,This company is great to work for but only if you don't want to have a life.  If you don't kiss the union president's butt then you are not included in anything.  The plant is all about men.  Some of the things heard while there were very very inappropriate.  Talk about sexual harassment to the max.
good,"Hired at Tempe, AZ, and promoted/relocated to Hazleton, PA, during Pillsbury ownership.  Company bought by General Mills.  Successfully led all system conversions and process changes prior to taking next career opportunity."
good,Very good benefits.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was putting together very creative presentations.

good,"I spent almost a year at General Mills, so I do not have enough time there to provide a full review. Please speak to others that spent longer at that company."
good,Learning is more in General Mills.Management is good and they care of all the employees when in need.Workplace culture is awesome and it is good and fun to work with the company.
good,Management was not the greatest but the work was hard also a great learning lesson. I loved the people who worked for me on my line as well as the respect i was giving.
good,Assembly line work just wasn't for me. The pay was nice. But doing that type of work isn't for everyone. It was a good company to work for. Daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and i needed some time off to take care of her.
good,"Depending on departments fast pace or kick back, Union Great benefits, discounts, pay. Long hours, weekend pay is a plus voluntary and sometimes mandatory. Good employees."
good,"plenty of overtime if wanted, can learn new duties if available, Safety is the most important  part of the company. They have a lunch cafeteria with hot or cold food."
good,Empresa boa de trabalho infelizmente os contratos são feitos somente nas temporadas de festa Julina
good,"It all seems GREAT until you get comfortable as a seasonal. I've been there 5 years in logistics. From high paced conveyor belts to the robots taking over the building. Management doesnt take logistics seasonal employment seriously because it's not manual labor. Therefore slowing down your personal goals and dimming moral.... TRUST ME. It was hard being a slave there! 7 day weeks, 12 to 16 hour days... mostly forced because of vacations. It'll BREAK the weak..."
good,"The hardest part of the position was keeping it. In lean times General Mills would remove the environmental engineer thinking they were replaceable. It takes years develop the necessary connection with employees and regulatory personal. "
good,I never knew from one week or one day to the next if I was going to work or not. It really depended on how many orders they had and how many people they needed to work a line in order to get the job done. Very fast pace. Friendly enviroment
good,General Mills was a great place to work. Unfortunately they shut the plant down. The hardest part of working at General mills was the overtime. it ran in 4 hour blocks we worked either 12 hr days or 16 hr days and had to be back in for our regular shift following a 16hr shift.
good,"It was a great job but job security is not great these days. The company has instituted massive layoffs in recent years and nearly my entire dept was laid off in 2015, some had been there 20+ years. We were replaced with temp workers."
good,"A good company to work for. Helped me gain a lot of valuable knowledge and experience in the consumer packaged food industry. For the most part, a very stable and encouraging work environment."
good,Great pay / different culture. Relaxed atmosphere with a high school politics feel. Great opportunity for overtime. Times have changed since I worked there.
good,"Uma empresa ótima de se trabalhar, porem liderança da minha passagem pela empresa não soube adiministra o turno."
good,I had been working there for 3 months and during that time they were working us like crazy saying we need to get ready for peak season but turns out it wasn't true.  So when all the work was finished everyone was sent home for 3+ weeks until new work came in.
good,"Empresa em uma mudança drástica de cultura, após a aquisição da yoki. Pressão por resultados é intensa;"
good,"Each day at work was different as a product development engineer! I did everything from direct interviews with the consumer, to formula/recipe development, to scale-up and optimization at the plant. Great opportunities for learning on the job. The workplace is friendly, but very corporate jargon heavy. The hardest part of the job is that R&D is an all encompassing role that answers to every other function without a lot of control. The best part is the variety and how exciting it is to take a product from idea to on shelf."
good,"Very interesting working there as a summer hire. Lots of hours, good payment. Tiring work especially on third shift. Would recommend for anyone looking into factory working."
good,Merchandising all General Mills products at Scott Air Force Base.  Also built displays and sold additional  products during holiday and seasonal times.

good,"Empresa comprometida com segurança e com o alcance dos seus resultados, preocupação com o bem estar do funcionário"
good,"As a new hire, overnight shift or second shift are the only options available until senioroty has been established. As a single mother, working nights has been extremely difficult, and rules state new hires can not switch to a different shift until 18 months of employment."
good,"This place pays well for the work you do, the only downside is that they have MANDATORY overtime occasionally. I worked during the winter seasons, and outside of work, I couldn't do anything."
good,Management has difficulty connecting dots. Plans and made and re-plans are made while losing objectives. Every year people lose jobs and leadership changes
good,"Excelente, solo que hubo fin de promoción, pero en todo lo demás muy bien."
good,"*  Atendimento ao cliente, rotinas administrativas como gerenciamento de emails, lançamento de nota, pedido de estoque, inventário, lançamento de venda, controle de caixa e estoque."

good,This was a really good place to work. I worked in the HRIS area supporting multiple Power Builder applications for the various General Mills Departments. I enjoyed the co-workers and team out there.
good,"I have been working at General Mills full-time (More than 4 years)"
good,"The production and time schedule was working well with everyone in the plant, but somehow, due to some misery reason, the plant closed down while total production was in the highest in the corporation."

good,"muy buen clima laboral. en lo personal aprendí mucho mas allá que venia de otros tipos de actividades."
good,"Its a high pressure job with no motivation. Management is not much supportive. Management is not ready to accept the change easily."
good,"A day in the life of a production lead was fulfilling to know that our team as a whole met the goals set forth by the company to achieve on a daily weekly,monthly or yearly basis.I had a great bunch of co-workers that would try very hard every time we were working toward a new goal.The hardest part of my job was when one of my co-workers quit or decided for whatever reason to go to a different shift/department.What I enjoyed the most about my job is seeing the satisfaction on my teams faces when they knew they had broken previously set records.Management was there to help us if needed,for the most part,but would let us do our jobs like we had been trained to do."
good,"Great company and on-the-job training.  Competitive set is changing, and GMI needs to evolve to continue to stay competitive.  Company is going through some significant reorganization, and will require behavior shifts from Senior Mgmt to succeed.  "
good,Great company to work for. This is a great organization that will allow you to move up and around the company based upon mobility. Management is open and they care about you and your family. I would recommend this company to anyone fresh out of college.

good,"es una empresa dinamica, moviendo sus recursos hacia adelante."
good,A typical day consist of cleaning and the general running of the production lines. I learned alot about the cleaning methods used in production factory's. The management at the time was still changing around alot. Co-workers out there really just depended on the type of person. The hardest part of the the job was when the palletizer would go down and you would have to be doing all the stacking on pallets. 
good,A General Mills era uma empresa com foco no negócios e também em pessoas.
good,It was never a dull moment.The work was hard but satisfying.
good,I really enjoyed my time at General Mills. I learned a lot while working there. They really try to invest in the leadership and work to grow their employees.
good,Good benefits and pay... Vacation begins after 90 days....the home/life balance needs work ... Management could use some help with their interaction with the employee...
good,"I enjoyed my job at General Mills, management was extremely respectful and understanding. Besides the heat, this job is amazing. I would definitely recommend someone to this job, the pay is reasonable as well."
good,"Good people, they don't mind helping you when you do some wrong. You work as a team on the job to make sure the job get done fast and the right way keep you busy."
good,Corporate kept cutting benefits and it was so hard to get time away from work. Great health care and 401K. Coworkers just had a negative outlook and all seemed depressed
good,"Job pays great and most people were awesome. Management needs work, can't tell someone how to do a job you can't do yourself. Main con is how ""drink the kool-aid"" they can be about the product, I mean it's literally just frozen pizza and pizza rolls not the cure for cancer so maybe tone it down a hair."
good,"Easy night shifts and relaxed superiors, breaks are sometimes generous and can last quite a bit."
good,"Some tasks are simple and/or easy. Some are difficult such as having to lift 50 pounds repetitively. Just as in any other job, there are co-workers who are difficult to deal with."
good,Buona azienda in cui lavorare. Struttura multinazionale
good,"Good pay. Your life is work. They have a point system that sets you up for failure. Examples, I asked why we received a point for using a PTO day, response was your not here so you get a point,  the benefit is that you still get paid. The 12-2 schedule leaves very little time for family. Advancement is possible."
good,A typical day was coming in getting our list for the day picking orders packing them and sending  them out for shipping. It wasnt a stressful job fast paced but it wasnt really demanding.
good,"focus on doing the right thing"
good,"I learned a lot while working at General Mills.  It was my first professional job in my HR career.  General Mills provided all the tools needed to do your job.  There was a great deal of advancement opportunities but unfortunately I married a wage employee at the Lodi plant which limited my career advancement.  I left General Mills and returned to provide some stability in the HR department.  Ultimately, I had to leave General Mills Lodi to advance my career."
good,"Nice people to work around very positive work environment, bad thing is the long hours and depending on your crew like D crew you never have weekends off."
good,"General Mills is a great mentoring company to work with. They try and develop their employee skills by making them undergo various training programs and sessions. Work culture and benefits are great."
good,"fast paced, large workload, work environment pleasant, many opportunities to volunteer and give back to the community, learning and development opportunities abundant"
good,General Mills continues to face price challenges along with government interference in its operation like all other food producers. Its commitment to CI should help it be successful.
good,I learned to work as a team to accomplish all goals. The best part of this job is the people we work with. The hardest part is working all the extra hours 7 days a week. Management did not solve problems when they were spoken too and felt like we were last picked.
good,"Great workplace to meet peers."
good,"Pros: good work/life balance, strong leaders, great cafeteria and other benefits "

good,I would say that the pay is great for a 3rd shift job. There is a lot of detail to the job. One thing that could be better is having set days that you are off.
good,"General Mills has been a great company to me for the pay/demands of the position I am in.  However, culture is going downhill and advancement is rare, if at all."
good,"Empresa multinacional em processo de integração com a Yoki Alimentos , com muitos desafios, metas. "

good,General Mills is a very clean organized company that help children schools nursing homes any other company that purchase from them
good,"over all the pay was so so, there's a chance that you might lose your job since they sell out they're brand. great people on the inside just not for me. unless you become band A or a manager its not a place for a decent career. co workers were super friendly and taught me everything i needed to know while working there. the hardest part of the job wasn't really that hard just lifting 50+ pounds of product."
good,"O ambiente era muito bom era como se fosse  uma família ,  era muito de se trabalhar lá ."
good,"You work with four other people"
good,"Overall Good to work place."
good,"Show up for work and relieve the previous shift of Maintenance staff."
good,Fun work environment with great team leads who allow your ideas to be shared and are taken into heavy consideration. The type of job that gives an individual certain responsibilities
good,Great place to work for me. I advanced to management quickly. Started as a production employee. Love my job but this plant is closing and I am unable to relocate.
good,Management unprepared to do what has to be done to make the corporation profitable. It's Romper Room. Workers are mainly unsupervised.
good,"Good company to work for ,with low turnover ,good benefits ."
good,"Le chef de secteur en grande et moyenne surface développe les marques de l'entreprise. C'est un métier très intéressant, très formateur et qui permet de rapidement trouver son autonomie et son rythme de travail. Mais cette autonomie à des limites car elle signifie aussi être seul au quotidien."

good,"Acompanhamento da produçào com metas de quantidade e qualidade."
good,"Empresa instável."
good,"Highly political, advancement process is painful and extremely frustrating. New generation and previous generations tend to clash with one another, so implementing change across the organization is extremely difficult and in turn creates a negative environment."
good,"I worked GM as a temporary. The environment was not bad, but one of their problem was, the job was never secure. Every shift people would get in a line and if you worked several day priviously you would be sent home because they have to give a chance to others. Also their pay was not really great compare to the heavy lifting and constant hostility it requires. No overtime and $9/hr. even third shift."
good,Work with my team to maintain the machinery and keep everything running smoothly in order to meet our production goals for the day. Troubleshoot any problems and take regular quality checks to ensure the customer is getting the best of General Mill's products. 
good,"Excellent work available and whole lot of things can be explored."
good,Um dia com muitos desafios
good,"General Mills culture is in the midst of a major culture change as they downsize in response to market forces. This seems to be a period of instability as rapid adjustments are made to recapture share growth. Managers are focusing more on bottom line results and less on team development it seems, particularly for production staff."
good,"Aprendí el manejo de SAP, las funciones propias del puesto de Administrativo."
good,"General Mills is a great company to work within, wonderful for the college graduate just starting out!"
good,Nice people. Fun atmosphere. Very little opportunity for advancement unless you're in Marketing.
good,General Mills is a company that is all about consumer safety. They are consistently aware of any possible health risks that can affect their products.
good,"Just need extra work, but I love painting but time comes and I would like to make some extra cash to provide a little more for my family and have no more issue money wise"
good,"nice workers, helped me with anything that I needed or didn't understand, never felt rushed or pressured. good hours as well and the pay was really great"
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but the customer I last called on had extreme requirements that resulted in very long hours.  The benefits were good."
good,A logística da empresa precisa melhorar tem muitos problemas na entrega de mercadorias
good,"I work in the Kitchens developing recipes so it's a different challenge every day, which I like. You have to be okay with corporate culture, and that means it takes a long time to get anything approved and moving. That can be hard as a creative person. But overall I love the experience of working at GMI."
good,Its a great company to work for but some leads don't do much work but take the credit. Get better management and people who actually care about the employees.
good,"They had a great moral booster through the activities committee.  Always getting local tickets for theme parks, events, etc and offered to employees at a discounted rate.  Lots and lots of meetings.  Most everyone was friendly and willing to work as a team.  The company did a lot of charity work.  You were rewarded for helping with charity events."
good,"Learned everything here from typical machine adjustments to indepth PLC code changes.  Work days can be excessively stressful at times, but for the most part a good place to work.  Benefits are nice as well as the pay, but could always be better."
good,General Mills has done better than the other leading competitors to maintain shelf space and dollar share.  There is a good work life balance but there are opportunities for leadership to improve overall performance through creating specific goals.
good,Too bad the West Chicago facility closed. Great company to work for. I was hoping to carry my knowledge to another food company. Felt age discrimination.
good,It was a fun place to work. The people were great. Upper staff was helpful and the hours were good. Benefits were excellent. The actual jobs were not to difficult
good,I had the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and on projects all around the world.  Advancement is tough in middle management as many people have been there 20-30 years.
good,Good work experience. Team player good communication skills hard worker. A good listener a fast learner. They are friendly good people there sometimes they can show favoritism to other employees
good,"My time at General Mills was for the most part OK. However, with any job, changes in leadership can severely impact the culture of the plant. The work was challenging and the people were great to work with.  There was a fair amount of politics when it came to getting promoted to the next level and being awarded new assignments.  If you remove the politics and the tendency to hire people who are ""like me"" then it would not have been a bad place at all."
good,Gret people to work with for the most part but it would be hard having to work weekends. Also I worked the night shift so it was tough to be productive in the wee hours of the shift.
good,It was a great company with good benefit and pay but lacked exciting opportunities or energy for young workers as it was a mature company and work. Overall good experience.
good,"Overall a great job to have , great paying, plenty of time to work.. horrible people placed in high positions of power which impair the judgment of work decisions"
good,I worked there for 30 year's  and it was a good job.it was a very clean plant.I I would still be there if they had not closed the plant I worked at.  They paid for all the schooling in my training to become an electrician.

Significant upper management changes in an effort to turn company performance around.   A lot of college hires as well as employees that have been there 20+ years."
good,"I can't say anything bad about working at General Mills.  Quality people work there.  Are you a people person?  If not, you won't fit in.  If so, perfect."
good,Violated OSHA's rules and regulations. They do not provide steel toe boots as is required by OSHA...Good company otherwise. But they make you pay up for your own boots which is a violation of OSHA's rules and regulations.
good,General Mills was a great company the 4 years I was there. Things started to go downhill once they sold the green giant brand. They started to try to get rid of people to prevent a lay off and changed the majority of schedule to 12 hours rotating which brought the morale down. However my experience was mostly positive.
good,Worked at General Mills Canada for 4 months as an AMM intern. I was constantly challenged as I worked on business innovation and business management initiatives. Marketing at General Mills is not a 9 to 5 job.
good,Work is busy and can be overwhelming at times. You are expected to get your work done if it takes 30 or 60 hours. Some managers play favorites which can derail your chance at promotions.
good,"As an intern there, the payment is fair."
good,"GMI is a great company to grow your skills and enjoy the daily work culture. I learned a lot there, they just weren't able to pay what I felt I was worth after working for them for so long."

good,"the people and the management are ok, it was really a clicky place to work."
good,The rich history of General Mills speaks for itself. The people are the finest professionals in the industry.  Its brands are household names. I was privileged to be a part of it for 30+ years.
good,Good place to work. Employees were great. People always seemed supportive and happy. The best thing working with General Mills even as a member of Guardsmark Security is that you felt connected to the company. The contractors were treated as part of the company.
good,Everything was great at General Mills until corporate decided to close down its unionized plants. The work environment was very friendly and it was a nice place to work until they shut the doors.
good,"Na minha opinião é uma ótima empresa."
good,"The company was great. Even as a temporary employee, I felt that I was appreciated. The work was at a fast enough pace to where there weren't many complaints, and the regular employees catered to temps with respect."
good,Empresa com poucos desafios e oportunidades de crescimento
good,"While the benefits are good and the work life balance is good, there is a trend of moving work to India and laying off very good, knowledgeable workers here in the US."
good,"Worked 8 hours a shift if i wanted to work overtime i was able to,i learned a lot while i was employed there to further my career within the company.I loved the workers and supervisors as they liked me too."
good,"A typical day we go in and do stretches to start the day off. Then we go to assigned areas where we get assigned task for the day. It's an ordinary factory job, but I liked working there. We got three breaks 2 fifteen minute breaks and a thirty minute break."
good,"my job was fun , did a lot of communication so i gots to know my co-workers good. productive and fun handing out flyers with the team i been to parts of milwaukee i never been."
good,"For Labor in the Union Factories it was a good solid job with great benefits. The people in the plant were great. Big push on safety and quality. Big turnover in management every couple of years. Near the end there seemed a bigger gap of understanding with the new management employees, and the labor force.  On the whole it was a very decent place to work. So sad to see so many people loose their jobs. General Mills did some supportive options for the labor loosing their jobs, including resume writing, interview practices and job fair notifications. Hard part of working there was the monotony of the jobs. The lifting  and repetitive work took its toll on many of the equipment operators who were there long term. I saw many of the older Operators and Mechanics with bad backs and repetitive injuries."
good,The people at general mills are very helpful. You can ask your co workers a question on the machines and they where able to help you figure it out or tell you what's wrong .
good,"A Place to learn new things daily"
good,"Boa empresa, da oportunidade de crescimento embora alguns lideres não valorizam funcionários."
good,"General Mills recruits and retains excellent personnel.  The work culture is generally positive and mutually supportive.  The organization prides itself on inclusivity, positive intent, and working as a team. However, the culture can trend towards ""Minnesota nice"", in which decisions are stalled and responsibilities become vague because of a cultural hesitance to address failure. "
good,"En General Mills son días de largas jornadas de trabajo en un ambiente laboral agradable, sin tanta burocracia."
good,"General Mills was pretty steady work and wasn't too strenuous. It was busy so you weren't constantly looking at the clock wondering when you got to go home. You got your work done with surroundings that made the job easier; meaning the people there all did their part and worked together to make it friendly, competitive and motivational."
good,"I worked for General Mills for a little over a year. At the beginning it was tough because i was thrown in to train with some old timers who knew everything so they thought i didnt need to learn anything = i hated my life for the first 2 months. BUT luckily i got a new trainer on a new team and it was smooth sailing from their. Met great people, got $1.00 raise after 90 days, it was great."

good,"General mills Berwick has been a fantastic place to work in the company really focus on there employees to grow and inspires people, over the past 10 years. I have loved working along side all my co worker,  the site hear in Berwick was all about growing the teams and the department to the highest level we could get to, the key thing that we all learnt was everyone had something to offer on site if one person didn't know something there was always someone that could help with that situation.  We learnt one person no matter how good you are you cant know everything all the time and if someone is there to educate each other we would be able to get there quicker as a team and not as individuals this worked really well. The company is a real driver in people health and safety and food safety."

good,"Great people to work with. The management is great  as well, very understanding and flexible. They have great opportunity for advancement and the compensation is also reasonable."

good,"When I arrive at the warehouse we would be split into groups of 4 or more for the day then our manager would give the team leader an order for us to fill. While working at this job i have learned to work at a fast pace for a very long period of time, me and my co-workers never talked much because we were working at such a fast pace that there was really no time to converse. The hardest part of the job was getting back from our last break and working another 4 hours until 4am came around which was the time the warehouse closed, the most enjoyable part of the job was taking our breaks."
good,The company is amazing at developing you. Marketing is competitive with an up-or-out advancement policy. Your experience also varies widely based on your division and management. It's a great place to start out your career.
good,General Mills provides a good total compensation package and is large enough that there are opportunities for advancement if willing to relocate.
good,General Mills é uma escola para aqueles que desejam aprender.
good,"In the 2.8 years that I worked at Yoplait, I learned almost 40 jobs. I greatly enjoyed being able to learn so much in such a short amount of time. At the time, I thought it was a good way to get job security. A typical day for me was getting to work, getting the janitor keys and the janitor cart, and getting any supplies that I may need on my cart, if I didn't stock it the night before. I would start with cleaning the women's locker room/bathroom. This would include the toilets, taking out trash, cleaning the sinks and mirrors, restocking paper products, sweeping and mopping the floors. Next I would clean the men's downstairs locker room/bathroom, doing exactly what I did in the women's room. Following that, I would ususally head to the second floor and clean the men's room on that floor. Next I would unlock, one by one, the office doors on that floor and take out the trash (every night), and vacuum the floors twice a week. Next I would sweep and mop the upstairs hallway. After I finished that, I would go back downstairs, put my cart away, and sweep and mop, vacuum the rugs, and take out the four trash bags located in the hallway. I also had to restock the hairnets, beard nets, and earplugs located in the hallway. Next I would go onto the main floor and check the paper towel holders and soap dispensers located throughout the plant and replace what was needed. Then I would clean the single bathroom located in milk receiving and the single bathroom located above Go-Gurt, and take out the office trash for this location as well. Finally I would restock my janitor cart, maybe clean"
good,"I enjoy working for GMI, but feel that they are struggling, as many other packaged food producers are, to figure out what its role is in the current economy and culture."
good,General Mills was a nice place to work u got along with everyone could work overtime.I learn about different of cerals and machines.
good,"Interactive activities with co-workers all engaged and sharing in analizing and interpreting consumer insights data.

Management was supportive and adequate training provided. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to assist others/co-workers.

good,"Awesome workplace in a good location. Colleagues are helpful and motivated. Questions are answered in a detailed manner. The team is currently expanding."
good,"Working at General Mills I picked up a few skills. Learning how to box boxes of cereal, boxes of whole grain bars, and ect into a bigger box. Learned how to work as a team. And also by myself as well. Its a quick pace job. With the boxes of foods coming down the belt you must be quick w your hands and know how your going to stack your boxes."
good,"the pay was great and workload was light, but no work life balance and very oppressive atmosphere , my boss changed 4 times in 2 years i felt lost alot of the time"
good,While management is always positive I see they are trying to communicate more and are trying to become more efficient. The work/life balance is fantastic being able to work 3.5 days a week and still get 40 hours. Honestly it is one of the best work schedules that I have seen out in today's workforce for an operation that works 24 hours a day 7 days a week .
good,Always loved waking up to go to work. The people were wonderful. The job was fun and easy. Hardest part of the job was taking totes of yogurt to the trash room.
good,They treat their employees well. They offer things that are great for those that have young families.  Many convenient benefits like a General Mills store to get things like cereal at a discounted rate.
good,"Many Different Facets"
good,I enjoyed my season with General Mills.  I thought I was doing a good job. Was able to keep Sonic welder and Casepacker running with little stops. Produced quality products. Just didn't get full time
good,Great company but can be a stressful environment at times. Would recommend to someone who  has a desire to gain diverse experience. Sometimes locations are not the best.
good,"Lots of hands on experience, easy to network, General Mills like to hire from it's pool of contract technicians and interns, so the chance of getting hired full-time is likely, though not guaranteed (depends on what jobs are available at the end of your contract)"
good,Lots of responsibility given to early career employees... which (assuming you have a good manager) advances learning and development. Good benefits and work life balance.
good,I liked working at general mills. I am the type of work and go home. over all everyone is nice. some supervisors need to be more professional but its a good place to work.
good,general mills was a great place to work. great pay but the work to life ratio got hectic at times. A lot of overtime was needed and having some time off was slim to none. Overtime was only needed because the location I worked the HR department couldn't seem to hire candidates for the production technician job but other than that the job wasn't stressful until we became short of staff.
good,Joined as new venture in direct sales to the foodservice trade. Calling on  large distributors such as Sysco and US Foodservice. Great initial training.

good,"•	Able to lift 40+lbs"
good,This is a good place to work as long as you keep to yourself and dont get involved with others. It is a great learning experience and great job stability if you are hired permanently
good,It's a good company if you are starting your career with 1-2 yrs experience. The company invests on building various skills in employees through training and knowledge sharing processes. People might tend to become lethargic eventually as this is a process driven organisation where any 2 given days are the same and lack of dynamism adds to it.Overall good place to work for 2-3 years provided you switch roles.
good,"Knowing that on a daily basis, with the help of my team we were able to hit and usually exceed the target cases.  Enjoyed working with each and every member of the team."
good,Provide exposure to their employees though various trainings and updates. It's like a big GBS family.They believe in CSR activities and promotes their employee to actively participate.

good,it is a great company.. I have got a good growth here..the salary oncrement is good..lot of investment is done for trainin.g employees t to upgrade their skills

good,"Bom convívio com colegas, boa organização do ambiente, trabalho em equipe"
good,"good place to work, very good benefits.  Typical day was setting up machines such as cartoners, case packers, baggers, side seam gluers, performing quality checks to ensure product was safe for consumers.

good,Good company to work with. Managers are supportive and listen to you. They are transparent in their policies. Lots of work but they also support work life balance. Salary benefits are not that great.
good,"Le monde du yogourt bouge très vite, j'ai appris à prendre de bonne décision rapidement dans un environnement changeant et avec des défis constants. "
good,The money and benefits are very good the only bad part about the job is working 12 hour shifts 13 days in a row with only 1 day off every two weeks.
good,"Um dia de trabalho era dinâmico e sempre com novos desafios, pois a empresa tem visões ambiciosas em querer crescer no mercado brasileiro. Aprendi a superar os meu limites e querer algo a mais para a minha carreira  de trabalho, aprendi muito com os meus colegas e que sempre me apoiaram muito. Tinha o respaldo do meu superior, e isso me motivava ainda mais."

good,i learnt how to use machinery and computers. my co-workers were very helpful.
good,The best part of the job is the team work environment and the ownership of your work.
good,Very good company and team oriented. We worked 12 hour rotating shifts. The company treated their employees with the utmost respect. The hardest part of the job was when there was a system malfunction (could get very hot and messy. Overall I learned a lot thru the years and it would take a long time to explain.
good,operated forklift to get different materials for the pizza roll fillings for production on that day..Shred cheeses for the fillings.  Recording the materials usage on the batch sheets..stronger than I thought I was picking up 33 pounds of block cheese for a hour at a time.  I shocked myself.
good,"In my personal experience when I first started with General Mills (manufacturing pasta making company), I came in to a warm happy friendly environment with exciting co-workers to work with. With having this as my first job and no work experience whatsoever, I started off with a slow start and at first did not like it because this was a fast workplace environment. Although as day by day came, I became good at what I was doing and started getting along and loving my job.  This is what I learned from my years of casual work is that if you get a job you give it your 100% as soon as you step through those work doors and maintain the standards of your employers or customers. Don't EVER slack off!  The hardest job working here was packing. Not because of the packing itself but because you had to pack really fast to keep up with the machines.  Most enjoyable part was filling preparation for the pasta and machine operating. Friendly, funny co-workers to work with but got the business done!"
good,"Great team of people to work with."
good,"Benefits alone make this a great company to work for. In the production area of the company, managers are know to come and go on a yearly basis; I've been at the company for 10 years now and have had 11 different managers."
good,"There is no typical day in a manufacturing environment due to it's complex nature. This keeps you busy and allows you to solve a variety of long and short term problems. General Mills has a great culture because they hire great, talented people. They are committed to continuously improving their people, processes, and staying competitive in the global market."
good,"Fast paced environment, always on the move. Continued search in saving money for the company and finding ways to reduce waste."
good,"My typical day at work i started 5:30 pm and proceed to computer system,check the temperature of the filling every 30 minutes and prior to perform a metal detector check and document the time of the rejection pop and initial blow-off column.After production done i do sanitation."
good,Loved working here its a good company they care about their employees. It was hard working 3rd shift for me
good,"General Mills is a great place to work, especially in Minneapolis. Most managers respect work-life balance, and there are many opportunities to contribute."
good,"Empresa dedicada em ajudar seus funcionários, ótimo ambiente de trabalho e excelentes profissionais."
good,"There is not a whole lot of room for growth, very few spaces open for advancement. I worked hard and the timing happened to work out for me, personally. It is a great company but the rotating, swing-shift changes can be very difficult and definitely is not for everybody. If you can handle the hardships, the personal growth is worth the sacrifices."
good,In the winter months very busy a lot of overtime. Sometimes we worked on Saturdays doing reworked soups from the warehouse from jobs that were from previously worked.
good,This Job began as an easy laid back job. As one of the first jobs I've ever had I was very excited to start and I was treated with nothing but respect and kindness. I wish I could of stayed longer as I feel this job promoted a very positive workplace environment
good,I loved working here but i was with a temp.service so it wasnt a temp to hire and my assignment ended there but once some of the hours drop off i can return there for further employment.
good,"Working 12 hours shifts in the factory was nice because we technically worked only half the year... one week 3 days a week and the next week 4 days.  This also meant we had every other weekend off.  Some of the physical aspects of the job were a bit demanding, but overall it was a good experience."
good,"threw out my years working at General Mills, I found it productive, I grew a lot there with the encouragement to reach my person goals. I was given the resources to obtain and to reach my goals."
good,"At my plant we work 12 hour shifts in almost all production related jobs and this can be a challenge for some people especially if you work the night 12 hour shift.  We have a very well organized seniority bid system for advancement and every effort is made to provide fair and equitable paths for advancement and learning.  Safety is taught as an absolute culture, not a priority.  Employee input is solicited in every major policy change."
good,Honestly it wasn’t bad to work at. You did get drafted quite a bit to go to other departments to do their cleaning which was annoying and when brought up was dusted off. From cleaning and running  your machine it was fun but sometimes no matter what you did it could run bad that day which could make the day drag. Overall experience not to bad.
good,Well management structure.  From day one the training is informative and related to your duties. Always updating new ideas and technology.  Life and work balance is very well managed

good,"Ótima empresa pra se trabalhar, excelentes profissionais."
good,"I am currently still in the “new hire phase” having been at the Covington plant for less than a year, but I can say a few things. First off it is extremely hard to get a job in the plant for good reason. It’s a dangerous, physically, and mentally demanding job. You MUST be a self starter to work here and be prepared to dive in. I love my job, but like any job there are flaws. Management wanting some impossible things done, systems failing, coworkers get irritated sometimes, systems are a little outdated, but at the end of the day we all come to work to do a job. We are family when we walk through the doors everyday and you can feel the tight bond throughout this plant. The biggest complaint I have is our rotating schedule. This is a 3-2-2 schedule meaning starting Monday it’s 3 on 2 off 2 on 3 off 2 on 2 off and every 8 weeks you shift from days to nights limiting your work life balance with your family, and can really take a toll on the body. If this job offered straight day shift it genuinely would be the most amazing job I could think of because I absolutely love working here and I know without a doubt I will strive to retire from this company."
good,"I enjoyed my time at General Mills, I thought the company did a lot to be a good employer and give back to the community.  My only complaint was that the heavy branding and brand awareness felt like corporate cheer leading."
good,"Worked during a start up om new line, plenty of training opportunities and team building exercises. Some areas worked were very labored but only worked 15 days a month due to the rotating 12 hour schedule.   Would definitely work there again!"
good,Good job to have I Learned many skills. The days went by fast because it was always busy. I also learned how to work under pressure and stress. We worked four 10 hour shift which gave us three days off.
good,"Great company to work for but now room for advancement as a sales rep to a higher level."
good,"General was a great company to work for, great pay, great benefits and time off. A very understanding group of people and i would recommend them to anyone."

good,"I liked working here, The pay just was not enough to pay for my family."
good,"Good place to work, good money and benefits. Management is always comming and going but good people to work with and good opportunity for advancement."
good,"Was a fun place to work.  I met my a ton of friends and my husband working at one of the plants.  The food industry is really up and down and when working in a plant, you really feel it when the lines go down. A lot of folks will say it's ""Minnesota Nice"" but I enjoyed my time there."
good,It was different even though I love cereal I was hard seeing it every where but watching the cereal bar be mad was great and the people are so nice and if I still lives there I be still working there
good,"Maintain, TS, PM, assist other Technicians"

good,Structured Environment to where the management is neat and organized. Due note that when it comes to the management and structure you have to work  and gain capability of growth.
good,its a manufacturing job with educated people that come together to make it successful. although a manufacture job everyone helped each other and teamwork was created.
good,"Great experience to learn brand management at an established company early in my career. Lots of hierarchy and processes will get in the way of moving very quickly, just like most large/established CPG companies with focus on dividend."
good,Good place to work. Sometimes it was hard but I got through it everyday. The employees are awesome. The staff helps a lot. You can also be privileged to have you spot held
good,A good company overall. Although it needs to improve compensation structure. The management is good and general company direction is good. You feel secure in the job environment.
good,Great place to work. Great co-workers. Working with the children was a wonderful experience. Meeting and getting to know the parents was wonderful as well.
good,"The work/life balance here is great. The hours are flexible and the pay is pretty decent. The stress factor was on the constant emphasis on saving money, no matter the cost, even though the company is not struggling. Management here is also disappointing. I question how some managers were able to advance to leadership roles."

good,"On the macro level: lots of hoops, red tape, bureaucracy just as you would expect from a large global company. Decisions are slow and product launches are often too late to market to gain significant share. Acceptable benefits package."

good,There are some great people at General Mills and good leadership.  It's been a tough couple of years with the decline in people's willingness to eat processed foods.

Grading included looking through the oats to remove any gluten containing material that was then documented and entered into the database for further analysis.

The whole process was very hush hush and it seemed you had to schmooze quite a bit to get consideration.  I was on multiple high-profile projects that were successful in large part because of me stepping up and working outside of the box.  They had profiles of each employee - one form even included ""Career Derailers"" as one of the things they tracked about you, but never shared so that you could work on it."

This is a company that truly is invested in ""doing the right thing all the time"", one of its core values.

good,General Mills does an excellent job hiring quality people with great attitudes and vast knowledge. If you are considering a career here the people will do their best to train you even if they aren't provided the correct resources.

There is limited career advancement.

Then we go to our lines and wait for our line lead to give us instructions on what we are doing today and how to handle our product. I've learned a lot by working with General Mills, I've learned that working as a team gets the job done faster and easier, Speed is also one of the many techniques I've learned, in order too get the job done on time you must work with speed and pay attention at all times to what you are doing. The hardest part of the job for me would be lifting heavy objects such as pallets, heavy product, or boxes. Sometimes I need help lifting other times I can do it myself. The most enjoyable part would have too be working as a team and getting to know your team, I work in various lines so meeting all the people I work with and learning different ways too handle product is interesting too me."

We work rotating shifts and my favorite was grave yard. There are rewards for no accidents and for doing well. The company is closing the Lodi, California plant due to that they said it is cost prohibitive to operate in California.

good,General Mills is a great company.General Mills is very strict with its rules and regulations and about safety and sanitation. I was working through a temp agency so I can only speak on what I have experienced as a temp and what permanent employees at General Mills have told me. For permanent employed pay is great. It’s about $20-23 an hour. I would have applied straight through the company but the company requires to work 12 days on and then you get 2 days off I believe. Still too many hours for me even if I am getting payed $20 an hour. I did not have any problems working there. I got paid 11.25 through the temp so that’s the only thing I had a problem with but besides that I have no complaint about the company.

We continue manual labor until our lunch break at about 12:00 p.m.. The store is pretty safe, although there are sometimes accidents. Safety is something we are very aware of. The doors close at 10:00 p.m. where the night shift cleans up the days work and a manager releases us for the night. A paycheck arrives every two weeks."

good,"I've learned a great deal from and been given tremendous opportunities during my time at General Mills.  However, the company's success now hinges upon its ability to change more quickly than ever before, and in some cases, focus away from the ""household name"" brands that have generations of consumers have trusted for its quality and consistency.  Today consumers can access food from more retail channels, and some perceive small brands to be the most ""authentic"" or of the highest ""quality.""  This can undermine General Mills' advantage of scale and its own conservative, high quality standards."
