rating,review
bad,"very fastpaced environment, good benefits. The company commit to several charity events and clean up days. The location is in CBD, easily access by train or bus"
bad,"If you are hired through a 3rd party like RPC do not even bother with this place. They offer you a 3 month contract while promising that if you do will they well keep you. They don't keep any of the contractors though. Most get fired for failing fraud calls. People calling in pretend to be other people and it's your fault, even if you ask your security questions correctly."
bad,"One company I will never go back to... Totally against family. Very unhelpful, also refuge to give me anytime when my dad past away. All about work and I had been there for many years."
bad,"They lie about the pay, you get $13.00 per hour and and your told you will receive  2% commission, but instead its 0.002 percent commission.  The policy changes on a daily basis.No structure or incentives for the cost of living benefits. The company is not about change, your told it's been this way, for over 30 years.  A militant style training and your employment is contingent upon passing a 3 hour test of crammed product knowledge.When you ask about the pay, your told, they will not discuss the pay, not until you pass the test.  A lot of favoritism.  Very inexperience supervisors, no leadership skills. Very micro managing, every 30 seconds, your reminded about how many calls, are in the que, When their is a Huge Reader Board hanging everywhere. A very high turn over. The computer system is out dated and ancient. It does not work on a daily basis. The travel agents, that call in,  receive 15 percent commission and  you do all the work and receive less then a penny 0.002 Percent. The desk and chairs are not ergonomically correct, for your back."
bad,"After i understood expedia is a way to scam and cheat people, i left. They dont pay what they have to pay to hosts."
bad,"Evidence based excerpt of actual events during my three years in Fraud Ops."
bad,"Expedia is a giant bureaucratic organization that stifles individuals. They waste too much money and too much time in asine meetings and bureaucratic time wasting procedures. They are more interested in writing procedures and making up new rules rather than running a lean, mean operating machine. They are liberal and recently got rid of anyone that was conservative."
bad,Lots of turn over in the compliance tax team mainly due to horrible leadership by the VP of Global Reporting.  VP is a micro-manager that is not that knowledgeable and does not lead by example or lead humbly.  Self preservation is management's main priority.  Not a place you can work and feel safe.   No team work environment and upper management doesn't care.  Management is not understanding or fair.  Lots of double standard and time spent on immaterial items.  It's a company that believes in promoting females which is great but often times undeserving females are promoted due to time with the company.
bad,"I wouldn't have have even interviewed if I knew how bad this company would be to work for."
bad,"I had very unfortunate experiences with Expedia and am very happy not to be working there. Rate of pay is very low for the job they expect. I worked like a dog for about $15,000 a year less than was standard for the area.You can be sure that if you work in certain departments of Expedia that you will be underpaid and underappreciated. If you thrive on corporate conflict, then get out your fangs! You'll love the place."
bad,"I worked there for a temp agency. I was only there for 3 months before I quit. You get 2 weeks of training, and you get absolutely nothing from it. By the 2nd week you get to play on the computers and by then you're out in the floor. You get told in training that you can ask as many questions once on the floor and that's a lie. Your team lead will not help you. Your Co workers are better help than they are. Employees that actually works for the company were getting upset that the temp workers got to partake in activities they were doing. There was alot of backstabbing. Team leads meet once a month to review your score. I got told I was the worst person on our team and by that point I was done and that was what did it in. She was inexperienced and didn't have a clue, to what she was doing. She would say IM her and well she NEVER ANSWERED. It's a joke working there."
bad,"A typical day at the department you would contact and refund fees for customers that were incorrectly charged by the hotels. While working for Expedia, I learned how to use excel, macros, sales force program, AP recon and OneNote. There was poor organization and management within the Expedia Virtual Card department. The hardest part of the job was the workload. The quota was too hard to make. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and making their problems resolved in a good manner. I enjoy conversating with the hotel managers and companies."
bad,"Preferential treatment is given to younger workers, promotions, wages and other perks.  Not geared toward an older worker.  Has a very pre-school atmosphere."
bad,"Los compañeros de trabajo fueron muy agradables. Pero esta empresa no supo explicarme ni a mi ni a los que trabajaban ahí, el proceso de lo que debíamos hacer. "
bad,"Pay isn't remotely close to what it should be for the 3.5 MONTHS of training. Some members of management are cool, and don't bother trying to move up. Pay raises aren't really a thing, not to mention, you got trainers teaching you how to steal money from the company, marries bosses sleeping with other bosses, guys dressed for bed, and girls like they are auditioning for Bad Girls Club. Save yourself the stress, cause trust and believe, you'll end up getting fired for speaking your mind, or spend your checks in therapy."
bad,"It was a great place to work"
bad,This company has fired pretty much all of the senior reps in order to change the comission structure to pay the workers less money than before and hire new people that arent used to making as much money
bad,"Contractors are considered very separate from FTEs and most communications do not apply to them. "
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. Management ery unprofessional. They are understaffed, which causes other employees to carry extra weight and work extre hours. Employees walk on egg shells under constant threat of termination. Managers are promoted by who they know, not experience or education and there are only a few who actually do their jobs. Others you know ahead of time not to ask them for help on anything. They're just there to get paid, not to actually work. You will sit on hold over am hour for a Lead or Manager and when you get thru they will not take over the call when a customer specifically asks for a supervisor."
bad,"Beyond micromanagement.  People are required to manager their time down to the second during each work day.  However, management does not provide /demand the same out of the software we are required to work with to manage that very time."
bad,"This company TATA, held a contract with Expedia.com and I worked with this contract.  The exact review would be under TATA, Inc.  I found this employer lacking in management skills and feared for my own safety due to drugs being used on the premises."
bad,"In my two years at Expedia, I went through five managers. Two of my managers physically intimidated me and others. The existing UNIX team was destroyed. Executive management was ruled with an iron fist and drove many talented people away. Managers has ongoing disputes publicly in the hallways. People who got in the way of management were targeted and harassed. No configuration management existed. Change management was incomplete. IT was decentralized and territorial. I don't know of any talented people who used to work there. Pretty sure they all left for better places as I did."
bad,"Assists with inquiries from Expedia’s Headquarter Offices addressed to Senior Executives, Board of Directors, Legal Department, and Public Relations, as well as issues filed with Better Business Bureaus and Attorneys General. Represent Expedia with the upmost professional and positive manner."
bad,"Fast paced and micro managed enviroment. Management seemed to be more concerned with their impressive numbers than the expedia  customers themselves."
bad,"Learning culture but has Bit of politics. No growth."
bad,"Company does not promote individual growth although they make a big charade of it that they do. Loads of favoritism. Only people get promoted that smile a lot and bring chocolate to the office every day (you know the type). There are people there for years that did not receive a well deserved promotion while people that joined after 6 months were promoted to senior collector"
bad,UNPROFESSIONAL company. Management does not communicate well with each other. Pay is decent but not worth the headache.
bad,You will learn and get great incentives. However moving to the next level takes time. It's a great place for a couple of years
bad,"There is no job security, the metrics give you less than a percentage of room for mistakes. Look at it as a temp job cause if you like it or not you won't be there long."
bad,"Working from home was extremely convenient, however, stressful with children and trying to run a family around work schedules. Management was kind but not accessible or extremely knowledgeable in required assistance."
bad,"Not  place to work if you desire any advancement or job security.  If you can handle difficult metrics, and working every weekend, this is for you.  Management's focus is their own commission."
bad,"If you work in Dallas at Hotels.com, be ready for cliques, politics and no career path unless you want to move to London or Bellevue.  There are good individuals at the staff level, but the leadership is elitist because most of them are former consultants and the only people they hire are more consultants who have to come from top tier schools or else they cannot do the job.  If you interview there, get ready for case study style interviews like you would see at Bain, McKinsey, BCG, etc."
bad,"Call after call all day long, distracting work environment, little management support. Nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,"schlechte Kommunikation, starke Hierarchien, Kontrollen"
bad,Company provided wonderful training for new mortgage professionals as well as seasoned veterans. However the training doesn't provide you with the reality of the hard work you needed to put in.  You would need to provide your own book of business or cold call or network constantly in order to live because you have no salary or any kind of compensation even though you were required to be there between certain hours.
bad,"Call center is very job focused and time consuming. High turnover rate due to pay, but they management does not care. You will only be treated like a number who can be easily replaced."
bad,"Working on a contract reimaging desktops and laptops. Helping inbound and outbound customers. supporting and connecting reset passwords, working on trouble tickets."
bad,"No structure or organization within the company, only benefits you get are insurance, you work all holidays, and don't get holiday pay, the pay is decent."
bad,"This place was a joke, the people promoted to director and above were under qualified and had no idea how to accomplish anything. We had to do things at least twice because management made promises based off of what a salesperson for a vendor told them, with no SME in the room. Absolutely ridiculous."
bad,"After the transition in March for data center services, there was a exponential decline in quality of work life. The management is not functional and the communication company-wide is almost non-existent. To top it off, there is little focus on employee career advancement."
bad,"This is just a company that envy Amazon's growth and culture, instead of having their own, they just are trying to be an Amazon ""wannabe"", which is sad because it feels way more disorganized, less human and respectful therefore less fun"
bad,"Too many managers, too many re-organizations that change directions. Too many people chasing whats hot, and leaving important code behind."
bad,Laid-back culture. Challenging projects. Situated at a great place in Montreal. Easy to commute. Very Spring oriented environment. Great AWS integration.
bad,"I have been working in the customer service industry for almost 8 years and I found my experience at Expedia to be disheartening. Training was an absolute joke and the agents that are released to the floor are no where near ready to take calls. As a Tier 3 agent I feel we should have the  knowledge to perform our job duties, especially since we are dealing with  customers who have spent thousands of dollars. The lack of support from supervisors and leads is sad, they could careless if u fail or succeed until one of your actions cost the company money.  Proper training helps build any successful company's foundation and without it you'll find that your costing yourself a lot of money correcting employee mistakes."
bad,Nice place to work although it does get stressful . i managed to survive 3 years there. Management is required to be there for the customer's.they cannot lead you anywhere but to restart your computer . They can criticize your work but cannot tell you how to correct the issue at all .
bad,"Management worked you extremely hard by setting unrealistic targets."
bad,The culture was like family. The Dallas location has directors that are not in tune with the culture and manage in a passive aggressive manner. There is not enough room for growth.
bad,When I started it was a good place to work. Over the 5 years that I was there management at the supervisor level was in constant flux. You could never get help if you needed it or get  a straight answer.  The lead line was a joke constant 35 minute wait for help. The stress level went from a 1 in the beginning to a 10 in 5 years.
bad,"Expedia's culture is generally productive and places a high importance on networking and relationships."
bad,"Responsibilities:"
bad,Customers are always angry and supervisors do their very least to help employees.  Not a comfortable or inviting working environment.
bad,"Selling cruises for Expedia, Hotwire, and AARP, working with customer to resolve complaints and issues, money transactions over the phone, devolving relationships and repore with the customers."
bad,"Hard work, volunteering for overtime, years of dedicated service, and even doing special projects above and beyond your job description will get you nowhere..."
bad,to tight of a schedule...poor hours... barely time to use the bathroom.... quite boring....high pressure sales bblah blah blah blah blah.........................................................
bad,"It doesn't matter if you have a life outside of work, or if you missed lunch, or if you need to use the restroom. What matters is that you're tied to the phone to assist screaming mad customers whose biggest complaint is how long they've been on the phone. The processes are insanely slow. To get a question answered from a lead, you have to wait on hold for 30-45 minutes. If you get on a call that goes over your shift, it doesn't matter if you have kids or another job to go to, you have to stay."
bad,No development opportunities.  Micro managed the department.  Little accountability and inconsistent standards held.  Not overly stressful but not fulfilling.
bad,"Expedia was the most political environment I've ever experienced. Cliques were everywhere, making it difficult to fit it. Besides all that, Expedia feels heavily on the decline with lack of innovation and superior competition from Google Travel."
bad,"It was fun when I first started. Then, the only male manager in Cruise department quit and the lesbians took over. At that point, favoritism and nepotism ran rampant. With seniority, I still didn't get promoted, instead, after my vacation they fired me based on what they said, I wasn't making my quota. There was no mention of quotas in the interview. Bait and Switch. Now, unless things have changed. Its still the same working there. Choose another department, not Cruise."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"The management was terrible. They waste your time playing games or just talking during meetings versus providing productive information. When trying to ask for projects extra work or a challenge, they never have any. Job is too easy without challenges and it’s the same thing in and out daily. Job operates in the grey area and you are not backed or supported in your job decisions, even when following training guidelines. It’s great at first, but not worth it."
bad,Too many cooks making too many things with no standards so getting systems to talk to each other is a nightmare. Nobody knew what the source of truth for data would be or could decide on a set data type for their projects. One project will get started only to be killed because you find out that another team using the same table or form will be unable to operate because their source of truth from data in the table is different from the source of truth for the other five teams that also turn out to be using the table.
bad,Company is at a great location the colleagues are wonderful and make your working time at the company wonderful the only points which are bad is that the management lacks transparency accuse you sometimes of stuff you did not do and lie quite a lot when it comes to contract renewals they will try and find an issue so they do not renew you
bad,"Once in a position there is no growth. Depending your position in a hotel, which they gut a lot of the perks once they increase the pay to $10. "
bad,"Expedia Group Cons: "
bad,Job security has become a concern.  To much restructuring and not enough talent retention.  Need to focus more on the boot level folks in the trenches.
bad,This is an escalation call center 95percent of the time the customers you get are angry very stressful  your job is to find resolution  to the issue and there are just to many one offs to name or describe the co worker culture was very helpful as everyone tries to help everyone else out.   for the amount of tools you have to use and just the nature of the calls they should pay more but don't  15hr to start and raises are a quarter a year if your lucky   you can move to other departments pay stays the same job may change  with less or no phone time depending on department  benefits are outstanding  also get travel benefits vouchers from the company .  if you can handle the stress and learn the dependent systems   GDS (airline global distribution system)  and other tool  shortcomings      hardest part of job is the stress and de-escalating the customer and when there is no resolution and only company policy    best part was the people and my manager was great to work with.  if your applying here go in with your eyes open.  and don't take the calls personally
bad,Ik kon helaas de werktijden niet meer realiseren en daardoor is de samenwerking beëindigd
bad,8 hour day and was able to leave work at work.Changes in management as C-Level were shuffling and departing the division. Still had a Microsoft feel and experience.
bad,"I loved working for Expedia, Inc. The workplace environment was as if I was spending the day with my family.  The benefits were great. The training was extensive and on going."
bad,"Expedia is a alright place to work, the culture has changed a lot. It used to be faced paced and challenging but now it is slow pace and kind of boring."
bad,"I worked at Expedia for almost three years. I loved my job until the name of the game became who can make up more stuff to get fellow employees fired. The HR department at the Springfield office is a joke. They grant FMLA to certain special employees for more than 12 weeks a year; and some, not  all take advantage of this. Anyone can complain about how something made them feel and immediately the HR department launches a full on investigation. You aren't allowed to have a sense of humor because it might offend someone. You can call in sick, take long lunches, take more breaks then you should and nothing will come of it but if you are one who follows the rules and complains about others abusing them then you are now on their radar and not considered a ""team player"". You can have a negative attitude and complain about everything and your as good as gold but if you're a happy, extroverted, high producer then you have a bounty on your head. Several people were terminated in the QA department recently and others are trying hard to get out; including its manager. They aren't concerned with how good you are at your job so as long as you are a good little robot."
bad,Fast paced interaction with customers daily. Excellent
bad,"I joined because that I love travel. The company culture wasn't very supportive. My manager was not a very professional person, and that set back the whole team's performance a lot. Eventually the whole team left."
bad,"Very technical & financially based position. You are assisting with financial questions and internet training for the hotel partners, such as remittance advices and invoices."
bad,"Exciting Projects and Collaborative workspace. "
bad,"Company has several struggles of running the office. The overall atmosphere is highly stressed, and no one talks about in fear of losing his/her job. Micromanagement is extremely high as well. There are good people there. Their benefits are wonderful."
bad,"Expedia was very flexible, allowing me to attend school part-time while working. The pay was good, at least as far as contracts go."
bad,"Pay is great and benefits are good, local HR and managers - not so much.  Other sites have free soda, free snacks, and even free beer IN THE OFFICE on a regular basis.  The Springfield site is very different, people have gotten fired for drinking in Springfield."
good,It was good and productive thing for me to get experience from it ..I worked there for learning and I got a lot then my expectations but I wants to back on accounts and finance so I'm searching for...
good,"i was poorly compensated with this account, I've worked so hard to achieve the standards of the account however I did not get the salary that I deserved"
good,"Great shift availability."
good,Turnover is very high including at the leadership level. Most people (peers etc.) are very nice. The leadership is the biggest downside.
good,"Not family friendly,   work late nights and holidays and weekends.."
good,"My day to day routine was listening to recorded and live calls and then breaking down those calls with my agents so they could be more productive. Being more productive will not only generate more an extremely important repeat customer base, but more importantly it gave the guest a great experience but at the same time it put a rather nice and large check in my agents pockets. it's always a great feeling feeling when I simply assist and slightly guide people in a direction of integrity and financial security at the same time"
good,"No room for advancement,  In fact the company posts public listings for management prior to listing internal jobs and offering promotion to current employees. Unfair and Unstable leadership. Pay increases for managers annually but no increase for hourly employees in over 6 years. Time for new management."
good,"The thing that stands out to me about Expedia was the culture, and how competitive it was. People were not helpful to each other, and they often criticized each other just for entertainment."
good,"Answering calls of customers who where stranded hundred of miles from home with no place to stay was the hardest part each day. I learned how to multitask very well. Co-workers where great people to work with, a very caring group. I really enjoyed when I was able to re-book a guest into a decent hotel."
good,"constant change in rules, priorities, systems, with minimal explanations made for a hard place to work."
good,"Expedia culture is adaptive from Google or Face Book, young and hungry. Expedia mission states no discrimination base on race, age, gender etc. If you are young and white the it is easy for you to move around and get promoted. If you are over 40 and have the skill set and education and a woman of color you might as well accept the position you were hired into because you will not be able to career advance and no one is willing to help you. You are ignored."
good,Typical day is working with corporate clients who majority of the time have problems with their account rather than booking travel. Also there's limited help from management.
good,"I used to love this job when I started as a Lodging Support Agent. After you've been there for a few months the cracks start showing. Management lacks expertise on everyday work tasks and one is forced to ask other peers for guidance and support. If you are able to reach one of the leadership positions then you'll have a bit more job security. "
good,"It has as any other companies many pros and cons."
good,The Springfield office does not have the same culture as other offices within the company. The office environment is more like a manufacturing facility than that of an administrative office.
good,"As much as I loved working in the data center, it only took hiring the wrong person to manage the team to make me want to leave my team and my job. They would have to change drastically to go back."
good,It is ok for the pay but prepare to be stressed day and night. You are forced to be customer service no matter what department you work in
good,"This was a great experience. I learned a lot about business and myself. The pay was extremely minimal for the hours spent researching for clients and sometime non existent if they suddenly weren't interested or just enquiring. "
good,"no chance of advancement, in the call center you cant move up."
good,"Very informative about the cruise market. It was amazing to learn the ins and outs of the different cruise lines, how they work, where the go and what to expect on the cruise line and their destinations."
good,"Expedia Inc. is a face paced company that is focused on being the #1 travel provider online.  I work with Expedia and Hotels.com partners globally creating policies, procedures and training initiatives."
good,"Expedia had it's ups and downs."
good,"Alignment and follow through is an endemic problem. We were judged for end to end outcomes, but poor leadership and and collaborative was a constant blocker to execution."
good,I do not have a review because I would not rather say. It was okay in the fact that the benefits were good but I do think that for the amount of work we were underpaid.
good,"Good Place to work Except few things i.e. management issues, team issues and monotonous work."
good,"I worked at the Arlington, Tx location that is now closed as a customer service rep. There were times when we had to work mandatory overtime which was not some of my favorite times. Overall, it was a call center with typical call center culture: being heavily monitored on your clock in/clock out times, phone call length times, in addition to the no cell phone while on the work floor rule. Typical call center, was a stepping stone position for me."
good,"I've had a difficult time here at Expedia, which is opposite to my previous Corporate experience. Many of the people are great to work with, the overall culture is fantastic, but pay is low (comparatively) and advancement difficult for me to understand. Mgmt speaks to a ""work-life"" balance, but when I'm called as I'm entering the movie theater at night because they need something within the hour I don't much feel balanced."
good,It should always a fun work place and supportive management. Especially regarding the salary it should be provided without any disputes. There might be an instance of disputes in the salary but not all the time.
good,"Société en croissance forte qui présente donc des opportunités de développement de carrière pour les collaborateurs performants"
good,This is a disorganized mess of a company who can't seem to find a supervisor to tell you what you can improve on or what you are doing wrong
good,"worked in M&I which is in Canada, culture is way different than US.  Not good. Love the Bellevue Culture.  My director was an extreme micro manager, which I hated."
good,"Taking care of yesterday's commitment if any and continued efforts. How an online travel portal works is quite unique on its own. Management is perceptional, but core people are definitely not travel experts at back end as well. Efficient and competitive but less utilised. Leadership team is loyalty based as opposed to skill set.The tenured and the best knows who I'am."
good,Have to work through the day and attend off-hours meeting everyday. liaising with a manager who is US based makes it difficult to make prompt decisions. Limited authority in hand for decision making
good,The best part of working for Expedia Local Expert is the perks. Our partners makes our jobs worth while. Being able to enjoy all that Orlando has to offer is amazing.
good,"work culture is good , work life balance is good, one can work on the latest technologies in the market , free breakfast and lunch and salary also is good"
good,"- Poor leadership."
good,"Booking air, flight, hotel and car for corporate customers working for Procter and Gamble .... the only time it wasnt fun is if you had an employee that is stuck half way across the world and you cant get them home - the best part is being able to accommodate them and get them home."
good,"Manage all aspects of requests using ticketing system SERVICE NOW – Responding to issues in Escalation queue, creating, modifying, and removing Active Directory access, as well as working in Exchange O365. "
good,Sing in start taking calls. Sometimes it was very difficult to find accommodations in or near where the customer wanted to be.
good,I had a good experience at this company as I did what was asked of me. You are graded by performance on quarterly basis and always reminded that the door to exit is right there. I've never seen a place where so many people come and go. Most people call it a Revolving Door. It often seems when you start to know someone they are let go. The company does not pay for holidays nor observe holidays. So you can bet you are working every holiday unless you're scheduled off. As a new person coming on you will almost always be working weekends and be ready to get up early. They do offer good benefits for employees. It was a good job selling travel.
good,"I loved working for Expedia. The really only thing about the company is there are a handful of people in high level management that really are terrible. They are VERY conservative and DO NOT respect anyone that disagrees with them or not like them. They will fire you or make it hard for you so you will leave. Which makes it hard on supervisors and managers, because they are pressured. If those 2-3 people were gone it would be a almost perfect place to work at."
good,"Expedia est une entreprise très formatrice , malheureusement les salaires sont trop bas ."
good,Loved every minute of the 7 yrs there until they shut down the center while I opened and trained the new center in the Philippines. Sad!
good,"Very regimented atmosphere with extreme stress."
good,"I supported various Executives and the CEO's office.  High stress and not the best work life balance.  Great team members, however no room for growth."
good,"Can be a good place to work depending on your role and reporting structure. Management can seem archaic and backward at times, but there are some great people there."
good,"Depends on which team and who your management is. There is a culture that exists, but the more that people change and management chains change the more volatile it can be. I've watched women in tech be railroaded for being ""direct"". Told to smile more and practice soft eyes. "
good,I was enduring personal medical issues. Expedia did not support these issues. I was happy working at Expedia and would love the opportunity to work there again.
good,"I don't have a great amount of positive feedback, based on the interaction of some management, and environment at Expedia.I did however learn some accounting skills with the company."
good,Company needs to invest more time in the hiring and development of managers and supervisors. Great experience while working there and many great colleagues.
good,Expedia is the 800lb gorilla of online travel agencies but moves like a start-up. The people are awesome. Little room for advancement outside of Bellevue/Seattle and London offices. Big power struggle between these 2 offices. They aim for 50th-percentile in salary ranges generally so half of the companies in this sector pay more.
good,"I worked there from 2003 - 2010. They had better than average benefits, and compensation was average. Culture was good enough, and work/life balance was fine.  Management consisted of a small 'in-crowd' who had all of the job security.  Anyone else was eligible to be let go at any time.  My experience was that unless you could bring specific travel industry technical knowledge to the table - they would only keep you for so long.  Once your salary demands hit a certain level - they would fire you.  I saw this happen over and over to senior people.  I'm not sure what they are like now."
good,I have been in leadership here at Expedia for a while. There are some divisions that have great growth opportunity but offer less pay.  Some ORG's offer better pay but little room for advancement. There is a fair amount of infighting among leadership and it can fill like you have to watch your back.  If you can kiss up you will go far here.  This is a result of a lot of people in leadership that have never worked in a high stress job so they aren't looking for the hard worker just the one that is most vocal.  If you work on every thing that your superior tells you to work on and do a really good job you will still have less chance than your colleague that schmoozes the boss.
good,"Every person has a different experience at Expedia. This is purely based on who your manager is and what locations you work. If you can sell, you can make money and advance. There is a lot of internal politics though which can make the work locations stressful at times. I learned a lot from my time there and it helped me advance in my career."
good,Worked hard for everyday of the 3 yrs included my days off  and was rewarded with layoff.  Best thing was the benefits and the Wellness reimbursement that is provided to their employees..
good,I am delighted to be involved in such a huge and efficient international company. I am learning every day thanks to my supervisors and my clients.
good,"Working from home for low wages is probably an ideal assignment for someone with school-age kids and a spouse working outside of the home. I can't recommend it as a sole source of income for a single person like myself, except perhaps as a ""from hunger"" job to tide one over between higher-paying contracts at Amazon and Microsoft. But the contract-to-contract lifestyle can burn through one's financial resources rather quickly, so my advice is to always try for a full-time job, if you can find it. Also, unless you have phenomenal self-control, working from home tends to erode one's life-work balance. Hence, it loses one of the key selling points of contracting. It's low-wage office work outside of the office. That said: I did enjoy learning about far-flung hotels, editing hotel descriptions down to the simplest language, and the challenge of clearing a global or regional queue of requested edits in a set period of time. But it was a short, low-paid contract dangled between longer, more rewarding assignments."
good,Everyday was mostly the same take calls and go home. Management was not a strong factor as it changed almost every month. Nothing was steady as far as Sups and leads. So I think that is why the environment was not as enjoyable and not so friendly cause you didn't know who would be over you the next day.
good,"Data Center Services work load can vary from day to day."
good,A good working environment with excellent employees.  Fast paced and always looking to improve it's self.
good,Young and multicultural environment with all the typical problems of the big corporates work environments.
good,"Coworkers and I would come in everyday loving it.  After pay cuts and managerial switches to make it impossible to even use the restroom once a day (2 minute max on RR breaks all day), we just got sick of it.  I think there's maybe 7 people I know left of nearly 100 that I knew whom worked there when I did."
good,"Management needs to be replaced to make this a better place to work.  Campus is great and so are benefits."
good,"Expedia offers great benefits nothing else really to say about the company, I have been here for  5 years and still in the same department. Ready to move forward"
good,Some groups are better than others to work in.  Company offers lots of perks but the work life balance seems to be changing and not for the better.  Good autonomy to make decisions but some leadership is not as strong as others.
good,"When I first applied to this job I heard that it paid a lot more than it actually does per hour. Which doesn't help those of us struggling with student loans. We handle a lot of screaming people and issues for the hotels we work under. I feel the amount we are paid hourly is very low and not livable by any means. (I have had to get a part time job at night to pay my bills) Although we do get commission and tips from our work we can go weeks and weeks of stressful and mentally damaging work and not earn a dime of commission and tips, it's not for the lack of trying to fish either. This is a very competitive job, you have to be rather vicious with your co-workers to even get a sale sometimes."
good,"Great Company.. Compensation is not as good for the amount of work you do. Great benefits and has good employees, but too much turn over due to stress level of the job position."
good,Nice collegeas bad management I worked in Lisbon nice place to live
good,Low pay. Depending on dept work hrs were assigned by seniority. Some opportunity for advancement. Job based on productivity in all depts. good benefits.
good,Vyborne prostredie na zaskolenie do sveta it supportu na dialku a a komunikaciu s udmi z celeho sveta
good,Loved working here until the team was outsourced overseas.  Management had it's hands tied by the corporate office but meant well.   Almost all advancement was possibly only from within Bellevue so career development and training was stalled for a couple of years.  Few changes while I was there.
good,"working for expedia was mot the best experience, manager was not the best, was afraid to take decision, did not know all about it,  and when had meetings, had to brings clerks to respondent questions about balance"
good,Flexible hours (shift bids) based on performance. Decent base salary. Not really enough to live on. High stress to meet sales goals. Good training and friendly co-workers.
good,"Typical work day had over 5 meetings"
good,"The rewards are not balanced, career advancement opportunities offered to only those who embrace the management vision. The general feeling is ""if you're not with us, you're against us""."
good,"I have worked in a couple of different roles and no matter where I landed, the pace at Expedia is very fast. Some teams are better at it than others. The culture is mostly collaborative and people typically try to do the right thing."
good,"Pros"
good,"FCTS is a division with no career advancement. I've seen multiple SDE1 who worked at this division (FCTS) for 2+ years with no promotion. Also, no impactful work in this division so SDE1 learns nothing."
good,Day to work was working on marketing strategy and change the code accordingly. Create SSRS reports and generate adhoc reports. Once. Create user stories and generate documents based on the reports
good,"Managed portfolio of 25-30 ASP Clients that represented $30 million+ in bookings and $3 million in annual revenues. Created business plans for new development projects and continually added new projects to overall plan. Introduced new marketing plans and analyzed partner’s metrics (site performance and customer conversion rates). Created contracts with unsubstantiated revenue share baselines, modeling revenues vs. profits to determine contract negotiation range and revenue/profit break-even points."
good,"I worked for Expedia many years, Worked in many different areas, strong training for employee, Salary not that great, expect 13,00 - 15.00 Hour max, Expedia give opportunities for employee to grow in the company."
good,good hours and very flexible to employee needs. Management was changed often which means the regulations and expectation was different each time there was a new manager.
good,Worked here for a year when I re-located to the Seattle area.  Good company.  Nice mix of employees.  Friendly office.  Salary would have been stronger for the work demanded.
good,"Good company with work life balance and good CEO but compensation needs to be more competitive with market."
good,"Great place to learn new Technologies. Managers in India are unprofessional, interested only in obligating Leadership and adds no value to Company, divides team to hide their inefficiencies and save their job, Taking credit for all good works and working with no accountability for failures."
good,"Answer inbound calls, solve customer issues and deal with travel agents. Culture is intensive in results and the hardest part was to manage unsatisfied customers. They do not value the individual workers, and expect you to take toilet breaks out of your 10 min break you get every 4 hours..."
good,"Some teams are better than others. I've worked some jobs at Expedia where I'm working nights and every weekend. Other jobs, I was able to better manage my workload. The people are what keep me around--they are incredibly smart."
good,"When you are on a specific account your typical day will be talking to lovely people, clients and most of all customers. In my days of working for this company for almost 2 years, I've learned a lot of things especially, how to balance things like money and family."
good,"Great hours, very quick and easy to get through the day. They had fun games during break times and provided candy during the shift. Worked with several other college students - worth it!"
good,"9h30 : café et c'est parti !"
good,Excellent place of employment. Able to use travel benefits to see the world and also learn many different levels to travelling
good,"Typically a fast paced environment. Great co-workers. The upper and middle management teams have little to no idea what is really happening on the floor but are always trying to come up with new ideas to squeeze more out of the already hard working Hotel Operations team. Like many places the direct supervisors have their favorites. The current evaluation process is devoid of any useful metrics upon which an employee can improve. It's all left up to the ""Opinion"" of your supervisor as to how profitable you are to the team, and that can change monthly."
good,"Positive atmosphere to work for. "
good,"Answering phones and booking travel for all types of corporations and businesses, some being part of the fortune 500 businesses.  I learned everything that encompassed being a travel agent from airport codes to being able to operate any type of booking system from Worldspan to Sabre (used by airlines) and even became certified in Canadian travel.  Management was decent, but a lot of the questions I had they couldn't answer on their own and had to research them so questions were not answered in a timely fashion under some circumstances.  Coworkers were friendly and considerate and everyone worked to their full potential to keep a balanced work environment.  The hardest part of the job was trying to multitask under extreme weather conditions for a multitude of companies while maintaining everyday office duties.  I enjoyed learning about the travel industry and talking to so many different people in the world."
good,I enjoyed working for this company immensely until we trained a NOC team in india and they promised our jobs were safe.  Once we had the other team up and running they let all of the contractors go.
good,"Expedia was an experience I will hardly ever forget. It was the first time I got in touch with the call center environment. With all honesty it is not a very hard life as many people said it would be; maybe it was only because I was a student and it was just an internship that I didn't feel like the rest of the people. "
good,It is a good place to work in if you want to be professionally comfortable.
good,"ok place to work, co- workers: some unfriendly, nice fringe benefits. good learning about the travel industry"
good,"Expedia is all about hotel car, flight reservation. Busy and client centered job. When it comes to management, they are very strict about targeting metrics from day to day sale. With my fellow colleagues, we enjoy our job most especially if there an employee engagement wherein we extend our hands in joining fun filled activities outside the company. Closing a sale from a client that requires full conviction in order to meet the daily metrics needed in order to keep the rank. Providing and meeting clients needs beyond customer satisfaction and expectation all through out."
good,"The typical day start by accessing Sales Force and ADM; Review old cases assigned (per priority) then, checked new properties; manage the activation process with vendors especially in EMEA and NA regions."
good,"Had lots of fun here, working with team members and customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was that I learned a lot and there was a lot of room for advancement. "
good,"Days can get tedious working the same types of cases over and over. Sometimes there would be more variety but they tend to assign similar cases to one person which can get boring. You learn to use the company's different software tools easily. One of the experts on all the things I was doing in my department had only been working there a year, which tells you something about how difficult/challenging the work is."
good,"Expedia excels in providing maximum customer service, emphasizing the discovering the needs of the guests, assisting guests in creating a sense of urgency when planning & booking their desired events and ensuring follow up and maximum customer experiences."
good,Perform multiple tasks - keep my self updated with latest offers /situations worldwide - Judge situations and find solution Ona quick pace - report directly to supervisor.
good,A typical day at work :
good,The overall experience is good.
good,"They have nice Lonodn offices and people are generally nice but since the Hed Office is in the US, all the best roles are located there. If you are looking for more senior high paying roles, it is not the best place to be unles syou are looking for cushy 9 to 5 job."
good,Good for people who choose work life balance. Compensation is fairly competitive. People are generally helpful and open to feedback. Flexibility depends a lot on team and manager.
good,The culture changed over the years for the worse. Used to be a very fun/exciting place to work. Now it's micromanaged and most jobs are bing shipped to India.
good,Over the years company lost its customer service focus and became only sales oriented   Decisions were made from upper level management who didn’t understand the job.
good,"After being promoted to a team that is directly responsible for customer cases that have been escalated to the executives of the company, you would think you would be paid fairly coming up from a regular service agent. This does not happen even though you help with legal research and press/social media cases. Even while being at an advanced level, your tools fail site wide frequently"
good,Great workplace culture but workload can be overwhelming. Company encourages employees to pursue professional development. Most employees are great team players and work partners.
good,"I started 7 years ago, and we went from a Win based platform, to now almost a subsidiary of Amazon.   Only work there if you are into AWS.  Dev are all H1B."
good,Adorei trabalhar na Expedia e conheci pessoas maravilhosas. Infelizmente muitos sairam da empresa por falta de crescimento profissional.
good,If you are willing to work for a lower salary and not get deserved promotions then it is a great place to work. Some of the management is great others are not.
good,Great workplace culture. Everyone is willing to help with any questions or concerns. Definitely a place where you can be part of giving back to the community at any time.
good,"Many opportunities for growing as a young professional, international work environment, team work, trainings, good organization"
good,Face-paced environment with good people to work with. Stand out individuals within the organization. Benefits and perks are great.
good,"answering steady influx of calls for misbooked on website and fixing the problems"
good,Salary and benefits was very poor and also Job Security and Advancement. But the culture and management was great and I've learn a lot of this from this company.
good,Expediaでは世界一の旅行会社として、ホテル・航空券を扱う数もとても多く、効率的に仕事をこなすことを学びました。ですが、数が多いこともあり一人一人のお客様に対し時間を割く事があまりできませんでした。
good,"- opportunités de développement"
good,"As a sales agent for Expedia I answer phone calls and sell hotel rooms. I love interacting and talking with people from all walks of life. Every call is different and I find joy in fixing problems or finding the nest solution. What i've learned most about working for Expedia is patience but also boldness. Since it is a sales job the end goal is making the sale. The hardest part of the job for me is isolation, even though I talk to people on the phone all day, I never have time to interact with anyone around me and that bums me out. I life interacting and getting to know coworkers."
good,"Responsible for booking reservations for inbound customer contacts including but not limited to researching destinations, collaborating with management and other teammates, and booking reservation and reservation packages. I was able to learn a lot about Geography and other industry related information to assist customers in establishing vacation planning.  The most enjoyable part of the job came in pairing customers needs to packages whereas challenges arose in the fast fluctuations of prices movements. The most enjoyment came in the rewards and recognition and compensation program designed to pay for performance."
good,"Expedia, Inc. is a great company to work for with great salaries and benefits.  The team you are on will make or break your experience at Expedia.  Some teams are amazing while other produce a culture of favoritism, fakeness and sensitivity.  "
good,"The Company has a clear hierarchy, very good benefits, opportunities for self development, very slow career path and a lot of internal politics and procedures."
good,"My day at work is over the phone. i log in to my PC and start answering the customers calls. i help them to book their flights, hotel and trips. i learned a lot about the airports and the attractions around the world. i got the knowledge about the Canadian culture. Our management is not so efficient. i don't feel them around. some times i need some help from a supervisor but actually he is not around. My co-workers are very nice. we have fun in and out the work. we go the the fun zone in the company and play some video games or we go to eat together. The hardest part of my job is to understand the customer needs and wants to offer him the best option that satisfy him. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i ask the customer have i answered all your questions at the end of the call and they reply yes you did. you were very  helpful. Thank you very much."
good,"No real security at this organization, the culture was such where there was no depth of sense of belonging."
good,nice to work here. the vacation policy is more lenient than most call centers
good,"Expedia has been behind like 10 years on their software platforms for a long long time. Only recently they have been investing into developing them to be more competitive. I didn't have a particularly exciting experience working there but it wasn't terrible. Politics plays a major role in many of the teams. People here like to stay here, and there is a much better work-life balance compared to most other places. However on the compensation front as well it's about average. Their leadership has shown some promise in recent times and it's not a bad company to work for. If you are politically savvy and enjoy an average type of work experience (speaking for software engineers), you can thrive here."
good,"Expedia cullture is mediocre, not a lot to look forward to going into work under Curise Travel Agent position. The call center energy is cut-throat and can be very stressful."
good,"Fun place, good inviroment."
good,Depends on what level you are working at. Customers are already very irritated when they reach your level of communication and can be very abusive. That makes it an unpleasant working situation. The turnover is constant and it gives cause to wonder what is wrong there. Not enough pay for the work you do.
good,"Overall, a positive outlook but the pains of moving to the Expedia way are readily apparent. Not open to new ideas, mid-level managers are inexperienced and looking to prove they know everything. In my experience, there was no clear descriptions of role, inaccessibility of people necessary to get work done and no understanding of what a product manager is supposed to do. "
good,Expedia is great for work life balance. Its not fast paced like Amazon and people here tend to get into one position and never leave. You wont advance your career here much but if you want a comfortable job its a good place.
good,"Over 250 employees lost their jobs to outsource overseas. I wish that would not have happened, I enjoyed coming into work and they were a great company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work would begin with the Project Manger, Developer, key stakeholder, or someone from the Engineer team contacting me regarding my part of the SCRUM process. I would write BRDs, user stories, and test case scenarios after meeting with the stakeholders and project group. Then, I would begin regression testing. I would perform a check and balance on my tests by writing my own SQL queries for a final outcome."
good,overalll good place to work but other than that i really have nothing to say.
good,Working conditions were fair pay fair bonuses fair hours great over time available single mom of two and was very independent wish I had the opportunity again
good,"Cruise supervisor was super uptight about certain policies that she herself didn't follow completely. They don't have any flexibility in hours, even if you need a specific set of hours. I understand we have to work our personal life around our job life, but if multiple employees are quitting or being let go, their shifts should become available for other people who may need to work those hours due to it possibly being more accommodating."
good,this environment is new to Asian region. The jobs here doesnt have a proper guideliness or through knowledge base to refer if you are required to provide a support. A SOP was not properly defined. No career advancement out of this industry
good,"a typical work day at Expedia consisted of answering inbound sales and customer service calls. taking payments, selling cruses and answering cruise related questions."
good,they need to provide better pay for colleagues  and better structure
good,Working at Expedia is a great place to work. It will challenge you and enable you to work in an industry that really matters nowadays. The workplace culture was an environment that was great.
good,"...they practiced Scrum all the way through."
good,"Great benefits. Travel industry is always fun, but the luxury travel division lacks challenges for the average Silicon Valley employee."
good,"My role as Sales Manager at Expedia CruiseShipCenters, Ajax involved"
good,"a very good place to work. nice environment good work life balance."
good,"Overall I liked Expedia's working culture. People are open to discuss the problems, people do coordinate to solve the common problem, very friendly, and cooperative."
good,I loved my job here. I was saddened that it was only temporary. Tried to get back on but it seems they don’t like bringing temp workers back in. Only worry is if your contract will be extended or not and if you are going to be out of a job.
good,The company suffers from using the technologies from the time when they were part of MS. What that really means is that any change requires too much effort to implement.
good,job titles were removed and job roles are open. you can be asked to rack a server and build or sweep the floors and clean toilets. you will be used for whatever they need.
good,Gezellige collegas die een leuke omgeving maken.  Management moet echt meer aan hun transparency werken .
good,The culture at Expedia is one that does not promote transparency nor does it support growth. I've found that unless you are willing to bend your own personal convictions you will not move through the ranks.
good,"Expedia.it è una realtà del mondo del turismo. La richiesta è quella che ogni agente sia in grado nei tempi indicati dall'azienda di risolvere la domanda del cliente al primo contatto."
good,Overall great company / product.  The move to Elliott Bay is challenging for people that live on the East-side and not ideal with a 3 hour total commute each day.
good,"When you are performing well, management treats you great.  When your performance slips, you are nothing.  Don't buy into the mission/value statements, those don't matter."
good,It was a great job experience. They allowed a lot of independence as a freelance writer. They provided great compensation for the word done as well as travel reimbursements.
good,"Fine place to work, upper management is fine. Co-workers are fine.           E-commerce company gets affected with ups and downs too frequently. Many offices around the globe."
good,"Every day is a stressful as work load is high."
good,"If you love to travel, here's the place for you. Company still has the young vibe with most people in late 20 and 30's. Compensation is relatively competitive, but definitely not the best. Mid size company with some politics."
good,"Expedia provides an excellent benefits package and a good work/life balance. Not all managers are created equal. I, unfortunately, have worked with a manager that lacks the willingness to put in the time for training and appropriate guidance for influencing the successful output of work."
good,"I liked this job when it was a customer service positon. As soon as they changed it to a sales positon, I was out of there. When I was hired it was specifically to help customers, it got ugly when they gave me a sales quota. I'm not comfortable trying to get people to buy something they are sure they want and the quotas made me want to throw up."
good,HR is not very helpful sometimes feel like you are on your own if there is an issue.  But very fun atmosphere otherwise lots of great benefits and fun employee outings.
good,"Work/Life Balance & Career development are a couple of the biggest  issues for Expedia."
good,The best part of working at Expedia was your coworkers.  Due to the lack of training and the inexperience of management we helped each other as much as possible. Truly a team effort for success and putting the customer first.
good,Good company with a large set of teams working on different components. There are multiple areas and LOBs available to work for with good environment overall.
good,"In this position I first managed the geography in Nth America and then Asia Pacific where I was responsible for the creation, maintenance, and analysis of global geographic, administrative divisions, hotels, car vendors, points of interest, airports, train & metro stations, and mapping data across Expedia Inc. brands."
good,"Nice place to learn new things and update ourself, Management takes care about employees. Best place to learn new things. Friendly atmosphere. Everything is good"
good,"It was a good place to work when it was still HomeAway, although I have heard it's a little more corporate now that it was been taken over by Expedia."
good,"not much else to say, if you can handle being on the phones all the time it's a good spot. Expectations were a bit high on the sales quotas but not too bad on everything else."
good,"Expedia was a great place to work with the exception to the mishandling and misleading approach to any kind of employee leave , whether it be for bereavement or medical emergency any kind of unplanned leave was frowned upon and usually resulted in corrective action or unemployment no matter the case or the person."
good,"I interned at Expedia. While the work was interesting, management was very strict and not friendly. Workplace culture is awesome, motivating but relaxing."
good,"Expedia is a great company in general and if you work directly for Expedia Inc., they offer some awesome benefits. The escalations department in Nevada is challenging due to a job culture that unfortunately messy in mired in office politics that should not affect how management treats others and handles disciplinary actions. The benefits package is really great and someone who has a goal in mind and can balance the work life in that atmosphere can succeed."
good,"Es un lugar bueno para trabajar, pero un consejo: debes estar muy al tanto de tus responsabilidades"
good,"Expedia has a diverse working environment. Some flexibility with work schedule. Management changes often which can be frustrating. Growing company, but maybe a little too fast."
good,I didn't work there very long but I got promoted within the first year. I would have stayed if I didn't moved to fort worth which was too far for me to travel.
good,"I enjoyed the corporate culture at Expedia, but new and inexperienced leadership was a constant problem, poor vision, lack of direction, and immature / insecure."
good,Good work environment and great team work. Everyone works great together and the perks and benefits the company offers are good. The work is steady and there is always work to be done.
good,"Overall, it's a good company to work for. There is a new CEO. The direction going forward is uncertain as Expedia tries to grow and encounters more competition."
good,"Expedia is a fun workplace. They offer a variety of benefits, and lots of opportunities to expand your knowledge within the company. The have office all over the world if your looking to relocate to a specific location."
good,Expedia is a great place to work as long as your leadership chan is good. It can range from hands on to micro-manage so finding the one that aligns best with your style is key.
good,"Nice place to work until you are working directly with teams based in U.S. "
good,Expedia has a good work environment. Human resources does a good job with rewarding performance and coordinating employee events. Great employee travel benefits.
good,"Nice place to work and aquire new skills. Employees manage themselves for the most part, Leads and Supervisors are very hands off when it comes to managing their teams.EXCELLENT pay rate for contractors, but very few opportunities for career advancement from coming in as a contractor to being promoted to FTE."
good,"A typical day at Expedia starts with meetings."
good,Pays well. That's all I have to say. Feel free to check it out for yourself. The application process is simply dress code is relaxed. Structure is lacking which is why I'm looking for something new.
good,It's a company growing very fast.  Seems to have a lot of turnover in upper management positions so direction can be a challenge with lots of manager changes.
good,"Expedia's Air Fulfillment Department provided the greates experience when it came to troubleshooting and resolving flight ticket reject issues.,"
good,A very innovative and fun place to work. Co-workers are smart and driven.  Best in class product development. The culture can be tough - but you work hard and you play hard. Travel perks are a plus.
good,Amazing pay potential. Good working environment. Union job but lacks ability to make a difference. Company demands at times to strenuous.
good,"Working for Expedia/Hotels.com was nothing new in a respect that it was a call center. But what we were doing was. With any new job I was always nervous especially with not knowing anyone. But as always everyone was welcoming! The pay was great and everyday was different. Since I was such a quick learner I was always selected to help new employees, listen in on their calls and give pointers. Selected for special projects, supervising the floor etc. I started to learn patience with those that weren't as swift learners as myself or others. And to have compassion on those that felt like quitting. And also started to push people towards wanting and to do better regardless of the numbers or past experiences or failures. The hardest part was providing back a negative report…and the most enjoyable part was making not only a clients' day but a new coworker; in lending a helping hand along with a smile of encouragement."
good,"great co-workers"
good,"Directed North American operations for dynamic division of Expedia, Inc.  Business owner with full P&L responsibility generating annual revenue.  Exceeded plan by 45% during worst economic recession in decades.  Increased EBITDA by YOY.  Enriched 10 managers and influenced 120+ personnel."
good,"Expedia is an excellent environment for those looking to carve out a career in e commerce. There is a huge focus on technology rather than just travel and therefore a skill set that can be applied to many industries outside of travel can be developed. It is an environment where challenging is very much encouraged and constant evolution and improvement demanded. It is fast paced, casual, smart, fun and an excellent place for those looking to step up early in their career."
good,Team leads were very helpful with any questions or issues that may arise. Very personable atmosphere.
good,Took inbound calls for customers looking to book hotels.  Moved desks every day.  Learning the geography of the cities your clients were looking to stay in was fun and interesting.  Constant schedule changes were the worst part of the job.
good,During my time at Expedia I have gained tremendous experience in payments and enjoyed many great experiences.
good,We sat on the phones and assisted customers with their travel needs and questions they presented. The management team was extremely helpful and always right there for us. The hardest part of the job was making the sale itself because customers would ask questions and decide to make arrangements themselves off the phone instead of allowing us to assist them.
good,"Felt like a number most of the time. Sometimes Supervisors would take 45 minute smoke breaks in the evening, leaving you floundering if you had a difficult call that caused you to need help from a supervisor."
good,Storage Area Networking support for EMC and NetApp. Use Symantec Veritas Netbackup and lots of other tools to manage the environment. Really enjoyed my co-workers and friends I met there.
good,"One of the companies, you want to keep working for. Excellent management in distributing team work."
good,There are very high sales goals at this position.
good,"Fun place to work with good technologies to learn and explore. I have learnt a lot of backend technologies along with several big data technologies like spark, emr, etc"
good,I really enjoyed my time at Expedia.  They have a great office culture and hire really great people.  Salaries are fair and benefits are really good.  Not too much room for advancement.
good,"Overall it's a great company, it just has a few departments that change so much you don't have any security. Also, some of the departments seem to have goals that run contradictory to one another so it can make anyone getting their job done really hard."
good,Expedia isn't a bad place at all. I just didn't fit in. I relocated from LA and worked in entertainment before coming to Expedia. We all worked different hours (9:30-6) and used Macs and I wasn't used to the rain. I left Expedia purely for these reasons. The company is a great company otherwise. The work was good and the people are nice.
good,"I loved the work environment, very chilled and laid back. The people are wonderful to work with, and super friendly, no big egos.  Get place to work for all ages."
good,"Great company where you can learn a lot from. Changes quickly but still have time to have a good work/life balance. "
good,"Lots of options or advancement, really up to you, also lots of fun with great benefits. Overall a place that is fun to work that callings you everyday, especially in the position that I held."
good,"My team was responsible for any changes made to invoices issued in previous months.  I learned a great deal about Excel giving me a basic understanding of the fundamentals of the program.  Expedia was a wonderful place to work.  I was not able to continue employment there due to personal issues, which I have since learned to manage."
good,"Expedia in general is a wonderful company to work for in comparison to other travel company's."
good,"Expedia can be ancient in some aspects. There were definitely more males than females - however, they're huge on work life balance and vacation, travel! Great perk to this company."
good,"I worked for Expedia, Inc. for eight years and four months. During that time i had four permanent directors and one person who served as interim director twice. I loved the company and the experience it provided. I also enjoyed my co-workers. We worked as a team. Our last director did not operate the way we were accustom to. She is concerned about quantity of work and not quality. There were 10 people on our team when she joined us. There is only one person left from that group. In fact she hired a young man she worked with from Microsoft, her previous employer. He tenured his resignation due to stress in Dec 2015. "
good,"I love the relationship between employees and the supervisors. everyone seems to be working as a family. Moreover, it enhanced my communication skills both in written and oral."
good,"It's an interesting job, which allows you to learn a lot about travel and tourism including how things work in the background. I didn't know so much went on in a travel agency."
good,Company is surrounded with smart and intelligent people who are friendly and passionate about working in a collaborative environment.
good,"Great travel company, lots of opportunity for various types of jobs. Great culture and somewhat of a good work life balance"
good,"Over all the work experience with expedia was good. The management was typical, My team lead was not liberal in understanding the views of the coworkers, and was a little problamatic, But other then that everything was fine"
good,I work in escalations so its demanding and at times very interesting with the calls i receive on a regular basis.
good,"I've been working for Expedia for 1 year and 3 months, as a Contractor. "
good,great employess and fun projects to learn and delivery on-time
good,"It was a good company to work for. Excellent benefits. Health,Vision and Dental. The company atmosphere was good as well. Very willing to help. Just a lot of technology issues."
good,"Expedia was a good place to work, with flexible hours for my position, great people, and a casual laid back atmosphere most of the time. I unfortunately, fell into a department that the executives at the company were actively trying to dissolve. The management, was competent for my area, with a hands off nature that was a pleasure to work under. However, they were very disjointed at times. No amount of restructures and transformations was every satisfactory, and we were constantly being moving around and torn apart as a team."
good,"The company is a very positive place in which to work, but does suffer somewhat from a lack of advancement opportunities.  Days could vacillate between very stressful and nearly stress free, depending on call volume and available manpower, along with the time of year... vacation season was high volume, off season much less so.  The corporate culture is more relaxed than many, and there is a very prevalent sense of the company taking care of its people as much as possible.  The aforementioned, as with almost any company, would regularly take a ""back seat"" to the bottom line."
good,"This is a fun place to work, but they tended to only promote their favorites regardless of skill level when I was employed.  Once you get to a certain point within the company, it's like you are stuck in this glass ceiling,."
good,Expedia is good if your manager is good. Lot of facilities. But some managers from US will give you such a bad treatment that I have seen few people in my team ( even I ) resigning from the company without another offer in hand.
good,"I've really enjoyed my time at Expedia. And I've put in almost 11 years and generally it's a good place to work. Like other companies of comparable size nothing is perfect. For me, the overall group I'm in (about 2000 people) is just getting too big and process driven. So I'd like to find a more intimate environment if I can."
good,"fun workplace,friendly environments more incentives,pressured but its not permanent work,you dont know when to end the contract of the project or the account."
good,"Prons:"
good,"Expedia gives ample opportunity to tryout new things. Its a test and learn environment. Out of the box recruiting."
good,Faltan muchos cambios los cuales estan haciendo por que la empresa es joven en cancun y no tienen bien estipulado todo
good,Empresa com bom salário e ótimos benefícios. Infelizmente o RH no brasil é muito aquem e alinhamento com o RH global não existe.
good,"This is a great company to work for but the job it's self is very stressful. There is room for growth and advancement if you are willing to put in the hours. The company tries to distract you from the bullcrap policies by catering lunches, parties, and other things. Overall not a bad place to work if your okay with the stressful job that you have to do in every department."
good,"I learned lot of things here "
good,"This is the right please to learn about customer satisfaction , and about airlines and ticketing process, "
good,"- Entreprise modern, basé sur un model très américain. "
good,"Management doesn't care about you."
good,Good job to have but hard to move up. Many people have left due to not being able to obtain growth. I worked as a concierge with Expedia  Local Expert. They are flexible with school which is good.
good,"Fast pace, always busy. Great co-workers always willing to and support their co-workers. Rewarding the team members monthly when team goals are met."
good,It was fun because the job was always finding ways for us to better ourselves by competing as teams and scoring each other on casual days. Plaing fun games was always the best...
good,Expedia.com is a travel company. There is a diverse workforce in many different groups.

good,"Expedia is an excellent place to work, with a variety of cultures. We have people from all over the world."
good,"Die Arbeit in einem jungen, dynamischen Team hat Spaß gemacht - Expedia ist ein toller Arbeitgeber mit vielen interessanten Zusatzleistungen. Schade ist nur, dass man sich intern nur weiterentwickeln kann, wenn man bereit ist umzuziehen."
good,"Security 24/7, 3 shifts, ability to change departments, friendly staff on all tiers of work status. Management informative when changes arise. additional training available when changes are made to your work position."
good,"Great place to work with good tech-stack to learn. Work-life balance is good overall but is subjective to teams you work in. Expedia is a good pay master in Gurgaon region as compared to other companies."
good,"Supervisors are nice, there are several different shifts available and it was a fairly laid back environment.  I would  and have recommended this job to people."
good,"Pretty good benefits "
good,"Great place to work, I would recommend Expedia to anyone. Why are you making me do this, I have no desire to rate my current employer, this should be voluntary."
good,"A typical day at work is being surrounded by a very friendly environment and fun where on your busiest and bad days everyone manages to make you smile, loads of events on a weekly basis which is great for networking. "
good,"Working at Expedia for the past five years has been very rewarding. I have grown so much in this role. I work with a great team and we have a work hard, play hard motto. Since being at Expedia I have traveled more than I have ever before and this is possible with the generous PTO we get and the travel discounts as employees."
good,"Over the six years I worked at Expedia, management has really made an effort to offer flexibility for work/life balance, within the limitations of a 24/7 call center."
good,There are lots of opportunities available and the benefits are great.  Good atmosphere to work in and some positions offer opportunities to work from home.
good,"Expedia can be tough if you don;t have the skills, but If you do, its a great place to work.   One downsize is they are constantly reorganizing management."
good,Good start for a beginners in Expedia.more of a travel industry which is more fun to work..get a experience of working in bpo.management is not very good.it demands a lot for employees
good,"learning and a relaxed work environment, "
good,Good job and career with excellent benefits.  Limited career growth potential in Springfield.  Very liberal company that freely expresses  political views.  Leadership can be awesome or awful.  Decent work/home life balance.
good,"Expedia is best place to work and work place culture and environment is excellent."
good,"If you are based in Bellevue or London, there are a number of avenues for advancement.  If you are located in a satellite office, advancement is much more of a challenge."
good,Expedia is a really good company and promotes a work/life balance.  They struggle with all of the acquired companies but are putting it all together.  Leadership is outstanding and a much better culture than the other Seattle tech companies.
good,"innovative, fun, place to work- supportive management- multicultural- progression- fats paced - family focused- learning and development "
good,Expedia was my 1st BPO experience. Love and Fun place to work. Lots of engagement that built team work. What they need to improve on though before was the change of incentives target monthly.
good,"Great place to learn the fundamentals of an eCommerce business. Not a lot of room for innovation, more pragmatic execution and application of fundamentals."
good,The work was exciting. A good place for someone to grow/learn. Hardest part was unsupportive leadership in Global Customer Ops group.
good,"Customer service rep, sales rep. and leader. I helped take customers info and make leads sales. I picked up inbound calls and outbound calls. Goal setting and meetings"
good,it is a very social place with a great knowledge and ability to solve problems what ever it was to make the customers satisfied and what was really great when receiving a phone call from a customer they know the solution of his problem within the first minute and working to solve it by the time the customer end talking they already solved his problem
good,"Expedia is an internet travel company.  They have great benefits with a yearly travel reimbursement program, and the people are great."
good,"Great work life balance, coupled with team members who are passionate about travel. Competitive benefit packages for all types of employees"
good,"Exceptionnel , enrichissant, perspective carrière à l'international, responsabilité"
good,"A typical workday with Classic Vacations Customer Service would consist of receiving calls from clients, vendors and travel agents ranging from something as simple as confirming a reservation to things as complex as flight changes, expired passports, and change in destination. Regardless of the types of calls we receive, I feel it's always important to give your best effort to satisfy our clients. "
good,"Worked in the Supplier Relations department where I researched and resolved payment questions and issues for vendors and managers."
good,"I Have been working with expedia since may 2012 ,have learn so many things over there .Since it was my first company  so my overall growth went under the culture of Expedia .All team mates work under the moto of one team concept ."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Expedia.com. It was always a fun, friendly exciting workplace. Unfortunately when I was employed there the company was in the process of being so unbenounced to us employees's until the change had been made, Our pay structure considerably dropped drastically immediately after and I seriously couldn't afford to commute there and make it beneficial for my family any longer."
good,I learned how to work with different department within a major Fortune 500 company.
good,"As a resolutions department team, we work together to ensure our companies policy and ensure our customers a enjoyable vacation. We have daily tasks we each work on collectively and as a whole."
good,We get 10 an hour plus commission which it great 5 years ago but its gets harder every year because you have to battle internet price on tickets. Overall its much better than a regular retail job
good,"Generally friendly and knowledge sharing culture. Decent diversity and rarely feeling left out or dominant by any demographic dimension. "
good,This is not that expedia they used to be called kochway distributions and changed their name It was a good company the Boss paid us well it was never a problem
good,"Good place to work"
good,"I Help customer plan Cruise and look up On Ship , activities.Help caller plan vacation, Hotel, Car, Airline transfers. I  ask customer they give deposit, I Key card number and I set up email amount."
good,I worked in several departments here for 9 years. I had a life changing event that I struggled to get over. My only problem is that after being here 9 years they gave no severance.
good,"Expedia was a tremendous place to work. Quality people, management and developers work together to change and improve. Were there problems? Yes. Was there reflection and change to improve? Yes. I am a better developer due to being part of that environment and I'm glad I had the opportunity."
good,"great family culture"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Expedia; my reason for leaving was personal and not related to job satisfaction whatsoever. The company has considerable untapped potential; leaders are aware. They do tend to take a more conservative approach to growth; I would have liked to see more risk taking, but it does seem to be working for them. I would not hesitate to recommend Expedia as a great place to work for my friends."
good,"Expedia was a great place to work. I had no call center experience prior to working there. They give you the training you need and are always willing to help throughout your time there. It was a busy job, but it was fun. Great people and always room to grow."
good,"Hotels.com was a great place to work for, also had fun day and game day. Enjoy making reservation for customer. Never had dislike with Hotels.com management was great."
good,Work balance is largely dependent on group. Management doesn't do the best job clearly communicating vision or communicating development opportunities.
good,APAC leadership suffers in comparison - great team and culture worldwide. Great quality of peers. Downside: Little support from an overextended product team in London
good,Good place to work I really enjoyed my time there. Workplace Culture is good. I worked in the inbound sales department and really enjoyed it. Hardest park of the job was keeping consistent pay
good,"Expedia Springfield office is a great place to work. Great pay, benefits, culture. Definitely an amazing opportunity for new graduates and those ready to go global with their careers."
good,In certain departments there is flex time. EGP allows employees to come into work between 6AM and 1030AM depending on your work schedule. We all work hard and play hard. The benefits are outstanding and there is room for advancement as long as you are willing to relocate.
good,"Expedia offer's great pay, job stability, and awesome benefits. A great place to work. If you can get pass the bogus shift bidding, then call center environment is worth a shot."
good,"My typical work day included, but not limited to heavy telephone, customer service, data entry and invoicing.  I learned a lot about marketing.  Management was nice.  There was a lot of room for promotion.  During my stay at Expedia, I was promoted 3 times in 1 year.  Co-workers were typical, some friendly, some not so friendly.  The hardest part of  the job was working on some Sundays.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people from all over the country."
good,"Very busy phones taking to all kinds of people on a day to day basis.  I have learned lite sales heavy escalations and how to handle extremely irate people.  The management I good here I have never had a problem with any supervisor in my 3 years here, I get along with everyone I work with,"
good,"Expedia is a past-faced, ever-changing company.  The benefits are wonderful and the employees are dynamic and colorful.  The most difficult part of Market Management is the lack of training and lack of direction from your Superiors.  You are thrown into your role and expected to know how to use the programs, where to find data, how to interpret data, what questions to ask, whom do you ask to answer those questions, etc.  Also, 50% travel to your markets."
good,Satisfy with the time I work for this company until they started to make drastic changes and made it very overwhelming. Company has great benefits and pay.
good,Tremendous leadership.  Always busy.  Corporate presentations were essential either via conference call or face to face
good,Great company providing an opportunity for entering the world of travel planning.  It is certainly an environment that provides learning on an ongoing basis.  Franchise Partners are there to be utilized for answering questions on a daily basis.  Co-workers can also be learned from based on their area(s) of expertise.  The hardest part of this job is a combination of commission-only pay and learning all the options available for the effective booking of travel.
good,"I loved working at Expedia, especially all the travel perks!  The Senior Management was great, but some of the people they hired in Middle Management were pathetic.  "
good,"Great team to organise events for. Team work, friendly, hard working and supportive."
good,"•	Picked up incoming calls for Cruises"
good,"I loved working for Expedia.  It provided me career development and growth in the 4+ years I worked there.  It was there, that I developed my passion for training and coaching.  My skills were recognized by leadership and I was given opportunities to advance.  My day to day was different depending on the classes I was training.  The call center environment was lively.  Just like with any other call center, there was a lack of communication at times. It's a great place to work."
good,A great company that moves fast. The culture is mostly positive.  Work/life balance is challenging in some departments.
good,"Good management, though maybe too high a ratio of management to engineers at times. I joined a team working on a new internal software application and saw it grow from 20 people to 140 people. Generally extremely fast-paced, and my hours varied from 70/wk at the beginning of the project to 40/wk at the end. "
good,"Create and Execute test cases, report Test execution status and Defect metrics for projects with sophisticated test management tools"
good,I had a long and positive experience with this Company. My daily work changed with the company's changes. I had the possibility to meet a lot of interesting people from all over the world. I learnt a lot of the hospitality industry.
good,The atmosphere and people here are both open and friendly. I wish I could have stayed longer.
good,"My internship was a little rough as my project was not established until halfway through my internship. My team was not ready for an intern and the onboarding process was rough and slow. Besides wasting half of my internship, the culture is welcoming and friendly. Everyone is committed to the company and the mission."
good,"Expedia offers good work life balance & opportunities to grow across various brands under Expedia group. If you are passionate about technology & travel, Expedia is place to be."
good,"I  like working for Expedia and i work recommend working for expedia"
good,"It was ok. The location is prime in summerlin. No covered parking, so it does get hot in the summer. Plus they have an xbox and small store on site. You can also leave for lunch."
good,"This is where I started my sales career back in 2002. The culture was great, the training was great, and it was an overall great experience. The foundational skills I learned here helped catapult me into bigger opportunities down the road."
good,"I enjoyed learning the travel ind.  Set air fare, cruise, hotels.  This was a fast paced job. I enjoyed working for them.  Also I handled any problem the customer might have had.  The company had to cut down the amount of employees."
good,"Average benefits and salaries, however good life-work balance and travel perks. Work environment really depends on specific team. Good choice for travel lovers - good vacation and travel benefits"
good,I enjoyed my time at Expedia. The management was always good to work with. Benefits were amazing . Company events were always enjoyable and made time there as one of the best places to work.
good,"The typical workday is from 9-5, with a standup meeting in the morning. Not necessarily the most technically advanced or fast-paced company, but has a very friendly workplace culture."
good,I enjoyed working here greatly. The employees and management are great. The benefits are limitless and pay is just right. I would work here again if I ever moved back!
good,Expedia provides all necessary training to their employees. They are generous and they make sure that all errors are being studied and being worked to with to be resolved.
good,"I was recently at Expedia on a contract and had wonderful time while there. Culture, work life balance, and other perks made this a great place to work. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new challenge."
good,Expedia is fun to work with. Good pay package and easy going life. Less political. Medium paced. Your learning depends on you. You may not learn anything or you may learn a lot.
good,"Expedia offer great Benefits,discounts and many hours of PTO. In the branch I was working, there were not many opportunities to grow but I enjoyed working at EXPEDIA."
good,"Not sure company has changed since i worked there. It used to be great now its terrible. Back to back calls all day long, short lunch time and hard to advance in company."
good,"Great workplace with a great team, and a visionary leadership. UK has a great work/life balance, and new offices very central to the city,and close to clients"
good,"very professional , beneficial , great work environment and good salary in the Egyptian market ,"
good,We had a great time playing ping pong on the bottom floor. We had tournaments formed depending on your your playing status. I loved that morale that it gave us.
good,They have an intricate and well-planned architecture which is guarded by a detailed code review process.  Good support for ergonomics.  Fast-paced development cycle will never leave you looking for work.  Not  so much connectivity with your fellow employees.
good,"There is room for advancement as long as you get out of sales. In the sales environment you are pretty much stuck.  If you have any other marketable skills, do your time and post out."
good,"Most of the jobs are available in the headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, and if you are willing to move there, there are great career advancement opportunities.  Opportunities in other Expedia offices are minimal, but they design the salary window to allow people to stay at one position for more than 20 years if so desired."
good,"Helping customer's plan their cruises, trips, and excursions.  Accepted payments.  Answered questions for customer's on type of cruises, and about the excursions."
good,"Lots of changes, always..... but that kept it lively! The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers, the people. Hardest part of the job was not much flexibility during peak season, it was understandable with a organization that size."
good,"Expedia Australia was fun and a great life experience for me. The position I was working was not what I had thought it would be, including significant off-hours production support work, but otherwise a great company."
good,"The job is extremely easy with good pay and excellent benefits. Potluck each month for bdays, baby showers, etc. Very fun and diverse group. Two 15 min breaks and a lunch break, the location of job is near by anything you can think of if you want to go out to eat during lunch."
good,"Era una experiencia muy importante en mi vida y aprendía mucho pero el tiempo de descanso no era muy flexible."
good,Global company with a lot of employees. Smaller regional point of sales do not have a lot of say. Good work/life balance. Fun work environment. Family type workplace.
good,"Best Part of Expedia is work and life balance."
good,"Good management support, good perks, good culture. Everyones very supportive with growth and career path goals. "
good,Racking and stacking servers and cabling them in the rack. pulled tapes from the back and got them ready of the off site to picked them up. installed the image from image servers between 50 to 100 servers per shift. take care of the hardware RMA between Expedia and vendor.

good,Good place to get handsome experience on travel related servies and GDS knowledge as you work on Amadeus and Worldspan.However you should be ready to work in shifts and extend whenever needed.
good,"Great place to be if you want to have a life. Lots of food, networking opportunities, and entrepreneur atmosphere. Still growing, and lots of opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"Interesting Office Life "
good,"You can drink, show up, not show up, be drunk, do your work, not do your work...it really doesn't matter.  What matters is to not draw attention to yourself.  Do not under any circumstances care about your work.  You'll do fine and probably get promoted."
good,Expedia is an amazing company however there isn't an income potential that I would prefer. The supervisors and staff are amazing to work for and with however there isn't an opportunity for advancement
good,"Great place to work. Open 24/7 year-round."
good,I love my job.  The company is great to work for.  I would recommend for anyone.  The company does a lot of fun things for there employees to keep moral up and work days fun.

good,"Great place to give a start!"
good,"This place is awesome, it really is work though. The location is nice, the people can be friendly, and there is ALWAYS food."
good,"This is a great company to work for, great benefits, great employees. Management is excessive and promotes at times unobtainable goals."
good,"If you are looking for growth, this company does not encourage it."
good,I enjoy working with talented people at Expedia. The work place is a team environment and encourages everyone to participate in team discussions to share and implement ideas.
good,"Its a good place to work.I have learned few new methodologies and concepts. Management is good. Very strong logical, analytical skills with vast experience in .Net 2.0,3.5, ASP.NET, MCV 3.0,  C#, Web Service, WCF Services, Oracle, PL/SQL, Fermat 10.0."

good,Monitor and Manage multi call center on realtime. Work with Support team to quickly resolve and call center tool issues that arise through the day. Provide 3 daily reports to senior management.
good,"I like working for Expedia. As with many corporate environments it has its issues (do we ever think we're getting paid enough?) but the management I've been fortunate to have has been excellent. If an employee is independent and strongly motivated to find solutions to problems, they will excel here. There is very little micro-management for responsible, smart and assertive people."
good,"Springfield Missouri is great place if you are looking for restaurants and shopping. I wouldn't classify it as a great place to look for Information Technology jobs. However, three years ago I was surprised to find an opening for a Java Programmer/Analyst at an Expedia branch office. When I got to the interview it was quickly apparent that these guys were serious about software development. The interview questions ranged from specific java functionality, to design patterns, to programming language theory."
good,"The company itself is great, but most of managers in Egypt are not that good. They are just bossing more than leading their teams; in the other hand, the compensations and the allowances are quite good."
good,"I loved working for Expedia. I would still be there if two of my supervisors had known anything about the job in which they were supervising. However, I left for a higher paying job. I would recommend the company."
good,"Expedia is a well ordered, well established engineering organization.  They have great benefits and excellent work life balance.  The people are awesome and the management is generally professional and highly skilled in their own right."

good,"But stay away from working in Operations."

good,"Excellent place to work and earn good money, but only if you stay being professional. This makes you close to management and keeps your pockets healthy too."
good,"I'm a contract Recruiter and love it. I received comprehensive training and onboarding from my manager. She still supports me daily and always has an open ear for questions. "
good,"Pros:"
good,Great place to work. If I could change one thing it would be the excessive changes. Changes are needed to stay in the game but change just to change is stressful on employees and ineffective.
good,"Expedia has a good sense of work/life balance. They don't pay as well as other companies, but it's a good place of employment. Beautiful surrounds and close to the transit center."
good,"It is a great place to work, I really enjoy my time here, they are fair and are very helpful with everything I have ever needed.the working environment is fantastic."
good,the benefits they give are pretty great. They have team builders where we all go out as a team and do fun stuff. We have food at work all the time. The way the management is there for you is amazing. Some management you can just tell their only there for a paying job. They coach you listen to you most of the time attempt to help you.
good,"Great company to work with, good salary, good trainings, employee benefits, onsite visits. A great career opportunity for freshers as well.  "
good,If you are on the right team and brand there is great work/life balance. Benefits are good especially having the added health & travel benefits. I really enjoyed the team I worked with.

good,great place to work as family center person. Balance work and family life. You will be sure to have time to accompany with your value family members. Also you can improve your skill set in this company.
good,"Some terrific people here but, like anywhere there are some subpar performers hiding out. Kind of a hesitant culture which is a bit of a disconnect from the CEO's risk appetite but meh, that's what happens down stream. I'd send my friends and family to work here."
good,"Expedia provide an excellent office environment with the best equipment for your job. All staff are friendly and helpful and management always listen to issues and act quickly. They hold team breakfasts and drinks once a month."
good,"great place to work"
good,"Expedia Group, Inc. is a fast-paced work environment.  Expedia facilitates travel, yet they are really an IT company.  You will do well here if you are a hard working initiator with a bias toward action."
good,"Each day was different from the next. You are constantly changing your attitude, persona, demeanor to match your guest and their needs.  Hardest part is the sales aspect, where if it is slow and tourists are not in your hotels, you are not making money.  Busy seasons are incredible for your pay, but also come with the stress of being ""on"" for 10-12 hrs a day.  You're dealing with with a number of guests that believe their needs come first and you're constantly trying to set expectations and meet everyone's needs."
good,The facilitates and work culture is amazing. Employee benefits are fantastic and care is taken towards development of employees. The chances of innovations at work place is limited.
good,"It was an inbound call center where customers would call in to book hotel rooms, I had to convince the customers to book the rooms which they had called in for regarding inquiry.  After 5 months I was upskilled for packages wherein I dealt with not only hotels but flights and car rentals too."

good,Exciting work environment!
good,Work life balance is excellent. Very good salary and benefits. Leadership is very supportive. A lot of travels involved to make work enjoyable and fun
good,Expedia has a great work environment to learn and grow. Management is always there to help and has an open door policy at all times. There are always opportunities to grow to other fields within the company if so desired. There are also tons of opportunities to travel since this is a travel company as well.
good,"generous employer with friendly people from all over the world, chances to develop, flexible working hours with option to work from home from time to time, modern spirit"
good,I loved working for Expedia. I worked there for nearly 8 years before they laid off the Tacoma center. It was a very friendly environment and I worked several positions within the company. We had teams that would hang out together outside of work and were close to our co-workers. 
good,"Expedia brings the best things in travel to their customers, both the Hotels and the end customer.  Their attention to detail and urgent nature of the business makes it a great company."
good,"This position offers a lot of flexibility and allows you to manage your time to suit your circumstances. The franchise owner is really genial and amenable and has the ability to work with just about everybody."
good,"Multi-cultural place to work for. "
good,My supervisor was the greatest! The company knows the task can be somewhat draining so they always come up with fun stuff to do. Decent pay... However for the job I was doing it was kinda on the low side... However the perks of the benefits made up for it.
good,"Employee friendly and great place to work"
good,I have learned many things upon working in the company for almost a year. It gave me confidence talking in english and answering telephone calls. It also help me salary wise.
good,"Great place to work , very passionate place with option for growth ..."
good,"Proactively manage and communicate project status, issues & risks to management."
good,"Respects employees."
good,"The company has great benefits from travel down to PTO. There's a real push towards developing you to fit goals you design for yourself. Could use a bump in pay, but as far as a start to your career it's great."
good,The company offers wonderful benefits the following month after you are hired.  The office is located in Summerlin which is a very good location to work at.
good,Expedia is a great place to work with excellent perks. I would highly recommend working here. My favorite aspect are the co-workers that made each day better.
good,"Limited opportunities given."
good,"This position has given me the most creative license in coaching and developing employees.  Expedia breeds a culture of working hard, but also being playful at work.  They are not afraid to try a new process, fail, learn and move on."
good,During the time period I was there I was able to learn what I could and really develop myself as a junior software developer. The hardest part about the days were the challenging aspects of the code that had to be consulted with my group.

I must say we have a great management team.My co-workers are very Fun and very entertaining they make the day go by very fast. Saying no and sticking to it, is the hardest part of my job. Having a satisfied customer is the best part of my job."

good,"Expedia Inc. has a great work environment, it is engaging and professional."
good,"My tenure at Expedia was so long ago, I'm unclear as how any opinion that I have would help current job seekers.  Any information I have is stale as management has completely turned over many times, and the company has grown drastically."
good,Expedia is a good place to work...but it really depends on what department you're in & who your manager is. It has excellent benefits. Management at the highest level is good...however...at the lower levels it's kind of a lord of the flies situation
good,Expedia is great place for work and very nice company with amazing colleagues and friends. i learned a lot through training and from very talented people and enjoy working there everyday .
good,"Good career growth opportunity."
good,This job was very challenging. I learned something new everyday.

good,"I've worked at Expedia for the past 7 years in multiple offices across the country. I really enjoyed it. Work -life balance is great there, though you are expected to check your e-mail on the weekend. Benefits are also good. I've gone for medical check-ups and had people commit how good my insurance is."
good,Leadership is too involved in goofy off rather than helping people develop their skills to advance.  Very poor review process and was left to learn on my own.
good,Good Place to work .  Support leadership is good committed to quality.  Easy Scheduling.  Technology performance is standard with all the other travel management companies.  Same issues with same responses.  I feel if your honest with them they will be accepting.  My only issue was technology and providing documentation but still being held accountable.  Overall for a business environment i would recommend.  They shadow everything it a bit intrusive but none the less  committed to customer satisfaction at any cost.
good,"Good work-life balance, very interesting projects. Different technologies and tools. Some of team are working with cutting edge technologies and extremely interesting tasks."

good,"I worked at Expedia Canada, when I was in my second year of college. It was very hard to have a full time job, where I worked 9 hours and had to go to college everyday. I had to take night shifts from 5 pm to 2 am, and I had to plan my college schedule around my work hours. I got home at 4 am everyday, but I was happy. It felt like my day was divided into two days. I was productive. Literary, it was like I lived two different lives with different people. It was exciting and enjoyable. I gained lots of problem solving skills, and learned how to work on saber program, which is a ticketing program used by airlines, also I documented calls and received quality ratings. I learned how to turn ones anger into satisfaction and to read people just by listening to their voice. Tuning ones anger into satisfaction or even joy was one of the most important things that work taught me."

good,"Working for Expedia has really helped me to grow my customer service skills, along with learning to handle large groups and scheduling multiple activities. The shifts are typically 7 hours long and the motto is any desk, any time, anywhere. You get to meet a diverse amount of people and you will learn a lot along the way."
