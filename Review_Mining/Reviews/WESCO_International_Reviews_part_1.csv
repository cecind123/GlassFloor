bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work, plant manager is horrible, does not care about anyone, constantly talks down to you. There are no perks to this company, if you are sick they take your vacation days plus give you points, so in other words you cannot be sick, no bonuses except for big bosses. Don’t expect to get anywhere in this company unless ur a brown nose. Very high turnover employees. Stay clear..."
bad,"Lack of management, no motivation, culture, morale or positive feedback. Overworked employees and never a job well done. I was here less than a year and I do not see how people survive longer."
bad,"Wesco pays you hourly and makes you clock in and out. I, as well as others, were forced to work overtime off the clock and unpaid. If you mention employment laws, then you will be targeted and forced to quit. Wesco likes to break employment laws and force you to work for free."
bad,"Unorganized, unsafe place to work.....beware! Do not keep their machinery safely maintained. Inept management. If you do the bare minimum but kiss bosses but you will do ok."
bad,"If you love micromanagement and 10 people telling you how to do your job at the same time, Wesco is the place for you. Toxic work environment where management is in meetings for 90% of the day and the other 10% is going over everything negative that they can possibly find. No matter how hard you work, they will see you as a number and nothing else."
bad,"Not a fun place to work at all. Management was very bipolar. the work was not hard at all, the coworkers is what made the job fun . the environment was very boring"
bad,"If you want to work for a company where you are treated with respect, don’t work for Wesco. The management will say one thing but does not follow through. In addition, management has very poor communication skills and it’s very likely that you may be doing something completely different without any notice or support. It’s not a fun place to work."
bad,"Horrible company. Don't bother, keep looking! They don't pay what their employees are worth, and look at you like you're replaceable   They sure make sure to pay their executives a lot of money however. Horrible company. Five years of my life I'll never get back!"
bad,Absolutely horrible company to work for. No training what so ever. You are told you need to ask how to do what you don't know. But no one tells you what is expected. Management just talks about changes but will not support you in anyway. They say people are the number one resource but treat employees like trash.
bad,I did not like working here their pay and salary did not measure up to the cost of living what so ever didn't even come close I was broke every week the same day I got paid.
bad,Need management that cares about their employees. Give employees raises. People in the office stop playing with phones and make them do more filing to get all the work completed for the day and not let it sit their for months.
bad,The manager does not know how to run things properly. They will section you out . work there is really done by 11am and u start at 8am so after that all's you are really doing is standing around and the manager is okay with the company loosing that money ..
bad,company does not invent in technology.  Everything in this company is not best practice or world class.  Its the way Westinghouse Electric left it 30 years ago
bad,Low pay and little time off. I would not recommend working here. You might get a few days off a year. It will sound great in the interview but you will regret it.
bad,i was wrongfully termiated for actions done by the person i was being trained by they are rude and unfair and i suggest people look else where for employment
bad,They were great before they became so corporate then ever time a new upper management was hired changes would follow and not for the best. The pay was not good and the merit increase was not good at all. Branch managers all favorites that always received special treatment.  If you are looking for employment that you are planning to stay with it is not Wesco.
bad,"I loved working for Wesco. I loved my coworkers and customers. I was kept very busy with customers and cleaning. The hardest part of  the job was making sure all duties were done before morning shift came in. I learned  a little bit of everything working there. Very team orientated atmosphere. Management could use improvement unfortunately, She was all about favoritism and let her favorites get away with anything while others had to pick up the slack.The job was not hard at all, just a lot of cleaning."
bad,Employees are dealt with in an unprofessional manner.  Expectations are not realistic and there is no appreciation for work well done.  Favoritism and poor to non-existent training.  Upper management is clueless and out of reality with demands.
bad,I have yet to see management do anything required of them. Management is never there and they don't get rid of the people who don't work. Be prepared to work terrible hours too.
bad,"Very bad place to work ,lots of favoritism no rules guys come late everyday lots of call out lots of long hours bad pay dirty  warehouse lots of dusk don't care about employees please stay away from this places."
bad,worst place i have ever worked. Terrible management. NO room for growth. Terrible pay. No Training. everything was just thrown at you and you were expected to know how to do it perfectly even though management didnt know how to do it. Worst place i have ever worked.
bad,WESCO's management and leadership skils are the worst I have ever seen. If your not ''in the clique'' and a favirote (and you know who the favirotes are because they are the only ones coming to work happy and the only ones who make money)
bad,"Business is driven by commitment to shareholders only, employees lack morale due to politics driven by HQ. Management offers little to no support for employees and HR has too much control in decisions with employees. Business reacts to sales but does not support the support functions needed to provide high quality customer service."
bad,I had a very difficult time enjoying any part of the job during my tenure.
bad,"There's no prospect working in that company. They will never want you to advance unless you are ready to lick their butt. The management is extremely racist. If you want to waste your time, go can go there to work."
bad,Every person in the leadership roles there have ZERO leadership skills. They were put in those rolls for lack of any other options. The one person they hired off the street to be a supervisor was A-Mazing. He knew how to be a leader. You can work with your spouse there too!! Ridiculous. They always said they were going to implement a disciplinary policy.....I heard that for months and still no one had the kahunas to do it.. You can do anything you want and still have a job. You can call in all the time and still have a job. You can cuss people out and still have a job. The office boss is a major you know what that acts like shes about 12. Like I said lack of options. This is definitely a company that thinks just because someone is a pretty good worker that they can be a leader. Well NEWSFLASH.....they DO NOT HAVE LEADERSHIP SKILLS. I was a proven leader in previous jobs. I made things happen and they were done correctly THE 1ST TIME. Do you think they made me a supervisor here? NO. I know I'm intimidating but only because I WORK and I am SMART and that's a good thing to be if you work for a company that wants show a strong front and move onward and upward. This place is a complete joke. From the white trash employees to the white collars above.
bad,"The place is a joke. The management is a joke. The higher ups are clueless and cowards like there puppet management. Horrible work environment with liars, snitches, two faced and favoritism."
bad,Senior Management does not recognize the real talent and does not appreciates the individuals who are working hard. They just appreciates and promote only those who say 'Yes' to their Boss.
bad,Would not recommend  this place money is not worth  the stress lots of turn over poor mangement lack of training..no loyalty what  so ever you will regret working there
bad,"No advancement"
bad,Management has no clue and not helpful.  Will not recommend anyone to work for this CO. some co workers are very helpful and others aren't too nice.
bad,Worked for WESCO. In their safety divsion.  Management didnt have a clue about the industry and how to run the company.  All previous managment that made it a great place to work left the company.  It wasn't a good place to be when you were afraid of what management was going to do.  They changed the comp plane monthly.  It was to be a salary plus position.  Management changed things so frequently it became impossible to get any kind of commission.  I would not regiment working here to anyone.
bad,Typical day at work completing task by managers. Learned there wasn't as much communication as needed.
bad,Never received the last pay as indicated in the offer letter
bad,"invoiced customers, AR, Apay"
bad,"Mission de 15 jours que je n ai pas souhaité renouveler chez Wesco, car dans ce service les journées de travail se déroulent selon l humeur des 2 chefs d équipe, et leur disponibilité (pour les femmes pas de soucis ils seront disponibles...). "
bad,The company is not for minorities. Was discriminated against on multiple occasions and it fell on deaf ears. My mental stat deteriorated at this company. My therapist can back that up. I see they're hiring for a discriminatory personal in hr. Maybe that will help.
bad,Poor management sales people ate rude jerks. No opportunity for advancing. Just all around bad place to work. They will not tell you about lay off until you get home and will lie about reason. Management at this place is a joke
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years. You are treated more as a number than an employee. I saw that if you had any issues with management, you would get released from your duties, permanently. The culture in Calgary is very ""watch your back"", tote the company line or else."
bad,The Charlotte location has very poor management.  The manager worked from home 3 days out of the week and when she was there she talked the entire time about non related work discussions.  Some of the supervisors are very unprofessional and try to bully the people under them.  Please think twice about going to the Charlotte location.
bad,"If you want to work all the time and have everything dumped on you with no help from anyone..... this is the place for you!"
bad,"On a typical work day you would receive inbound product. Put away stock. Generate/release sales orders. Pull, pack and ship orders via Wesco truck, UPS or common carriers. Perform cycle counts. Route all deliveries and generate manifests for drivers."
bad,"Manager is best friends with her manager and go to the same church. She pretty much does nothing, steals employee rewards for herself, and blames others. Working in the bakery is pretty cool though."
bad,"Work / Life balance is not a consideration of the management team coupled with the stresses related to the lack of a job security.  The company has gone through 3 reorganizations and several layoffs since Jan. 2014.  "
bad,"bad management, no upward mobility or competitive compensation"
bad,Ive worked here for years. In ten years i did the same job with no advancement. Also in ten years my pay only went up $2.00 an hour. 20 cents a year average but the insurance went up alot more.  You go backwards working here. Management is a joke too. Office people get treated one way and the actual workers get tteated different. The place is a pathetic joke.
bad,"Scary work even when I was young working there. I was never sure when I would get fired, even thought I worked like crazy"
bad,"I was excited to take on my new role and learn more about the lighting industry at Wesco. However, they did not have although resources to properly train me. Although I did learn to take on several tasks and how to help some of our smaller contractors with minimal help, I believe this company overlooks the smaller businesses at times. The pay and benefits were good but I was a single mom and working over an hour away from home. I was expected to devote my entire life to this job and as much as I enjoyed working with my customers, my children came first."
bad,"When I started, wesco was a great company with management that was understanding and helpful. It has since then changed management and taken an extreme hit in morals and care for their employees. I tried to remain loyal as I enjoyed the work I was doing but the stress of my surroundings was more than I could accept."
bad,"Working at Wesco was a decent place to work it seemed from the start but I slowly learned how things were handled by management. This is not a place you want to work if you're looking for advancement, to be frank I'm shocked the place runs with such sloppy work ethic and the fact there is no moral. "
bad,I enjoyed working at wesco for a brief time as a temp. They hype you up but you soon realize how disorganized everything is. Product is always missing and blame gets tossed around while nothing gets fixed. If you are a skilled warehouse worker you shouldn't waste your time with this place it's incredibly unsafe to work here and the workers are constantly getting high and drunk on the job.
bad,"decent job went to work did what  i had to do and went home , management sucked did not learn much of what i already did not know pay was decent nothing exciting"
bad,"I Have not experienced such a lack of professionalism and management in a workplace since my days working in odd jobs for college. "
bad,"Stress full place to work, management could be better. Employees treat each other bad, and there is no excuse for disrespecting co workers in the work place."
bad,There is poor training. When a new program is given to the store there isn't any real training other than read this and hope you can figure it out.  There is no life balace between home and work.  You work 6 days a week and are on call all the time.  If they need extra help you go in and work far past your required 50 hours.  It is frowned upon if you don't work more than your 50 hours.  You are denied time to take vacation time. They say you have the right to make mistakes but that isn't tru either. You rarely if ever have time to eat or take any breaks. They don't appreciate anything you do for the company but quick to point out mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was some of the staff that worked for me.
bad,"Management in the warehouse is extremely lazy. When it comes to training, the sessions are poorly ran. After my first 7 weeks of working there, I still was not given the proper training to do my job."
bad,"If you are not part of the ""good ole boy"" system you will be underpaid and work with people that look like you instead of working where your experience is."
bad,"Pay is low and no way to advance or wage increases.   Supervisors are inappropriate and top management has no grasp on what is going on because he works remotely from a different state."
bad,"start at 8am load my truck,do my deliveries and come back at the wrong time every day. it doesn't pay to think for your self is what i learned. management was terrible,one would tell you to do something ,than the other would yell at you for doing it,plus the sales force was always butting in and telling how to do something or they had an ""emergency"" that had to be done right now."
bad,"company that cares about its employes,time off when requied"
bad,Sales people are put on pedestals and allowed to treat everyone else with disrespect. I reported someone to HR and was suggested I try to resolve it myself with that person.
bad,Relaxed workplace but people get away with way too much. Place could be a lot better if their was decent supervision. Good people to work with but guys take advantage of the lack of supervision.
bad,"I hated working here personally I just needed something secure at the time. The higher management was terrible. The pay was okay. The only good thing was that my team and customer was amazing.  Demanding, but amazing."
bad,"It was a memorable time in my life , I strive daily to make sure everyone that I interacted with them ie: Co-workers also Customers, It was my pleasure."
bad,There is a huge lack of training and no structure to the Business Development Department. They micromanage making it feel pressured and overwhelming. Co Workers are nice and extremely helpful. The only positive is that the work life balance.
bad,Management at this branch is lacking. They really don’t know how to communicate well. You’ll be scared to even call in sick or go and talk to management about anything because you’ll be looked down on. I don’t recommend here. You’ll be talked to like you’re stupid. They’ll have nothing nice to say. And if you’re new and ask a question you’re treated like you’re dumb and that you should know the answer.
bad,Working hours were good and i learned alot more to use the forklift and do shipping manegement was okay not that great. the hardest part of my job was having to work under stress but i really enjoyed what i did
bad,I really loved the position and environment until the day I was let go. I spent 6yrs with one of the toughest customers out there that are union. I believe I did a great job and my Manager will tell you the same.
bad,Was there for almost 20 years and Company continues to try and do more with less without adding compensation consideration. Often times people are doing 2-3 jobs with the expectancy of meeting the requirements or risk losing the opportunity for advancement
bad,Poor and rude Management!!! A lot of pushing and threatening!!! Super stressful work place! Always worried about getting fire! Bosses like to make fun at people who make error which is not nice! Lack of people skills! Lack of training! Co workers are okay.
bad,"The work that you do here is very rewarding; I loved my actual JOB. It was my coworkers and management that was not so great."
bad,"Management at Wesco fails to understand the OEM market, and is concentrating on construction business."
bad,"Toxic and hostile work environment. The management team bullies employees, openly used the N word, and created a toxic work environment."
bad,"Administrative clerical work, different experience for everyone, many different locations across the United States.  Electrical Distributer, Electrical Distributer"
bad,These people were rude unaccepting.  I lost no one to talk with.  No team work efforts.  A lot of yelling and disrespect.  I would not recommend anyone to work there
bad,"The Management at WESCO is very uneducated, have a large lack of experience and delegate everything."
bad,"Conflicting goals amongst departments and support of sales by operations is often absent."
bad,"Some depts (cash application) are not treated as fairly as others. "
bad,Management set the branch up for failure. No support from management. Concerns fell on deaf ears. Lack of inventory made the day to day business scarce.
bad,Inside sales consisted of taking orders from customers over the phone as well as taking orders from walk in business over the counter. Also helping warehouse employees pulling materials for deliveries.
bad,"The turnover was horrendous, so the people who stick with the job become a pseudo dysfunctional family.  There were a lot of good people who worked there, but one petty manager had a toxic effect on the entire warehouse. I believe they promoted said manager to another branch but the damage he created is done."
bad,Don't waste your time. It just not an ethical/fair place to work. All they care about is sales. They dont care about their people.
bad,"There are areas of WESCO in which you can work and be very happy and fairly treated. There are other areas where you can be abused, harassed and mistreated very badly and there is not much recourse unless you have the ability to live without a paycheck. There seems to be very little preventing a few bad managers from doing very bad things over and over again although they are reported."
bad,the typical day at work involved being second guessed by managment and in general no trust in your abilities.
bad,"Overall a good place to work for sales people, bonuses sometimes and sales incentives"
bad,"Gossip occurs in management"
bad,As a worker the staffing is very poor. Co-workers have to do double work in order to stay on pace with orders. We have no Manager to help manage the warehouse and a lot of co-workers talk bad about others workers without addressing the problems or heling them improve. Weak communication and alot of blaiming is going on which creates a stressful and uncomfortable environment for new workers.
bad,"If you work in the warehouse, its always your fault. There is no support from management. Run run run run run.........................................away"
bad,"La direction était de mauvaise foie, aucune flexibilité travail-famille. Le respect des employés n'était pas très bonne."
bad,"2-3 days at a National Acct. 1 1/2 hrs. away, worked on opening the North Country for new accounts, the office was based in Watertown NY and my location was in Plattsburgh NY."
bad,"Centralization strategy not widely accepted throughout organization, which made implementation extremely challenging."
bad,enjoyed the data entry as it was interesting  with all the daily duties just wish that I could of had more help from the management  with most questions
bad,"I was micromanaged out of a job by a vicious manager. Retaliated against me by loading up my already full plate with unreasonable and inhuman duties that had to be done daily--with NO overtime--that none of the other buyers had to do. I truly loved the job, but my manager refused to put in a real purchasing system and made it so every item bought (thousands) was done item by item. When he wasn't breathing down my back, it was lovely! I had to save my soul and health, so I chose to request termination."
bad,I would not recommend this place to work at if you like breaks or like to go to the bathroom. It is very hard to find time in between customers to take care of yourself.
bad,"At AED (Wesco International) our internal manager is a dishonest manager and he's a tyrant. He makes work harder on the people that he doesn't like and the ones that he does like, he promotes them. It's not about work ethic in that environment, it's about favoritism and nepotism."
bad,"Worked inside Nexteer plant in Saginaw, Michigan. Management of the Wesco employees was not good. Most every person that worked for Wesco disliked their job and was looking for a new one constantly. Wesco site management was located in a building down the road from Nexteer. I really wasn't quite sure what some of the managers did each day. Most were worried they would be losing the contract there because of how they managed getting parts for Nexteer. Not good!"
bad,This is a good place to start off your career but there is absolutely no room for advancement. Very high Turnover rate and upper management does not care about workers.
bad,"I offer experience buying the engineered equipment and the site construction subcontracts to install: Foundations, roads, mechanical, electrical and I&C services for the equipment installation.  I have experience from permitting, geotechnical investigations, start-up and commissioning."
bad,"communication, leadership, technical infrastructure and IT support are either, missing, ignored, unstable or just plain poor."
bad,"Wesco lacks communication and teamwork, not a good place to work if you like to get things done. It has good people, but they rely on you to get things done more than most."
bad,"Be prepared for a Slow, Old and Non-stimulative Environment. This Company is stuck in the 1960's and runs away from the idea of growth."
bad,"overall it was a good assignment "
bad,"Hostile work environment, threatened by co-workers."
bad,Our project manager had very poor skill as far as dealing with workers and our contract customer.  He was the whole reason that our contract was broken.  The rest of the workers tries their best to keep our customer happy despite taking the brunt of the complaints from our contract personnel.
bad,I am a little biased as I did not enjoy my time in living in the town and I did not enjoy the clientele or the food that I was preparing. My co-workers were fine.
bad,"Wesco has great employees but the management , respect and organization inside the company is poor. I've heard in the past Wesco was a great company to work for them tension got high and no one enjoys being at work anymore."
bad,Very unorganized place to work. They have a diverse product offering but don't know how to take it to market. Very knee-jerk reaction to solving problems.
bad,"You got to hustle when your a paper wrapper.  Fast-pace when the shift gets going.    It's good not to make mistakes on numbers to the corner of the blocks after wrapped.  The reason why is because at the end of the shift they check for what was written wrong and then they have to usually be redone.  Which then can upset coworkers, unless they like overtime!  So it's good to do it right the first time.  Some it takes longer to catch on than others.  For me, it went pretty easy.  Using a staple gun, edged knife, and marker to jot each corner depending on what...simple"
bad,"7 years of experience.  Typical day is fast paced, constantly busy, dealing with multiple customers.  Pulling, filling orders, restocking shelves, dealing with invoicing and interface issues.  Working on monthly metrics on a daily basis, researching stock outs and doing root cause analysis.  New management recently was the hardest part.  Most enjoyable part was the many varied customers and people I was able to work with on a daily basis"
bad,"I was a pricing analyst copying, pasting pricing templates on Excel spreadsheets. It was very analytical and technical. Management was very structured and hawkish. I was paid well, however, I did not enjoy what I was doing. I was glad when they terminated my employment. I never gave up performing this job. It was not a perfect fit."
bad,"Stressful.  Typical work day started before 6am and finished after 6pm.  Most days started in the warehouse assisting receiving and shipping.  Then paperwork and on to sales calls.  More paperwork."
bad,"In the beginning there was lots of promise to move up in the company. When I asked for more work, they told me there was none. I was able to move into a parallel position after 6 years, with promise to excel, but instead was put back into my old position and STILL had to do my new job. After two years of begging to get out of my old position AGAIN, I finally left because the neglect, overwork, and under pay felt like abuse. They forced people to retire early, had multiple lay offs, and constantly made you feel like you were replaceable. There are good, honest employees who are treated terribly while there are others who are rude, constantly waste company money and time and are still favored. Management is unapproachable- when you tell them about a problem they tell you to basically stop talking and go back to your post. Micro management is a noticeable issue and HR is even worse! They do not follow proper firing policies and make up convoluted stories to get rid of people they target. High turn over rates, disorganization, cut throat environment. People are having major health issues because the stress is so high: strokes, heart attacks, and even death."
bad,"Management doesn't listen to the employees opinions about how to improve the warehouse, its really a simple job. There is no career advancement would rather hire from outside then from within."
bad,Management is awful. Many have no clue of processes and just look for sometime to blame for mistakes. Good workers are not recognized. I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  Lots of drama and manipulative leaders. If your strong minded prepare to be let go.
bad,They do not follow through on promises. Beholden to the board of directors. Management does not tell the truth. Not a real distributor.
bad,"It's a gas station job, they try to pretend to be the best but their fuel is awful for your vehicle and their management is more concerned with getting a big bonus check than they are about you or your safety and happiness on the job."
bad,"little to no support from any corporate level.  you essentially are running your own business,  but with house $$ and house rules. antiquated system and little to no training"
bad,"Management sucks but the overall work and company is great, the coworkers you have to be careful with and also depends on which part of the building and temp service your through to get paid more"
bad,One of worst places u can work for.! The mangement is horrible.! They got the wrong person running they wear house. No place for advancement.! I had to call the labor board about my last paycheck.!
bad,Lack of communication and team work. To much talking behind each others back. Warehouse workers do not make it a team effort and choose to sit at the computer all day.
bad,"A fortune 500 company. Great benefits. Work/Life balance not so much. A very old corporate structure. A lot of older people working there for 20 years and still in the same position. Everyone does the bare minimum, if you decide to go above and beyond, be prepared to be swamped with work. You won't be appreciated. If procurement is your field, this can be a good stepping stone."
bad,"was a great company when I first started, then over time a revolving door opened with Branch Managers and quickly became dysfunctional. Relocated to another branch and it just got worse. How can two branches operate completely different under the same company and guidelines. My branch was by the book and this other branch did as they pleased, no true guidelines were followed, no discipline, lack of training for a cumbersome computer system. Then another merger was in the mix with no clarity as to where new location was going to be,  This would effect employee commutes Only certain people were told specific details where as the rest of us were left in dark. , two facing and drama just overwhelmed me and I had to get out. I thought I was going to retire from there"
bad,"WESCO is a very large corporation that at times has competing goals.  Their organization is fractured and overlapped; often it pits two distinct job functions against one another.  "
bad,The work is easy and the people are laid back but there is no place to advance.
bad,"Loved the job, hated the manager. Sour staff and there was only 5 people inside. Went in all happy and excited and left broken. No oversite and no checks and balances. Sad to go but I had to to save my soul."
bad,"The job itself isn’t challenging but lack of technological advancements and backward mindset of management makes this place a mediocre place to work. There seems to be a lot of nepotism ie: spouses, cousins and family members working in the same division.Employees behave like high school cliques, and management encourages such behavior. Wages are barely industry standards. Employees have to fill multiple responsibilities at once because management is more concerned with saving a few cents rather than retaining employees."
bad,"I work at the one that builds things for Shindler, CCS, Volvo. I am a assembler there. This job is filled through a temp service.  Management keeps telling us they will be hiring on but, ask the ones who have been there for 4-7 yrs as a temp. No raise and never hired on. I have been there for 1yr and 3 months. Nothing.    When it is brought up by us about getting hired on, we get a real bug run around. Management is cold and lacks any communication. My co-workers however are awesome in every way."
bad,"Low working conditions and bad working environment is part of their working culture.  The management was below expectations, from leadman to supervisor."
bad,"Management was OK, but lacked leadership. Pay for equal employees was all over the place. Raises are terrible and pay rate is not up to standards for the area."
bad,"Worked on business unit consolidation. Included daily accounting functions. dealing with vendors, customer and sales"
bad,"Wesco have great employees, great work enviroment, but no place for advancement and pay is bad. You will be a temp for years before you gain full time employment."
bad,"eh eh, goofy work environment, late hours, not sure what else to talk about"
bad,Management had poor communication with lower level employees. My sister passed away in Jan. 2018.  I told management that I was taking on custody of my nephew.  They failed to tell me that I may be losing my job in April due to them closing my branch.  I was offered 3 weeks severance and only able to keep my health insurance for 2 weeks.  I need medication for my thyroid and blood pressure that is over $500 without insurance.  I was not forewarned about the possibility of my branch being closed.
bad,"If you like talking about gourmet coffee, that hip new vegan restaurant in L'Ville, thinking that you should be promoted to manager because you have been there six months and answered an email correctly, leaving for hours on end to go to Crazy Mocha, happy hours, and the like, this is the place for you."
bad,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, Turnos y horarios accesibles."
good,"Worked at a wesco operated facility for a year. I liked the pay, but we were short staffed and the only way you moved up was if someone quit or retired. I was middle senior but I had an accident outside of work and had to miss some work. They ended up hiring the new guy into a position above me while I was out. The money is good but its going to suck while you make it."
good,"The team I work with is just that a team we all want the branch to succeed.  I'm not sure the company wants to invest in current employees.  "
good,I'm working in Wesco for 3 years and I saw everything. Talking about the Warehouse my Supervisor is not present every day(so no supervision). Some guys work others..no. The pay is not the same for all employees.
good,a typical day at work would concist of cleaning! I did not learn anything at this job. Management (their are too many). Co-workers ???? their is nothing hard about the job
good,Wesco was an ok place to work the pay was ok but the manager suck thru will never communicate with you unless it is to tell you that they are shifting your office down with no worning and the that day is your last day and throw you and your family out on there butt with no sympathy
good,"Would not recommend.  Poor management, little to no training, too many green employees, mediocre salary, quantity is valued over work quality.  Employees receive no recognition from management."
good,"The day starts with answering emails and review status of current projects documentation submittals and deliveries"
good,"I enjoy the product lines and customers I work with on a daily basis, however I am competing against my own company in many instances."
good,"The management team doesn't treat all employees equally. They also look down on you based on your ethic background, and go to extreme measures to unbalance work loads throughout certain employees."
good,I fill that I was not given a chance to prove myself in this company as a hole.no chance to move up or to get a review to help me in moving up the ladder to a better position
good,"The other person I worked with in the warehouse was an Ok guy. I wish there had been more opportunity for advancement. I just felt like site management was unwilling to listen to associates to better daily processes. I loved the daily pace to complete tasks. I like to keep myself busy, it make the day go faster."
good,Management doesn't care if you go to them with issues around the office. Being an admin was would help anyone out but if I see that they are just goofing off and not doing their job then it's not a good thing to work there.
good,"Overall, the staff at WESCO was great to work with. Management changed part way through my employment, however, and the new management was not as much fun to work for as the previous management. The new person did not take the time to get to know employees. There was a variety of jobs to do and plenty of work to do each shift to keep you busy."
good,"I learned that in some very old companies are very slow and unwilling to change. In spite of the jargon the silo, cover your butt and ""it's always been done this way"" philosophy is very much entrenched at this company. This starts at management and filters althe way through. As always Great employees"
good,"As a top Sales Account representative I am assigned to more then twenty different Customer accounts each day. The Most Active of these Companies are the ones running specials, discount days or have recently sent out product catalogs. I assist their Clients with sales, product descriptions pricing and availability. If available I transfer calls to onsite Customer Service Agents on back orders and problem orders already received. "
good,A day at the office can be very productive along with a few laughs from co-workers.  Atmosphere is great.  Management is tough at times but deadlines need to be met.  This is a place where you are glad to go to work and come home feeling that you accomplished something.
good,Management does a poor job of taking care of the employees that have been with the company for years
good,"I worked with a Wesco subsidiary. Management was not very supportive.  Customer was secondary as well.  Training was almost non-existent.  "
good,Enjoyed my first ten years there the next ten was not very good at all too many changes in the corporate structure of wesco
good,"Would come in for my shift and make sure that I had a clean appearance and was prepared for my shift. I would then check which section or sections I had for my shift. Go over my sections to make sure that they were clean, prepared, and ready for the customers that I would have. When customers were seated in my section, I would get their drink orders and any appetizers that they would order, I would then bring their drink orders and get their food orders. I would then put them in the computer, When their food was up, I would bring it to the table and keep checking back with them to make sure everything was okay, refill drinks, etc. I would then give them the bill, and than take it up and give them their change. I would then clean clean the table and get it set up for another customer. If we were slow I would find things to do in my sections, deep cleaning, refilling condiments, etc. At the end of my shift, I would clean my section or sections and make sure everything was prepared for the next server. What I learned from the job it to be a multitasker, team player, hard worker, and quick to get my customers what they needed or wanted. The management was okay, there were a few shift manager that could be pretty harsh at times. My coworkers were excelled, we all worked as a team, helping out where we could, bringing other servers food out when they were busy and all around helping each other give our customers a satisfactory experience. The hardest part of the job was that it could get very fast paced and you had to be quick to adapt. The most enjoyable part was being satisfied"
good,"Look at other employment options! The current culture there is terrible. After 43 yrs, new management to watch out for!"
good,Part time was considered 35+ hours but if you worked 40 hours you would get written up. Not very good training. Manager did not communicate well. Lazy coworkers. Expected too much to be done in the back during busy hours.
good,"Staff was great. Management was spineless, and awful. Only looks out for bottom line. Does not reward hard work. Good work schedule, easy to stay busy and productive."
good,"When I first started working here I was so exited. But I had no room to advance due to my mom working their in the past. Because they thought they could some how base my work on hers. Didn't get along with a lot of co-workers, too much drama."
good,"Responsible for all inventory, account payable, safety, human resources, P & L to run am efficient warehouse."
good,"Handled incoming calls, accounts payable/receivable.  Posted checks, released orders, inventory for office, filing."
good,Was not what I hoped! Learned alot and earned a few certifications!
good,Review daily demand and stock levels to meet a customer requirements.
good,Double standards unfair favoritisms outrageous fees for company car. Too many competitors no help inside with administrative duties male dominated work environment
good,I wanted to become full time but I was laid off. I was only a temporary employee. Being they had full coverage benefits I wanted to take advantage of that but instead they let me go.
good,not a company I would recommend to anyone. the location I attended daily is in such disorder. communication is not good. a typical day is stressful. management has ruined the culture . overall the community of workers get along but still needs improvement.
good,"Good comoany but switches exec management every year, little room for higher advancement, employees are not valued, HR is worst I have ever seen and destroys morale"
good,The culture at this particular Utility branch was nearly intolerable. I believe that they will have a difficult time acquiring new talent moving forward.
good,"My experience in this job is too good. All my senior as well as head incharge including sir and mam are too helping, supporting and frankly nature in all the case of matter and problem whenever it arises. My work experience under this job was good eg. for learned, management, workplace culture and environment. I learned and enjoyed a lot under the work experience in this job."
good,"Poor management with so little staff, quick paste job, inventory was going down the drain, had to do the most to prevent that, I did everything I could n work over 67 hours a week"
good,not a bad company to work for if you're not a contracted worker because at any point you can be terminated upon arrival which makes you feel like your job is never secure
good,"if I had to say something about Wesco , I guess it would be that this company is to laid back . it is a okay place to work for . Your are granted 40 plus hours a week . unless you went to collage there no room to move up ."
good,Temporary job that taught me all ends and outs of the business. Started as quality control an ended up Shipping Coordinator. Was 100% accurate when was in charge of shipping!
good,"The branch in which a person receives employment is the number one determining factor of their overall experience. The work is steady and certainly requires the demand, unfortunately, its possible to have a different reporting structure than someone with the same job title in the same state."
good,"Overall, not a bad company to work for, but I definitely feel like there needs to be some restructuring at the management level to have the most ripple effect down to the individual branch level(s)."
good,"Ok, this can be a fun job if you let it be. I loved the customers! Stocking shelves and 3rd shift cleaning could be more therapeutic then most jobs, just get in your flow and go. Time flies unless your just leaning, waiting to go home."
good,Wesco is a pretty productive company but they do have issues culture and advancement wise there is a lot of work split between few people which isn't a problem but there is no employee appreciation and the merit raises are minimal
good,The working environment and management do not understand customers needs. Poor customer service and training. I enjoy the work that I do and love my customers.
good,"Here, you are just a number... there is a lay off scare weekly and high personnel turn over.  Just not a stable company. It seems like each year your work load and expectations increased yet pay remained the same.  My strong work ethic and dedication kept me there until I was laid off."
good,"Good local team. Bad corporate decisions. Great benefits, salary is decent. Lack of skilled employees and layoffs make it harder to do your own job."
good,"Due to a new younger CEO who acquired his position in 2011, WESCO’s espoused values have been changing to encourage employees to continue educating themselves. WESCO has an educational assistance program available to employees which is available after completion of six months of service. This program offers up to $10,000 annually and requires a year of services upon completion of the degree. WESCO also developed its own training program through a website call WESCO University. This site offers online university level course from topics as general as phone and email etiquette, to more specific topics such as warehouse management, LEAN training, and B2B sales courses. Employees are encouraged to take as many classes as they want, and most departments actually require individuals take at least one course per quarter. "
good,"Overall, it was a good starting job, but definitely not what I would want to do forever. I, unfortunately, dealt with harassment issues that were unsettled. My manager was not able to communicate with the employees well, and employees were afraid to communicate as well."
good,"It is mostly desk-based job where you enter data and answer emails and phone calls. I learned to work hard and push for the information I need."
good,Work hard all day.... Extremely hot.. Do 2 or 3 differents & still make productivity
good,"Opportunity to provide ideas, and pitch programs, however, it would take an eternity to get approval from management...sometimes. Very often Management showed a lack of interest in improving communication."
good,"this is a fast paced environment where you need to make your productivity numbers - productivity bonuses every month."
good,"A typical day at work included customer, supplier, and employee management."
good,Good place to work it is a family own business and friends and family are all hired. A lot of people at WESCO have been there a long time. Just need to be part of the circle. If not you will be an outcast and always fighting to keep job.
good,"Pro:  no dress codes.  This is great in the winter time when you can wear sweatshirts etc. "
good,"The Business method for the company was great. They had nice benefits for a gas station including bonuses. They follow the principles of accounting very well. The company also had college reimbursement but found many loop holes for themselves to not to have to pay it to me which hurt me a lot, like saying they would only pay a percentage of the credits my classes were and not credit hours which is what I pay. This problems caused me to have to take less classes per semester because I could not afford it even though if Wesco did give me the money they promised me I could have gone full time."
good,"Fine place for a first job, however, compensation is significantly lacking in comparison to all competition.  Not willing to innovate and management doesn't care about workers."
good,The people of Wesco are great to work with. The management side has a lot to figure out. The have purchased several support companies with the philosophy of just make it work but provides no guidance.
good,"At first, it was great but thwn later on nobody ever covered for me when I needed it while I covered for everyone else when they did. They do not take into consideration any life events that could happen. They will change your schedule without telling you, until the very last second. there is absolutely no positive encouragement, all they seem to care about is the stores needs not the associates needs."
good,"Show up every day to do the same thing. Easy to move up and advance, but not much of a work culture. Everyone arrives at 8 am and left at 4:59."
good,"While I continue to gain knowledge, the lack of true leadership and moral has proven difficult over the past few months. The company, as it stands, it too top heavy. As a result, the few ""worker bees"" are overworked and underappreciated."
good,"A typical day included running the cash register, cleaning the popcorn machine, cleaning cappuccino machines, stocking the shelves and coolers, taking inventory and of course working with the customers. Coworkers were usually friendly when they were on the same shift. First shift coworkers were not usually so friendly. Management was very strict but fair with all who worked their. They were very willing to help all with learning and teaching to make better employees. The hardest part of the job was throwing all those yummy donuts away. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the regulars and remembering their information and their names."
good,"One can go from nothing but busy work to full blown spreadsheets to complete within a few days.  Coworkers are okay,  Workload comes and goes depending upon client's demands."
good,Management poor and unsupportive. Came in one day and fired half the branch with no warning and tried to close branch basically.
good,The Assistant managers position at Wesco seems like a very worth while job opportunity until you are stuck in their interview and training processes for two year before you get any additional pay or benefits. Getting stuck due to one person who has decided that you are not yet good enough to move forward is a warped way of doing things. It is something that should be decided by more than one person.
good,"The job is pretty great and, most of the people are good, but management is all over the place and never on the same page with one another. Some managers expect more than others, normal, but when asked the same question will answer it different from day to day based on how they feel that day. Simple job duties change daily. You are sometimes left without a manager at all. Some managers micro-manage too much and bully employees when things aren't done their way but preach about how it's not a ""one fits all"" job and you have to find the best way to work your accounts for yourself. Outside of a normal paycheck there aren't any incentives to do your job while other departments gets bonuses and other rewards. When I first started, they were great about boosting morale and bettering the department, but the past 6 months everything has gone drastically downhill."
good,"Strange working atmosphere and little or no training. Very clique-ish.  Not a welcoming work culture between those who've been there 20 years and new hires. You work hard and steady, but  the day flies by quickly."
good,The money is great but I would not work there again. The company is basically made up of the haves and have nots.  Its a very layered company with too many managers and resources are very thin for a company that is 8 billion in revenue.
good,As a HSEQ Manager took volunteered for additional responsibility. My panache for more work and mentoring proved to be detrimental to my own employment continuance.
good,"Great benefits, no management structure.  Very hard to get someone to make a clear decision, you have to keep your emails forever, just in case someone says you didn't do something."
good,It was a good company to work it was just the coworkers who would start drama and make for a bad working environment. If I didn't get fired I would still be working there just too much drama caused by other coworkers. They try to do things to get you fired.
good,I would not recommend anyone to work at Wesco because when I was there I was sworn at a lot and the 2 guys I worked with sat around and tried to get out of work.
good,"Work life balance becomes what you make of it, but little hard work is rewarded. advancement opportunities are constant but HR rules about raises when employees reach new pay scales mean that advancing leads to more experience and responsibility without competitive pay for peers"
good,Working at WESCO requires good time management skills.  Day to day job duties are combine with one off issues to research.  It is challenging to manage the workload.
good,Very fast pace but no support. Always demanded more from staff but never supplied more resources.Management team changed 2 times in 2 years. Hard to maintain flow
good,"The work volume was high when I was employed there, but not too tough to handle. I generally enjoyed working for the company itself.  Left due to the environment changing after another manager was relocated and it caused a conflict in how the department was ran thereafter. Most of my co-workers at that time were always professional, helpful, and friendly."
good,The work and schedule is fine with occasional opportunities for overtime.  The work is straightforward and makes the day go by quickly as you are always engaged with no down time which is nice.  The overall maturity level amongst employees leaves a lot to be desired and management could be better for sure.
good,"Typical day was reviewing customer e-mails and                    quoting and/or filling customer requests. Learned new products and terminology. I enjoyed working with the people at my branch, but overall company management left something  be desired."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es sano en general."
good,"I would rather not provide this, as I don't think I should have to provide information about my current employer."
good,"Job is redundant, most of my co workers are great.  Middle management can be tough to work with."
good,"Constant changes in upper management and initiatives.  If a company is always finding ways to improve, its a good thing.  However it can be a tough place to work if you don’t have support of management."
good,Large fortune 500 company where you just become a  sales number and not a person.  Do not value the work life balance as much.  Felt like they didn't care about you on a personal level.
good,The job is good I need better pay and more hours but it’s not working out. The hours have been declining and I need more. Would recommend this job for high school students looking for a part time job
good,"A electrcial company that is focused on Oil and Gas markets in the area."
good,Its a fast pace job. The crew all has lots of experience. You get good benefits and a descent amount of paid time off. You do get sore from lifting a lot but there are breaks and company lunches to make up for it
good,No training - no resources available to new Account Executives.  Sink or swim - high quota.  Poor management in the Houston market.  No different.iators
good,don't think this is the same as the computer thinks it is.  But where I worked was great.  I loved my clients and helping make them the best they can be.
good,"Do what your told, how you're told to do it and you'll get by with no problems.I was transferred to this plant from a different branch to increase sales."
good,No hay respeto..   El directo de la empresa  solo trata bien y  da oportunidades a quienes le siguen  el juego  sin valores
good,"Morning is spent on reports and managing CSR's.  Remaining time is spent working with the customer.  Orders, REQS and PO's.  Also contacting suppliers."
good,"Actividades inmersas en cambios de estructuras por nuevas orientaciones de los negocios, y el proyecto de Ensamble de forma separada a la Distribución  de productos del sector eléctrico. Este ultimo, gobernado por el requerimiento mínimo de 5M USD para el primer año y la reestructuración del área de Producción en su inicio para triplicar su capacidad productiva. Acto seguido re-certificar el Sistema de Gestión de la Calidad ISO 9001-2015. "
good,The people there are very kind. They don't treat people differently and everyone there does their best. The scheduling is not very flexible and it is hard to try and get everyone on the same page.
good,"There are only four levels buyer, senior buyer, supervisor and manager. You are not promoted until you ask for a promotion your work is never praised. If you show strong work ethic they just give you more work while others in your department get less. They give cost of living raises and then expect you to do ten times more work."
good,Provides excellent sales incentive programs for both Inside/Outside Sales reps.  Warehouse employee hours can get a bit long without proper guidance and preparation from management team.
good,Took this job as a temp to hire.  Didn't get along with my boss who was a micro manager.  Free lunches at the end of every month with closing.  Parking downtown was a beating.
good,A typical day was the usual 8-5 sales job.
good,"This was supposed to be a good job, until you find out that the customer that your working for on their site determines your pay. There is ""advancement opportunities"" in the fact that you can change responsibilities or take more on and get nothing for it."
good,"Be prepared for rude, drunk, and very flirty customers towards young women"
good,"I had an overall good experience. But with the later second shift you felt with a lot of awful customers, had to call the cops 6 times within 8 months working there for stealing. Management was awful though, completely against you if they see you as a threat and do what they can to get you fired."
good,I loved working at this company and managers when hired.  Several moved on to other locations and I was working and running my department with my Sales guys and warehouse personnel were very supportive.
good,"Working at Wesco was a learning experience."
good,"Culture is sell, sell, sell, and sell some more. Not a bad thing if that is what you are into.  Sales support is often treated like a necessary evil. Good benefits."
good,"while there it was stressful. only person in warehouse besides the delivery driver. gets overwhelming with 0 electronic inventory use. its basically a one man show in the warehouse from receiving, put away, pull orders, load orders and all paperwork. they do ALOT of cut backs every few yrs. if youre seeking long time employment this isnt the place rather its sales or wareouse."
good,"Some of the people were fun to work with in the office.  However, as far as advancement goes there really isn't much to do.  There is the possibility of moving from one branch to the other but there would have to be a perfect fit for that situation.  Workplace is rather dull.  Basic office structure with open cubicles.  At least there was free tea and coffee but other than that didn't offer much."
good,An amazing job for a social enthusiast. Decent advancement. Pay raise are min. pay raise bonus are good. Great customer clientele. Communication is min.
good,"I grew up in my career at Wesco.  However, once I reached 25 years service, they eliminated my position.  Very disappointing to say the least."
good,"fun times, great atmosphere, loved meeting new people and hear expieriences, money was ok. having a family life wasn't easy with this company tho"
good,Fast pace multitask environment. Keeps you busy and on your toes. Great compensation package and benefits. Friendly coworkers and management.
good,"A typical day at work involves counting cash from previous business day, running the register, putting out back stock, and cleaning up the store.  I learned that it is very important to work as a team, if the person on a shift before you slacks off you have to pick up that slack.  The management is not entirely how I would run a store per say, they need to step up a little more and speak with employees about gossip, being lazy, etc.  Co-workers were easy to get along with.  I get along with just about anybody.  The hardest part of my job is not specifically the job itself but, the fact that I don't have a specific shift.  I work all sorts of hours, I could work an early morning shift one day then a night shift the next.  I need some sort of consistency.  I enjoy being able to converse with and help people out on a regular basis."
good,".Nice place to work , just not enough hours for my needs.Enjoyed everyone that I worked with. worked around my family needs,"
good,WESCO is a typical publicly traded company trying to maximize profits with less resources
good,good place to work; helped me to build skills needed for the work force
good,I was introduced to Wesco from outside the industry and had no formal education or knowledge of electrical products. Wesco supported my successful efforts with world class technical support and a network of manufactures eager to assist in growing my business.
good,Ran the cash register and counted down the drawer at the end of the day. Depending on the register I was on I cleaned and stocked the cooler and shelves.
good,"My typical day consists of a variety of responsibilities seeing as I cover a wide variety areas in the organization.  Task throughout the can consist of setting up and placing purchase orders, handling invoice resolution and working with other employees or management on projects.  The majority of management are easily approachable and willing to guide you.  The office culture is diverse, you can ask any employee for assistance.  I have enjoyed the friendships I have made here with my coworkers and wish to continue them.  The most frustrating part is the lack of upward movement and compensation. There has been little to no advancement. During my time here I have expanded my knowledge and skills of today's business practices.  I wish to continue broadening these tools in the future."
good,I had hard working good co-workers.
good,"Usually worked on register for first 6 hours, then stock, clean and do till. I learned that I really like working with the public. My co-workers were happy and upbeat people to work with in and outside of job. Hardest part was to stand in one place for 6 hours--I am used to moving around."
good,I was hired by RECO which is a division of WESCO.
good,"Ran register, interacted with customers, stocked, cleaned, checked parking lot, and changed garbage."
good,It was a very productive place to work. You were always busy cleaning or stocking shelves. You never had time to just stand around.
good,"There is plenty to do on the daily basis, with some exceptions of some employees not completing their duties that are set for them. The management is fair to their employees, but at times it is as if there are favorites."
good,The management is great and coworkers are awesome. Options for advancement are available. Flexible scheduling for those needing it. Benefits were nice to have too.
good,"typical day at work,enjoyable,relaxing, communication good. Good people to work around. i have learned more about a computer in the last year and a half.Its been very beneficial to my family and me.The work place i work in is organized and that makes it a enjoyable place to be. The hardest part of the job, to me, is learning where all the tools are to provide the customer with accurate and fast service. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people ."
good,"Work day was typically 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM depending on how busy the day was. Providing excellent customer service to my customer base and earning their respect and repeat business was very rewarding. Great co-workers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with issues beyond my control. Providing the ""extra effort"" service and being recognized for this by a customer."
good,"Wesco was a good workplace to work for with great people who help out, which was good because there isn't much for training."
good,"Sales is God at Wesco. All other branches such as Financial Services and Operations are under compensated, but outside sales and sales managers make a ridiculous amount of money."
good,"During my time at Wesco I noticed typical growing pains that a large company opening a new branch would experience."
good,A large and diverse group of industrial customers ranging from fortune 500 company's to oil field to technology and science end-users. It is a very educational and fast paced working environment and which makes it enjoyable.
good,You will not have to worry about being bored working for this place. Exciting and new things happen everyday.
good,"Entered accounts payable invoices for several branches."
good,"I worked for Wesco for a few years. It was a fast paced job as most gas stations are, but it was an interesting job. It provides you with the opportunity to meet many people in the area that come in. Also, when I worked there they had a college tuition reimbursement program."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo,y excelente compañeros pero falta mas prestaciones para los empleados."
good,"My day consists of checking and responding to emails, answering phone calls, product research for customers, quoting, ordering, and billings. My position can be overwhelming at times, being that we are short staffed and at a hiring freeze. The manager here isn't a micro manager which allows us to be efficient at our job. My coworkers are great people and we all consider each other as family."
good,This office was very fast paced and was under staffed. The staff was very friendly and fun to work with. The local management was to notch and always there to help.
good,"Fair compensation for fair work.Good work life balance. Relaxed environment with relatively low stress. "
good,"Good place to work for someone who just wants employment security.  The job became redundant and there is absolutely no possibility of advancement in that company.  Additionally, the company is so strictly fragmented that opinions and suggestions are never even considered. And, the work atmosphere is absolutely terrible. Nonetheless, like I said before, the hours are good and there is job security, if that is the only thing you are after."
good,"8 hours a day of sitting in a cubicle looking at a computer screen. It is a reliable paycheck, but very monotonous work. If you enjoy cubicles and computers this will be heaven for you!"
good,Ordered inventory for all districts & learned new products. Management was very helpful & co-workers were great. Hardest part of job was keeping inventory for he multiple branches & most enjoyable was working with a lot of different people.
good,Plenty of stepping stone opportunities. Great work life balance. Great coworkers. Great stepping stone opportunities. I would recommend this company to others.
good,"Advancement is slow within the company. "
good,Good company to work for. great benefit. As long as you get your work done no problem with management. Great coworker. Repetitive work can be boring at times.
good,"I would punch in  and start counting my drawer and safe then I would begin my daily night tasks and about half way through I would start paperwork for the manager in the morning. After I started it I would finish the rest of my tasks and stay a half hour over my shift and help my boss get ahead with other daily management tasks, like with orders or counting money."
good,laid back environment with good benefits and family work life balance. can advance if you are willing to relocate. company is doing well in market and has a bright future ahead of itself.
good,"It's a decent place to work if you don't mind working 11-13 hour days. Pay is average, nothing special. After taxes, you will regret having worked all those long hours because your paycheck will not be near the amount you expect/deserve. I worked the warehouse shift and it required heavy lifting as well as loading/unloading trucks with a forklift. You are exhausted at the end of the day and all you want to do is sleep and recover and then dread waking up and having do the same thing all over again the next day. Management is lacking and needs vast improvement. They play favorites and said favorites can get away with doing very little work each day simply by sucking up to the right managers. Most of the warehouse workers take a ridiculous amount of smoke breaks each day in addition to slacking off and joking around with each other while barely getting anything done. I worked hard every day and had to pick up the slack for the workers who barely did any work each day. I did not take any smoke breaks nor did I slack off or avoid doing work like the other workers did. I would not recommend working here because the work is draining and exhausting. 50+ hour weeks on average with some Saturdays required. There is no job/life balance working here"
good,Wesco as a company has a great rapport with its community no matter where a store is located and that starts with great attitudes and even better customer service. I'm truly grateful to Wesco for showing me the advantages of good leadership and having a positive attitude no matter how bad things may go.
good,"Careful who you befriend. People tend to talk to much"
good,The people are the best part of the job. The managers on  the ground level are great. The pay structure and opportunity for advancement from within especially for women and people of color are virtually non existent. It is not a hard job and definitely not stressful.
good,"Great working environment,  management could use some help. There are temp services that work for this company and everyone is competing for a position."
good,"My position at Wesco give me the opportunity to grow my career, and learning new duties along the way. Quite a bit of negotiating when working with billing."
good,"1-Alistar Maquinas para desarrollar trabajos diarios "
good,Great gig if you just want to stay stagnant at being a warehouse worker. But was great simply because it gave me a chance to learn more about warehouse environments.
good,If you love being surrounded by people then this is where you want to be. You will have the opportunity to earn about so many different people while also working with great co workers.
good,8-5 weekends off
good,Overall great place to work temporarily. Management is great. They offer some tuition reimbursement. Offered benefits are not good if you need insurance for prescriptions.
good,"My typical day at work was get to the individuals home and assist them with cooking supper everyday while dealing with team lead duties such as filing paperwork, safety drills, house meetings. My duties were to report everything efficiently on relias and deal with any problems the house could have such as an individuals doing drugs or etc. While working on this job I learned to calm myself more and understand other people’s point of views also, I learned to be a better listener and better person to talk to. The thing I dont like about this place is management, I felt at times like management did not help me at all and I had to fix things on my own. Communication between team leads and management are bad, they don't communicate with staff which makes the team lead be completely clueless about everything."
good,allways learning there trying new things new models all ways coming in multi line dealer ship doing everything from pdis to repairs
good,I like working here but its been almost a year and I'm still a temp with no benefits. I am always willing to learn new things and work hard and always show up for work and work overtime. Just feel like I should've been hired on by now
good,"good entry level job.  more difficult than most to get get in due to background checks and drug tests.   non AC shop so pretty hot in summer.   days work includes receiving product, inventorying and customer service"
good,I loved working at this company.  The learning and challenges were abundant. Co-workers were awesome.  Direct management was active in the day-to-day functions of their employees. They are not good at bringing long term employees to market rates.  This may not be unique.  This is what eventually forced me out.
good,No matter what you did there you was always busy. Time would go by fast and the customers were great. I would still be there is I didn't relocate from Michigan to Kentucky. I needed to be closer to family.
good,Learning new steps everyday. Very physically and mentally challenging. Very hands on. Have to have a go getter attitude. Must be able to handle stress situations. Must be able to meet deadlines
good,It was not fun working here. Management was terrible. They didn't care off there employees. I would not recommend working for Wesco
good,Working for Wesco industries was a very rewarding job. Unfortunately my hours were cut and I was unable to make a living outside of work. I do have experience with everyday customer service. I assisted people with their daily needs and wants.
good,"The Orlando supervisors were great to work with, but had no control over the cost cutting decisions of the headquarters who closed locations/cut staff"
good,"Open mail and email, book travel & hotels for Director,  produced monthly regional reports, maintained calendar, PowerPoint presentations, and event planning."
good,"The customers can be really friendly and can also be a pain, but they are the main focus of the job. There's also a lot of cleaning and upkeep during your shift. It's not a very professional work environment. It is very laid back. I learned a lot about the store but I wish I could have advanced sooner and made a bigger impact. I loved working with my friends but didn't like trying to balance friendships with work."
good,Wesco has been a good fit for me in this transitional phase of my life. I would recommend Wesco to anyone interested in agriculture in Ellensburg.
good,"The salary and benefits offered are not bad but the benefits are very expensive, they don't offer a lot of benefits that other employers are offering to entice or retain employees and its hard to advance without knowing someone with influence or compromising your personal morals and values."
good,Wesco is a good place to work. The work to live balance is good especially if you work in the warehouse. Wesco pays very well for the work you have to do.
good,"Se trabaja de una manera muy comoda, siempre tomando en cuenta las ideas de los trabajadores y generando un muy buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,I didn't stay very long but the work environment is very nice and easygoing. The pay wasn't that much and I had a lot of bills to worry about. Not a lot of hours.
good,"Never had any problems really. Other than the appearance policy, rules are pretty easy and fair. Was a nice place to work. Biggest issue was the other workers."
good,The job there was good but the management was horrible. I tried to advance my roll at Wesco but my manager stopped me from moving up in the company. Other than that the job was good hours were great.
good,empresa con valores de urgencia y enfocada al servicio al cliente
good,"I honestly can't say enough about working for the Cleveland & Toledo branch, except my boss was wonderful to work for.  She is very laid back, understanding, patient, and brutally honest, which I appreciate. "
good,"I like the job, but sometimes our manager is rarely found on the floor when needed and it can get stressful when you have some employees  that are not motivated on their own."
good,"El ambito laboral de la empresa presta situaciones normales donde no creces mucho debido a que se escucha el dicho "" es lo mismo todos los dias"""
good,"It was a great place to work,  fun environment. The managers were okay.  Easy to approach.  The schedule was a little unpredictable.  But overall it was a good place to work."
good,"Changes were recently made to hurt sales efforts.  Company service levels were lacking and customers were reacting unfavorably.  Overall, I got a lot of sales experience from the company."
good,"WESCO is a typical supplier/distributor, very bottom line/margin driven.  Locations are dependent on competition and manufacturer discounts."
good,Wesco is a great place to work.  Always very busy.  Always work to be done.  The customers are great.  The company is very concerned about its employees.
good,"WESCO was my first job at the age of 21. It had, by far, the best benefits of any company I've worked for since. They offered health, dental, vision, stock options, and 401k. The position was salaried and required a 40-hour work week."
good,"Worked with wonderful people, driving was a great aspect of the job Provided great customer service to different job vendors. Learned about the electrical and construction materials and equipment."
good,The best thing about working at Wesco is I am always busy and learning new things. The only con is the disconnect between the sales  and operations sides of the business.
good,"At this job you did typical warehouse duties including forklift operation, and using a pallet jack, while adhereing to all safety guidelines"
good,Performed inside and outside sales with take-offs as needed for any and all switchgear and panels and associated products.
good,Great working environment. Very well structured workflow. World leader in distribution and supply chain. its been great working at wesco
good,"At Wesco you spend a lot of time cleaning and prepping coffee stations and filling product, but you also get to know the customers and are able to enjoy the times that they come in. Customers are what make the store!"
good,"Greet visitors and keep log and cover incoming phone lines"
good,"A typical day at work is one filled with challenges. Being the go to person has taught me how to multi-task very well. "
good,Great place to work.  Enjoyed meeting new people each and everyday.  Every workday was different. Sometimes you are required to work long hours though.
good,"Very busy and growing company. "
good,I loved it here. I got to meet a lot of great people and enjoyed the work. It wasn't a very demanding job. There were times where it could be stressful but that was only because depending on the spot you were working in the bakery the other two on the team depended on you to determine when they got out for the night.
good,WESCO has some great people to work with.  Wesco people are professional and proud of the great relationships they build with their Customers and Suppliers.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace and interaction with the customers.
good,"Wesco has been a great place to work. A typical night is simply frying donuts and cleaning. I have learned basic decorating skills, as well as how to make donuts. The worst part about my job is that it is 3rd shift, I work 9pm-5am. The best part of my job is when customers ask for me by name."
good,"Fast paced and administratively heavy. Corporate office is located in Pittsburgh, PA. Will have to travel for periodic training classes. Job responsibilities included managing inside sales, warehouse associates,"
good,"I have a very positive experience. Staff is very patient and helpful. Very busy on the phone. Very customer satisfaction oriented. Was hired as a temporary contractor, but would definitely accept the position."
good,"Great people to work with at the location I worked out of. New District Manager came in and wanted to completely change the workplace environment which was winning awards for margin levels achieved, new DM caused people to leave the company and work elsewhere including myself."
good,I spent most days on the phone or emailing customers to provide technical support. Management varies greatly depending on what department you work in. Workplace culture is very much an old boys club. The hardest part of the job is watching strategy revolve around short term gains for stock holders. The most enjoyable part of the job is the autonomy to make decisions that some management teams provide.
good,"management is good, have to jump through hoops for a 10 cent raise, you get free pop and popcorn while on the clock, hours aren't the best but they are manageable"
good,"The hardest part about working at Wesco would have to be some of the customers we get. I have learned how to be way more patient than I used to be because of those customers. I love my manager there, she makes going to work enjoyable and is very helpful when one of us is having a bad day. I would recommend working at Wesco if you need a job."
good,Good company to work for if looking into college they help pay and if looking to advance depending on the management. If like customers and good working environment place to work at.
good,"Overall Wesco is a great place to work and for growth opportunities. They value their employees and encourage personal development. As much as is possible they retain their employees and see them as assets they can invest in, that means your future. As it goes with most companies, they are always looking to grow and improve."
good,The workplace environment varied with my particular position due to the amount of travel required.  There was tremendous flexibility in the field role as I marketed for 30+ branch locations.
good,"Great company and people to work with. The job requirements were great . Compensations was always going to be the main complain, however because of the varying dimensions of this job and  the interesting aspects of it it was worth all of my efforts and commitments. It was mainly a out of the office job most times , requiring a lot of travel to various locations. It provided me with the ability of share my own ideas, recommendation  and abilities at these locations. Its always a good feeling when your own ideas and recommendations are adopted by these stores and  helps to  save the company and protect both staff and customers. Whether it is an audit check or the regular inventory counts"
good,I really like picking and packing but had to leave this job to move closer to my daughters

Direct activities/responsibilities of FS Associates and Analysts; approval of new customer accounts, protect A/R by securing personal or third party guarantees, LOC, bond/lien rights, and review of financial information."
good,The best part of my job was learning another industry while servicing my customers! Branch manager was supportive and willing to teach upon request.
good,"Good job and work environment with good hours and benefits, but does get stale at times and no real room for advancement and/or pay increases. If you are looking to stay in one position for a long time, could work for you."
good,It was ok at times but the buddy buddy relationship with certain salesman and upper management put little say in other employees opinions. Some previous employees had salary pay in the supervisor position. Unfortunately I was awarded with hourly pay.

good,"Productive and great team work. We help each other succeed. We have training 2 times a meeting. A sales meeting every Monday-Wednesday. Start work at 7:30-4:30.

good,WESCO offers great opportunities for all types of jobs.  Overall friendly atmosphere with a well structured business portfolio. International offices provide relocation opportunities depending on skill set and available position
good,"Able to work remote.  Often times no direction provided.  Work culture was good. Management tended to stay in the ""background"".  Large customer base with multiple products to offer these customers."
good,"Although they are not in the area any longer, Wesco was one of the better companies to work for.  My only issue I had was being on ""temp"" status for longer than I was initially to be,"
good,My daily work consisted of inventory check and making sure things were in order and accounted for. I routed delivery drivers and made sure deliveries were handled accurately. When these things were taken care of I helped customers with counter sales. I also billed sales tickets at the end of the day.
good,"it was ok to work here just low pay and insureance was not that good"
good,"Some managers/team mates have been great to work for. A lot of changes come down from the top and they don't understand the impact of the ""on the frontline"" workers."
good,Great physical work. great way to make friends and the people are friendly. over all I had a great time working there but it was time for me to move so I had to let the job go
good,"Overall this job wasn't bad, I almost enjoyed my two and a half years there. The management needed a lot of help but the employees made up where they lacked. The pay was great and the benefits were even better."
good,"It can be a fast paced work environment but there is a good support network from fellow staff and management. "
good,"A typical day at my job consists of putting away deliveries, completing shift duties, and ensuring that our customers have the best experience they can when shopping at our store."
good,"I loved worked with Wesco, unfortunatly, the lost the contract with big Customer in my area"
good,"Excellent company to work for i started at Wesco over 3 years ago i was told that i would start on an agency contract until my contract was drafted and approved. I was told that this would tahe no lnger than 3 months,This was over 3 years ago and i have still not got a full contractths"
good,"Most employees have laptops to perform work on-the-go so a typical workday consists of reading emails and responding to inquiries or resolving issues.  There are daily reports to be ran and a huge push to find ways to increase margin, prevent margin erosion, and to recover margin."
good,getting my shipments ready for delivery. management treats the employees fair. my co- are great to work with. we work as a team.
good,Worked with the clients with in there home and worked on goals that the clients wanted to accomplish. I learned a lot on how to manage tone of voice when talking to others and worked with communication skills. Loved most all the co-workers with in the job. The hardest part of the job was not being able to be home when my husband was. I enjoyed seeing the clients enjoying themselves and laughing with joy from the company that us as there workers.
good,"Well spent ten years of my career, furthering my experience in materials management, project management, manufacturing scheduling, customer issue resolution and in my last position as Facilities and IT Manger."
good,The customers were number one in this company. As it should be. The company worked hard to see that all stores had equipment and were mantained up to the Wesco standard. I truly enjoyed this job.
good,"Enjoyed Job Duties"
good,"goed bedrijf , met vakkundige mensen. je werkt op meerdere projecten alleen te poetsen en vanaf vroeg in de morgen"
good,"No longer work at this job. However, most days was productive. When it was slow, I always stayed on task. Management and HR was extremely poor and lack of communication."
good,"Wesco company was an easy to follow job. Manual labour was standard, and learned the system as you went."
good,Work was challenging but manageable.  Compensation wasn't equivalent to job demands.  Customer relationships demand significant communication and negotiation skills.
good,"Typical office environment, regular office duties. Nice employees and had room for growth and advancement. Also they had  good leadership from the top."
good,"A typical day at work involved insured that product was picked, packed and loaded for delivery to various companies.  Accuracy percentage was kept for each employees.  We were expected to get product out in a timely matter with minimal to no errors."
good,same day to day work schedule. Busy most of the time. The management is okay I do believe they need to find someone whose more knowledgeable about the hardware.
good,Wesco is a fast paced environment that starts you above minimum wage. If you can handle the fast paced environment then you'll do just fine. We're all a big family who help one another out whenever someone needs something
good,"I was a Deli Associate for Wesco, and let me tell you, thats the best place to be for Wesco (store side wa crazy bussy). Often times though, it would be insanely stressful working the closing shift. You'd have to try to take orders, do all of your expected duties, try to close the kitchen alone, AND get out on time. Wesco is very strict about measurements for recipes, too, so weighing all the ingredients was a pain. Working the morning shift, however, was very nice as long as you could keep pace. Still liked the job though, the environment was very inviting and everybody was close."
good,"The company was very good to work for, the work was very intense and very challenging i like the challenge. Run powder truck load holes with AN and Diesel fuel, management was not very communtive with employees. Becoming a blaster was the hardest and the biggest challenge."
good,I have not been working there very long but so far its a very clean organized warehouse. Staff is friendly and break room is clean. Very helpful in getting me accommodated to the way they do things in their warehouse.
good,"Wesco had many branch offices, and I worked in a satellite office for a Wisconsin branch.  There were two Inside Sales employees for my branch and we discussed issues first off in the morning.  It was very much a mixture of account management and product quotations. order processing, special ordered items from specs and diagrams, and shipment expediting.  Our branch represented 1 very large company so I spoke to the purchasing and engineering departments throughout the day.  "
good,Good organization with a decent culture.  Being a private company has its challenges and general Wesco does well.  American versus Canadian culture can be a challenge but the Canadian team does a good job
good,"wesco is a great environment. they have great programs for school reimbursement, benefits, great bonuses. I have grown so much with them in the last four years."
good,"Wesco is a good company to work for, but it does have some down falls. This company has some staff that tend to think they are always right. But there is may positives to Wesco, the individuals make your day fun."
good,"WESCO LLC well equipped and fully dedicated to instrumentation and controls in most of the fields."

good,"Every day is extremely different. Was able to work as part of a team constantly, which was very enjoyable. Management is very easy to get along with."
good,"overall Wesco is a good place to work. the pay is great and benefits are good. however unless you have a four year degree, dont plan on any advancment to a better position. I was hired to be the warehouse manager, but was never offered the position once it became available. after inquiring about what was discussed before I was hired, I found out that I was passed over because I didnt have a four year degree.I had to teach the new manager how to operate a forklift, being that he had NO warehouse experience what so ever but just graduated college!! I have 10+ years of warehouse managment experience, but that meant nothing to wesco higher-ups. I was stuck in a drivers/warehouse associate position. also be prepared to be shipped off to somewhere, where a natural disaster has occurred (E.G. tornado, hurricane...etc) and assist in restoring power to those areas. no choice, no bonus, no special pay. you just have to go and do what they say. employees are friendly and helpful, and working conditions are clean and pleasant. managment is very strict but will kid around somewhat on their terms. when things get stressful i just think of they pay. they will take you to lunch for free several times in a month and claim it on business expense"
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, capacitación, administración y preocupación por el empleado."
good,"Wesco overall is an ok company as far as it goes when dealing with its customers. They have a good vacation system for the employees, and work system however I feel the employees should make more."
good,My responsibility is consumer service. I would work at a register ringing up items for the customer and stocking items on the shelves. Cleaning is also part of my responsibilities.
good,"Excellent company to seek employment with. My experience, manager's have an open door policy. Training offered via the web for a variety of topics. Good employment advancement if the effort is put in."
good,"Since my Division was closed, I can't really review this place of employment any longer.  There are olther Wesco locations and I can't review those locations."
good,Was home for the summer from school and worked in the warehouse. Very straight forward job every day and normal hours. Learn how to quickly perform tasks with a high level of accuracy.
good,"Great place, supervisor is great very understanding, management not so much, very difficult to work with. Great hours good location pay not so much. Enjoyed my time with Wesco."
good,The most enjoyable thing abiut working there was that the workers and staff were wwre remarkable to work with.when needed advice about how  the cusomer needed their product built the would advice you.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, en la parte que elabore ahi fue mas en el proceso de producción aplicando un método llamado las 5 s y fue todo un éxito"
good,I enjoy working with the people at Wesco. Sometimes I wish there was more connection with management. I feel like management will work more closely with the people that they regularly work with instead of reaching out to other shifts to see how they can make a good connection.
good,"I have gained a great deal of experience, knowledge, memories, skills,  and friends while being employed by Wesco. The provide many benefits and opportunities for employees, while creating an exceptional atmosphere for working and shopping."

good,Great place to work company offers college reimbursement. Management is great and hour are flexible.
good,Loves working for Wesco. Lots of room to grow. They teach you life skills that will help you along the way even after you leave the company. They are very good at educating when people make mistakes instead of just letting them go.
good,"Great manager, lots of diversity.  I like being depended on and having the respect of my manager knowing that I can complete whatever task he gives me without being micro managed."
good,It was a good place to work until they started reducing inventory.   Most of the customers needed their parts the same day which makes it hard to meet sales goals.
good,Great comunication with staff and managment. Great place to learn. I greattly enjoy working for this company. They offer excellent quality products and the work life is balanced.
good,"Mejor comunicación "

good,"not fun serious place, alot of office drama, owner was good, employees were bad always complaining about raise call in sick alot.. my job was easy dispatching calls"
good,WESCO is not a bad place to work. Just days are very busy from start to finish. Which I dont mind because it makes the day go quickly. The office I worked in went from 3 people doing the job I do now to just ME. I feel overwhelmed and under appreciated some days!
good,fast pace sales environment filling the customers need finding the best prices for the customer helping the customer to find the right for the part their needs
good,"Enjoy the job as a whole, but the management and their lack of sympathy and understanding is the reason I'm ready to move on. Events that happen in your life they could care less about all they care about is you work when they need you."
good,On a typical day my previous coworkers and I picked daily orders and shipped them to address provided. I learned how to use the Bluecherry system as well as the scanners.
good,"buena empresa en todos los aspectos, un lugar agradable para laborar."
good,I would recommend working at WESCO. The managers were very respectful helpful and organized.  The job I did was easy paced and my Co workers helped me adjust well to the position.
good,I really enjoyed my coworkers in the Wesco bakery that I worked in. We were really appreciated by our store manager and it was shown. I also like that Wesco offers college reimbursement and other great benefits.
good,Enjoyed by position and chance to explore Thailand.  Locals were great and job was fairly straight forward.  I was paid well and had nothing negative to say.
good,"En wesco distribution mexico, me encontré con un trabajo donde no había almacén sabiendo que fui contratado como almacenista, a la intemperie y bajo el sol de 40C°, sin embargo yo y mis compañeros nos pusimos a trabajar sin abdicar un segundo. No tardaron en traer lonas y agua para satisfacer las necesidades del sol. Pero seguíamos sin tener electricidad. Al llegar la paga, la mayoría de mis compañeros tenían problemas al cobrar o llegaba menos. Yo tuve la suerte de no tener problema alguno. Aparte de que tardaron a todos en pagarnos la ultima paga. Todo este problema fue de logística. Quitando eso de fuera, fue un buen ambiente laboral e hicimos lo posible para que el trabajo terminara satisfactoriamente."
good,"I enjoyed and gained so much working here for about 6 years. Started there for the education reimbursement, while attending Baker College. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement and compensation."

good,Wesco was an excellent place to work. They care about their employee's. There is always room for promotions. They have great benefits. Also have an excellent school reimbursement program.
good,Good staff provided. Along with great care for the facilities for the employees and the customers. Great products as well.
good,"I enjoyed my 3 years at Wesco for many reasons. For the most part we were left alone by our boss, because it was our own sole responsibility to make sure our daily tasks us were completed, and that orders were pulled and shipped out on time. This was slightly stressful at times, but gave an overall sense of freedom and trust between manager and employee. There were days where the work was hard, and days where it was more relaxed. This made it enjoyable, as it never really got too repetitive on a day to day basis."
good,"Process orientated company. I learned about inventory management and software. I had good people there, those always ready to support and help you."
good,"Typical day working at WESCO was always busy! I learned that it is important to stay on track and get things done. Management at WESCO is great. Co-workers are hard workers. They work together, they make sure things are going the way they should be, and they help get the job done. The hardest part of the job is hoping to never mess anything up, tot not have any problems. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work for WESCO."
good,"Everyone is very professional and approachable. i enjoy the people on my team. There is a lot of individual work, but we all work towards the same goals and communicate often to achieve those goals."
good,"Wesco was a great place to work at. They are constantly striving to make their company succeed. I completed many task during my work day and we had to sign off an extensive work sheet when we completed task. On an average work day I would wait on customers, clean indoors/outdoors and work on stock. Many team building exercises would take place to go over conflicts and to get to know your co-workers. The management was decent but needed some work due to the role of favorites. I enjoyed cleaning and stocking but when I had to stand behind the counter to long while waiting on customers I would find myself getting restless. I constantly have to be on the move improving things. I absolutely loved my customers and I rarely had any rude customers. Now that I have left I still know and speak to many of them and its an amazing feeling. I enjoyed my time there but I was ready for something new!"
good,This company is a constant source of information to the employee.  The online services provided makes managing personal matters very easy.

good,Wesco is very flexable with their hours and they always have a place for you. They are all about helping you improve your skills not only to benefit them but yourself as well. With JPR you can set higher goals for yourself and once reached you are rewarded with a bonus every month.
good,"Hours are good for the family work balance."
good,"The company culture is very mellow and subdued for the most part and everyone is expected to do their job and their are rarely questions based on performance. The management treats their staff differently based on the assigned roles and so advancement is possible though it varied. The company is, however, quite generous with budgets and so allows for constant new hires and opportunities for promotions based on performance. The part I worked for only worked through temp agencies and once employed, benefits including time off and insurance were very generous."
good,Wesco is a very busy gas station. I enjoyed working with the other employees and i got along with them. There was always something to do to keep yourself busy. I also enjoyed working with the managers
good,You get to know the customers and connect with them. Co-workers and management make it a fun place to be. Company outings every summer make the employees feel appreciated.
good,I felt I was very appreciated while I was working there and was trusted to run the warehouse and all the operations involved in the warehouse.
good,"I loved working here. The people were fun, my boss was fantastic and work was always interesting. Felt like a family here. Hardest part of the job was helping customers. Not because I was bad at it or anything, but after working a ten hour shift going on eleven and still helping customers, it got just a touch harder to keep up the smile but I did my best, and had no complaints in the two years I worked there."
good,I enjoyed working at wesco. I enjoyed the physical labor and the management was super understanding and really nice. I hated to leave but the heat exhaustion was getting bad
good,"Great pay and benefits . Excellent schedule and very rarely did we work overtime , when combined I had 32 days off a year that includes vacation , holiday and floater days and you could take half days ."
good,"I was a part of Wesco for many years until poor management stepped in and tried to change something that didn't need to be changed. Also because of this, the company started losing business which then lead to a number of employees, including me, to be layed off and even forced into early retirement."
good,Wesco Indianapolis in particular is a good place to work. They offer a supportive atmosphere and recognition for effort and accomplishment. Management communicates well and expectations are clear.
good,"While at work I received material from different freight companies and was in charge in entering the packing slips into our data base and then store them in the warehouse in the specified location. I was also in charge of shipping freight to our customers on a daily basis. I had a great relationship with all of the employees. The hardest part of my job was only when we would recieve a large amount of freight in one day and had to find places to store in the warehouse. For instance, the hardest time to work there was when a hurricane would hit land in the south. My place of work was the main distributor for the electrical companies in the south. So, when a hurricane would hit land we were working around the clock for months at a time to make sure our customers received the equipment they needed to restore power to the community. The best part of my job was learning. I was able to learn how to properly maintain a warehouse with thousands of different items in stock.

good,I will not go into too much detail.  I was let go in 2009 during the economic downturn.  I would accept another job with WESCO in a heartbeat.
good,"A typical day at WESCO would start at 8am. Usually already had messages waiting for customer orders. Vendor meeting through out the day. Called new and existing customers for upcoming projects. The hardest part, probably the structure of bidding a quote, competing with your own co-workers to win the bid. The most enjoyable part was working with different vendors to learn about the latest and greatest product line."
good,"A typical day consisted of order processing, storing small airplane parts,  pulling parts to be issued, & conducting Inventory. The management was very hands on, & we worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the political things that was going on at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a good team of people."

good,It is a fast pace job and a place you can grow within the company. Sometimes you have to make choices and think outside the box and you are able to work as a team to accomplish the task you are given.
good,"I worked at Wesco for nine years and loved just about every second of it. We wanted our customers to walk out being satisfied, but more then that walk out with a smile. It was a very laid back, fun, and positive environment. It was a job where you woke up and wanted to go to work. My job duties there was to greet customers with exceptional customer service, answer phone calls, collect payments and resolve any conflict so the customer always leaves with a positive opinion about Wesco."

good,"Very Solid and Productive Company"
good,Typical day at work is making sure you have a sense of urgency to make sure you take care of the customer. I manage a team of 30 employees.  The reason we are successful is because of my team.  They understand that we have the same goal and work together to meet our customer expectations. The hardest part of my job is when a supplier does not meet your needs and you have to relay the information to the customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my employees and my customer.
good,Really enjoyed working for WESCO. Wonderful group of people to work with/for. Co-workers with helpful and friendly. Management was approachable and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was learning the older programs.

good,"Work hours from 730 am to 430 pm.  No overtime required, some was given on my own for networking with clients and potential clients.  Learned a lot about outside sales having come from a retail background.  Work well with managers and have been able to assist and support them in their day to day duties.  I really enjoyed most of my coworkers and our support staff.  I think the hardest part of the job was living in a rural area with limited population and having a lot of competition.  The most enjoyable part of the job was winning new business and project business."
good,The company has pockets of great managers and sales teams and pockets of poor performers that can drag down programs.  There was a lot of negativity at the company and a lot of people who didn't seem to like working there.  Making progress with these teams was like pulling teeth.  Conversely there was certain teams and individuals that were very professional and very good at their jobs.  Generally I had a bad experience but had visited other offices that the atmosphere and people were top notch and I imagine those offices would have been great to work in.
good,"A typical day starts with receiving and entering all Packing Slips into computer system, making sure all merchandise and equipment that comes into company matches Packing Slips. Pulling all Special Ordered items out and place them where necessary..I learned stock"
good,Working at WESCO was great. There was plenty of room for advancement and communication with coworkers was great. Meetings were held almost daily which was very informative
good,I love working for Wesco as the Warehouse Manager. Set schedule and they helped us work smarter not harder to help with the workload. I probably would still be working there if the store had not relocated.
good,"Typical day at Wesco started with gathering items identified for delivery to customers and getting them loaded onto the trucks for the deliveries to be made.  The rest of the day would be spent receiving orders from UPS and FEDEX and unloading LTL truck deliveries and putting materials away in there proper location."
good,"I like working for Wesco, I enjoy working with the employees and the company.  Everyone is really nice. I learned how to work within a group.  Hardest part of the job is leaving at the end of the day."
good,The job consisted of normal 8-5 hour with no overtime. End of the months and summers where usually busy due to construction constraints. Management has been there for a 20 plus years and always included employees and was yearly goals where to be met. One of the best overall jobs I've had.

good,Co-workers and management work well together to get the job done. Striving to get it done right the first time putting the customers first.
good,"I wish I had worked at Wesco for my first job. I worked the night shift, which paid very well and was a fairly easy job. Mostly involved cleaning. I would come in just before midnight and leave around 7 AM. I cleaned all the soda and coffee machines, and generally kept the store looking good. I learned the value of honesty and company loyalty, as well as picking up a few customer service tricks that have helped me really connect with customers. The only downside, and main reason I was not happy at Wesco, was management. I did not connect with management, I felt as if they had a problem with me on a personal level for some reason. I loved the job but between my wacky sleep schedule and unsupportive managers, I couldn't do it anymore. I did not have any such problems with coworkers. I would happily return to Wesco if I could work at a different store, or if management was changed."
good,Wesco is a great place to work at.  Great down to earth people.  I miss working with them!  I went through their sales and mgmt training program.  Was a good opportunity to learn and growth as a professional.
good,"	To  coordinate  the  testing,  repairing,  calibration  and  trouble  shooting  of  the Instrumentation Control systems"
good,"If you keep in perspective that this is an entry level job, you will be amazed by Wesco.  They offer regular raises for good work, and promote from within.  It is hard work, and they have expectations, but they also offer profit sharing and a person can directly have an impact on what they get through sales.   You won't get rich working for Wesco, but you will have a better than average entry level position where if you put in the effort, it is rewarded."
good,"Typical day at work consists of:"
good,Was a great company not many people six people in the office at most. No distractions laid back not pressed great environment to work.
good,Working for Wesco was the best Job I've ever had settled in really quickly & was given fantastic support along the way & helped establish a great working relationship with our main customer where I was based my only regret is that I left in pursuit of other opportunities. I would fully recommend Wesco to anyone.
good,"Wesco is a driven publicly traded company. I have enjoyed my work Wesco, but I'm moving to Denver Co. as soon as I can find a position that will utilize my experience as capabilities. In Denver at present there no positions available with Wesco or I would transfer with Wesco. The most enjoyable part of my position is I work off site most of the time which allows me to organize and follow through with the needs of US Steel. A typical day is preparing products for delivery, and putting away all products into the the proper storerooms. I talk with various procurement specialists to ensure their needs are being met. I also trouble shoot as needed and work with Inside Sales and Outside Sales to solve any problems. The hardest part of the job is taking care of 11 storerooms with over 2000 products."
good,Had a great learning experience working on the projects team! I was located remotely on construction sites as a project coordinator which enhanced our capability to provide on-site customer service and material management.  I would do it again!
good,"Honestly I would recommend anyone looking for a job that likes to work for a great caring company to apply. They are understanding, but also keep business business.  If working with the community is something you like to do than this is the job for you."
good,Trucks stating showing up at 7am didn't stop till receiving closed.

good,Working in this kind of warehouse business was really the thing i like working with. I operated a sit down propane forklift. I pulled orders for our international trailers as well as our local ones as well. I would be lifting over 100+ lbs throughout my shift. I pulled and loaded orders for next day deliveries in the proper staging areas. I did do some local deliveries to various companies.
good,This position was as a Crib Attendant through Wesco at Pratt and Whitney. The environment was comfortable and quiet during second shift. The employees were all kind.
good,There was a structured work environment dedicated to advancing their employees into positions in-house as they became available promoting lean work practices and allowing for educational opportunities
good,"I went from a job I hated and wasn't encouraged to learn much from (in a connected field) to getting an informative and helpful answer to just about anything I could think of. From the warehouse, to inside sales, all the way up to district and regional management, everyone wanted to help everyone in anyway they could. If I hadn't moved out of state or if I had been able to get transferred, I would still be working there happily."
good,"good location, great team, support for position is low, working for a publicly traded company is risky when return on investments are low."
good,"Was a good company to work for, long hours, competitive pay. There is a lack of growth in the company once you get into management."

good,"This was a very good company to work for as they made sure you were trained in sales, product, and sales goals. A very professional business. The sales manager not only trained you to be successful but helped with customer sales plans, forecasts, and on road sales supported by traveling together for some of my sales calls. Any advice I required was there for me."

good,"Great place to work.I think that the staff was amazing and had it not been for my family having to relocate, I would still be working there.Overall this is a 5 star rating"
good,"Best place worked  employees are great to work with. Great scheduling "
good,Long hours especially being at work super early but it was worth it if you pushed yourself. Always learned a ton as i would take notes of everything new that i have learned. Management was always on your side as the higher-ups would come to your cubicle every time you needed help on anything. That was a big plus for me. Hardest part of the job was to stay on top of everything and you will always be busy. There's hardly a break in work so expect to be working a around the clock and they only break you'll have is when you take a 30 minutes for lunch. The best part of the job was the small work force that i was at. Everybody knew everyone and you were able to create lifelong friends. I am still in contact with many of the coworkers there.
good,"willing to work with their employees , vast training for material sold "
good,"I enjoyed working here, steady paced but as long as you wanted to be busy you could be. I enjoyed the social aspect of the job and found it quite pleasant. I regret the fact that I left do to home and family and I would work there again if offered."

Great place to work!"
good,"working here is great, it surely has its ups and downs but there’s nothing better than having those rewarding customers to make it all up. This job position is great if you can think quick on your feet"
good,Loved the job it was slow pace easy going plenty of training and was quick at picking everything up I had a good bond with my boss and the only reason I left here was because the store got shut down
good,"Resting will also make for a better finished texture. If you don’t let your chops sit before digging in, all of the juices can come seeping out, and you’ll be left with a dry pork chop."

good,Working at Wesco has taught me to be a better worker and how to work under pressure and not let it get to your head. A typical day at Wesco is like we have to pick and put away 600 lines a product to different branches all over the lower mainland. I've learned to be a better manager I've learned to be a better worker also a better teacher as well because I trained all the new people that come into the company I've also learned how to drive forklifts of all types. The hardest part of my job in my mind is when a branch orders too much of one product and the most enjoyable part of my job is all my co-workers and all the help I can get from them and how nice they all are.
good,Enjoyed working there. Relaxed work environment with friendly coworkers. Easy job and enjoyed the driving and meeting with individuals  at different work sites.
good,I really enjoyed Wesco they are a really good company. The management at this company is really awesome. They Really take care of their employees and customers.

good,Wesco as a company is a great place to earn a paycheck. 
good,"Worked as a driver delivering materials to local contractors.  Great job with full benefits and full time pay.  Management generally doesn't bother you, but are willing to help with issues when able.  Co-workers are enjoyable and fun to work beside.  Most of the time is spent in the truck without anyone looking over your shoulder, so you can listen to whatever music you like while on the job.  Generally expected to help customers unload their materials."
good,"An averaged day working at WESCO consisted of shipments coming from semi-trucks in the loading bay, which were always quickly unloaded and received in a computer program that would defer whether the items were shipping out to NEXTEER or to be stocked in the warehouse. I learned how to work every position in the receiving room as well as the shipment room where orders were to be delivered. Both the managers in the receiving and delivery areas were very nice and patient people. They made sure that everyone was getting along because it is imperative that everyone work together. The hardest part of the job was the relentless amounts of orders that would come in during the day, but there were also times where not many orders would come in at all. When nexteer wasn't placing many orders it was relaxing because you could stock inventory or clean at a more leisurely pace."
good,"Wesco was a great place to work, best manager I have ever worked for. I would visit many customers through out New England on a weekly bases. The more I sold the more money I made. The only thing that was wrong is that there was to much competition other distributors we selling at a very low margin. It wasn't about customer service any longer, it got to be about the lowest price, it was time to retire."
