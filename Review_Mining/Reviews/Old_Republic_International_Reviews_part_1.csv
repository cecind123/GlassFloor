rating,review
bad,"Unfair policies, harassment of employees, cover up and corrupt management. Absolutely no regard for their employees, overworked and under paid. No education or training practices in place."
bad,"Orhp is a horrible company to work for they say they are there to promote growth and it’s a good work environment but it’s not .They micromanage people ,talk down to employees ,over work you because everyone quit .Horrible HR manger ,per she is really not knowledgeable .Manager leave to go drink and hang out on company time .Supervisor and management sleeping with hourly associate"
bad,"low pay, rude leads and managers, favoritism, not flexible with sick family leave or sick leave. over time. long commute. no time off without a note. far."
bad,"Management did not support and no room for growth.  I worked here a short time but did not enjoy the experience.  For the first time in my life, I walked away from a job due to the unprofessional displayed there."
bad,This company was horrible place to work. Bad management on every level. Poor work conditions & old & out dated break area. The other employees were not friendly and acted as if were afraid of termination if were sociable. Would not refer any one to work at Old Republic.
bad,"There was a lot  of who knows who to get the better position. It wasn't based off your skill set. It was based on who you know. Even though i was promoted to a higher position the management their were real into getting in your personal business,"
bad,Poorly run. Management was poorly equipped to run and operate a business let alone people. Job culture was absent.
bad,"This place will tell you how they were did not plan on staying at ORHP, but did and is currently been there for 20 something years. How great the people there are and how they take pride in “People Helping People”. This is a game folks into being manipulated that this is the place to be when in fact they do not follow the culture themselves. Do as I say not as I do should be there “matto”. The pay is ok for what you do. This is a highly stressful environment and would not suggest this employer even if my family was starving I would not choose ORHP to employee me."
bad,"What a toxic environment!  It starts with the HR department and rolls down hill.  Red tape for everything and it's very annoying.  They say everyone has the same rules and then you watch to see how they clearly don't.  Pay was absurd and only a temporary paycheck.  There is a different ""system"" for each department and nothing talks to the other.  People run in circles checking for info they could have looked up themselves IF everyone was on the same system.  And make sure you do a ticket for IT because no one can speak to you without that.  Run fast from this disaster of a company."
bad,Treat staff like dirt and no job security. No matter how long you have been there they will fire you just based policys. The managers and supervisors pass off work to people inder them while they sit and socialize at each other desk. Supervisor fire staff for attendance while they are late daily themselves. They also feel like you kids being sick is a non factor. They want the company to come before a child even newborn ba bies
bad,A typical day at work was ordering or sending files to the file room. I learned how to work in Excel better and faster. Management was ok. My co-workers were nice people. Very friendly. There was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. We worked as a team to get the job done.
bad,I enjoyed working with the people in my department.  This place was very prejudice and upper management made it very uncomfortable to work there.
bad,"No appreciation, no bonuses, no work from home or telecommute allowed, few perks unless you call basic insurance a perk, which they cut back on most every year.  1960's dress code.  Women and minorities are not valued.  They do not want to hear your voice, input or opinions.  Opposite of a team climate."
bad,"Little or no upper management communication to personnel.  Think opposite of a team or open door policy.   Your voice nor input will be considered, in at least several depts."
bad,I would not recommend this place to work at.  Your are micro managed to the pont of exhaustion.  Every move is monitored and if you ask questions to be a better employee you are shot down and made to feel/look stupid.
bad,"This is a company who required much and gives little. The management had unrealistic expectations, were very inappropriate and allowed harassment of employees withing the location. I started as a receptionist and moved to become a assistant asset manager within 2 years. There is very little training or guidance, and no programs available to expand your knowledge."
bad,"I was able to learn and improve some of my skills but a very depressing place to work with a very low moral with the co-workers.  However, the co-workers were dedicated and hardworking individuals.  I was very impressed with their dedication to the task at hand."
bad,"Management at office were incompetent, self serving, condescending.  If it weren't for 2 employees a certain department would fail completely!!!!  Professional growth is non existent no matter how hard you work and would rather hire completely ignorant people than promote qualified candidates from within.  All around great people working at the office but beware of certain department were all of the above apply!!!  And the brass at the company are the greatest, approachable, and very down to earth."
bad,This position was a job that I took right out of college. the company overall is a decent company however the management is something that need a lot of improvement
bad,"Management- As I am in management I can say, like most employers, management style does not suit my expectations. Management is a ""punishment"" style: do ten things right and nobody mentions it. Do one thing wrong and you're position is threatened. I don't feel employees are appreciated here. Its a revolving door for employees. Majority of the staff are temps (around 70%), therefor you run into the renter type mentality. Management does not celebrate the employees and employees are not motivated."
bad,I was responsible for completing authorization requests from customers who wanted to file an insurance claim. The job was overall good and the workplace was professional.
bad,High volume call center with unhappy plan holder on the other side of the phone ready to yell at you for something not being covered in there plan. Pay is to low for the stress. Company does not want you to take any time off in the summer. So count out family vacations. This is a job for single people who doesn't have a life outside of work
bad,"Lots of manual work, lack of advancement opportunities, long term employees wages not kept up with current market of new hires, environmental concerns over upkeep of old building, frequent changes to company policies."
bad,Numbers driven dollar recovery (not collections or loss mitigation).  Fun part was working with Secondary mortgage market investors to sell defaulted loans to.
bad,A typical day at work consist of accounts payable inputting and reviewing. There is a lot of technical and operational accounting task such as claims check cutting and daily check scanning and reviewing. I also do daily analytical and  reviewing to ensure accuracy and proper reporting. Management and co workers are supportive. The hardest part of my job is playing catch up if things are behind because i have an important role and it is time sensitive so I like to be one step ahead.The most enjoyable part of my job is the analytical work I enjoy finding useful information to help reporting and decision making or new controls to help better work flow.
bad,"I look forward to working in an out of the box environment, open to new ideas and tools to improve BI."
bad,I learned that you have to cover you behind. I like some of the people I worked with the differnt brokers and agencies. Very nice people but management was not updated. The style of Management was truly outdated.
bad,"I was hired by this company shortly after it opened in 2009 and was there until recently.  I saw a lot of possibilities in the first few years but as time went on they began to take advantage of the employees working 10 to 12 hour shifts and Saturday's.  Management became  us against them, the floor was always quiet and subdued unlike when the company first started when there was a lot of enthusiasm and life in the office.  The people who worked there were nice and everyone got along well but they all felt the cloud hanging over their heads.  There was no enjoyable part of the job but I will say the pay and benefits were attractive.  The hardest part was having to sit for hours at a desk trying to meet deadlines imposed by management."
bad,"Had to sign in at 8am on the dot or get written up. two 15min breaks and exactly one hour for lunch. the rest of the day consisted of pulling, filing, delivering and boxing up hard copies of customer files. I learned very little work wise and a lot about people. The management was not great. My co-workers were great. They are what made the days bearable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with lack of communication between departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,"They hired 20+ people and kept us 8 weeks and the last day of training they started separating us into some people going out to start actually working and some of us ""didnt have desks yet and they would be available tomorrow"" then on our way home called and fired us. Does not take care of their employees, they are dispensable."
good,I reeview mortgage loan files for accuracy and work with great co-workers.
good,"I started as a temp worker then got hired permanently.  Most people are friendly.  After a while, I felt like i have done all I can do there and just felt like it was my time to go."
good,"Although I met and worked with some very nice coworkers management was the real issue. It seems as though management was more worried about their appearance more so than their employees, I was hired, but not properly trained and was shifted around from person to person not currently doing the job that they were training me to do. Lack of communication between departments and department heads that were supposed to be working in conjunction with one another was also a problem. Rude upper management as well as an unprofessional HR representative that showed up to work inebriated on a daily basis."
good,"The person I worked under was really moody when you asked a question  she was not good at all!!!! Whenever you ask this manager a question she seem like she was being bother or she took too long to get back to you and she had let certain people get away with a lot of thingsWhen you make mistakes they hold it against you forever like you are a  target and never praise you on how good you are doing just the negative things and never tell you ""Good Job"
good,This company often hires employees with minimal to no office work experience. I'd say its a good place to gain experience with the lowest pay possible
good,"Began work at 8 am, answering all calls and directing them to correct department, processed all outgoing and incoming mail, filing, volunteer to help co workers when my task were completed, hardest part setting up claims, best co workers"
good,ORMDS is an environment where you are constantly putting long hours in order to meet production goals. I learned the loss mitigation process while being at ORDMS. 
good,"I love working here, it's an amazing place. I would recomend it to anyone. I need more of a challenge, that's why I am seeking l am seeking elsewhere."
good,"The job is slow and there are many days with nothing to do. The learning process can be lengthy but the manager is very easy to work with. I was trained for one area, added a second and then a third. I liked the amount of work and was busy. After reconfiguration in the business I was left with one job and not much to fill my days. No other work is available. Coworkers are nice. Building is run down and dirty. Close to areas to leave for lunch."
good,"The questions asked are unrelated to the work I do with Old Republic. Work is brokered out to Old Republic from another party and Old Republic in turn sends the work out to realtors in the area where the property is located. We as agent do a property evaluation providing Old Republic with an analysis of what we think the property will sell for should it be placed on the market.There are no set daily hours, however, the reports have to be submitted to Old Republic within a time span for them to forward back to their client. Agents serve as independent contractor for Old Republic, just as we do for the real estate broker who holds our real estate license. In essence we do Broker Price Opinions."
good,I worked at Reliable Life/Old Republic for 6 years. When my job became non existent I was given and option to stay on in another position or leave with severence. Due to my family life the job offered would not work so I took the severence. The Company has been good to work for and has strong moral values for an insurance company. Because the Company is small the chance for advancement are limited.
good,The company as a whole is great. There is an onsite fitness center just depends on the department you are in. Some departments get treated differently than others.
good,needs to update systems. nothing more to say. location is convenient and people are nice to work with. not much room for learning other areas but hands on learning and questions encouraged.
good,"a typical day involves punching in, setting up to speak with homeowners\contractors. speaking with people in a variety of states throughout USA, it is a team atmosphere, "
good,"The location is perfect right by State and Lake CTA stop and one block south of the river. The benefits are under average even according to HR. The starting pay rate isn't that great but the raises are even worse. At most it's at 2% which shouldn't always be ""the rule"" if associates deserve more."
good,Working at Old Republic Home Warranty was a great work experience.  I learned a lot and got to know a lot of great people.  I have become a more confident and capable individual with a sharper skill set to offer my future employer.
good,A fortune 500 company with many different subsidiaries and a wide variety of people to work with and learn from.  It has been a great learning experience
good,Provided me with opportunities to gain insight into multiple state workers' compensation programs.  I enjoyed working with my staff so the most difficult part was when we received notice that the office would be closing.
good,Small company and employees rarely leave making it difficult to move up in the organization.
good,I learned a lot while at Old Republic. I was able to perform to the top 10 level and later manage a Region. The home warranty business is extremely stressful. The company is very conservative which in many ways serves them well but they also hinder the salesman to compete in some instances.
good,A good workplace that understands the work and home life dynamic. The politics can sometimes outweigh Employee need but it provides some career growth for individuals that put in longterm effort and time.
good,a typical work day consist of taking daily report rom techs and listening to issues from plan holders. authorizing payment for tech to perform work.  supervisors are knowledgeable. the hardest part of the job is communicating with plan holders the non covered items that may need to be repair. the co workers are friendly and helps make to working environment within he office fun and go by smoothly.

good,"The corporate recruiter contacted me to see if I was interested in going to work for the company. I was happy with the company I was working for, so I politely declined. A week later the company's corporate recruiter called me again, offered me more and boasted how great the division they wanted me to work for was. I agreed to a formal interview in their regional office. A couple weeks later the interview went well. The HR department took several days to compose the necessary paperwork for the offer. An offer letter was eventually sent to me. A few days had passed, and I had not signed the offer letter. Divisional managers were calling me at night to welcome me to the company and they told me that I was going to love working here. I signed the offer letter 2 days later and sent it to the HR department. "
good,Great company to work for. Really train you for your position for success.
good,"Typical day consist of reviewing and ordering title reports in the morning and curing title issues for the rest of the day. Answer emails from clients and co-workers and updating reports for management and clients. I've learned some new systems, data trace, data tree, pacer, equator, outlook and resent. Management is strict, but fair. Co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is clearing difficult title issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is clearing that difficult title issue which results in the property being clear of issues and is ready to sell."

good,Great company to work for if you are looking for an entry level position. Management is nice and there are great opportunities to grow if you put the effort in.
good,"It was stressful 1working here. Long hours, short breaks, high pased enviroment, the sence of rushing every second and the treat of being fired every day. This call center was focused on short phone calls or you get a warning, 3-5 minute bathroom breaks, if you were late a second, warning. never again!"
good,even tho is was a 2 day project for computer refresh. It was still great. People were very nice and they were respectful.
good,"Decent place to work, some departments are better than other. for the most part Upper management is decent. I loved my boss and fellow coworkers. Pay is decent , could be better."
good,"Fellow co-workers are nice to work with.  I had no issues with upper management, but I heard a lot of people do.  It was a good place to work, but no possible way of being promoted.  So I had to move on."
good,Its a great fast paced environment to work in. You'll never be bored. I loved it there. It kept me very busy. The people and management are all great people to work with.
good,"I was in procurement at Old Republic and it was by far the most stressful job I have ever had. I should have an assistant just so I can focus on my ""normal"" work load."

good,"Very negative work environment varies between department s"

good,The culture of the company is certainly changing for the better. Management as a whole is actively listening and working toward improving morale.

Most of the service tech where very good with explaining the problem to get the customer up and working again or replaced the item.

It was tedious and hectic, at times I wanted to pull my hair out - claimants can have that affect on you, but at the end of the day the work was done and the next day, you start all over again.  This was a job that when I got up every day, I WANTED to go to work.  I loved working with the claimants and each individual case.  Everyday there was something different.  I was extremely sad when we got notice that they were going to close our location down.  I miss this job very much and I wish they would re-open an office here in Lexington again."
