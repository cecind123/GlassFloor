bad,"You will eventually be terminated with no reason why.. They don't give second chances and expect you to read their minds with what they want.  Stay away, you will be much better off elsewhere."
bad,"Worst company i have ever worked for. Middle management bully and try to make stafff do illegal things such as serve alcohol off site to try ""boosting sales"" micro managed and have little regard for family life. If you like constant harrassment and never having another long weekend then this is the job for you. They promise bonus but it is paid out 6-9 months after the quarter ends."
bad,Constellation Brands is a terrible place to work.  They love to misuse people by keeping them as temps for over 25 years and refuse to hire them directly.
bad,"Working in a downtown location in Ottawa, it was demoralizing everyday to aid the alcoholism of the homeless population.  They would come in wasted with a tim hortons cup of change and management would insist you serve them so as to not lose a sale, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ILLEGAL!  This job gets around so many legalities because they think their store level staff are stupid.  The minute you bring up the labour board they threaten to take you off the schedule.  They manipulate and use coercion to get you to do job tasks that you arent comfortable doing."
bad,"Worst management ever! If management could do anything right, they always intentionally chose to do it wrong. If they liked you, you could do no wrong. If they didn’t like you you were blamed for everything. If you addressed issues it put a huge target on your back and even other department went after you. Cut throat and very negative culture."
bad,"The company is so badly managed. It's to bad because they have a great product and great sales people, but the management and middle management is ruining the company. Pay is awful for the liability, they like to push the law and this puts their staff at risk.They bully, and the worst management rise to the top and the competent get fired or quit. Great customers, nice stores, its too bad the company is run so badly."
bad,"Horrible management, no transparency, total lack of company direction. Constant restructuring creates lack of consistency and momentum. No interdepartmental collaboration, no communication. The company is so busy with acquisitions and new product development that they don't focus on the brands they have. Management ignores concerns and complaints.  Rather than hire new talent for upper management, company constantly rotates upper management into new roles, whether qualified or not (usually not)."
bad,"Management is terrible. If there's an issue the manager doesn't address it with the person, instead she talks about those people behind their back to other merchants and customers. Instead of trying to talk to that merchant about what is being done wrong, she reduces your hours and makes you feel uncomfortable in the store until you are forced to quit. A lot of the times you are alone in the store and you cannot go to the washroom. Most company policies aren't followed, such as two merchants are supposed to be in the store during load, which is when we receive our order of wine for that week, due to safety reasons. There is never more than one person in the store during that time. There is no wine allowance. All we get is wine issues which are chosen by the company and we have to fill out a homework sheet on it and if the manager doesn't like you, she will take your issue home without telling you. The wage is not competitive, it's only .25 cents over the minimum wage which doesn't really make a difference. Its an extremely boring job and the company is terrible. You have to work a minimum 5.5 hour shift to get a break. Anything under that you don't get anything. All this company does is take advantage of you. They also don't tax you properly and when you ask for additional tax to be taken off, you get ignored and end up paying a lot of money when you have to do your taxes for that year."
bad,"Adecco got me in as a temp but screwed up my time by not calling me to let me know I had work, I tried to explain to Constellation brands and they refused to listen, I never missed a day until Adecco forgot to tell me."
bad,Company changed executive leadership 3 years ago.  They lack experience to take the Company through a major change in business direction.  No thought or respect is given to employees.  It is all about bottom line revenue.  Executive leadership continues to make poor decisions.
bad,"I was temping in R J Spagnols, Kitchener for 10 days to cover for a sick worker. I must say that fellow employees are a better than the usual crowd you expect meeting in factory settings. Working hours from 7 AM till 5:30 PM (10 hour days). They don't have a clock in machine, rather, if you're not at your work station at 7 AM sharp, they cut 15 minutes pay from your pay!!! The wine making kits line has to operate from 7 till 5.30 with no stoppage. A perm comes and takes over from you for the 2 breaks and 1 lunch break. You keep working most of the times beyond 5.30 PM. If you have other arrangements like what happened to me once, the production manager didn't like it at all. Next day, I was 10 mins late for the morning shift because of an early morning accident on the 401 and I commute from Guelph. The same day, a worker asked me to stay beyond 5.30 PM to finish the batch. I accepted, I inquired about payment, he informed me that they round up the overtime minutes if less that 15, to 15 mins. Next day, the manager himself asked me to stay beyond 5.30, for which I accepted and stayed for 30 mins. "
bad,"I enjoyed working with my co workers a great deal, benefits were better then any job I have had to date in a non-union job. The working culture created by management was sub par."
bad,"During the holidays if your temp be prepared to get laid off during Thanksgiving and Christmas and new years. They let u know that day not to come in for a couple of weeks. If you have any felonys, you will not get hired on fulltime. For some reason they dont tell you that in the first place. Kinda wasting your time"
bad,"Great place to work, very happy with my time at the company,I recommend working with constellation brands you will love them, amazing company, i was very happy"
bad,"I have no comment on my experience with Constellation.  It was not good, but it was a reflection on the local management and not the company as a whole."
bad,"Would never recommend working here if you over 55 years old.  For younger people it would be a good experience but, don't be surprised if one day your job is eliminated."
bad,Let me start by saying that this position i held for 5 years. It has the worst management team from the GM to supervisors in every department. In this field they are currently trying to go union. This is do to bad management and poor wages also favoritism at its finest.... I would really consider not wasting your time here. Also everything is out dated and that's due to bonuses givin to management on how much they save so there is little to no spending on equipment. Just a heads up to those applying for this position...... also this position is for rotating shifts so it's near impossible to go back to school or have a second job. Watch out for the supervisors in this department!
bad,"Worst manager I have ever experienced in my career!  Since this is a huge corporation, corporate management has no idea what goes on. Save yourself a huge headache and skip this place!"
bad,"It does not matter what they said the wine and spirit division is implementing lay off’s, upper management taking poor decisions on high investments that are not working and now they are firing people, so that is causing low moral and many of the best employees are leaving to other companies."
bad,Poorly managed production team.Never know what product is running until last minute.Head winemaker has no clue how to run a commercial winery(very large volume).Production manager is very heavy handed and is a spiteful individual.Company does not follow Collective agreement and this causes a lot of friction on the shop floor.Workers feel they get no respect from Management.Management running place into the ground.We are supposed to be the largest Winery in Canada but are run like a Mickey Mouse operation.
bad,"The benefits and culture that the corporate office pushes are both positive and forward thinking; free lunches, office parties, maternity/paternity leave, flexible works hours, and a solid work/life balance. It's a fun industry and there are a lot of perks about working in the Chicago office; nice location, fitness center, open bar, etc. The bonus plan is promising, but it got harder and harder to receive a sizeable amount of the plan."
bad,It’s a really cool job you do something different each time. The only bad thing from this company is management doesn’t care about employees I’ve been there 5 years and I have not gotten a promotion and I can run all the machines and they still can’t figure a way to pay employees for what they know is always there excuse.
good,"This was a great place to work at a couple of years back, but lately there have been many drastic changes, mostly management, and there is no sense of job security here anymore."
good,"No work life balance, instore managers receive no help or support from upper managers. Paper work is repetitive and not really related to stores specifically."
good,"Transition phase, very different from day to day. Everyone is flexing to cover the gaps in roles until they are fulfilled. Amazing work force that deals with constant change and transitions in management."
good,Company is constantly changing - needs to find a common direction and go.  Too many brands to successfully build each one.  With recent investments company needs to find its way.
good,"too much middle management, lacks effective department structure, a lot of micro management. A large HR population that is lacking employee payroll knowledge.  Do not offer promotion within ... more concerned with hiring outside."
good,"The  management was very unprofessional and disorganized, as far as it came to training the staff management had no idea what they were doing. I was lied to in the beginning about what my job actually was and how to do it."
good,"Benefits are great, but that does not make up for the fact that the company has double standards, unclear goals, horrible training. They keep employees that are incompitant for years and years only because they can sell wine clubs. It was fun to work at a historic winery, however guests were frequently disappointed that it was owed by a huge corporation."
good,"All that matters is that you reach their targets which are generally 15% more than LY. If you don't, your a terrible employee. One shop went through 3 managers in one year because neither could meet the high targets. Why? Because and LCBO opened up next door. Had nothing to do with managers performance. Can't compete with a big-box liquor store."
good,The things I enjoy most about work are the times I can learn new things. There are a lot of knowledgeable people in the workplace and safety is there number one priority.
good,"In order to thrive you need to be able to handle a continually changing environment. if you thrive on a fast pace, can be self driven and have an aptitude for evolving quickly, its a good fit."
good,"-Drama with co-workers"
good,They do not invest in training and help with your advancement. You are on your own. They talk about opportunities for advancement but they are just empty words. The business has been making some horrible decision the past 2 years and its only getting worse.
good,"People on the floor level have to work hard, long hours. A lot of people were laid off leading to shortage in employees needed. Management doest seem to care that one operator is doing the job of two people. You are also expected to work Saturdays now. Sometimes 10 hr or 12 hr shifts are scheduled with little to no advance notice."
good,"Company offers good pay and benefits, however, it is very demanding of it's employees. Each department has such stringent objectives to meet, that it often adversely effects other departments, which can cause friction and hostility between employees. An employee will not make very many friends there. It is a very stressfull and fast paced environment."
good,"Good people, but company culture is changing.  Moving away from sales and marketing toward analysis.  Used to be much better when management was collaborative."
good,"Great place to work.  Clear vision, focused on results and growing the business.  Collaborative and free thinking culture; challenge the status quo."
good,Worse manager i have ever worked for in 20+ years of professional life. This place could be a great company but owners/top mgt not in touch with average joe. Many have been there 15-20 yrs plus and feel too much ownership and power resulting in little respect for the workers. Recent cuts are starting to cleanse the place. Hiring tactics not very professional as many are brought in and then layedoff within months. Such a waste
good,Most of the coworkers I had there were pretty miserable. You definitely feel like a number and less like an employee. But the wage was decent and the work wasn't very hard. Just keep moving and Jeep working and management will like you.
good,"Good Benefits, Bad Work/Life Balance. You are reimbursed for a certain dollars amount of product per year based on your job title. There is a bar in the Chicago office, which serves snacks in the afternoon which is great when you are working late."
good,Overall good place to work. Management is demanding. High pressure sales and strict mandatory work schedule. Team building and training available. Opportunity to hire your own staff.
good,"Company has great work life balance, they pay well and the people for the most part are hard working and friendly. "
good,"I owe a great deal to Canandaigua Wine Company (now called Constellation Brands).  This Company gave me the chance to learn the wine industry covering multiple states with plenty of distributor responsibility.  As they acquired companies such as Sebastiani, Robert Mondavi, Vincor, Beam Wine Estates, I became educated on Premium, Super Premium, Luxury, and Ultra level wines because these were the wine categories I inherited and took over selling."
good,worked at constellation for 6 weeks great place to work but the job assignment ended .teamwork safety all number one felt secure working there.training went well
good,Great while they were growing in the alcohol beverage industry. Once they shifted gears into the cannabis industry managing brands within this publicly traded company became extremely challenging.
good,"The company is committed to very high quality of products. The team was in two different locations so at times it was difficult to ""bond"" with your team members."
good,Es una empresa buenísima. Pagan muy bien y el ambiente de trabajo es bueno son muy estrictos pero por nuestro bien la seguridad es lo primordial.
good,Joined Constellation to make a difference in the wine industry however they are focused on cannabis and beer. 90% of the leadership has experience with the beer industry and are given flexibility to move into the top tier positions that have nothing to do with beer.
good,Company has a lot of opportunity and different sites across the world. If you are motivated and a hard worker the sky is the limit at this company.  They tre
good,"Excellent training and tools to perform your tasks better than the competition. Lots of opportunities if you are able to relocate and rewarding brands to sell with exceptional marketing.  Goals are beyond lofty making long hours and weekends not worth the incentive payout. New products are usually steps behind the competition and released when they aren’t quite ready. "
good,"Nice work environment."
good,The company is a very good company however there is an enormous amount of micromanagement occurring.  There is quite a bit of turnover in the department.
good,"Buen salario y prestaciones por parte de la empresa, muy mal ambiente laboral"
good,"bygga och driva all kommersiellt relaterat till Norden, Baltikum och Centraleuropa"
good,"Friendly, easy to network, encouraging, hard-working environment, terrible HR - poor feedback, have to be proactive to receive feedback/interview outcomes"
good,"Great to use this company as a stepping stone in your career but do not expect loyalty to it's employees. Ask anyone who has time there about ""march madness""."
good,I enjoy working at Constellation Brands. It is a positive and safe workplace.
good,"Everyday is always different it keeps you thinking. We will have different company's coming into Inniskillin and Jackson Triggs that are all looking for different experiences within the food and wine industry and that's what we strive to give."
good,"I like the type of work I did at this Winery I was in the red cellars pumpover. Was doing cem adds. Also every single person here was friendly "
good,Nice place to work but hard to advance!  Management is not always picked from what they knew but who you know.  It was a small company but has grown large and is starting to be more competitive.
good,The best part of the job is working independently and also lending a hand to your team mates when they need help.  The hardest part of is challenging your self to do better.
good,"- I would open the store and count my cash"
good,Constellation seems to always go above and beyond when it comes to it's support of the communities where they have offices.
good,"I loved what I did for Constellation.  I was challenged and my days were full. I got to learn a lot about various aspects of the business over my 10 years with them.  One of the things that really bothered me was that even though I did a great job (and had the reviews to prove it), I was constantly passed over for promotion.  Also, after 10 years, I went through 12 acquisitions or restructures. While as an individual I learned to thrive with change, the amount of constant change left things very unstable."
good,"A nice place to work. "
good,"A typical work day was good"
good,"A typical day at Constellations:"
good,"Good place to work and had been in years past, however the company seems to be in constant upheaval at the moment and employees are being moved around and moved out pretty frequently."
good,"Watched this company grow, from a manger perspective the life work balance was very difficult however, a rewarding job.  Love working with the public and this job provided such opportunities daily."
good,"It was a great place to work for a student, lots of different skills needed and used to work in this environment.  Lots of new things to learn, great job for a ""people person"""
good,Leading a group of people towards a comon goal. Day to day production of Wine and carbonated beverages.
good,"cool office, great people, and nice work perks such as an alcohol allowance and bar in the office. not much room for advancement. can be clicky. focus is shifting from wine to beer."
good,"Passionate people, fun industry to work within. Very large stable of brands offers some very unique and interesting challenges, but also keeps things fresh and varied. Lots of talented people work there and it shows in the quality of execution. My role requires wearing many hats which to me is a huge bonus but might not be to others."
good,Busy all day long - time flew by.
good,many varied jobs over 37 years
good,"This was a great place to work at a couple of years back, but lately there have been many drastic changes, mostly management, and there is no sense of job security here anymore."
good,This was a collaborative and fun company to work for.  The collaboration among various teams and the admins was remarkable.  You worked hard but they supported a great work/life balance.
good,Really a family run business that has very professional staff.  Some of the best marketing people I have work with.   Enjoyed working with communications and it is interesting to see the differences in the culture from the N.Y. office versus the west coast.
good,Constellation provides both scope for advancement as well as diversity within the role for almost all positions in the company. There are a lot of courses to avail of and particularly for anybody interested in wine.
good,"Fun workplace.  Work with people who love the whole wine experience.  Although we work as individuals as we input data, we do share our tasting experiences which helps us to focus on our tasting abilities."
good,Middle managment was typically overwhelmed with employee issues and computer management programs that left no time to actually manage the work force. We spent so much time on line doing HR type functions that most managers were very frustrated.
good,Good place to work nice people but bad management  they don’t know what they want poor communication one or two know how to treat people right the others just mess everything
good,"Good place to work however constant restructures and evolving strategies make for stressful atmosphere.  Lots of nice benefits including health and financial coaching, flexible working hours, and insurance offerings."
good,"Constellation offered a number of benefits from healthcare to 401K and vacation.  They offer overtime, but on a volunteer basis, which is great if you have an event scheduled for the weekend.  They also do a yearly bonus, which most companies are doing away with."
good,"Lots of meeting (6 to 8 per day), which took away from addressing the daily concerns and operations. Learned the wine business and processes for testing, assuring quality procedures were followed, and overall production of wine. Great culture with engaged employees. Limited staff made it difficult to complete some of the daily work requirements. Enjoyed working with other departments Director's and their management staff."
good,"Great Company, Great Brands, Very fast paced. Loved working with the people there and the projects that i was placed on. Hard to get promoted and takes a long time."
good,Since the takeover by Constellation it has put allot of progressive programming into the work environment. In my territory travel was very extensive.I worked with a great team that was very supportive to each other.
good,"Started up machinery, loaded box makers, fillers, tray maker, glass; made sure all labels, boxes, glass, wine and print were correct according to purchase order."
good,"A typical day at work includes constant interaction with Sales, Marketing, Finance and Legal. The environment is dynamic and fast paced but the excitement and passion of your coworkers motivates you to drive for success."
good,"Good people, good culture. I learned a lot. This was my first corporate job so I don't have anything to compare it to, but the company has fun product and everyone keeps that in perspective."
good,"Good company"
good,"Excellent company Worlds largest wine company, great pay and benefits. Culture is interesting as they do promote people but they also let people go every fiscal year end. "
good,The company has recently changed time recording systems (from Kronos to Workday Time) and that has been a huge transition but will definitely be a positive change once the system is learned by all using it.  The company itself is great to work for.  They are involved in numerous community activities and provide time for employees to give back and volunteer as well.
good,Quality Director is quite possibly the worst leader I have worked for.  Other than that the company is good to work for.  Just hope you report to the right person.  Some new management couldn't manage a McDonald's drive thru.
good,"Le domaine du vin est très compétitif.  On évolue constamment dans notre facon de faire les chose, de vendre et de présenter nos produits."
good,"Great compensation"
good,"The plant runs 24/7.  I worked 4pm-12am as an R/B which is the Cellars entry level position.  Tasks are loading/receiving bulk wine/concentrate.  Blending and treating wines.  Hardest part of work is the weather cold/hot, maneuvering pumps in between tanks and carrying 2-3 in.x 25' hoses.  I enjoy learning the fermentation process and the different types of wines made at our facility."
good,"Great place to work in the Wine category."
good,Constellation offers a great opportunity to work with a diverse workforce with immense pride of our products and services.
good,"Constellaton brands is a great company for the workers the bosses are so comprensive people and te teamwork is great too, Constellation Brands is a big company and good for the work"
good,"Wonderful opportunity to build upon my skill set, and learned a wide range of new skills through the many and varied experiences in this hospitality & retail environment.  Enjoyed my 7 years there!"
good,"Work environment is great, management does not always have clear direction or alignment. Poor communication between sales and marketing and supply chain created issues and questions."
good,"I so enjoyed my days that sometimes it didn't feel like working. Always a lot going on, high volume of work always flowing that the days would fly by"
good,Managed the day to day operations of warehouse and distribution activities of staff.
good,A typical day consisted of doing line checks for the lines that were bottling wine and/or sparkling wine and make sure that the commodities were correct. Hourly pick ups for the lines making sure to get a sample for micro plating and samples to check the CO2 and/or O2 in the wine. In between that I had to plate/filter all the micro samples that were brought in as well as other duties that were put on the schedule.I learned a lot about the process of how wine is made and it's journey to the shelf. The hardest part would have to be the hours and everything that is/was expected but the people I worked with helped the days go by faster.
good,el ambiente de trabajo es muy estresante ya que es muy grande
good,"great place to work, and learn new things everyday. Workplace place culture needs work, and the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting with key decision makers for a business review."
good,"good work place, good pay, good management it has its ups and downs you have the opportunity to work an learn new things almost everyday. a very interesting enviorment if you are interested in wine"
good,Siendo una de las cervezerias mas grandes del mundo es una muy buena opcion para prender y desarrollarte profesionalmente en el hambito laboral...
good,Great company to learn fortune 500 brands and implement in depth sales strategies. Great teamwork and management preperation with distributors and retail funtions.
good,The company is a great place to work for with great work-life balance. There are a lot of employee perks and its a great location for a family. The pace of the work is slow. The people are nice and professional and easily approachable. Most have stayed with the company for many years. I wish there was more collaboration among the employees/ divisions but that could be because of my inclination to collaboration. The Friday happy hours are great way to network and socialize.
good,"Lots of opportunity in a very large company"
good,Constellation provides excellent pay and benefits. They are fast-paced and challenging. The only real drawback is that they are cutthroat in their industry. They seem to have an interest only in the bottom line and anything that must suffer to benefit that surely does.
good,"Constellation Brands is a great place to work! A typical day includes managing multiple projects across many zones around the United States. Managing coupons, point of sale, displays, racks, and much more from execution with graphic designers to completed with distribution vendor shipping. I have learned so much, from the many wine, beer, and spirits brands to organization, project management, legality, branding, tracking, shipping, creative design and much more. It is a very nice and open environment, where everyone is willing to help and collaborate.  It is a very enjoyable environment and always fun to learn something new about the wide range of brands."
good,"This corporation has a very steady and strong presence little risk involved. Good compensation."
good,"Never a dull moment in busy consumer relations department.  Good communication with management.  Team-oriented work culture.  Focus on consumer satisfaction.  Hardest part of job was handling fast growth of the business.  Loved working with dedicated, loyal, and talented teammates, staff and in serving our consumers."
good,"This was a good job with good benefits. It was days only no weekends and no overtime. Production jobs on assembly lines is extremely mind numbing to me. Good people, clean and climate controlled environment."
good,Amazing work culture with good work life balance. Everyone helps you grow and I have gained massive experience in my field.
good,"Complex and large scale winery operation, great people at the Madera site (Mission Bell Winery)"
good,I worked for one of the wineries owned by Constellation Brands in California. It was a temporary internship position that paid well and gave good experience in project management while I was finishing up my Mechanical Engineering degree. Sometimes a little slow but it would pick up other times where you felt very busy. Just depended on if multiple projects were picking up at once or not.
good,Working with Constellation Brands as a fresher is an amazing experience. Its the cool and the safest place to work. I have learnt many things during my tenure.
good,"Stable work environment.  AP is ever-changing as they acquire more businesses.  Moving into beer and liquor sales, not just wine, makes AP a growing department."
good,"tienen buenas remuneraciones, así como buenas prestaciones."
good,"Focused company. one that is moving forward to the future in the wine, beer and spirits industry.  Is a great place to work"
good,"Great management"
good,"une bonne compagnie"
good,"I certainly can't say anything bad about Constellation Brands, Inc. It was a great company to work for. I was brought in as a contractor and was hired on as an employee in just over 9 months. Working with Management and co-workers were absolutely wonderful to work with. I actually looked forward to going to work with this company. So many compassionate people to work with. It was not your average Corporate atmosphere. Again, the most enjoyable part about working there was working with the end-users and resolving their issues. You couldn't ask for a better feeling of appreciation. I was able to move up in this company and they really do care about you. You definitely are not just another number in a corporation."
good,--> Easy going team.
good,"One of the best beverage companies to work for, there is quality product, and a desire to be the best selling organization."
good,"Overall, its a great company to work. As the company get bigger it lack the people aspect and training manager to treat people with respect. They can get smart people to work but their managers lack in people skills. Something to work on Constellation!"
good,"Constellation is a Great Company to work with. There are many benefits to working with a great company. I was able to learn great skills, Both analytical and management of distributors. "
good,"During my initial interview I was told that employees work hard and play hard at Constellation, and that is accurate.  The company has seen tremendous growth over the years and they do push their executives and employees to produce."
good,hard work and stressfull because of the glass. good people to work for. very friendly and would often do things for there employees.a company the continues to grow..
good,Una excelente empresa con oportunidades de desarrollo y crecimiento
good,Outstanding company which was well managed and where I was extremely happy. The customers seemed to enjoy the interaction and returned regularly for more purchases. Are products were often available and management was supportive and encouraging.

good,En constellation brands aprendi lo que es el trabajo en equipo y verdaderamente ponerte la camiseta independientemente de los problemas sociales.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Constellation.  The workload was fair and the day to day demands were to be expected.  Very great culture - you felt safe to share without reprisal.
good,"Constellation is a great company to work with. However, they offer lots of opportunities. they have great personal. They give you hands on training. you must have a student mentality."
good,"Fun and Laid back workplace with good management and a good culture. This place had multiple projects going in all departments so there is always something productive to be doing and all projects have some new aspects, always providing a fun, new experience."
good,Constellation Brands is a very strong company and one with a promising future
good,I love my job here at Constellation Brands. I am given opportunities to provide process improvements. I actively work with Management and Finance on aligning budget year-to-year. I have significant input on cost savings opportunities. I have the benefit of working with Sr. Network Engineers and Suppliers to keep with Emerging Telecommunications technologies.I am responsible for auditing and processing over 160 Telecommunications invoices monthly. Everyday is a new day here and I enjoy learning new things.

good,working in the department i did i was given a lot of opportunities and learned tons. my specific location however lacked the upward mobility i desired. although annual increases were given there was not real possibility of a promotion due to the lack of positions available.
good,Provided great experience; recommend for more seasoned consultants and project managers as you work  independently and lead various projects for the client.
good,"Best company I ever worked for, friendly people lots of challenges, lots of opportunities for growth, good benefits and programs to enhance employee experienc."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The employees and staff were so helpful and respectful to each other and made me feel welcomed. I learned to do my job quickly safely and the importance of working together as a team to help each other. We made sure that we were always aware of the strength and weakness of each other and to give a hand whenever needed. The hardest part of the job was leaving.
