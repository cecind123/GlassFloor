good,"I believe that Macy need to pay their employees more for entry level work such as pricing coordinators, office coordinators, office coordinators and sale managers"
good,very nice place to work but it can get a little bit much because some of the customers tend to be very rude when certain deals are on and they cant use their coupons how they thought they could. but other than that I had a good experience. everyone was nice and they provided good hours even able to pick up hours whenever you want
good,"I worked at Macy's for about 2 years in different departments, so I was able to understand and learn certain things with each department. Working there was fun, and I met some great people, but some of the management there was not the best. They would demean you or just lie to get you to do something and take advantage of a young person's naivety. But some managers were amazing. Very kind and helpful without demeaning you, I'll miss those managers the most. I think the hardest part of the job is trying to deal with coworker competition or an unruly customer, but overall I had a good experience at Macy's."

good,"Learn to undergo and maneuver in fast pace and competitive environment while obtaining great work attitude, and reaching daily quota's! Very great company to work for if you need training in character building."
good,If I had to say one thing about Macys it is the fact that while you are there you feel the fact it is an old company. It's a classic american department store trying to shape itself into a technology company. While that means you have good worklife balance and a generally relaxed atmosphere for the most part it also means you don't get the experience of a tech company.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,"My typical day was about meeting quotas that are designated by the differing departments.  As being a part of a team effort, I wanted to stay in that vein of ensuring that collectively, we all looked good overall.  The hardest part of the job would be the standing.

good,A day at Macy's was fast paced. and challenging When doing fulfillment. all merchandise had to be packed and mailed in time for the mail pick up. we had to work as a team to see that that was done in a timely manner. I also took care of Bop orders. These were orders that a customer would call over from home and request that the merchandise would be ready for pick up within an hour. We had to interact with other sales persons to make sure that the merchandises was ready for pick up.

good,"The people are great! Fun during the holidays. You work hard and are on your feet a lot but it can keep you in shape, I enjoy working with customers and recommending products and services that will benefit them."
good,"Although the pay is low, it is not unreasonable for the work required.  I find the job to be low stress, although there are always certain customers who are either very demanding or sometimes outright unreasonable, which increases the stress level.  Generally, the management are helpful, and good natured, and provide good guidance.  There is room for advancement in the retail field if you are interested in doing so.  The workplace culture is fairly relaxed, unless there is an important visit of high level executives planned, and then there is much more pressure to have everything clean, neat, orderly and in place, which can be challenging when there are a lot of customers to take care of at the same time.  Nevertheless, as long as you make an effort to see that the customer comes first, and still try to use any free time to keep the workplace in order, I have found management to be very understanding and helpful, in general."
good,"The environment and pace at Macy's as pretty pleasant.  Like any field, it has it's days.  Holidays are stressful, but they offer a lot of overtime and ot pay.  There are certain points during the month where the discount is really worth it.  The people are fun to work with, the only thing is the lack of hours outside of holiday season."

good,"it was a very nice job, very tring at times but you got paid well so how much more can you ask for and you got to go shopping........................................"
good,It's a great company to work for. If you worked in retail then it's the same all around. I would just have this job as a part time unless your position is commission based.
good,"A typical day during holidays seasons  when I need to handel customer at the same dealing with customer queries. I learned patience, multitasking and so on. Great workculture and management  very  helpful collegues."
good,Executive management wants us to figure everything out. I guess that means they trust us?  I love my team in jewelry. I am a clerical associate so I organize our sales paper work and receive orders... etc...
good,"The customers were of a wide range and working with so many different people helps growth and experience. The staff eventually becomes like family, some coworkers you grow to love and some you tolerate."
good,"The only issue I had with this job was trying to get hours but other than that it's a nice job, the coworkers are friendly and with the position I had I didn't have to deal with any rude customers."

good,"Holiday pay and hours were horrible, I was barley given hours and I worked my butt off, They didn't give me any official notice of my last day, just took me off the schedule and sent notification of seasonal position ended weeks later"
good,"good place to work if your looking to get some customer service experience. Good co workers, good manager, fun place to work.. you get 20% discount which is not bad."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very creative job using my artistic abilities and creativity. I was visual merchandiser for all of women's ready to wear, women's accessories, men's collections and more. Mannequins, signage, display windows and seasonal decor was the main thrust of my job."
good,"When I join Macys, I learned how to be creative as a visual associate. Then I became MBA (Macys By Appointment) for a short time. After that, I became a sales associate."
good,the location i worked at was a good experience and taught you a lot in the retail business but the only concern was the scheduling and the management. but other than that i would probably work there again if i needed to.
good,"Loved customer interaction. Well kept, and heavily lit environment. Frequent bonuses for employee production. Mangers always checked on employees, and were always available to answer questions."
good,"I am an experienced hands on team leader with a history of managing multiple personnel and locations. Partnering and collaboration have always been my management style which has allowed me to execute renovations, new store openings, special events and store environments to a high level that delights the customer. As a resident of Sonoma County I haver always wanted to use by expertise in a local market. I have been fortunate to use my skills to also curate museum show and special events which is a real passion of mine."
good,The store was usually very busy especially at night time. Always tried and kept myself busy with different tasks. I learned how to work at a fast pace and always keeping calm. I also learned to work in different departments around the store including the stock room. Great management and friendly staff.
good,this is a hectic job at time. you have to be o your feet all day. 30 min break doesn't  seem like enough time gather your self. but if you love retail this is the job for you.
good,A well known brand with great benefits for employees with flexible working hours.  Great for full time and part time employment.  You can grow with the company.
good,"It was s fast paced environment .. very busy , but u have people to help you out  when your in need.. during the holiday time it gets really busy and packed . And the store will be a mess"

good,"competitive environment, but still a nice place to work. management was scarcely around."
good,"A typical day working at Macy's starts by having a meeting about the goals and achievements. I  to work alone with out any supervisor on my back. Manager differs from personalities,I personally liked my cosmetic manager who was transfered to another location. associates don't care about nationalities. there is not hard job at Macy's. It Is very enjoyable to help all kind of individuals , to connect with them and knowing that they will come back for you."
good,"The one thing I liked the most about Macy's was their flexible schedules. As a Seasonal Sales Associate you pick up shifts that meet your own schedule. Co-Workers and managers are friendly, customers can be very rude."
good,This job wasn't horrible I actually enjoyed it but I was in women's shoes which was stressful and demanding . If I worked in a different department I personally would of had a different experience working here but I recommend working here.
good,"I liked it at first,  actually I feel in love with selling Men shoes because I never did it before and once I broke it down to a science of selling shoes to men vs women I shot to the stars.  You would think its more lucrative to sell women shoes but its not.  I learned they return 5 out of 6 pair they purchased and men buy shoes for places they need to go to.  Management was great just as long as you made sure those shoe's flew off the racks.   The hardest part was to think outside the box on sale days.  People want everything for free.The customers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Helped in other departments. As need to get work out picked. Orders.   Putt items away. Also packed. Orders.  Helped were as needed to get work done. Work as groups.   And.  Bye our self's on single lines to seperate items.  Check items as some are returned. Back make sure that not worn. Messed up
good,Very enjoyable place to work and still have the life outside work consider this is a retail hours.  I would like more steady hours at least for AST position.

good,"great job,"
good,"Clinique has great products, built in clientele, good training, knowledgeable management and supportive work culture.  Compensation is not as high as other lines. The brand's volume and demographic mean that you must be able to multi-task, hustle and practice patience and understanding daily at counter.  It's VERY busy!  It's a great brand to work for."
good,"it was a cool place to work i liked the people the job , pace was good , just like any other call center but better cuz you dont have to sell many things unless your in sales."

good,Everone one is a joy to work around and or with management is always helping you and informing with all the tools you need to do your job there's always something going on for tomorrow have fun with your customers
good,"I liked the scope of my work there. People for the most part were nice. I had trouble ever understanding the org chart of the company. There were too many people that reported to other people besides the actual store manager. That led to many conflicting agendas and efforts. "
good,Everyday at Macy's was a productive day.  I started out a Macy's/Bloomingdale Specialist.  I opened and closed accounts for both companies.  The customers were great.  Always friendly and ready to spend money.  I did credit checks to determine level of credit limits.  Everyday was great and we got a discount and I loved that about my job even more!
good,Everyone is treated equally and there is no favoritism. Everyone is polite and works together to get the job done. Its a great atmosphere. The management is consistent.

When I started working there, everyone was very helpful with filling me in on things I struggled with or things I had forgotten from training since I was new and everyone else had years of experience there. Unfortunately, I was a seasonal sales associate so I only worked there for a month but the skills I learned there helped me in the next retail job I had."
good,Nothing unexpected about working here; great place to work. Jobs are simple and not monotonous enough to bore you to death. Hours leave something to be desired though.
good,"Macy's was a decent job that somewhat helped pay the bills."
good,"I liked working there but could not do 12 hrs a day on my feet. They would not put me in another position where it was less hours. And when I hurt my foot on the job they would not work with me to get it taken care of, so I was disappointed in them over that, which caused me to have to look for another job."
good,Good place to work for a part time job. Offers discounts for employees. There is always a way to switch schedules and pick up extra hours if needed. Overall a decent place to work.
good,Working in the women's shoe department is cutthroat. Everyone is after your sales because you make commission on each pair of shoes that you sell. You make decent pay though.
good,"A typical day at Macys would consist of you clocking in and finding one of your managers telling you your department for the day. Usually you are stuck in one department for the entire day unless they someone calls out sick or reinforcements are needed in a busy area. Starting out, you'll find it difficult to deal with the bombardments of questions from shoppers but as you move around, your knowledge will increase and it becomes easier to handle the customers. The hardest part is standing on your feet for 8 to 10 hours so where comfortable shoes. The most enjoyable part was the lunch break."
good,"I liked the flexibility of only working 3 days a week full time and being able to pick up hours when I needed them. It was hard to work 10-12 hour shifts, but the pay rate was nice enough."
good,I take great pride in my work. I am very detailed oriented on my productivity as a merchandiser and also as well signing on the floor. I am global as needed.
good,"I learned a lot working with macy's, we had so much training that have helped me to develop my carrear, I learned how to give a better customer service. Very good eviroment to work for."
good,Macy's you have to stand on your feet the whole time.  Sale persons who are on commission can be hard to work with.  You also have a sale quotes you have to meet.
good,I was a sales associate and I helped out the costumers pick out mice clothes for them and their loved ones it was a great experience to learn how to interact with people l:
good,As of right now I'm a sales associate. I've gain great  experience in customer service. There is alot to learn working at Macy's. If you truly invest yourself in learning.
good,I worked in the commission sales part of Macy's. Work with other sales associates. I learn customer service on a whole different level in a department store setting.

good,"Working there was fun. My management helped me when I was lost of confused about something. If they couldn't help, my co-workers were happy to. The customers were, for the most part, pleasant except for a few instances. It was fun to do all the sort of odd jobs that a retail associate has to do. Putting away coats was intolerable but... no it was just intolerable. The annoying thing was that the scheduling thing. Like, if you scheduled yourself for one day, they could just drop you and advertise your shift yet not tell you at all. Or give you shifts and not notify you. What's up with that?"
good,"I was only at Macys for a short period of time , but the hours were great and as a new employee they give you a revolving credit card. Great management."
good,"A typical work day is ringing up customers and fixing, cleaning around your area/department you're in that day."

good,great working environment...i enjoy working there as well as shopping there too. The benefits are good too. Every week you get paid on Friday. I learned a lot when i was working there how to deal with complaint from costumers. I also learned to be more responsible.
good,"We started at 6:00 a.m. and did most of the work before the store was open and typically went home around 10 or 11 a.m. "
good,I was working at Macy's as a season sales associate. I wasn't there long nor often enough to give a review but the time I did spend there was enjoyable. I worked in the Men's dress furnishing's department.
good,"It's been a long time, but overall a great experience. You kind of had to know this story wasn't going to end well and the days of department stores were numbered."
good,"Macy's was a great company to work for, because they have flexible hours because I was a part time student. It was a lot of room for growth within the company. They also have a great 401(k) plan and medical/dental insurance for part time employees."
good,"A day at Macy's is a great work adventure everyday I go. No day is ever the same and the challenges seem to get tougher, but those challenges never stopped me or discouraged me nor did my employers, always with their constructive criticism and positive feedback. My manager alone has taught me so much on approach, determination, the power of great customer service and how far it could truly help make or break a company. I was blown away at how diverse the environment  was, all walks of life, I did not feel out of place. I cannot say there was anything that was hard during my stay there, definitely had my fare share of challenges, but who doesn't love a challenge!!!  The most enjoyable part of my position was the personal relationships i was able to make with my customers, the bond of getting to know their likes and dislikes and watching them leave satisfied with my service was very gratifying."
good,"Always get a good support, well organised meeting. employee flexible work timings. some times it might be very busy work but you still get all support from your management."
good,"Typical day at work at work I will begin my daily duties by scanning the maintenance repair and overhaul receipts. After, completing this I take it to shipping in order to expedite the services. I learned organization, packing, and time managements. The workplace was a diverse. We was well knitted and team players. We work together and completed our mission in a adequately and timely manner. There wasn't a bad part of the job. I enjoyed working there and look forward to it daily. The enjoyable part was learning different things. Enhancing my ability on the internet and gaining more knowledge with the different department Macy's had to offer."
good,Learned a lot at working at Macys from customer service issues and growing my true potential as well.  Working in retail may seem hard but once your in a stable environment and working with a team that loves to succeed is what anyone would enjoy to work at.
good,Macys has it all. Customer service where you embrace the different cultures. Embrace the holiday seasonal feeling. Warm and friendly employees. people help each other out where needed.

good,"organized and sorted boxes"
good,"I enjoyed my seasonal time there. The workplace was heart-warming and I wish I could've stayed as a part-time or even a full-time employee. I only worked weekends and the pay was worth it. You work at your own pace, which I enjoyed the most because I was there over night so I needed something to occupy my time being there. I had no complaints while working there."
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's and dealing with the people there on a daily basis. I managed customer transactions with the register and developed my communication skills by helping them find what they needed.
good,"The scheduling was very flexible, which made it great for students and they had good management. The environment was friendly and everyone was very nice."
good,"When I was in receiving and recovery, had the opportunity of viewing all new items brought into the store.  All workers from all departments worked well together, all working in harmony.  The hours were great, I could establish my own working hours to suit my educational schedule."
good,Macy's is a good people oriented company that has a lot of departments to gain experience in and offers from. I challenged myself to learn more before graduating from College to use in the future.
good,I can start off saying that the hardest part of the job was dealing with slow computers. the best part was the pay. I learned to how to drive an order puller. Workplace Culture was not the best.
good,"Enjoyed working here while I was in college. High chance for money to be made, with little hours given up to work since I was commission. Would recommend to college students."
good,Very competitive job. A good job to start off with if you are young and in school or even after school. Company is a great company to work for. Retail just isn't for everyone

good,Working at the company is overall a good experience. It teaches you a lot of things about how the retail world is like. Everyone there helps each other out making sure that the customers come first.
good,"yes, you do get super fat working there 8+ hours a day, eating a bunch of food. if you don't like that, then it sucks. if you do, then ok. also, i don't like talking on the phone."
good,A good job is your looking for a job to work around school. The work environment was nice and the people that I worked with were very nice as well. I would recommend you apply.
good,everyday is a new task never a set day quick pace day peers make the day easier and more fun they give rewards and other special things when doing the best job
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfy the customer needs and making connection with every customer. there is a great culture balance we were a diversity team work together great and satisfy the client needs.
good,"Macy's was a very fast pace working environment. Friendly environment to be a part of. Learn new things everyday from the many of customers you associate with and interact with and of coarse  the people you work with and managers you work for. Macy's was very busy around Christmas, new year, thanks giving. The holiday is the craziest time of the year because that is when all the outstanding sales and events take place. Of coarse the holidays is not the only time sales are giving out. Macy's has promotional events and sales through out each day, each week & each month."
good,"good place and people. Discount is very nice, tough skills to learn. great people to work with. Now it time for me to find new skills and places, that i can love to work more then the place i am at."
good,"Although sometimes the stress of the customers can be overwhelming, everyone you work with is kind and understanding; the competition in sales is always a tad cut-throat but everyone had an oppurtunity to rise. Would reccomend it for self-starters."

good,"I was just an seasonal cashier from Nov to January and it was fun because that seems like more customers shop during the holiday season. The job was a little fixable but, it seem a little slow pace depending on your department section."
good,"I loved my time at Macy's!  Unfortunately, my department was outsourced to the Philipines.  I have been on a mission to find employment with another company with the same high standards and quality of Macy's."

good,"I worked at Macy's for about two year, the work was fairly easy to learn. I loved the work and enjoyed my coworkers. However the management made the job stressful. The attitude carried by a specific manager made several people leave, and made many of us feel stressed when we had to come in."
good,customer service. helped customers with any questions. had fun with other co workers. learned to be professional in an environment that was fun and exciting to be in helping customers find their needs.
good,"I enjoyed every day working for Macy's. As long as you have the drive and determination, you can be easily promoted. Depending on who your manager is can elevate you faster versus others. A lot of times there can be more ""chiefs than indians"" especially in the higher roles within the company and you could easily get conflicting answers or reports that can be frustrating. Note to future associates or managers, only downside with the company is if your store is closing, you could still be out of a job even though you put 100% of your time and effort into it."
good,"I am very happy to work with Macys.Friendly Managers,Flexible Schedules.Working with Macys is good.Working with Macys is good ."

good,"macy's is a great place to be if you like to get your work week done in four days.  the hours i work are from 0700 to 1730, which leaves friday to do what you couldn't do while working the first four days of the week."
good,"Usually the weekdays are the slowest times and the weekend are the busiest. When there are sales going on, it can be really crazy. I learned a lot working here, from ringing the register to how to have a good customer service skills. It was my first job which was nice to start with. The managers are nice but can get quite annoying because they're always on your head, mainly about the credit cards. My coworkers were awesome, I met amazing ones who I loved working with. I clicked with all of them and we were so close. What I didnt liked about working there is the constant cleaning and the rude customers. On the bright side, I liked working here for quite sometime and meeting new people."
good,"I learned how to be a salesperson at Macy's. I learned how to talk to a customer and tailor the shopping experience to them. A typical day at Macy's included clocking in, breaks every 3 hours, and being on the floor selling and front shelves for my shift. Management or a senior sales associate was always there to help me when I was unsure of what to do when I was still new, and if there was not somebody close by you could always easily get in touch with someone. The hardest part of the job was trying to push people to sign up for credit cards and plenti cards. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the pace and everyone was so nice and helpful."
good,"Everyone has their own experience when working at Macy's. These experiences are based on the departments you work in. Macy's has a good mission and great employees, however, the company or the stores themselves need to organize themselves to achieve their full potential as a department store. I have seen those who are in higher level positions unable to handle the basics of their jobs where lower level employees excel far greater than their superiors. while working here I learned that in order to excel you had to find the right person to show you the ropes whether they were upper or lower level employees."

good,"a typical work day is very interesting "
good,"Working at Macy's is a nice first job, I have been here for nearly two years and have learned a lot. A typical day at work would be looking at the schedule my manager created so know which department I would be in for this shift. After I would begin putting clothes on the selling floor back that the customers leave on the bar in the fitting room that they have tried on and don't want. When the bar is cleared, I go onto the selling floor to begin organizing and refolding the clothes that are on display. Also, I pick clothes up off the floor and rearrange bars filled with clothes on them. By doing this the selling floor will be clean so customers will shop without going through a mess of clothes. Throughout my day customers will ask for assistance, it would be to check them out, find a clothing item they are looking for or simply pointing them in a direction of another department. I have learned to be patient with customers and try to help them have the best shopping experience possible. Overall, I enjoy working at Macy's because it is training me to go into my field of work.

good,I was only seasonal there. As far as i was there it was a fun place to work. I had the schedules i wanted and meet some really nice people. I would work there again
good,Environment where you talk to people all of the time and develop relationships. Interaction between customers is necessary. Culture based a lot on adding people to client list which people don't want to do a lot of the time.
good,"I've been with Macys for 6 months and the first month we set up the entire store. Management is always very upbeat, personable and accommodating ! But be mindful that favoritism is bound to happen. This ""shop captain"" is rude and unprofessional. Customers and employees have made complaints multiple times and she has been spoken to multiple times. Don't see why she is still her."

I Coach my team members to the stats that need improvement. I have learned a lot working here by working in multiple departments which has made me very versatile to the company. Management in my immediate department is fair. The workplace culture is relaxed for the most part. The hardest part of the job it making sure you get everything resolved for your customers in a timely manner due to all of the departments not being local. The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to assist others with whatever they may need.
good,"It's the same workplace but every day is different, different people, different coworkers, different duties. Management is always around to help out and there are several managers to call if needed. The duties for each associate are manageable and keep you on your feet. I learned more customer service from this job since I started in June. If there is one thing I could take away from this job is that the customer is not always right and ALWAYS double check yourself so that you are giving the right information. Go that extra mile for the customer to make sure that they have experienced as much of the magic of Macy's as they can before they leave. The hardest part of this job is having those tough customers that come in with a sour attitude. The key is to keep calm and do all that you can to turn the from upside down. Do not take the attitude personally. The most rewarding part of this job is that you make great connections to the people around you; not only coworkers but the community in which you work. I work at the Federal Way Macy's and it is quite small but it is unbelievable how many connections I have had during my time working there."
good,This is a very team oriented Company. Fast paced multitask environment with focus on excellent customer service. Management staff very helpful with employees. great experience.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The associates are really friendly as well as the managers. They keep you busy by having you do multiple tasks. The break room has vending machines and a tv.
good,"A good job friendly people, it does get busy at time but we all work together to get the job done.A typical day at work entailed you cleaning around the store doing the resister, and making sure the fitting room is always clear."

The prices and sales were always affordable which made it easy for the store and employees to make the sale goals.

good,"A typical day at work is going in and getting orders online.  Then upload the orders into the RFID gun and then hit the floors looking for the items ordered.  If lucky the gun will beep near the UPC, if not we look for the item by style number and color. Once the all the items are found I then pack all the items and ship them.  If I have a day where I don't get many order, I then process any returns the company gets back.  It is an easy process where I enter it into the computer and return undamaged items to their departments.  "
good,"the employees were friendly and very responsible to work with "
good,I loved working with the team and customers. The breaks were an hour long and all the associates were friendly. the job itself was just fun all around but the pay was very low for the amount of work and quality of the work. I feel like we should have been paid alot more then just 9.55 an hour.

good,"Loved working for Macy's as far as working in retail. Wide range of customers and always new learning opportunities. Management was always very guiding and helpful, did frequent reviews and always gave you a chance to improve in your working abilities. Did not like work ethic of some co-workers as some were not always dependable in the department. Hardest part was maintaining the sales, seemed like it depended on the season and your department always depended on the advancement of your sales. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers personally pick out items for their needs. Frequently got to assist in being a personal shopper and feel i did very well in keeping the customers happy, and gaining new customers for the store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Sales Ringer in different register in the sales floor."

good,"I loved working at Macys. It's a fun environment to work at and the schedules are very flexible. If there's a shift you don't want you can advertise it and if you want extra shifts you can pick them up easily. They always need people to come in so you can work overtime all the time if you'd like. "
good,"CityPlace was an awesome area to work in the people are friendly. The work load can be too much sometimes, but a great expereince"

good,I enjoyed working at my local Macy's for the most part. The coworkers were the most amazing part of the job. Some difficult customers but most were VERY sweet. I did not agree with some of management but most of the managers were amazing and extremely helpful. Work day included a lot of fitting room clean up and go backs !
good,"A typical day at Macy's is clocking in, checking out customers, organizing, stocking, and returning merchandise, and shopping on breaks. At Macy's I've learned that not every friendly customer has the best interest of the store, same for employees. Management is very professional and understanding of all circumstances. Co-workers are very friendly and veterans are very helpful with things I may be new to. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a perfectly tidy and organized area as customers like to pick up items and put them down in any area. The most enjoyable part of the job is bonding with great customers and satisfying them in all aspects."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,Macy's is a really good place to work at especially if you want costumer service experience. Easy advancement opportunities.I got promoted 3 times in less than 2 years. Not the best pay though. So that's why people always leave. Poor communication with some managers.
good,Great people respectful and never mistreated anyone . great surroundings. Macys overall. Was a great job wouldnt mind working for them again.
good,"Great place to work, this company will help you grow, see your potential and gives you plenty of room for growth and a lot of interpersonal skill development."
good,Each day was great the rush from all the tourist was exciting leaving the work day to move at a fast pace.I enjoyed my time maces is a great company
good,"A typical day in HR at Macy's is interviewing, recruiting, coaching and training.  Spending time on the sales floor speaking with customers and associates.  Meetings with management team and administrative supervisor to review upcoming openings, upcoming interviews and staffing issues."
good,Overall; you meet different people every day from around the world that speek different languages. holidays are the most exciting and hardest time of the year due to the fact that everyone comes to shop and the store becomes so crowded it can become over whelming in a good and bad way; it makes you work more and build a greater connection. Co-workers are very helpful when new workers need help or advice.

Even the ones who came into the store mad, I guarantee you that they left with a smile on their faces."
good,"I love the management and overall work environment at Macys. I like creating happy customers and being a good role-model and teaching new sales associates.

good,You will be busy 95 % of the time but if you work on a Monday or Tuesday morning expect it to be slow. I was the only female working in Mens shoes and I learned everything. I really loved how the main manager was African American just like me and she is a female . It goes to show that we can do anything and we can advance. I got along with my coworkers but two of them were creepy. The hardest part of my job was when the computers would malfunction while we have a long line . I loved when people would give us free gifts or tickets to something.
good,"Operated various mechanized cleaning equipment, such as vacuums, polishers and buffers "
good,"a lady came to me and asked me to help her out, she was looking for gown dresses for a wedding. I showed her all of the dresses we had, she got the ones she liked and tried them on, while she was in the fitting room she told me she needed different sizes and maybe try other colors. while i would go get her dresses, i told my coworker that i was with a customer just in case if she needed my help. After the customer was done trying on the dresses, she took 3 of them to show to her husband, when she got out of the fitting room she told me how satisfied she was with the customer service i gave her. after she left with those 3 dresses, it made me feel satisfied knowing  i was able to help a customer out."

Enjoyed going to work,  forming new friendships everyday with customers. (Love retail because I love clothes) Flexible scheduling. Everything done online,  easy to access my information as an employee."

good,"same as Bloomingdale respond to customer calls  to resolve all credit card issues and billing issue ,ensuring customer needs were addressed processed financial adjustment"
good,Very productive and nice people to work with. I learned better communication skills. The hardest part of the job was to make sure everything was well organized all the time so that the costumers were pleased with what they saw. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see people satisfied with their experience shopping in the store.

good,"fun place to work"
good,"Goldman and Sachs was very helpful in the sense of guiding me and showing me certain ways and techniques their are in the real world concerning the buying and selling of stocks. In addition, it provided more information concerning the field of accountants and Business management. I appreciated every piece of detail and knowledge I learned at Goldman and Sachs Fast Track program because I am also interested in joining the field of being an Accountant one day so the information they explained to me was very helpful.

good,"Customer service skill"
good,"worked in a fast pace environment, with great coworkers."
good,"Great customers,"
good,its a nice place to work and the other employees are pretty welcoming. the training course shows you everything you need to know. The hardest part is selling the new card accounts but everything else is straight forward
good,"i typically worked 8 hours a day providing customers with all their retail needs, such as finding merchandise , completing account payments, and tailoring their shopping experience to fit their individual needs . The hardest part of the job was the long hours standing . The best part was the work environment . I enjoyed managing my own day and experiencing new people and situations on a daily basis."
good,Working as Macy's a typical work day would be coming in in the morning and unloading the trucks. I would also sensor the product as it came in. Sometimes your day could also consist of changing the signs and marking down merchandise.

good,"There was no such thing as a ""typical day"" at Macy's, which is exactly what I loved about it. I'm great with multitasking and very capable of shifting focuses when needed. I strengthened my ability to build strong partnerships when needing to get large projects or remedy employee issues, quickly. The management team was supportive with many of the initiatives that I rolled out to ensure various processes were fluid. The only downside to this position is that you are essentially fulfilling the role of three people as one, with a very minimal payroll budget to accomplish the equivalent workload. One of the many enjoyable things about this position were the relationships that were built. Never have I worked somewhere where you could pick up a phone and call anyone with a(n) issues and they'd try their best to help you find a solution, or they'd direct you to the person who could. This is a rarity in the workplace and was very much appreciated."
good,a typical day would be organize the new merchandise we get in the morning and sell to customers. i learned how to better talk to customers and fulfill their needs better. my co workers was easy going never had any problems with them. hardest thing about the job since it was based on commission was approaching customers that didnt wanna be help or with attitudes. the most enjoyable part is knowing you reached your goals and know one will bother you.
good,"If you're looking for holiday sales experience, this is the place to do it. You'll learn a lot about customer service, store operations, and merchandising. The store management is phenomenal! They go out of their way to make you feel that you're valued."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,I really enjoyed working in retail. It's my passion and I enjoyed the people whom I worked with and the customers that I came in contact with on a daily basis.
good,While working I learned how to have many different point of views and learned how to truly appy myself by going above and beyond. I was privliaged to work with management that was also like family. Thats how we were able to operate so smoothly and they were not afraid to show you your flaws but the thing I appreciate most is they critisism came with a solution.
good,"A typical day at work is talking to customers and placing their orders online for them. Every call is different and I learn to adapt to each and every call. My co-workers are social people and like to share their stories to anyone who would listen. The hardest part of the job is taking back to back phone calls the whole shift during the time from Thanksgiving to New Years."
good,I enjoyed customers who I was able to impact their life by being able to find something they were struggling to find on their own or didn't know they needed. I mostly got a long with my co-workers and managers. I will say the management was difficult at times to be on the same page or to let me know about new information about what was going on.
good,The schedule provided a work life balance.  I was promoted very quickly from my start date.  I really enjoyed the Merchandise Manager position.
good,"1. typical day at work, was busy"
good,"The staff was friendly and managers seemed eager to help out. Although I'm just starting there, the hiring process seemed like they were lacking in Organization. They were unsure as to what position I was working as for them and the scheduling isn't a normal 9-5 job. Every day differs and some days you may not even be able to work depending on who signed on and took the positions before you."

good,"Macy's is a fun place to work. The variety of customers on a daily basis keeps things interesting, as does the variety of workers. There is always something to do, so the workday seems to go by rather quickly. I think the biggest thing I learned was the difference between working in a small retail environment and a ""big-box"" store."
good,"Macys was a productive and fun work environment.  A typical day at work consisted of me arriving at work and greeting my colleagues with a warm smile and a positive attitude.  After I established this connection with my team, I proceeded to review my counters to see what merchandise needed to be replenished.  After I have succeeded in doing this, I reviewed my client book to see which one of my clients I needed to contact regarding the arrival of new merchandise, upcoming promotions,or just to say a simple hello when I have not seen them for a while."

good,I liked working a Macy's department store in St. Louis. I worked with associates that knew their department and products. I learned allot about fragrances for men and women.
good,I learned to manage people and how to multitask efficiently
good,"Macy's is a very high paced work environment, if you can't handle the heat you definitely need to stay out of this kitchen. Employees are required to balance greeting and interacting with customers, keeping the sales floor clean and clear, recovery, up selling star rewards, answering phones, search and sends and so much more. It really takes some talent to be a well rounded employee at this store."
good,macys was a great place to work but the hours weren't enough. I enjoyed my employees and gained excellent customer service skills

good,Excellent place to grow and build sales experience. I had the ability to build my own schedule and learned invaluable sales knowledge.
good,"Working at Macy's was a learning experience. I learned how to properly conduct a register and communicate with customers. I realized working with shoes is something that interest me. I didn't have to force myself to go to work because I enjoyed my position. Working morning shift was convenient for me at the time, being a college student. The hardest part of the job had to be when I worked on the sales side and it was only about two people assigned there or two who actually showed up, and we'd be stuck with so many customers. It was extremely hectic and overwhelming, at times I'll be having to go on break and a customer would ask for assistants. I had 4 managers and out of 4 of them I like 1. He was always around and so helpful. The other guy would only come around when the store manager would be present or an event was happening, and didn't even bother to get to know the new employees. The other 2 were women and 1 would pull me from job to do something and I always ended up being behind when she did that. The other one was pretty much around every now and then, she was cool and professional."
good,Working in a fast food environment can be stressful and chaotic if you don't have  a great spirit. Although you might view your fast food job as less than ideal it's the total opposite at White Castles it's very fast paced. You're always busy barley if any time to stand around you can still make the most of it by focusing on the positive aspects of the working service industry.
good,"In Macys, along with cashing out the customers, putting away merchandise, you have to provide assistance to customers with finding items. This job is most stressful because you work on commission. If your customer is taken away from you by another employee, they will get the commission for the sell you made."

good,"Typical day consisted of selective sales."
good,"Macy's is very fair and open to its associates. The company understands and meets the expectations of its employees. In general the typical day at Macy's is very driven and each employee has their goals and expectations. I learned through the job the best way to help and meet customers needs and wants, as well as the best way to handle and give product information. I work and communicate well with my associates, if we ever have a problem we try to work through it. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping track of all the people I have to interact with, especially on the weekends, it can get a bit overwhelming but once I get things organized and communicate to the customers I will help them any way I can it smooths out. Probably the best part is interacting with customers and helping them in any way I can."
good,"I worked in the the mens department(dress clothing) and a typical day involved selling, and working the cash register. Being a new worker the managers were always open to helping out. As busy as they were, they were always willing to help. Co-workers were very helpful as well and very nice. The hardest part of the job were the hours and learning to sell products to the costumers.

good,"I passed out perfume samples to customers as they walked by to see if they were interested in the product. If they were interested, I would show them the product and what each line had.

good,Management has allowed me to learn several different divisions of the retail world of Macy's.  I enjoyed learning something different and achiveing the goal set out for the day.
good,"A very free flowing and fast paced job..."
good,"This macys was how people should be treated, they cared about the store and you."
good,"I didn't work at Macy's for too long. I was there on-call. But I still loved it. I would work in any department available, but mostly in Womens, Juniors, Dresses or Accessories. My job was to make sure the department was clean and organized, while still ringing up customers.

The best thing about the job was the competitive edge between sales associates.
good,"helping customers with checkout at the register"
good,"Unload trucks, put out merchandise, pull merchandise.  "
good,"A typical day at Macy's is unlike any other day in a non retail setting. Instead of being surrounded by the walls of a cubical, I was engulfed in a sea of the seasons trendiest pieces by renown brands and designers! The best part about working with Macy's is the knowledge I acquired about the differences and similarities between various brands and designers and learning how to use those details to help customers choose their ideal piece. Assisting customers in finding  the perfect birthday outfit, or helping them decide which piece goes better with what is by far the most enjoyable part of the job for me. Nothing makes me happier than knowing that my client is not only happy but CONFIDENT in whatever s/he chose to wear. Unfortunately, working at Macy's or in retail in general is not all fun and shopping sprees. The lease enjoyable role of being a sales associate at Macy's is the maintaining of the fitting rooms. Often times the rooms are flooded with merchandise that you and your other sales associates are responsible for returning to the sales floor. Although the fitting rooms can be a job within itself, it is vital to keep them somewhat decent so that it is easier to prevent theft and damages to the items inside. Overall Macy's was highly enjoyable for me because I LOVE fashion and meeting new people."
good,The job requires alot of moving around and lifting/moving heavy objects which can be both good and bad.You also get to interact and assist customers directly. It's very satisfying to send them home with  everything they wanted and more.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day would be inventory, recovery, stocking racks, shelves, and changing sales/ prices."
good,"I come into work clean up the area I will be working in for the day along with helping any customers if needed. Making sure everything is put back, and where its suppose to be neatly i assist my customers in helping them find what they need and maybe even more.

It is important not only to know the product(s) but how to present the knowledge in a way that will inspire the customer to buy.

good,Working with Macy's was a good experience. The hours were great and the people worked hard to insure excellent customer service.

The management was pretty fair, lots of perks and very knowledgeable with good handling of employees. Co-workers was fun to be with and very open in helping and sharing ideas to come up with something that will benefit both the customers and associates in every situation.

The group of co-workers in my team are fantastic people, able to work together for the better of our department and our customers. Our customers come first always. From straightening racks and cleaning the fitting rooms, to offering suggestions and giving helpful advice to customers, it's a very time consuming job. The management is helpful 9 out of 10 times and usually is able to do what they can to assist in whatever I need assistance with. The hardest part of the job would probably be the issues we get with customers and coupons but it's not very difficult to avert the situation and turn it positive."
good,"On a typical day at work before the store opening we have meetings about business the day before. It shows how much money we made, the positive & negative feedback from customers & plus updates on what's going on in the store in terms of sales & upcoming events.

good,A typical day fro me starts early am and not rushed. I have learned time management and comunicate more with co-workers and the management. My co-workers are great to work with and lend a hand when someone needs help. The hardest part is getting done in the short amount of time given. The most enjoyable part is when management makes the Support Team breakfast.
good,"Typical day is, well, helping people out. Awesome, right? You learn a lot about all kinds of people and how to read body language. Management is cool, and of course professional and fair. Co-workers are great, fair, interesting people. Hardest part about the job is pretending that it's the highlight of your life, when in reality you're just fugging trying to do something with your life. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that after kissing ""as"" all day, you at least made normal, average people pretty happy. Which, who does not like making people smile, laugh, have a good time? I got a ton of loyal customers due to my unique style of helping people. Even had people told me they were having a terrible day and that I turned that around for them. Best. Feeling. Ever."

good,"It's great that you can go online and see your schedule, and the ability to pick up shifts in any department keeps things exciting and different. In that sense, you have more control over the hours that you work. The downside is that there are not always a lot of hours available and only full-time employees get steady and reasonable hours every week. The managers are knowledgeable and helpful, and the training process is extremely thorough and makes you confident when you are out on the selling floor. The pay is low, but it's a great job for a little extra cash every week."

I worked in the housewares department where i learned to hone my interpersonal communication and sales skills. Here I learned just how important presentation can be as it was used as tool to sell more items. If not for school at the time, I would have loved to work there longer and learn more about the company. "

good,"I only worked seasonal but my time was still enjoyable. There scheduleing system is fantastic and i loved working with the people I did. The only real reason i give some low scores is because of how the selling system works. You have a goal that is sometimes unattainable and still they expect you to make it. Sometimes there just aren't enough shoppers to make what they expect you too. I also had a bad experience with a manager but, from what I understand the way she acted was not by company policy so I can't say anything bad about the management."
good,"Macy's was a good environment to work for, I was a shoe expediter where I basically worked in back of the house and pulled shoes for the sales associates that the customers requested.

good,I did not enjoy working at Macy's. I was under paid and had loads of work to do and not enough time to complete the job as expected.
good,"a typical day would be opening, always busy, picking up clothes cleaning fitting rooms re-tagging items or assisting customers. I learned to always be polite and respectful and that customers always come first. Management is all about meeting and exceeding daily goals and opening up accounts, there are good ones that care and other ones who not so much. I enjoyed working with others my same age but I also enjoyed the older staff that had many years of experience; everybody always worked together on setting up breaks and shifts scheduling. The hardest part I would have to say would be dealing with rude disrespectful, demanding, and impatient customers,  on the other hand the most enjoyable part was actually being able to help people find what they were looking for or suggesting ideas to them that they really appreciated and making good relationships with costumers. Making other people feel good always makes me feel good."

Learned to hold my own, respect fellow coworkers, and to make sales based off customers needs, and not my own."
good,"The major downer is the push to sell the Macy's credit card, which can prove to be quite hard, especially in the cosmetics dept. Other than that, everyone is very upbeat and you get a raise each review and if you have great customer service and selling ability, you'll be fine. That will also come with time."
good,"I got great experience in Customer Service and Support. I learned to be quick and outstanding in quickly changing situations, finding the best solution in any situation, stay positive and helpful for any people. Store management is perfect there. Co-workers are very helpful and positive. The hardest part of the job is only when a department manager tried to talk to associates while they served customers.

They are talk about the previous week, the news and the congratulations for the  recognized employees  who had  the most sales and or  some letters from customers, who thank the customer service satisfaction.  In addition the company gives some value coupons that  incentive the goals of the week and  good sales. What I appreciate about this company is the open communication in which each employee can put their input and recommendations to improve the work environment and sales. In addition the company makes you feel part of them."
good,"Macy's has a thorough training system for new employees.  Management is largely competent, even at the department level, however, the attitude of your co-workers will make or break it.  They're very clear on what they expect of each employee, and have a consistent system to help employees keep track of their standing and improve their job performance.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, and long shifts on slow days.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people find exactly what they need."

good,"A typical day at work was providing outstanding service to customers. Work in your assign areas, organization of area. multi task between customer needs and area needs ( recovery, neatness).Knowledge is what you learn, a lot of product to learn about. Different vendors, styles and materials to be informed about. Every day is a learning experience. Management is different in every department, but all in all they are there to help associates and customers. Co-workers are essential to great team work and a great day. Team work is important to because it gives the customer a well rounded staff with knowledge and provides efficiency. The most hardest part of the job would be the holidays with all the recovery needed, but is not bad when given the right team. The best part of the job would be getting to know your clients and building your client list. Great experiences come from a well organized, well team support and management."
good,"Working at Macys was a great fast paced experience. Being that this was during the holiday season the hours were a little crazy but it was always about being joyous, helpful and keeping the customers in the holiday spirit. The main idea was to make sure that the customers found exactly what they were looking for. If I had to go from floor to floor, section to section to find what they want or something similar, I always wanted to make sure that my customer had a great experience and would love to come back to shop or visit again. My co-workers were great and were definite team players which was tons of help during my first couple of days where I barely knew where to find anything. I also had a wonderful supervisor that worked with my schedule and tried to get me as much hours possible and was ALWAYS in great encouraging spirits. Actually, the entire management was encouraging. I've worked in retail for many years but this was my first department store experience, which was a little intimidating because of the stores reputation, high traffic volume and the time of year. All in all I had a wonderful experience and would consider going back next holiday season."

good,"With paid training and excellent management and supervision, Macy's was a great place to work! Though the balance between work life and home life were too closely muddled for me, due to a schedule that required me to be away from my children all day (leaving the house at 10:30am, returning from work at 11pm), it was overall a great work environment. Each associate gets their own desk, close to others, so it's easy to get advice and make friends. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, which were not particularly flexible, and I had to quit because babysitting  troubles due to those long hours, but I made many friends, and my supervisors were great. Many times I was able to just walk up to their desks and chat during free time. In all honesty, I miss working there, but at Macy's, due to their strict attendance and employment process, if you quit, you cannot be re-hired, which is a major downside. "
good,"It was pretty much any day where you meet so many people and converse with everyone. It was basically another little family where we help anyone who need a helping hand. I've learn how important the customers are and good it is to satisfy there need. The management there is decent, they help the associate if there's any situation. My co-workers were wonderful, help one another, laugh, joke, and trying to make the customers happy. The hardest part of the job is making sure you don't make any mistakes and trying to help the customer anyway you can. The most enjoyable part of the job is socializing with everyone. "

good,"My typical day would consists of ringing up customers merchandise and also helping them find what they came in looking for. I also had to make sure the store stayed neat and organized. "
good,"My job was based upon the completion of the buyer's submission and support information that was to be placed into a one day add.  My main goal was to ensure that the merchandise was accurate as well as the product description and sale price.  The office was very energetic which was a terrific environment to be as productive as possible.Due to the many different cultural backgrounds, there were at times some differences of opinions which were quickly resolved with direct interventions by management.  Everyone loved to be able to express themselves through clothing and create works of art with the intent to sell products. "
good,Depending on the department you work in your job can be pretty easy. Never see much of management. Pay is pretty decent for part-timers. Loss Prevention are always doing their jobs. Training is excellent and they make sure you know what you are doing before working on the floor.
good,A great deal of co-workers and friends to work with and go through rough sales days together.
good,I would work weekends about 12hours at least each day. Which was somewhat tiring but with the breaks we would receive was really helpful and useful.

good,Macy's has provided me with a great learning experience. The management and atmosphere with co-workers is productive and quite rewarding. One of Macy's greatest strengths is its continual Magic Training.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I can say I enjoyed working working Macy's retail, I love clothes and communicating with people so those parts fit right in, but the duties/tasks weren't on the level of pay, I felt as if $8.25 was not enough for the tasks we were assigned daily."
good,I love to help customers. This job helped me find what the customer needed and helped me see what's in style at this current moment.
good,I had a wonderful time being apart of the mcdonalds staff I became a shift trainer for the new people that got hired I loved the customers and the school kids that came I learned some of the customers by names they even brought me gifts

good,more caring for associates would have been a plus.
good,"I loved Macys! Out of all the little jobs I've had, Macys had the best management... though they weren't exactly perfect either. When you go to work it's comfortable enough to know what you are expected to do daily, but you never know who you are going to deal with so there isn't anything boring about the job! I loved how easy it is to move up with macys.. so long as you are a good associate there are plethuras of oppotunity! But!! Here are the 2 biggies... you will wind up LIVING there if you aren't careful... somehow you wind up with no social life outside of work... and secondly, sometimes a terrible co-worker who does nothing but BAD will somehow stay around no matter how many complaints she gets... if you are opening credit cards frequently at macys, then you are almost untouchable.."
good,"I was hired at Macy's for a seasonal position only, but my time spent there was well-spent. There was never a typical day, because I was in a different department every day. I assisted customers making purchases, ran the cash register, and organized merchandise and dressing rooms. I learned a lot about what kind of shopping experience many people prefer, and how to better assist different types of customers. I was usually assigned to work in a department by myself, so even if i saw a co-worker around, we weren't ""working together"" per say. The hardest part of the job was to learn the store along with the latest advertisements and deals so quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing so while being able to give people exactly what they came for. I often felt a great sense of accomplishment."
good,"A fun place to work with lots of benefits. I loved working with the customers. It was a hectic at times during the sales and the clean up, but working with the other cow-workers we always made it fun."

good,A very fun environment to be in. Management was pretty forward on what expectations that needed to be met. Hardest part of this job is maintaining a constant balance when volume of calls come in. I've learned that patients is key with this job because you are working really hard to satisfy your customer.

good,This was my first retail job. I got hired here to work only a seasonal position working in women's shoes. We got paid not only hourly but commission. A typical day at work for me was go in at my schedule time dressed in all black because that was our uniform. Always stay on the floor to approach different customers. Every sale was a percentage toward our commission. Our job consists of a quota that had to be met daily which was always our sales goal for the day. Management was very helpful at times especially when I first got there. But they really didn't stay around much like they could have in my opinion. My co-workers on the other hand were very sweet and down to earth. They helped me alot you know with alot of questions or concerns I may have had with the job and they were also very patient. So that really kept my nerves at ease. I think the hardest part of my job was just really trying to sell a shoe considering the expense of a shoe but as I got the hang of it then it really did become a lot more easier. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get rewarded as an employee. What I mean by was Macy's bucks. As employees if we persuaded someone to open an account with Macy's in the store with us then we earn our Macy's bucks. And thats money off of a purchase we make!! What I learned is any retail store dont get the credit cards because thats how they get you!!! Overall I was thrilled to have this opportunity in working in retail because it really makes a difference on my resume.

Throughout the day it’s imperative to keep a clean and organized area in your department, which makes for a smooth transition. The customer is able to browse effectively, and as a Sales Associate I'm not only able to assist better, but, by knowing where everything is, and specific details about our products, I’m able to build trust and credibility with that customer, in turn allowing me to close the sale."

It's a very friendly, relatively accepting culture that truly shows the idea of a team being one large family."

Some of the coworkers could loosen up a bit, but other than that, they were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was opening up reward cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customers and helping them find what they were looking for.

I just love Macys as I said as employee as a customer ..."
good,"Coming into work was a drag. Once I started talking to the customers, I've became more excited than most. I enjoyed meeting different people each and everyday. I even mad some friends. Sometimes I will get the same customers and we would have conversations about the product, that's if the line was not long or it wasn't a busy day. It was a good feeling to get the same customers that know what you are capable of and only want your help and no one else. It wasn't all fun and games. Sometimes the most rudest customer would come and start problems that could of been avoided, if they had patience, I already knew the top of my head how to deal with the customer, so I already knew that I would have to talk more than usual to keep the customer from getting rowdy, My trick never fails because customers love when someone can just sit there and listen to what they have to say and then when they are done, that's when it is okay to talk and ask questions."

good,"Everyday would be the same scenery but different pace depending on what had to be done. Usually during the cold weather and hot weather, a lot of trucks would come in during the week to be loaded and unloaded. After the merchandise was taken off the truck, it would have to be processed so that it may be put on to the floor for sales. There would be days when I had to do both because in my job it was best to know everything so that you may contribute to another co-worker's task if you were already done with yours as a matter of team work. Through the experience of working at Macy's doing stocking and being on the floor frequently, I've learned to work hard with a positive attitude and contribute to your job as much as you can so that it may help others be happy as you are with your job. A lot of hard work and commitment is required through this job, but team work and team effort makes everything so much easier and faster. Ive also learned the quick you get something done, the faster you can put you and your company ahead in work. Management at Macy's is very productive and organized and when things get hectic far as holidays when more merchandise comes in and sales need to be done, solutions are always found. The co-workers in this company are very easy to get along with and everyone is treated equally regardless of any race or disability. The duties that are given to you on the job are very easy and most of the time hands on, but the only difficult part or hardest part of the job would be adjusting to changes as fast as they may come whether you're prepared for it or not. Though"
good,A day in any retail job is enjoyable to me because it affords me the pleasure of helping customers leave the store knowing that their needs were at least attempted to be met and their day a little brighter. I developed many sales techniques and found that they were applicable to life in general. The hardest part of my job was having a dily reminder of sales goals and the possibility of not meeting them.

good,Excellent people good environment to work in if work hard and miss no days you go full time I wouldn’t mind going back next season to do it all over..
good,This company is good to work and had a fun work environment. The management team was always reliable and helpful to whatever situation I had. I would suggest working here.
good,Great experience flexible schedule learn something new and I like the job it helped me learn a lot of things in the job experience I want all I can say
good,"Once I was ""on a roll"" I was happy with my duties when I worked there. The break room was nice (ping pong.) The people at the plant were respectful and polite once you had a chance to meet them on a regular basis."
good,"With the number and sizes of the departments within the complex, and dependant upon your skill level, as well as willingness to work, learn the various physical and mechanical aspects, there's work here."
good,"I work for the company almost 20 years. I had many success and achievements . Macy’s was my family and customers my second one."
good,"I learned many things about of the retail side related activities, like helping customers, managing registers, finding online orders and get them packed and ready to ship, recovering messy areas to look more presentable to customers, unpacking orders from the loading dock. Depending on where your needed each day could be the same or different. My former employees and the environment was great no problem with other employees or managers on my experience. Though the hardest part of my job was not finding a certain item for an online order."
good,"Very fun employer, closing in march 2019. Very inclusive and friendly environment. Always lefr with a sense of pride. The management always had time to discuss anything with employees."
good,I really liked to work at Macy's. It has very nice work environment with more flexibility in schedule. It had definitely added values in my work experience. I will definitely recommend to work at Macy's.
good,"It is a seasonal job, but it is very lively at work daily. If you're a ringer you enjoy giving customer service and one does need a lot of patience when it comes to unsatisfied customer. Overall it is a good job."
good,I enjoyed my time and employee discount at Macy’s. I appreciate the team work culture and flexibility in work schedule. Management sets clear goals and provide a lot of motivation and feedback to complete your goals.
good,"Love the pay, flexible hours. Overtime is great. "
good,"Macys can be a great starter for a career in the retail industry... Or if you attending college, because of their flexible hours.. some advancement if you work hard it might happen. Great place to learn new skills , because managers and leads will patently train you. Also paid training, and you can request to switch position in another department"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,i was very excited about working at a retail store and meeting new people. i like experimenting new things! i’m really glad to get this opportunity. It’s always good to know what you want and work for what you need
good,Really enjoyed my time working at Macy's credit and customer service. They are always doing stuff for their staff and I really miss some of the people I use to work with.
good,"Macy's is a great place to start your career, pretty good lower level advancement. Big enough store to where you don't get bored. When I worked there you had the option to be a ""flex"" associate which allowed me to pick my schedule, and area that I wanted to work in. This set me up to become a Store Manager a few years later."
good,I work as an HR administrative assistant and I love my job. Very fast paced environment which I love cause your never just confined to a desk or computer. Also love working a flex schedule it allows me to have a good work/life balance and flexibility.
good,It was fun but the building is cold. Dress business casual and fold the clothes. The people are friendly and nice. Treat customers fair and always help.
good,"I liked working at Macy's but, the hourly pay was not enough for my years of experience. The management was nice, you pretty much handle your own department. Unless there was bad problems"
good,As a fulfillment associate working in returns I can tell you that I learned a lot of new skills well being and a great group of people made a lot of friends here and the tasks here are pretty straightforward HR is very friendly and helpful and so are the managers don't really have anything bad to say my only complaint would be that the pay should be 14 an hour..
good,"Over Macy’s is a nice pace to work . The people are very friendly, and helpful . It’s also a company you can advance in . If you don’t like doing the same thing everyday Macy’s is the place for you . It so much to do , and learn ! As long as you’re not lazy , and people oriented you’ll enjoy it. The only negative thing to me is the pay ."
good,"I really don’t have much to say because i wasn’t there for that long , only a few months . But the few months I’ve worked there I didn’t like it all that much only because you had to pick up shifts & I’ve worked 3 times a week wit maybe 6hrs . I’m not sure if they’ve changed . But Macy’s is a very busy and fast pacing job . I like it I wish I was there longer"
good,Being apart of the Macy's team is a wonderful experience love working for them it's just some managers show favoritism and threat other co-workers like they're nothing other than that I love working for them and wouldn't mind working for them again
good,Upon hire knowing that you can grow with the company is very important. Macy's definitely has the opportunities to do so !    Keeping in mind to work hard to get to the top. Macy's can help you get there for sure !
good,Macys isn't a bad place to work i just feel its not for me. I've worked seasonal there before it wasn't bad. Its just that well it’s seasonal and I need more.
good,Co workers are very friendly even some of the customers are very friendly and who wouldn’t be everyone likes new clothes I work in many of the departments so I move around a lot everyday you are there you may have a different job to do
good,"Overall working in Macy's will allow you to grow as a person in many different ways. The company contains good management, as well as busy traffic but not enough hours."
good,"You will meet a lot of lazy coworkers who won't check fitting rooms, do recovery, and will steal your customers. On the other hand, you will meet great people who are willing to help you. This is a great place to work if you're competitive and want to move up to a higher position. You're able to work in different departments on different days but it still can get boring and depressing on a slow day because you won't make enough sales."
good,"It was great working there and getting to know customers and employees. It was sometimes difficult to manage certain tasks, but overall, it was a good experience. I learned so much from my coworkers and I was able to do the job effectively. It's also a competitive environment, but that's good because it prevents us from slacking."
good,A typical day at Macy’s was actually fun getting to know the coworkers and enjoying their time. Management was awesome the only reason why I left is because it was a seasonal position.
good,It was a easy simple job I liked it . You have to know how to communicate and put on a smile. The people that work there are really friendly and nice .
good,Kept you busy and offered training on the machinery. Long hours. But a good work out. Friendlya management and fair benefits. A positive experience overall.
good,"I started this about a month ago, it wasn't so hard as i thought it would be. It was fun and easy kind of work, but very long shift. A lot of people are so focused and is overly friendly"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Retail job. Great if you can deal with difficult customers often. Management is professional and fair. Great location except parking is a few blocks away from the building.
good,"I enjoyed working there at first but as time progressed, the politics really started to get to me. I feel uncomfortable even typing this. They were very open to me and showed me a lot but I began to feel like the black sheep of the store."
good,"I've only been here 3 months. Last night at the night rally they announced that the starting base pay is $12.50 per hour"
good,"I enjoyed Macy's, it's diversity, it's culture, the sales and the discount. The sales associates were professional. The rate of pay could have been a little higher. The sales I already mentioned along with the coupons offered a great buy."
good,"I was an on call beauty Advisor and overall I have to say I loved working there and I loved almost everyone around me. For an on call, there isn’t much room to grow, well because you’re an on call. On calls do get commission, but only 3% and if you were put in fragrance...you’re in it for something. The fragrance department is really tough, only because the full timers do not want you to take “their” sales. They will talk badly behind your back, give you dirty looks, and will sometimes take your sale because “it’s too big of a sale for you”. Another thing I did not like is how much they push credit cards. They really want you to force these people to attempt to open a credit card. Some employees will go as far as giving extra discounts just so they could open a credit card WHICH COULD GET YOU FIRED!! It’s ridiculous. If people don’t want one we shouldn’t have to push them to do it anyway. Sometimes they give free lunches on Saturdays. Fun place to work at, majority of employees are super nice and will always help you."
good,Everything was easy in the job and you just had to make sure you gave good customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to interact with a lot of people.
good,"Between customers, colleagues, and staff I stayed busy. I came in early and left late most of time, not good when you are a single parent, but the income helped when you have a growing family."
good,"Benefits, job culture was great only reason I left it was commute and medical reasons. Management is very nice, coworkers excellent and pay weekly when I was there."
good,"Typical work day fast pace and exciting, challenging and multi task daily. Fun environment work with many different people and meet many different people."
good,A fun place to work and flexible all the while bringing challenging problems to solve. Macy's allows you to do remote work when you have errands to do on a weekday
good,The managers was so wonderful ...I would work there again if I could... I would recommend this employment for anyone that's looking for a relaxed laid-back job
good,"My typical day includes making sure customers were taken care of, while I made my commission from a sale. I learned how to be more sociable and be more productive with my time."
good,Worked in Recruitment and it was wonderful. My manager was amazing and helped me grow immensley in my position and my career. Have and will continue to recommend Macy's.
good,I worked there for a short period but loved my experience there. Would highly recommend it. It was the first time I felt like I was supported by the management.
good,"I am currently working for Macy's for almost 3 years. I have enjoyed my time there and I'm hoping to transfer to the Las Vegas Furniture and Home Center. "
good,"Macy's was probably my best retail job. The management was friendly and realistic, and there was a good culture there based off of mutual support and trust between associate and customers."
good,Willing to go the extra mile to help employ candidates. Supplied transportation for those who had no transportation for seasonal employment. Incentives given for overtime workers.
good,"Macy's has very flexible schedule, good place to start as a first job. Gives an experience in customer service and sales. The hardest part of job - push the customers to open a Macy's credit card. The most enjoyable part - working with people. Sales person must have product knowledge and sense of taste and style to be able to advice customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,lots of walking and stocking but I didn't mind . wasn't a hard job at all it was very relaxing and a very friendly environment. love working and meeting different people
good,I put clothes on the rack. Made sure customers got what they need. Asked if any of my co workers needed any of my assistance. Just  being a helper and as well as doing my job.
good,"Managers and coworkers help new employees how to do stuff or just explain things when you don't understand something. "
good,I love working for Macys. I love how they prepare us for the work force. I love how fast they move you to another position if ready. I learn how to think like a team member and reach sales goals.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was catching shoplifters because it takes a special skill to be able to tell and learn the diiferent ways people go to steal high priced merchandise
good,This was one of the nicer jobs I've had. Mostly everyone is friendly...no real problems working there. I definitely approve of working at Macy's. You'll learn alot...good resume-builder.
good,I enjoy providing people with friendly customer service and being able to make somebody walk out of Macy's with a smile. My coworkers make it a welcoming and comforting environment to work at.
good,"Macy's is a legit place to work. The pay starting off is a bit above minimum wage. It eventually caps once you're there for a couple years. Managers seem to be good and helpful for customers and employees alike. Fellow employees can have issues interdepartmental wise, but that is normal. Would recommend if you want a retail job in a primary clothing and accessories kind of environment."
good,I've worked at Macy's for 7 years and have been promoted 4 times. Macy's believes in developing their associates and promoting from within when possible. They are also a innovative company that drives  many trends in the fashion industry.
good,A typical day at Macy's is relatively stress free. I learned a lot about customer service and gained a lot of experience in sales. The culture is overall friendly. I enjoyed working with many of my coworkers including managers.
good,"a typical day would start with cleaning the clothes from the other day and then be prepared for the customers to come in. ive learnt alot about customer service and how to deal with people. the workplace culture is very diverse and includes people of all ages and ethnicity, the hardest part would be the constant standing on your feet. the most enjoyable is seeing the customers happy when you offer them outstanding service."
good,Nice place to work. You get paid training and discounts as well. Scheduling was a little off sometimes but overall a great experience with staff and management.
good,Room for growth in the company. I enjoy working in a retail environment. I want it to grow with a company and Macy's offered me that opportunity to become an Estee Lauder counter manager however I do sell skincare products part-time from home as an esthetician so they said that was a conflict of interest.
good,"Macy's is an overall good place to work. If you work hard you are noticed and always have the opportunity to maintain a good work life balance. There is room for improvement with regards to compensation, benefits, and growth opportunities."
good,Typical sales position working closely with colleagues. Although the pay wasn't the best it was a great workplace. The most enjoyable part was being able to have support and communicate comfortably with management and coworkers.
good,I loved working at Macy’s so much. The management is awesome. The hours are flexible and they do what they can to work with your schedule. I will be applying here again when I can.
good,Working during the holiday season was fast paced but enjoyable.  Met a lot of delightful people-both workers and customers. Enjoyed the atmosphere....
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This was my first time working retail. I am always a hard worker and was promoted to management soon. I did enjoy it, however, I missed working in the movie theater industry."
good,"Macy’s is like a family oriented company . "
good,"I loved working at Macy's. While working at Macy's I was able to make use of most of the customer service experience I've gained over the years. The company gave me the opportunity to sharpen my skills on the daily which ultimately lead to me being the salesman I am now. Management rarely ever had any issues. But like all companies there are small things that can and should be worked on of course. To me, the hardest part of the job might've been dealing with so many impatient women who made their way into the women's shoes department."
good,"Working at Macy's was wonderful.  Helping customers find what they were looking for and making them happy was Macy's ""magic"". Every day was different, sometimes I would merchandise areas according to planograms, sometimes it was training new employees, but it was always about taking care of the customers and making them feel welcome and valued. What I learned was everything about men's clothing, from suits to casual wear, sizing and fit, and all about designer brands like Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss etc.  The management was good, communication and consistency could have been better.  The culture was diverse, and everyone was treated fairly. Hardest part of the job was the real early or late hours during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
good,i had very early hours working here. The people i worked with were wonderful and the environment was safe. the discount on all merchandise is wonderful.
good,"It is a great experience working there with the coworkers and the managers. It is great to work there especially it being my very first job. On a day to day basis it depends, during the season and on the weekends it picks up a lot. I learned how to be an polite associate and how to communicate to customers the appropriate way. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know what the customer is buying their clothes, appliances, or home decorations for."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work. There are days that are going to be slow pace, but during the holiday season is the most rewarding time if you are looking for extra income and also an extra discount on great gifts."
good,"They was a cool company. They appreciate my hard, I've gotten certificates and etc. We played raffles during our meeting so our day can start off well. Just overall experience was awesome."
good,"40 hours a week."
good,Good job to work at also good place to learn new things and see the company come as one .also everyone is treated as equal . The company acknowledges the employees .
good,"They are super flexible with your schedule. It was easy to get time off or switch shifts. Pay was every Friday. Easy to move up the ladder.You pretty much do your own thing. It is fun. Often times you are asked to do more work than you are paid to do, but that really depends on your manager which is why I chose to change departments. Some days would be very busy, some very slow. The busy days could get hectic and stressful especially if you have your mangers who are stressed. It does get very messy to work in depending on your department (all of them except: cosmetics and handbags, sometimes home). Their management is not so great and I wouldn't know how to describe it to you. But again, every store is different. It just may have been the one I was working at. They appreciate the employees a lot and offer 30%-40% off days for employees on ANYTHING. They provide great deals for their customers as well."
good,"Macy's is exciting meeting new people everyday, Learning about retail, customer service. Having fun events for the employees, having a flexible working schedule."
good,"I love Macy's because they give people a great opportunity to work!!! They even provide transportation to the seasonal candidates.  I really love to multitask and have the ability to hire a goalof 1,500 seasonal employees from my offsite."
good,It can be stressful and fast paced during the holiday season but the managers in each department are willing to help. Training is really quick and you'll make mistakes on the job in the beginning but people can catch on quickly with the right guidance.
good,I loved everything about the atmosphere the culture the job and the people. I had a very good time going to work and very seldom had any problems doing it.
good,i loved working in the cosmetic department you learn a lot and meet great people. management is great and try to work with your schedule. the company is not so great in hiring within and does not typically help you grow with in the company.
good,"I loved,my set schedule I loved getting up for work and working there.being able to do your job right the first time and being able to complete your goal by the end of the day makes the job a lot better"
good,"I loved my job at Macys honestly . I am 22 years old and after working for other (horrible) retailers , this was a relief. I loved my managers and I loved the respect each co worker had for one another. Only thing I disliked was the high “credit goal” which was basically how many credit cards you were supposed to convince the customers to open per week."
good,being the enjoyable of my part time job at Macys was a great experience. I loved working with great employees I liked doing my job there at Macys. I liked working with the store managers and with counter managers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The pay is good for the place, and it does help that that you can get more hours easily, but working 12 hours really can play a part on your body, especially if you're not sued to it."
good,"Very fun, always had something to do and customers were always understanding and kind. I enjoyed working the holiday season there was always a steady pace and things to keep me busy."
good,"TYPICAL DAY AT WORK"
good,"When working at Macys, the environment was very positive. Employees were very helpful and polite. Managers were very fun and energetic. I learned to deal with working in a more open area, handling the process with cashiers, and working my social skills with customers. The hardest part of the job was being able to learn and sell brand names products. But overall, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make new friends and have wonder conversations with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work I would open card accounts and lead customers to different areas in the store. I learned a lot about online order pickup and how to effectively communicate with customers. The most difficult part was the time of year, because of how busy it would get. The most enjoyable part was every big shopping day, we would have complimentary food and beverages in the break room"
good,I enjoyed my time working for Macys. I had the best sales floor team ever. I really hated to leave them. I love shopping at Macys in-store and on-line. The have all the name brand clothing that i am looking for.
good,I enjoyed my time at Macy's. Over saw my staff which varied at time. Worked with store management on how to reduce shortage in their departments. Customer service is and was always number 1.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's. It was my first customer service experience, and of course I got to learn all about the fun and not fun parts about that. However, management was really helpful and kind, and coworkers were generally the same."
good,"Working there was fun in the beginning, the managers always fed us, on special sale/ holidays, BBQ's or dinners were made. The scheduling is really flexible, you can pick up your own shifts. There's a rally every morning before opening, the employees are really friendly."
good,It is a good place to work.The schedule is very flexible. I did work with commission sales// it is very challenge since the Macy's prices are real low
good,Plenty room for advancement. benefits and discounts are great. fast paced environment. salary was competitive with the ability to make commission in certain departments.
good,You can make your own schedule very fun fast place environment to work in you can work in many different departments to gain experience in every part of the atore to meet the company's needs
good,"As a flex associate I was allowed to schedule my own hours, which became very useful as my college semester began. Not a difficult job or workplace, but workers have to be ready to stand for long periods of time."
good,I was taught immensely about customer service and I learned so much. There were always opportunities for advancement coming up. I really love all the people I work with as well.
good,Macy's was a fast paced work environment where I was able to meet new people and learned product knowledge and improved my communication service and people skills. Management was approachable and always available.
good,Working at Macy's honed my ability to speak with client confidently. Being able to educate someone on the benefits of a product and accepting rejection was a good skill to learn.
good,"I have only been with macys for about 2 years and its been ok so far but not somewhere i would want to stay. Management is constantly changing and is inconsistent with how they implement rules/guidelines and things in general that they want employees to do. Recently they want us to call each other ""colleagues"" and most of us find that is blatantly wrong as there is a clear indication on who is in charge and who is not in charge. ""Colleague"" infers that we are all equal and do the same job which we obviously do not. Besides that, pay is ok and the union helps a lot when it comes to issues within the store. The schedule is very flexible so that is definitely a plus if you're a busy person or have more than 1 job. There is annual bonuses for being in the union and the company also follows the slowly rising state wide and nationwide minimum wage. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with customers who think they own the store and can get away with anything and everything and the managers not helping us when it comes to those kinds of customers, as in they give in to their demands and it makes us employees look dumb and the customer gets what they want. In short, the customer is definitely not always right."
good,"Coworkers and managers were smart, resourceful and always reaching towards the next level. The company offered many helpful and interesting training opportunities."
good,"Good place to work as far as retail positions are concerned. However this was a management / supervisory position, which I am sure is better than what the selling associates have to deal with. Company does use innovative technology to help with managing the store and there is room for growth if you're willing to relocate to a more populated area."
good,Macy's emphasizes a creative working environment with a great work life balance. Macy's emphasizes customer focused decisions and is a great place to grow your career.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"take payments, solve any issues for customers from Macy's and Bloomingdales mostly billing issues,  give credit limit increases when requested and approved"
good,"I supported 2 warehouse, with over 800 employees depending on the season. I would check my emails in the morning, check my tickets, acknowledge whatever tickets I had, then make my rounds in the warehouse to each department. Sometimes, users had issues and they would not open a ticket. I would open the ticket for them and help them resolve their problem. users would call me all the time because I was very attentive to their needs."
good,"This job was probably the best job I ever had. The training was straight to the point and very fast paced. They give you a lot of hands on training as well and gave the opportunity to practice the register before going onto the sales floor."
good,"As a retail associate, I was involved with both sales/register duties and performed customer service responsibilities, promotional duties and opening new accounts. In these capacities I learned the importance of interacting with many different customer personalities."
good,"Low pay, but good for temp work.  Well trained for the job.  You most likely will stay physically active in most any position.  Management is friendly and supportive."
good,"The typical day started with clocking in. Then there would a meeting for all the morning people on every floor. As soon as the meeting was over than we would go to our designated areas and open the cash registers. Then if there was new merchandise we would put it away in the right places. My first priority was the customer and the young men's section. Periodically, I would clean out the fitting rooms and put the clothes away in there proper places. If I closed, I would do the same thing as the day shift, but would have to close down the cash register. I learned to take pride in the Guess clothing line cause I was the Guess specialist. The hardest part of the job was not working consistent hours and working all holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customer and finding out what their wants were."
good,"I was hired as a Holiday Jewelry Store Associate. My time was a pleasant but short stay. nice environment, Co-Workers helped Co-worker. Overall, it was decent, my only grip was that my term was up."
good,This was a great place to start in the merchandising profession.  Management was excellent to work with.  There is always a chance for advancement if you are will to work for it.
good,Overall I had a good time working there. I gained very valuable work experience that would help me in the future. I worked with some good employees who made the work day go by easier.
good,"Macys is a family like workplace, and almost everyone looks out for each other. The working environment is good, and the management staff is very experience, and overall we all tried to make the facility a comfortable place to work. I would recommend Macys to anyone who need to work."
good,"as an ap employee at Macy's it sometime could get busy especially during the holidays where you will most likely have a lot of hours to work. it could get boring sometimes but still, need to stay attentive at all times."
good,"Holidays are very stressful, customer service can be very stressful without enough workers, manager very positive,  nice company to work for,  Customer Service on some holidays ,  working in a big department store."
good,Enjoyed working there. Definitely would work for them again. I learned how different jobs around the store. Management could’ve been a little better. Teamwork was the best part of my job.
good,"Great hours, very fast paced during the peak seasons. Its hard to get a full time core position, normally your hired as part time first which is 2 days a week unless hired for the peak season and then your only full time seasonal help until the peak is over. I enjoyed working there and the management was good."
good,Macy's is a great job for all beginners. It was my first job and i found particularly simple.v the reason i believe it was easy because i am regular customer and i knew things about the store. The crew should be more interactive with one another rather than leaving a confused Individual on the floor I believe managers should establish crew leaders among new member.
good,I enjoyed my time at Macy's; a typical day would be me walking into the dock and pulling plastic off products and placing sensors on products. I would also unbox shipment.
good,I love working I want to start back it a good places to work i love the shipping part I learn new things met new people so it was very good . Experiment
good,"Working for Macys was a good experience for me, I have never really worked in a warehouse and learned a lot. Having to deal with a sales gun was probably the hardest part of the job. Learning it took time but once I got it I was able to process over 1500 a night with quota being 1000. I enjoyed my time at Macys even though it was seasonal and I lasted up until the very end. I enjoyed my job while it lasted"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Everyone was very friendly and helpfull. The only thing i had a lriblem with was the schedules. My job was fairly easy. Everything else was pretty goid
good,"For those of us who worked at Macy's, Inc., in its heyday, we had a blast. Many of us had intended to grow old in the company but due to restructuring, those hopes were dashed to the ground. But many of us are grateful to have worked for a company that took care of us --- great management, challenging opportunities, a lot of room to grow personally and professionally, fair compensation and great benefits. We felt very blessed indeed."
good,"Macy's administrative offices were a good place to work, however, if you were in Support, you did not get the same raises and advancements the merchant areas got.  I know that Support is basically overhead, but the differences were vast.  The offices themselves and people were terrific, and my staff was terrific."
good,"For the most part Macy's is a great place to work, something different everyday.  Can be very fast paced and exciting.  Management can make the position very stressful."
good,It was like a family atmosphere. Manager treated us like family member always.this was one the unique reason that workforce was very productive overall.
good,"I love Macy's good community and good team work .good people "
good,"Ring out customers,close and open cashiers, organize clothes, very nice managers and employees who are willing to help you when needed. overall a fairly simple job."
good,"Typical Day as Macys is very task oriented  and constant interaction with people from different parts of the world. learned an exceptional amount of people attitude, thought process and reaction to certain situation. the work place culture is  the hardest part of the job because if employees and manager s don't see eye to eye it can very costly to the company overall. But the necessary steps to increase moral has been taking and I see this location exceeding my expectation."
good,It's a fast paced work environment with plenty of positions available in multiple fields. The location is a bit secluded and out of the way but the pay makes up for that
good,Fun workplace full of advancement opportunities. Flexible work schedule. Ideal for college students with school schedules.Cool work environment and culture
good,Very fun and outgoing people with a face paced environment with great leadership and friendly competitive work place. The Culture was great with helping anyone in need of help whether its big or small products.
good,a meeting first thing in the morning and you plan out your day with members of co- workers and set goals for the day than we would plan our day around coaching our associates
good,"very laid back, there are always goals to reach, just like at any other job. like most jobs more is expected from your position. pay and benefits are great, given the jobs are not that hard, but hours are extremely scarce. I would sometimes barely work 8 hours a week. Only when BIG holidays are around you get those 40+ hours. people who work there are helpful, there are a handful of those who are also not that great but overall real good environment. materials needed to do your job are in low quantity at times."
good,"As a flex associate at Macy's. Our goal as a department store is to not only provide excellent customer service skills to our customers,  treat everyone- customers, and associates as friends and family. Most enjoyable part as an sales associate is interacting with customers on a daily basis. By enrolling customers into our Macy's credit cards, and getting to know the customer by handing over a different size item, but personally and having them become a usual customer. The difficult part of the job is being able to maintain a organized comfortable and clean department, with short staff."
good,"The hardest part of the job for me was getting there due to the buses I had to get to get there,but other than that it’s a good place to work,the managers are great people"
good,I had a pretty good schedule overall. Macys has a attendence point system so you want to make sure you are on time & present. The pay is just nit enough for the work you do. You can get overtime though.
good,"As a freelancer, I was not involved in the many meetings that are held each day. However, as a design support, I do feel that many of these meetings did get in the way for the designer to tap into their flow state, meaning, in order to flush out great ideas, one must have the uninterrupted time to work on their craft in order to meet the demands of the vp."
good,"Was always busy and everyday competition. The experience was great and you were able to get a 20% discount on purchases. Overall, it was an interesting experience."
good,"Varied schedule. Sometimes not enough hours. Great discount and coworkers. Managers, some great, some not. Many times there was not enough help and customers complained.  It’s pretty good for retail!"

good,"Working at macys was okay, people just minded their business but helped out if I was stuck with something. Overall just very pleased with the management and staff."
good,"People have no idea how much work is required at a retail company like Macy's.  I worked hard but got many promotions so it was all worthy.  I had great bosses that believe in my talents and helped me with career development.  Pay can be improved but probably is higher than many other retails.  Discount is a great think to have is you like/need to shop for your family or new home. I made many good friends at Macy's from coworkers and customers.  The job will suit better someone that have great peoples skills.  The schedules can take a toll on your family life if you are not use to work weekends and holidays. So overall my experience at Macy's was pretty good. (Part due to the company, some good bosses and many great coworkers and part due to my own ""can do, will suceed"" attitude)."
good,I loved my co works. I loved the products that's we sold and therefore I love shopping there. Getting discounts and earning Macys money was a bonus. But if moving up is hard to do if you are in one the smaller stores.

good,"clock in at 8am disarm store clock in walk into office turn on all monitors walk to office for a walk in report of who's working "
good,What I learn at the Tuxedo Shop @ Macy's is that you have to be a very well organized multi-tasker. In addition you have to be very in tune with the company and with the clients.
good,I enjoyed that when I first got hired they provided training with Smashbox Studios which overall help me succeed in being confident with my sales. I learned time management.

I would definitely say it is a great place to work.

good,"I was the stock associate in the mens department. So there was only one person giving me orders throughout the day and she was awesome. Once I worked there for a lil bit of time. I was allowed the freedom to come to work and do my job at an elevated level without her having being there or giving me directions every step of the way. Only thing wrong was they only would give me good hours and OT during only 3 periods of the year: Christmas time, Back to school & Spring Break."
good,Good company to work for.  every employee is responsible for their own schedule.  The management is great. It is a fun place to work and the benefits are really good.

good,"Good company with a stable job .Had too many organizational changes recently, few were reversing prior decisions. Currently they are trying to compete directly with Amazon, I believe that is the right step for the long term. Wish them them Good Luck!!!"
good,Working at Macy's in The Cosmetic department was very fast pace & competitive. During the holidays it is very stressful and busy.  You have to solicit Macy's credit cards and  meet  a certain quota in order to meet your productivity rate or score.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Nice place to work and really got used to the culture environment of Macy's.  Great opportunities for advancement.  Training that was relative to your job functions.  Fun work and out of work activities

good,I Liked working at Macy's. Like any department store it was seasonal. In the summer I was lucky to get 10 hours a week. During the holidays you practically live there.
good,"Productive and fun work place filled with excitement everyday.. Managed a total of 15 people each day. Had to make sure that all operational aspects of the job was completed each day. Learned so much doing this job for the last 3 years. Spent 14 years as a sales manager in men clothing, women clothing, kids clothing and housewares department. Customer service was a very important part of my job."
good,I worked for macys  only tell new years. The work was stress fully because it was the hoilday season and everyone was shopping. overall it has its ups and downs but ok to work.

good,"Working for Macy's was fun and easy, but at the same time you know they always cut-hours and laid off people each year. They provide us with luncheon's and breakfast monthly during rallys. I love my coworkers that worked with me. I would recommend Macy's for work, but only for 6 months or less because jobs eliminations."
good,"Good 9-5 people are nice. I have learned alot of excel and my team has been very helpful in my growth. Moving forward in the company can be tricky, make sure to guide your own career path. In such a big company HR is in charge of many employees and you really need to be in charge of your own growth."

good,A good company to work for. Nice managers and co-workers. You will learn how to deal with difficult customers. I liked doing inventory and fulfillment every morning
good,"Every day I would go to the Mens department, start off doing recovery, then fix clothes that was displayed on tables, provided customer service, while every hr. I would check the fitting rooms. I learned that customer service is very important to every customer because when they come in and shop they should want to be glad that they shopped at that store. Any manager should be very direct about their instructions, they should know what each associate does, make sure they do their job and have the best customer service as well. The hardest part of the job was folding the sweaters on almost every table while standing on my weary feet precisely the whole day. The most enjoyable part of the job was when some of the customers would ask me to help them put an outfit together."
good,"Good job, the pay is bad. The benefits and discounts are great but it doesn;t make up for the lackluster pay. You do way more than what you're paid to do."
good,"Working for pack is great! It is not bad, it is an independent work. For example staying in your own station and pack items into bags or boxes. Nice and friendly people. I learned to worked in a fast past environment but quality is most important to our customers."
good,"A great experience working for the Horton plaza store.  Fine merchandise for all ages, and overall a pleasant experience.  The management was always accessible."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I started out as a sales associate at Macy's. I sold woman's shoes for a couple of years. Then I desired a change from the high pressure sales environment. I then became a  expeditor. We pulled all the shoes for the sales staff.  We also preformed inventory on the complete shoe warehouse. We also organized the shoe warehouse.  The real busy times were weekends, sales and holidays. Next time you buy shoes at Macy's consider how many people were involved in the process."
good,"its a very fun, exciting, family orienting, and flexible environment to work in. it great for students, someone who is seeking low stress part time job."
good,When i was working for macys  i was a bra specialist what that means  is i measure  and fit people  for bra my department had the most traffic in the store
good,"A typical day at work was inclusive of basic transactions such as purchases, returns and exchanges. Maintenance and cleanliness of the work area is required. I learned how to conduct basic to intermediate transactions. Management was great, the customers opinions and feelings is always taken into consideration before anything else. There isn't really a hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers and making sure they were satisfied with customer service and their purchase."
good,I was a cashier in the juniors department. I learned how to use a register and developed communication and problem solving skills.
good,"The work culture is stimulating and keeps you on your feet and excited to go to work! You learn much patience and organizational skills, dealing with customers and coworkers."
good,"Really great company, working for receiving in the back just doesn't pay enough for all what you have to do, that being said I had to leave to find a better paying job."
good,"Macy's was a great place to work at, the employees were all kind and the managers handled every situation brought to them in the most efficient and professional way I have seen up to date."
good,It is evident why Macy's has been around for so many years.  They are skilled negotiators.  The working environment is good.  The staff works well together.
good,Macy's has the best AP program that I have worked for. They listen to what the AP managers tell them and they tailor report to what we suggest.
good,I worked in the beauty department and the manager was somewhat nice yet very rude. They sometimes force you to do tasks you're incapable of doing even after you'd say you can't or else they'd send you home. The employees there are very welcoming and they give you help when you need it. Overall I think the employees aren't getting paid enough for what they have you do.
good,"Arrive at work at 8:30 am. Prep for instore fulfillment and sales goals for each associates. Walk the floor to check attendance of opening team. Hold morning rallies to discuss promotions for the day and online coupons. Talk about initiatives/incentives going on in the store; raffles or giveaways."
good,"Most the Co-Workers and Managers were quite nice and didn't let you fail, if you struggled, they helped. Most days were a bit hectic due to it being a seasonal hire."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Serramonte, it is one of the older stores, yet would often be used as a template for updating merchandising trends, I took away from this experience so much that would come to benefit me in the future."
good,"Great place to work.  Meeting and working with great people.  Advancement is there to anyone who is willing. "
good,"A typical day work is not so typical every day is different which is good, i learned that not everyone is made to work retail, as for their management its not so great they can sometimes treat you with disrespect and act like they know it all which in some cases they don't."
good,"It was a good job for the winter, I would recommend it to anyone who needs a part-time while home for the holidays. Other than that, I didn't get much of a feel for it overall"
good,"The hours was good I never had a complain about the hours I was given. The pay and the manegment are amazing . Overall Macy's is a good work enviorment,  especially as a first job."
good,Sales associates work to provide excellent customer service experiences for Macy's consumers. Sales associates must also excel at working in teams and developing solutions to solve problems.
good,"Great place to work, the hardest part of the job is the customers during the holidays. Always have the pressure to open credits, Every   single day. If you create a friendly environment for you and your co-workers in your department, your job will be easier."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,very flexible with hours and great pay and benefits. loved the diversity of my co workers. managers were pretty rude to very petty
good,"-Provided apparel sales and excellent customer relations."
good,I've only worked here a month now as a seasonal employee but so far it isn't that bad. I had bad expectations for retail but it honestly isn't as bad as it sounds and I like how my fellow associates are very helpful and work with me when I'm still learning things.
good,Macy's is a busy place to work. There is always a task that can be done. The store is usually busy. Most of the customers are regular customers. The managers are friendly. You can always pick up extra hours. The discount is 20%. They work with your availability to schedule you. It's a set dress code and days where we dress for the holiday/ awareness event.
good,"Co-workers are nice , managers are great. I like the flexibility their schedule website allows. You never run out of things to do and to me that is ideal."
good,I got this job and was very proud to work for this company. I had never done retail before and thought id try it out. It was fun and a lot of great team members to work with. Great benefits too. There was a lot of mis communication though with scheduling for a seasonal sales associate.
good,Mixed hours in scheduling. Really friendly environment. All black attire is required for this job positioning. Different areas able to work. Very warm and comforting feeling during the holidays.
good,Employees were able to have fun but still be professional on sales floor. Getting somewhat personal with clients to form a work relationship that keeps them coming back to you specifically.
good,"Loved working here, the manager was super nice and cared very much about his employees and guests. You got a salary and a commission based on sales. Most people were very friendly and willing to help. Union based and healthcare available after 6 months of working there (if I remember correctly)."
good,Great people very flexible hours great pay and hours very understanding with working around your lofe schedule if you have kids and things
good,Great place to work far as the people and management but not so great pay.You do have the opportunity to do other things though.
good,This was a great place to work and meet new people. Everyday was a new experience. Management treated you as you was a part of a family and everything was organized and well done. Co-workers where very enthusiastic to work there and communicated well with one another.
good,"Starting off, you really enjoy working there because they can really work with your school schedule. However, the drama and rumors that go around are endless"
good,I loved working for Macy's they were always supportive of their employees. They would give monthly rewards to employees who worked hard to earn them . Very supportive in helping not only employees but the family of their employee as well if needed. They would help you advance as far as learning new and better job skills to help you in the future to make more money in their company.
good,great people fun place to work the work flow is fast and smooth im just typing anything at this point for some reason this wont let me continue!
good,"A solid company that provides opportunities to those in the EDP program. However, due to changes in the market and at the company, if you are trying to advance from entry level positions and are not in EDP, it can be quite challenging."
good,"What makes Macy's a fun place to work is the location. Located at Barton Creek Mall you could take your hour lunch and shop or eat at the few restaurants it offers. Macy's also allows for interaction with all sorts of customers, providing a vast amount of one on one customer engagement. Everyday is a learning experience since each situation is unique from the last. Management is helpful and always offers coaching to new employees to ease them into the position. My co-workes are by far the best and most helpful. Working as a team is definitely a positive at Macy's Barton Creek. The hardest part of my job is not being able to stay still in one spot, which I think is also a positive since being busy makes the time fly by. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to effectively service my customers throughout the day and leave knowing I gave excellent customer service and surpassed my daily goal."
good,"For the short time that I worked at Macy's, they were a good company to be with.  I wish I had spent more time in my role but had great management to support whatever I needed to do."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a very large store with many different managers. Some are better than others and more fair and approachable. Hardest part of the job is making your daily and weekly goal during slow times. Co workers can be extremely competitive but some are kind and helpful.
good,The management and staff were great. The hardest part if the job was getting adjusted to working the cash register. Working at Macy's I learned how to work at an upbeat tempo and multi task between folding and stocking clothes to assisting customers.
good,I worked seasonal for this location. I wanted to show the management my drive and dedication to getting things done and I was able to keep working through another season. My responsibilities ranged from recovery in the fitting room and helping customers
good,macy's was a fun place to work. everything was always very productive. i had a lot of hours so i had a lot of time to work and get things done
good,Great place to work if you are in need of flexibility in your schedule. Supportive management. Friendly atmosphere. Learn how to work with a variety of people.
good,Only there part-time for holidays so I don't really have anything good or bad to say about working. Recovery-wise is brutal
good,"The job is good and very challenging from time to time because of not enough staff but I still manage to pull through the day because I am known as Multi task and Efficient and fast at my job.  The day usually goes by quick because I don't just deal with associates or the executives but also I answer phones and deal with customer all the time.  Since I was a sales associate, from time to time, i help out on the floor(especially Black Friday)."
good,Productive and fun place to work. Meet and engage with allot of interesting people from all walks of life. The job allows you to help and serve the public in a satisfying way.
good,"A typical day at work was making sure the area(s) were clean and merchandise was properly placed,checking the registers and making sure they had been opened,assisting manager's and or other employees if need be. Met a few amazing co workers who were extremely helpful and had great personalities; met some that weren't so great. The hardest part of the job was keeping a customer from getting too upset especially when there was something out of our control. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people from different places from around the world and talking to them."
good,I liked working for macys because there where so much customers and workers and it was nice but i didnt like that it was someone constantly giving
good,"On a regular day in the office your asked to do about 3 things at once, so there's always something to keep you on your feet. Loved working with my co-workers and was taught the importance of communication whether is was verbal, email, or a sticky not. The hardest part of the job was the constant change of supervisors and a new HR manager. Most enjoyable part of my job was teaching new hire orientation during the seasonal holidays. I was always nervous but was admired and well known after the class."
good,Macys Inc. is a fun place to work for serious minded individuals. In Macys with a considerable sense of humor you can perform a great task with less difficulty.

good,There was always something to keep me busy. The hours worked well for my schedule as well.The managers were always there to help.
good,"Big company offers good experience in money handling, sales skills, communication skills.nice managers and colleagues."
good,Sometimes working in retail people are not always sanitary and management is not always organized. Stay on top of everything. Best part of the job is building friendships and helping others.
good,I learned a lot about customer service importance from Macy's. Co-workers were mostly friendly except when in commission sales. Management had a difficult time controlling co-workers who have worked at Macy's for a long time. These co-workers would bully inexperienced workers to get sales. Macy's was accommodating for my school schedule.
good,"The warehouse is busy, lots of people there, very diverse. Every job has its pros and cons but all in all an ok place to work"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"i enjoy working , selling shoes , giving a good customer sevice and i receive prizes , comission and a good treat for my manager and my partners."
good,Sometimes a lot of work but its a fun place. nice coworkers and room for advancement. flexible with employees and schedule. Have to meet sales to be liked or you don't move up as quick.
good,"I really enjoy my job for many reason. For examples my coworkers are great team leaders and we all work together. I've learned that a great team around you gives a lot of enthusiasm and also keeps clientele returning. On typical days we open our cosmetics area then follow up with clients that have appointments for brow or preparing a event at work. Were constantly booking appointments and steping out to provided customer service. When it's a calm day I consist doing paper work such as faxing sale goals, ordering shipments, making copies, preparing events and more. I must say the hardest part of my job not having enough staff coverage."
good,I was a seasonal employee and I have to admit that this is a very good company to work for. Very flexible with your schedule and all of the managers are so nice.
good,"I usually wake up early and always arrive on time. Though parking it hard due to it's popular mall location, I manage to clock in right on time. Working at Macy's usually consists of recovery of returned items and items on the floor and the wrong racks. Occasionally I got to handle the cash register and handle transactions. My co-workers were very friendly and understandable and my managers were also friendly and good mentors. They were fair and very helpful getting used to Macy's face paced holiday season. The hardest part of the job would probably the tediousness of recovery. But I enjoyed the customers and working the cash register the most."

good,I am good at learning new thing at macys and good at work and good with the managemnet and good with the team to work with them.
good,"I really loved Macys, I loved making my own schedule. I knew almost all the departments besides commission departments and  truly enjoyed everyone i worked with. I had so much support at Macys with management, supervisors, and coworkers. I enjoyed every day at work, i cant remember one day i really had a terrible day there. When I suffered a miscarriage and decided to leave Macys for personal time that was hard, I miss working for such an amazing company."
good,it is a fun experience working in retail. To get the chance to meet new people and put yourself out there is a good way to grow to be a spokesperson. I have learned a lot being a sales associate it help me step out the box
good,"Call centers are stressful places of employment due to the customers dealt with. Breaks were strictly timed and you were expected to be back in your cubicle exactly on the dot or you were docked points. Breaks did not really feel like breaks because the building has no windows, so you're still locked inside for the entire day. Otherwise, the company paid well and advancing from one department to another takes about 6 months each."
good,"Engaging, exciting and comfortable place to work in fragrance and skin care and was especially enjoyable around the holidays.  It was a great environment to work in and the managers were always uplifting and motivating."
good,"Very sweet, fun people. Great place to express your personality and make good friends. They want to see you doing your job but care a lot about your smile and being satisfied at the work place."
good,Macy's runs their organization by their core values. There is room to advancement if willing to relocate. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"Good job, work hard and you'll do okay. Simple tasks are to be done, must treat customers with respect. Come in on time, meet sales goal of the day."
good,"It gets competitive to work with coworkers when there is no customers."
good,The most enjoyable part of being a cosmetic manager at Macy's was being able to help customers feel better about themselves while introducing them to the amazing products that we provided.

good,"good work place with supportive management  "
good,"It can be a fun and productive place to work at sometimes."
good,"typical work day would be coming into the store clocking in, opening the registers, putting all the go backs away from the previous day that didn't get finished, attending customers that need some help throughout the day, and checking them out and making sure they found everything they were looking for throughout the entire store. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,"Even though it was a fast paced environment, which consisted of getting displays ready for end of the year holidays and events such as Black Friday, it had an incredibly supportive and friendly atmosphere. A typical work day included reorganizing displays, helping customers, ringing customers up, and trying to meet sale goals. Helping customers was the best of the job and made working at Macy's an enjoyable time during the Christmas season."
good,was a good job for a person who likes to move around and be active. Typical day would be doing go backs and helping customers at the register. Cleaning fitting rooms and organizing and cleaning the floor.
good,"Serious company,"
good,Was an awesome overnight temp job. Loved the people I worked with. Unfortunately they did not have the hours to keep me. So I moved on to another company.
good,"People's offered several benefits, most at little to no cost. It was also a good place for growth and development, as there were several departments to advance to."
good,Great place to work.  Team atmosphere where input was welcomed. Was given the freedom to think on my own and create solutions.
good,"come in to work 15mins before the store opens. Make sure all registers are online. say hello to everyone, helping with all returns exchanges and purchases. placing online orders and taking payments for credits cards . I learned how to help customers find what they need at the price they like. The management was great! i would get a weekly review on my performance on things that need to improve and focus on. A lot of recognition and support from co-workers and other managers. The hardest part of the day would be during a busy sales day with lines of costumers but you just have to give each person your attention solve their problems and have managers of co-workers put in a team effort to help anyone in need of assistance."
good,"- All associates were welcoming and respectful."
good,I love the working environment around me when I come to my job. I'm surrounded by great employees that are patient and will teach you a lot for you to advance within your job or career.
good,"On your first day you will be assigned to department . The manager will meet you and give you instructions on what they want you to focus today on . You will never be alone , they will always put you with a co-worker that has experience .  They co-workers are very helpful and guide you in the right direction .  The hardest part of the job is being new and have to work on a big sale day like the one day sales or holiday sales . The reason why is because sometimes the machines shuts down and you will have lines of customers . Also everyone's busy and every customer is asking you for help .  In addition the fitting rooms are the hard especially after the day is over because of the millions of clothes that has been left .  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with people , you will meet some great people from difference places . The events they have for the employees doing holidays especially fourth of July ."

The co workers at Macys were sweet and nice and took their time with you if you need it. the hardest part if the job was the commission sales but  I enjoyed going and working every day.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of all sales associates ringing up customers in order to attain their sales goal. Along with that associates take turns checking the fitting room and cleaning the floor. Our first priority was always customer satisfaction. "
good,working in macys is fun and interesting because everyday I would be in different department. the co-workers were very friendly and helped when I needed the help. I managed my time to finish and get my tasks done on time specially when it gets busy like on the weekends or holidays the manager would move to another department.
good,the management there treats you with respect and allows  you to perform your duties without difficulties and when you need help they're in your corner
good,"The management was great.  We opened our register, assisted customers on phone and in person, processed returns and assisted customers with their concerns, checked back stock and stock level at other locations.  Cleaned out the fitting rooms and took care of all product that needed to go back out."
good,"It was a very great experience. I learned how to be patience with customers, and managers. I learn how to listen more, and to multitask. I also learn how to work under pressure with upset customers ."
good,"Working at Macy's requires knowing all aspects of working in retail. Cashiering, customer service, organizing, cleaning, scheduling, calling other stores, ordering online, etc. There's rarely ever a dull moment, but that also comes from working in a mall. Everyone tends to be pleasant to work with, and the managers trust every individual's judgement for the most part."
good,A day at macy's consisted of 8 hours walking through the store observing customers. Making sure they did not steal or attempt to steal merchandise.
good,Fun and productive work place.  I learned invaluable business and customer service skills.  Management is great and willing to help.
good,"Talked to Management daily to find out what needs to be done in the store, Set floor to the standards of the company. Let the MTM know what was done and what was not."
good,"Inadequate amount of supplies and equipment for staff. For time I worked there, there was a limited number of keys available for employees so when the watches department would get busy, employees would have to wait for another employee to be get done using their key in order to take it from them and open up their glass windows to show customers watches inside the display. At times, it would take anywhere from, 10-15 minutes before getting ahold of a key and customers would get furious. Sometimes, employees will go on break and forget to leave their key for another employee or some will leave work without signing their key out. Overall, the whole key issue was a hassle and frustrated both employees and customers"
good,Working with a really diverse customer base led to the job being very interesting and challenging. My only complaint is that opportunities for advancement tended to be steered towards female employees.
good,"wrote and ran programs for all the department stores, and the management.  Took part in creating a new data base for the company.  We did not work face to face with management on a day to day basis, we mainly spoke by phone."
good,"When I was initially hired my manager was awesome, but through the year I went through 3 managers including the original. The later 2 were very lost and made the work environment hectic."

good,"Non-strenuous. Easy flowing work days caring for customers and their daily needs. Communication builder. Hands on."
good,"A typical day on a weekend is very fast-paced because not everyone is working and has time to go shopping. It's especially crazy when Macy's is having a pre-sale or doorbuster event. Be prepared to type fast and don't forget customer return labels and receipts. On week days, however, work is a little more slower-paced. Especially in certain departments, such as Linens and Intimate Apparel. But overall, the work is fairly good. It hardly gets too boring. The associates and managers at the Macy's in Olympia are amazing, all of them are wonderful people. The majority of them are so easy to get along with and can become great friends. But never forget your job, your role in the store. Your first priority in that store is the customers. Everything else comes afterward. Even the managers will tell you that customers come first. If you're in the middle of restocking a shelf during a doorbuster event and a customer asks you for help, you help them. And you make sure that there is another associate there to help customers if you need to clock out within the next minute. Even if it includes calling for a manager. Customers first. Connect with them, help them find what they need, and demonstrate your magic selling skills."
good,During my time at Macy's I learned different customer service skills considering it was my first retail job. The management was very helpful and they made sure my time at Macy's was enjoyable.

good,"Macy's was my first job. I worked in the dress shirts and ties department. I loved it because you got to dress up and help people find shirts and ties that compliment each other. When I wasn't doing customer service, I was cleaning up the store. I always received positive feedback from management and we had good chemistry. My co-workers were very professional and helpful when it came down to teaching my not only about how to work at Macy's, but how to work in general considering that it was my first job. The toughest part was probably enduring the shift a slow day. The most enjoyable part was meeting new customers that were typically really fun to interact with and help them discover new dress clothes."

good,"I enjoyed my experience with the Company. Retail customer service/sales isn't for everyone, however I thought Momentum had a good team with positive supportive people. It's a customer service and sales company that drives sales, no surprise there. Management was helpful and talked a lot about there goals and opportunity. Hardest part of the job was absorbing all the info and handling rejection. Plus, they did want some overtime, which I didn't mind. I left because I'm moving back home to be closer to the family. I would recommend the job to motivated people who want to grow quickly, and don't mind dealing with people"

Management are great people, they are willing to help  you, teach you and provide the necessary things you need for your success. The people that work there function as a family they all help one another, teach one another and cover each others backs.

good,"This was my first job. The management was awesome. They always set goals for their associates, and wanted to do their best to ensure the goals were made, but associates were allowed to have fun and laugh a little on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to help the customers that were cheerful and had a good experience finding what they needed. The hardest part would have to be dealing with those few customers that came in the store in a bad mood and decided to take out their frustration on innocent employees."

The hardest part of the job was getting off on time and the most enjoyable times was working with the customers. its good to learn their style and what they like, you would be amazed how it helps you in other situations, when you bring together evrything you learn and put it into your own style you can be very successful."
good,"Working at Macy's had been very great. It was great to find a job that was very flexible with my school schedule. I love how I was able to have total control over my schedule.

Whenever it was slow, I´d spend the time in the stock room filling the shelves in with new shoes and making sure that any new style was put out on the floor.

Management is very strict on dress code, and opening Macys credit which can be a tad stressful. Coworkers do work cooperatively together, which is something that I love because all of the work is not always piled upon one person. I enjoy interacting with different customers everyday, there are alot of wonderful personalities out there! Macys is great job to start because the strict management can help you become more experienced in the job field, providing and enhancing the skills needed to move up in the work world. As much as I love Macys, I do feel as though the pay is way too low for the amount of work we have to do."

Every hour on the hour we clean out fitting rooms and we have to make sure to meet and greet with every customer on the floor. With this job, I've learned how to multi-task and have great patience. My manager is absolutely the best. She will call me in at any point of the day because she knows I will pick up extra hours whenever I can. She cares about us as people and not just as her employees. The hardest part of working at Macy's would definitely have to be learning the floor and where clothes go. They change around the store quite often so if you take a couple days off here and there you might miss something. Overall, I really love the people I work with and the teamwork we have as a whole. I love chatting with the customers and finding out what has brought them into the store and if they have plans to wear the clothing items at a special event. We also get a really good employee discount as well."

good,"Motivate associates to perform at the highest level, and provide an unbeatable customer service experience to our guest. Coach associates on how to improve their service skills, and direct them to complete tasks or seek out opportunities to engage with customers. Hardest part of the job is motivating associates that are disconnected or do not buy into company directives and initiatives. The Most enjoyable part of the job is coaching associates and seeing improvement and the associates advancement that was directly influenced by my coaching. Also most enjoyable is working with customers that are very pleased with the customer service that they have received and seeing them return to the store because they only want to shop with me and my associates."

good,Liked the job. Needed more money. Friendly atmosphere. Super busy at holidays. Some people are rude and their are lots of clothes to hang up.

good,While working at Macy's I've learned how important it is to consistently tell customers about the benefits of opening up an account with our company. Management is great due to the fact that they are very involved with their employees. My co workers have been outstanding in helping me learn new processes in regards to my job. The hardest part of working at Macy's is being able to remain positive if you lose an opportunity to open a new account. The most enjoyable part of the job is gaining experience through directly speaking with both new and old customers.
good,i enjoyed working at macy's it was a fun place but the only bad was that you have to stay on your feet the whole entire time
good,not so bad a place to work i have gained a lot of knowledge about merchandise and how to work along side others to get what you need to be done
good,During the short time I spent with the Macy's team I enjoyed every bit of it. The customers were always a pleasure to help and when I needed help my coworkers were always so helpful. The staff are nice and rewarding to work with. It was really a great experience.
good,i liked working at macys because it was a new experience for me and macys gave me the opportunity to gain new skills and i always stayed busy working in all their departments which really helped me to gain experience in a retail setting.
good,"Macy's is a good place to work in general. Managers are helpful, and they often trust their employees to be proactive in their work and to work independently without constant supervision. They sometimes help, but normally are very busy with other things, and will let you know what you need to accomplish for the day, and then leave you to it, checking in occasionally to make sure you are doing alright."
good,here anybody surely feel at home and all the co-workers are friendly which is very important in working place. they are well- organized and helpful to others
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. Most of the LP management was really professional, but as in any job there are the occasional bad eggs."
good,The job was pretty easy and straight forward. When you needed help with something there was always someone you can ask for help. The environment was positive
good,I was great at my job and they loved me! Second year there I was one of their Employees of the Year and they took All of us out to eat at Brio (Galleria Mall) etc! You make your own schedules at Macy’s too!
good,Awesome place to work.  I started in receiving and was immediately offered to learn other positions  right away and took advantage. They taught me well and treated me with respect. I was only working seasonal and my only regret is not taking the fulltime position that was offered. I should have never turned them down.
good,"A typical day at the job would work out amazing depending on where you’re working. I learned a lot about the retail business, the management is amazing and so understandable. The hardest part about the job is closing and opening, it’s not really hard but it’s very frustrating. The best part about the job is the workers are amazing, and understanding."
good,Nice job sales associate position interact with customers and try to sell merchandise it is a friendly work environment. I enjoyed working as a Macy’s employee
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It is nice getting the free products here and there but you got to work for it like get credit cards and points for every new coupon sometimes alot of cashiers will just get people to buy stuff with the coupons  and not even really knoe what there selling to people
good,"The hardest things about my job is the heavy lifting. I break down tables, move racks, put out new stock while moving the old. Management is great at what they do, they get the team together and make sure that what they’ve planned gets done in a timely manor."
good,"They are a good place to work and cross train you to work in different departments making you a more valuable employee.   "
good,"Macy's cares and has a giving culture. A typical day involves clock in, log in, resolve customer concerns, take needed breaks and lunch, stay involved in ongoing company events especially during holidays which is the most enjoyable part and go home. It is a simple straight forward type of work environment. Do your job, take care of the customer and it is well."
good,The employees and the managers are helpful when you need them the most. There's a lot of diversity in the workplace and can be a little overwhelming at times.
good,I've been working with the company for 2 years now. I started as a seasonal and moved my way up to the cosmetics counter. I now work for Clinique and I absolutely love the company so much. Paid trainings and fun events.
good,"The environment was great and the coworkers were amazing, but for the amount of work others and I do we feel we sold be payed more than $11.50. Overall it was a fun job to have with many learning experiences."
good,work day goes quick. management is very helpful and encouraging . talent shows are great. very fast paced and always learning something new. everyone helps each other
good,I loved working at Macys. Everyday felt like a party and my CO workers were awsome. I was a manager at Macy's making 18.50 In Los angeles which was not enough at all. Also being a receiving manager can get stressing with higher management constantly slashing tmyour teams hours and expect to finish faster that forecasted with full staff.
good,"It's a good job, you learn a lot with sales, it's always moved, it takes a lot of time, it depends on the area where you work, the salary varies ! the atmosphere is good"
good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's, they had an average pay rate. They would give you a lot of hours if you would ask them. It was busy and always fun. Management was flexible and easy going. They would pressure us to make our goals and to open Macys credit cards. Overall a good experience but not so much room to grow."
good,Macy's has the perfect opportunity for summer and holiday employment. I was only there for seasonal period for a couple of years and I loved the enjoyment of being a team player.
good,Good place for a part time job to have extra income.Nice management and coworkers. Good for students to work during holidays not for a career builder.
good,"I've worked at the Fulton Street Macy's in downtown Brooklyn, for approximately 10 years & I can honestly say that ever since 2 years ago that they invested a massive amount of money into the makeover of this branch, it has considerably improved."
good,"Macy's was my 2nd part time job and worked perfectly for me, they have very flexible schedules that can fit people schedules like mine, depending on the departments things may be different, department  management and Upper management at Colonie NY were very professionals they care about hard workers... I learned a lot about products, policies and even selling skills. I enjoyed every day working in Macy's I had and excelent team and team work there makes a huge diference ..  employees discounts were awesome, pay is not much but they have a lot of incentives, bonuses, ... they care about your work-life balance..."
good,"15 year career with a company who valued my contribution and consistently promoted me to higher volume businesses. Fast paced environment, competitive pay, continued education and team building exercises."
good,"I had a great time working here. Laid back lead. Decent pay for the work. Worked with great people. It was busy, but made time go by fast. Listened to music and was just really chill."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I love working at Macys...it's a place to advance if you have the right skills that they are looking for. I have worked for them on and off since 2013...it's an exciting place to work.
good,"I was new to retail when I got job at Macy's, but people in the store from seasonal associates to the store manager were extremely kind and respectful to me. I guess that's quite a rare situation as I heard different stories from colleagues who worked at other stores. Anyway, the wages are low but you learn a lot and can get promoted easily if you are enthusiastic and have a good attitude."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work at for first timers. Must be over the age of 18. You gained good experience and often learn many departments. They offer VTO (Voluntary-time off), and opportunities for overtime. During peak season it does get crazy loaded with new employees as well  as with work. Mangers and supervisors are very understanding. As long as you work and show positive attitude you wont get into trouble. Easy to learn, and easy to get along with other colleagues. They have this awesome system where you can advertise your shift and if a part-timer picks up your shift you don't have to work,  and it doesn't count as a point."
good,Working at Macy's is absolutely lovely. The most pleasant experience I've had. They're very understanding and very flexible. My only complaint was not getting enough hours due to being flex rather than part time or full time. I was getting one shift every two weeks.
good,"My personal experience at Macy's was Great. As an employee, you beneficiate of the Macy's Card and they approve you automatically. But they pay terribly. $9.00 to $12.00 depending on your position. Good Luck"
good,the job at Macys was good I left it because I started working for Texas de Brazil. It was nice working there but the hours were not constant some weeks we had a job and some we didn't .
good,"Working on a loading dock in the mornings unloading trucks and working nights processing shipment. Routine maintenance around the store. Replenishing stockrooms, temporary recovery on the sales floor."
good,"Laid back workplace. Management and Company willing to help you succeed in your role at Macy's. Plenty of room for advancement and growth.  If you have any issues, they will try to get it resolved"
good,"Macy's offers great opportunities to advance, especially to those hired in the seasonal period who perform well.  Management opportunities are also available, but beware the beast that is retail sales, as the entire segment is still somewhat volatile but sales goals do not decrease in tandem."
good,"High turnover for kitchen staff, however good food.Too much compliance training.  Food Division do more training than store employees.  With no extra pay. We get $3.59 an hour instead of $15.00 ."
good,"My personal experience was at Macy’s Fashion Valley, which is an amazing location to work at Southern CA; coworkers are highly competitive people however always provide great teamwork. Management in the different departments tends to be horrible when the person in there is just unprepared or unfit for the position, but general store management was awesome and very open to listen to their employees inquiries. I think Macy’s can be the perfect retail job which can actually be fun and motivating to work at as long as you are open to hard work and negotiation, because I can guarantee it really pays off, again, as long as your manager keeps the working climate professional and flexible; many of the managers are always willing to listen and work things out with their employees in a friendly resolutive yet assertive way."
good,Positive culture and probably best work life balance in retail. Great collaboration within each store.  Ability to grow and learn new roles that you never expected to be in.
good,"Macy's was fun when started but it can be stressful. There's always hours every day so there isn't much to worry about. The pay is min wage unless you have some experience. But in my case. I had was Min wage. Macy also does inventory once a year. There is a discount BUT you'll still have to apply for the Macy's card so that's a no."
good,"At Macy's Logistics and Operations, employee engagement is a priority to the building VP and the entire management team. The 4 day work week makes it a lot more enjoyable to work at Macy's, in addition to the friendly competition among shifts and departments."
good,I loved working for Macy’s. It was a shame when the store closed in this location. The environment was like a family and everyone was supportive and so kind. You always felt included and well trained in everything.
good,Good work life balance management was okay benefits not too great people at stores always fun and friendly never had issues with management.  Would recommend
good,Macys was a productive job. The Environment was great You always had something to do but the amount of work for the amount you get paid is a bit unfair
good,"I love working at this store, the staff and workers are very great to work with. You have your ups and downs but it's a great place to work. Sometime you can get your hours and sometime you can't."
good,I did not have any complaints about the work atmosphere or the pay.  I really enjoyed working for Macy's and would reccomend working here to wveryone.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's was a fun but definitely challenging job at times. Very quick paced as you were interacting with hundreds of guests during the events. If you like kids and don't mind nonstop activity this is the place for you.
good,it was easy fun and really reliable if it would've been longterm could've gotten my whole life together the job itself was a piece of cake just have to be determined
good,I was there temporarily but I enjoyed my time there & the money I made there. If I could I would apply again. But I would like for them to have more full time positions
good,"Assisted customers in finding and dressing in merchandise to try on before purchasing, cashier and opened macys/plenti points/ AMEX accounts, Cleaned dressing Rooms  (Go-Backs) Organize sales floor"
good,"For me to had just graduated high school I was making decent cash working at their warehouse. Unfortunately it was a seasonal opportunity, but I would do it again. Predictable work day, paid every week, fast paced."
good,Great entry level job for basic customer service experience. Fair management and fun coworkers. Easy to build relationships. Just be on time and do as much that needs to be done without guidance (be independent) and be yourself!
good,"My job entails working in a fast past environment in stocks rooms, filling in merchandise on the floor and unloading our home store merchandise. I also learn from this position to use an RTV scanner to check sales, markdowns and change signing. Furthermore i have learned how to do floor moves , and learn how to put together a variation of fixtures."
good,"Macys was more than meets the eye. I worked hard and advanced to a visual position. The people made Macy’s an amazing company and a great place to learn, sell, and create."
good,"Working for Macy's in Burlington, MA was very fast paced and cut throat always busy management was great but was sometime understaffed. best part was of course the employee discounts."
good,"Scheduling should be improved.  Criticizing management seems to be an easy target and the employees I work with seem to revel in doing just that.  A lot of it has to do with the quality of employees.  It's tough to get high quality employees with a limited pool, in this type of setting, at these wages. Having worked at much higher wages and now retired, I have, by working here, had my eyes opened to the types of attitudes people exhibit.  Kudos to the hiring folks.  They ain't gonna get very many high quality applicants.  I like it as a 'retirement job' but the old body...well, you know what I mean?  Macy's is a good company."
good,"Working at Macy's was about being on a team and making sure all customers were attended to. The hardest part of the job was making sure a sale stuck, it was sometimes discouraging when a customer would return a product that we would work so hard on selling to them. The best part about working for Macy's was the feeling of being part of a family even with the fragrance vendors, it was a very comfortable environment."
good,Fun but very fast paced. You have different types of customers come in every day with different problems you have to work here with training first overall it was a great job
good,I had a fun time working at Macy’s. All the new people I met to the professionals who taught me how to advance in a career. Managers were respectful and understanding. The company also gave lots of over time hours during the seasonal time too!
good,"Catered to customers very professionally environment great management team customers are always happy ,associates always meet there gold and everyone is like family"
good,As my previous work experience I learned a lot about sales. I  learned how to engage with customers and how to say the correct things. I learned how sell store products
good,"You receive 20% off purchases free training in CPR, diversity, wellness to keep health, I never worked harder in my whole career, I very much liked my coworkers and my customers"
good,"It is definitely a good place to work park-time if you are in college, and you will meet friendly people and managers. Macy’s is a nice place and offered me discounts at the store."
good,"I really enjoyed working at macys which is why I stayed so long, although I didn't get paid for what I was worth. The employees was another reason I stayed. You really can't find too many companies that have a family-like atmosphere. Today, most companies are cut throat. I don't think I will ever find another home like macy, although I am happy at my current company."
good,"Management is friendly, always greets people. Job functions are flexible and still straightforward. Scheduling is also flexible, although sometimes it can be difficult to get enough hours. People who I worked with were kind, friendly and helpful."
good,Macy's is the best place to work in the retail industry.  It is very diverse and prioritize it's employees to achieve their ideal job through continuous training in order to advance their career.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This job was one of the most fun jobs that I had. I got to kind of be my own boss because they showed you how to do things then you got to just go out and do it on your own.
good,"A typical day varied as the store began to close and went into liquidation. I went from working as a Mattress Specialist and tidying my area and learning product information and selling a product and idea to a customer to hauling mattresses into customer cars. My coworkers were all very sweet and affable and the management team really care and put forth a lot of effort. Unfortunately, the store just wasn't profitable and shut down."
good,Fun and nice working environment and I have worked with specialists. It was cherished experience. I didn't have experiences but they taught me with patience.
good,I learned that its hard to get some customer to believe in you that they can be wrong too. hardest part was when customers yelled at you for something they did
good,always fun to go to work and since we were commissioned if you didn't work you didn't make money. Never had an issue with payroll.... or schedule . enjoyed my years as an employee for Macy's. Made me feel like a member of their family
good,After you arrive and check in with how things are going you would immediately either get on the cameras or start to patrol the floor. We would take shifts between camera work and working the floor. If there was something going on we would concentrate on that as a team and work together to potentially apprehend them.
good,I loved working at Macy's!  They developed me to be a leader and gave me opportunities to utilize those skills.  It's a fast-paced environment with great people to work with.
good,"Ability to pick your own hours, with a friendly and helpful management staff that was always willing to help. Learned how to work a Point of Sale system within the first two days, with onsite training before your first day on the floor."
good,"If you do what you are told everything works out perfect.   The managers are flexible, professional and understanding.   I enjoyed working here as a sales associate during the holidays.   There is always good and bad in every job however I truly felt appreciated here and only have good things to say about them."
good,over all the Macy's culture is  steady and fast pace. As a department manager you are required to wear many hats. As a department manager who over saw cosmetics you train develop and coach future Macy's leaders who can own their own business.
good,"I think this job, as first job is amazing. I had many opportunites at macys and I made my days last there. Even if it was for a shorr period of time. The managers were incredible so there is that too."
good,"A typical day would be if I was opening, I would count the register, print out the receipt, set up the media bag, attend the daily rally.  Then, I walked through my department and would straighten out any items that needed correction."
good,Working at at Macy's was interesting. I learned a lot and applied that to my future work life and personal life. It taught me that in a completive environment you cant hesitate one second because that is a loss of sale if you do. But the veteran workers they had in the store were very helpful and encouraging
good,"Scan to clock in,Find a truck check truck and get scanner and start pulling orders. Very fast pace,as long as you do your job no one says anything to you. Everyone has there own friends or clicks.The hardest part was when we was short of work.The good part was we was off on fridays."
good,"Macy's was my first job, it was fun and very fast paced!! I worked in the women's shoes department, and it was a good experience. I learn how to connect with customers and greet them. The workplace was a healthy environment, filled with friendly associates. The hardest part would be getting a certain amount a sales needed for a day sometimes, and the most enjoyable was meeting new people, and bonuses."
good,"Nice place,friendly associates and managers,clean departments,a positive atmosphere. You have to be mobile,to do different multitask duties,beside yours actual duties."

good,"A great place to work. The people were phenomenal to work with. "
good,"I love Macy's, but the pay is too low for full time.  A lot of work, but little pay.. Management is great, and the perks are good.  You ca also get part time benefits."
good,"It was great to work for Macy's I really appreciated the good management, benefits and co-workers everyone was very helpful and willing to teach you new things. There's always something new to learn."
good,A pleasant but stressfull job around the holidays. I only worked here seasonally but all of the managers were friendly and understanding. They allow you to choose a lot of your own hours and it seems like a well oiled machine!
good,"I did enjoy my time at Macys, where everyone is kind and team work is important. Management does confide in their employees, so performance is required. Able to get things done without major supervision."
good,Macy's support team is fantastic. The employee is very hard working and supportive. The managers can critic a lot but are very understanding that their employees are human beings and things happen in people lives.
good,"My favorite shifts to work were from 11 am-4 pm when the store was at its busiest.The store held competitions for the employees. If your sales team opened the most credits, you get rewarded. Its also nice that employees get an additional 20% on anything they buy. This is on top of the Macy's credit card holder discount."
good,At Macy's I would approach customers and engage in conversation about products that were in the store. Once a customer was ready to visit the register I would educate them on the lines of credit that Macy's offers while scanning their items to purchase.
good,"Macy's has been one of my favorite jobs I have had, the management is great and the company is huge so you meet and work with all kinds of people. I feel happy and content working here but know that there is something better out there for me."
good,Great first job. Working in the shipping department was a lot of fun and very fastpase. I have nothing negative to say about this place. Just wish they payed more.
good,Where I was working as a Visual Security officer. It was great where the employees were great but when it comes to people shoplifting it was pretty bad. Like I had to stand near the door to make sure that the people that were shoplifting weren't able to walk out of the store with the items stolen. If i find any suspicious activity I had to call it to the detectives so they can watch over that person so i can stay in my spot so i can make sure that no is being suspicious.
good,"I enjoyed working as a cosmetic/fragrance sales associate at Macy's Chesapeake Square."
good,I learned how to work in a big area as well as fast paced. I better my customer service skills and teamwork skills. I also learned how to take initiative and be a leader. I am a hard worker and learn pretty fast so the job requirement was not that challenging. The managers and associates were very helpful and nice. I enjoyed working there a lot.
good,Well I worked in cosmetics department I had fun talking to customers helping trying to find solutions to customer problems as well. Macy's was best job i ever had.
good,Good place to work. They are very allow a good work/life balance. Good open door policy. Can be very stressful. Have alot of fun employee events such as chorus.
good,workplace has a familiar and friendly atmosphere staff members are helpful and generous to others great please to work.   management have open door policy and willing to help out.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's isn't a bad place to work at especially for somebody in school they are really flexible and willing to work with your schedule and needs. The only downside at Macy's  is some of the managers don't know how to speak to the associates; when there's a store review the store is always on edge but overall Macy's is an okay place to work for
good,this experience was a great experience also i learned a few new skills the company is a very respectful the managers are helpful you also can move up in the company
good,"I eventful and intellectually fulfilling, Macy made me explore new fields and strategies I didn't know I was capable of overcoming. Macy's equipped me with the necessary tools to be able to pursue my legal passions."
good,"Working on the support team, you're constantly on you're feet moving around the store making sure the store looks nice, and merchandise is up to date."
good,"Everyday was different, with different problems, loved working with people to create and improve the working environment -loved watching people enjoy coming to work and to grow and mature with the job, many rose to manage me or my managers -took pride in their successes and ultimately when the credit function was devalued"
good,"I work at the above company for 4 years, discharging, Patient menu , Inputting data entry, Feeding, Meet and great patient,  reporting & recording any changes."
good,Start with stretching exercises. Then morning meeting to determine who works were. Then we start working. I had to pack 40 items an hour. If you have problems management is available to help work though it. They are the only company that I know of that lets laborers set in on executive meetings to voice their opinions on how things are going in the facility. As for the workplace culture it is pleasant when I worked there. It was an upbeat friendly place to be. When you needed help someone would gladly help. Keeping track of time was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was trying to top my own numbers on quota. I would pride myself in the quality of my work. It had to be correct items and look nice  when it was packaged. I loved working for Macys
good,"everything is is simple, i could either sale shoes and be an expeditor. i know how to handle money right and treat costumers right. overall they have taught me everything and that is where everything started so i am grateful."
good,"A great starter job and a great 2nd job. You are able to pick up shifts online, the customers are usually fine, and there is room for growth if you choose to stay."
good,"It was an open-minded experience working to provide satisfaction for customers, and develop well communication skills with an understandable workforce. Being on the Macy's team required companionship and at the same time leadership, as taking responsibility for your own actions was key. I enjoyed meeting new people and the friendly atmosphere. The most difficult part of the job was achieving  sales during the holiday season, as the environment tend to be hectic during this time of year. I learned about time management and how to multitask, as I would achieve several tasks at once. Overall, this job opened my eyes to different career paths and working with different people."
good,"Probably one of the better jobs i personally had. The staff was always polite and courteous with their guests, they always get along, communication between team and team leaders were always 100%. Food was provided on occasion, flexible scheduling and training was very thorough. The only real challenge was finding the items the customer wanted in the backroom."
good,"A typical day at work at Macy's is making as many sales as possible. I worked in the Women's Shoes department and we had to meet a sales goal every day we came to work- which wasn't an issue for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my coworkers and the customers. They were lovely individuals and I enjoyed seeing the same faces from time to time. "
good,High quality people who enjoy working with each other.  Can do spirit and environment that values individual contributions.  Work flows easily between layers of management.
good,target was a pretty cool job . i worked in human resources so i stayed busy pretty much. i loved working with the people there and the hours were great.
good,"Upon clocking in at Macy's, my daily morning duties consisted of powering up the registers and counting the money in the till.  Next up was Fulfillment.  Checking for items in department we needed to package to be sent to a customer or another store.  Working at Macy's improved my communication skills and taught me new ways to exceed customer expectations."
good,"Providing outstanding customer service, meeting hourly sales and Star Rewards goals on a personal and departmental basis, demonstrating superior product knowledge to customers, and creating an unforgettable shopping experience. "
good,As far as macys if I could work there again I would. Or just in a department store period. I LOVED macys! The vacations were perfect and the benefits and paid for. My team was even more perfect.
good,Fast paced environment that shows employees how to deal with multiple customers. Management was helpful in many aspects of the company. The workplace is is calm but when its busy become fast paced
good,I loved working at Macy's! It was a relaxing professional business to work with. I recommend this job/career anyone who loves working with others to their fashion needs and making them have a better day while shopping. Everything was ran smoothly and in a calm collected manner. The only hardships were finding hours since I was temporary employee.
good,As a member of the visual merchandising team I am responsible for keeping mannequins as well as the sales floor updated and visually appealing to customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a support associate, I would have an early shift from 5am-2pm . That wasn't everyday but usual 8 hours. We pulled new stock out and recovered the floor to look decent before the store opened. It was a bit fast paced work because we had to complete jobs quickly. I liked the work. I am not a morning person at all either but I looked forward to going to work every day"
good,Get to actually know who you are working with. Worked with a very diverse group and felt like you belonged. Not very difficult job just had to know how to work in a veery fast pace environment during certain periods of the day.You need to have very good customer service and patience.
good,"Working at Macy, specifically the womens shoes department, helped teach me effective ways to communicate and sell to potential customers. Macys helped me further develop working independently, responsibly, and efficiently."
good,Great place to work easy job with great pay air condition clean has a good cafeteria multiple entrances lots of over time availability good managers great people and hours are flexible along with the website that allows you to swap and give up shifts
good,Basically build your own schedule. Sometimes it can be very overwhelming when short staffed. You might need to wait for your break because it is busy.
good,"At work I was always busy, since I always give it my all at my job sometime I would give to much that I would end up doing extra work .I learned a lot about clothe. I enjoy working everyday specially when I was busy but they hardly ever had hours and that was the reason I quit."
good,"Its a nice work for college students and I like the past 3 years working in the store. But, the security is so bad for the workers. Are layers for take you out."
good,This is one of the easiest jobs in the world. You help organize the store and help customers. You process inventory every three months. The team building workshops are awesome!
good,"This was my first position in the security field."
good,"No pressure to make daily sales goals. Management was easy to get along with and were professional. Great place to work, need to raise their wages though. Online work schedule software was wonderful."
good,"It was fun not too bad. I worked a lot but didn't feel like I was getting paid for working. I was always called in and was glad to help out just wish I'd seen it on my paychecks."
good,"The hardest part of working at Macy's is learning the job because policies and procedures do change overtime. The training is not very thorough, but the work is pretty straight forward. I feel that Macy's is a great place to work if you are seasonal or just getting out into the work field. You gain customer service skills as well as learn to work as in a team. As long as you do the work, you are pretty secure in your position."
good,Every day is different in terms of customers and challenges you're faced with. Demanding sales goals. Management is helpful but they don't micromanage so you have the autonomy to make your own decisions.
good,Good Working environment but I only got 4hrs per 2 weeks after 1 month of work. They keep you employed but wont give you any hours and you'll have to keep looking for shifts. The workplace is good though
good,"I have work for Macy's several times, there are so many opportunities for advancement. Its a great seasonal job for the holidays with perks. You work with a variety of different ages, from seniors to college students. Macy's is big on giving back to the community."
good,"Macys.Com is easily one of the best places I've ever worked. From work/life balance to the actual office space itself, it is an amazing place to grow and show off your skillset to the best of your ability. The sky's the limit here! If you have a great idea, nobody will block you or try to politically usurp you. It's also great if you're a late-riser, as most people usually roll in around 10:30-11:00am."
good,"Receive and put away packages that were unloaded from the dock.I learned to drive a fork lift and pallet jack. Management was great and very helpful. Everyone was sociable and team players. The hard part was dealing with the weather, hot and cold. The best part was my co-workers and the picnic."
good,Some co associate are not fully concentrate on thier workplace..some are..supervidors seems not aware with those associate..i niticed caused cause i observe. I like sales its my passion but i prefer  working home with elderly became my new passion im concern about health of someone n.myself too ive learned a.lot thru experienced with different illnesses
good,"This was a good seasonal job. I basically was on my own during the evening, but when I needed assistance there was always someone there."
good,"Working at Macy's, I made lifelong friends and I was apart of a family. Management was good and if there was ever a problem, it never got out of hand. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,started as a sales assoc. for ladies sportswear and worked up to cosmetic counter manger for Lancôme was there for 5 years love it learned how to apply products and technique and teaching customers as well as daily numbers and sales goals to move the company to a rank high than when I first started .
good,"Macy's cosmetics was very diverse and offered different services and products for every type of customer from the prestige type to the young and influential crowd. the cosmetics department was able to keep up with current trends and made the services available by providing the proper training for employees. "
good,"The working environment was amazing, everybody & everything was very well organized. The hardest part for me in the beginning was my speed but training improved those skills for me. I learned allot from Macy's as far as dealing with customers and computers."
good,the work is very easy and the days go by quickly if you focus on whats in front of you. I wouldn't mind working for the company again or recommending it as a good job to start with.
good,"Working on the ""flex"" team meant that my schedule was flexible. Basically, I made my own schedule from open shifts. This was good at first when there were lots of open shifts, but it soon became more scarce since most of the time you had to rely on someone changing their shift or calling in sick. It became too flexible and there were times I would log in to my schedule everyday to find any available shift to pick up."
good,I learned about my coworkers and their religions and how they live. Languages they speak and even tried foods from Russia and Spain. My coworkers were the best part of working there. They were so nice and helpful all the time. Management was okay. As an on call employee we didn't really have a direct manager. We just checked in with HR and either went to work in the same department as the day before or were sent to another department. The hardest part of work for me was dressing and undressing the mannequins. Still can't do that properly to this day. Another hard part was sometimes working for 14 straight hours. Basically I loved working there but was laid off since it was only a seasonal job. I wouldn't mind going back. (I worked at the one in the Water Tower).
good,Building a clientele in a tourist location was challenging. Team group was awesome. getting commission on top of base pay was awesome. Making sales goals on a slow day was challenging that's why you have to book appointments and build relationships with customers.
good,"Macy's is a great place to work. I always have something to do. Teaching new staff, meeting great customers and a wounderful selection of merchandise to work with."
good,I am a part time seasonal sales associate and I love it from time to time. The scheduling does suck though. It gets busy on days of big sales. Always remember most coupons do NOT work of designer clothing and some customers seem to not understand that. I gets aggravating.
good,Its was great working there. I enjoyed the working pace but managment was not what i expected. Communication was lacking with my scheduele and it took over a month for them to finally fix it.
good,learning customers personalities by helping them chose different products within the company to satisfy their liking gave me the ability to learn customers personalities
good,"This was a good job overall. I learned a lot about customer service, sales and how to handle difficult people. "
good,"Every day was a learning curve at the Macy's Parade Studio.  Your coworkers, and even management, made you feel at home just like you are a part of a family.  The best part about working for the Studio was the daily challenge.  You never had the same job twice and you can work in many mediums along the way.  Management was great at finding your skills and even allowed you to step out of you comfort zone to learn new avenues.  Along the way I was able to learn how to weld aluminum, steel, and even how to fix large helium balloons and much more."
good,"The company takes really good care of their employees, along with an amazing management team, you get a successful counter! Every person in a management position was always supportive and made sure we were taken care of. The only issue was the flexibility with you schedule can be conflicting. But, if I could, I would definitely go back."
good,"Had a great experience. "
good,"Productive and fun place to work.                                                                                                                "
good,Management is helpful.  Everyone has a smile on their faces.  We are supported and empowered to help the customer.  Management believes in and encourages their employees.  You are not guaranteed a set schedule.  That is a drawback.  They do foster growth for employees. Christmas season can be rough as hours get long.
good,"I worked mainly in the luggage department so a typical day at work was selling luggage and other merchandise in hopes of achieving my sales goal. I learned to persuade customers into buying certain types of luggage and the importance working on commission. My manager was awesome! I got along with most of my co-workers but there was this one co-worker that I didn't seem to get along with. All in all it was like dog eat dog working here because we all work based off commission and we all were trying to reach are sales goal. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was reaching my sales goal, not because I couldn't sale but because the luggage department didn't get heavy traffic flow as apparel would. The most enjoyable part of my job was when customers actually appreciate the help you gave them and put out a good word for you."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The people you work with are the worst but the job itself is extremely easy. Cross training in other departments is a must so you aren't stuck in the same department every day. the shifts are long but working 3 days and being off 4 is the best
good,"Good starter job for someone looking for part time at above minimal wage. We pull boxes off the truck, and would hang all the clothes. My manager was a nice guy, very informative and helpful. Coworkers were the same way."
good,I was very lucky to have a Manager that allows to me to grow. I given many many opportunities to exchange ideas. One of my best work experiences.
good,"When I was employed at Macy's a typical day at work for me consisted of, assisting customers, working the register and making sure things ran smoothly in the department I was assigned to. From my past experience working at Macy's I've learned how to be patient and on top of my daily tasks. The co-workers at my previous job helped one another and always remained calm and respectful towards fellow co-workers and customers. The hardest part of my job was being able to help customers while answering phone calls of other customers who needed online assistance through the store's website. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking on certain tasks and assisting customers."
good,I've only worked at Macy's for a summer and it was great. They are very flexible with their schduling if you are part-time/flex. Some co-workers with experience in my field were generous enough to share their connections with me.
good,the hardest part of the job was unloading freight into such a small work area but also made it fun and challenging. sometimes if we had a good week the manager would order papa johns or bring in a pot of chili
good,A typical day was assisting customers with taking payments by phone. I learned everyone don't like to be reminded they have an over due bill. Management was there to make sure we gave outstanding customer service. My co-workers where helpful with letting you know about updated memos if you came in after their schedule shift. The hardest part of the job was not taking being called out of your name personal. The most enjoyable part was it was like a big family.
good,Macy's is flexible when it comes to your hours to work. The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself busy when there aren't too many customers around. The most enjoyable part is when you can take a lunch after working hard.
good,Awesome place loved working here had great energy great consumers and all around great vibes enjoyable. Coworkers was great and always supportive of actions. Just a great experience and hard work was always a great feel.
good,"Is a place with a good working enviroment, excellents co-workers and Supervisors. Maybe the job hours are something strange, but it is a job that can be done easily, in addition to co-workers and customers make the day more enjoyable."
good,"Enjoyed my  seasonal job a Macy's with it's ""family environment"" and professional approach. Only thing displeased about was the organization of the store and their attitude to keep employees that do not work as had as they should. Advancement opportunities a plus."
good,The environment was very inviting. Everyone was very open up to new employees and they welcomed you with open arms. It was easy to get along with other employers and the work environment itself was not as hard because everyone was very helpful around you.
good,"Macy's does a lot to help train, develop, and assist every employee of the company. Macy's also does well on giving back to the community."
good,"At Macy's I was allowed to pick up any available shifts and make my own schedule. I would be able to choose my department every time I worked and gained knowledge working with every manager, department, and shift by the end of my time working there. The managers were very helpful and available as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was being able to handle large crowds of customers at once. The most enjoyable part was being able to learn able the newest trends and products before other people."
good,Overall it's a good place to work. I am just ready for something different and something that can benefit me better. And with a lot of Macy's closing down it kinda makes me nervous to stay
good,In general I enjoyed Macy's. The company culture was great and most of my Managers were too. The only difficulties I had were the pressure of the card applications and the coupons not always working. Returns in general were pretty easy to take care of and maybe I'll work for them again in the future
good,hard work but great place to work on the job training and can move up the ladder fast as long as you work hard and show up on time and do what they tell you to do
good,"Macys is always growing and developing as a company. "
good,"call center environment "
good,"co-workers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"At this company, thejob was very productive. Great team members. Great hours but less pay. Even though the pay was not up to my advantage, I was able to do more then 25 hours to make atleast a decent amount."
good,The environment is very fun and professional.You meet many different people from different cultures and backgrounds.
good,Well this was one of my first serious job... What I learned was how important it is to speak up if you do not know something. How important it is to be aware of your surrounding (I worked in a really big Macy's).
good,"computer skills IE: Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint"
good,Typical work days were assisting customers or working the sales floor. Learned to work together and come together as a team is a lot less work that's so smooth. Co-workers worked as a great team as well as management. Maybe early shifts sometimes were sometimes hard because of less employees and having truck deliveries. The  return of seasonal help each year was an enjoyable part of the job.
good,So far i enjoy working there. the idea of working as team  and meeting new people expands my networking skills allows us to gets a lot of work done as a group  considering we do move and work at a fast pace because we work with a high inventory considering g its the biggest retail department store in the world  but its easy to mange. I feel working here would expand my knowledge in the fashion industry because of the many fashion  brands i work with day in and day out
good,"My managers were always very kind, and willing to offer their help. There were always competitions, and ways to earn macy's money, or gift cards. I sometimes didn't appreciate the constant pressure to sell Macy's Credit Cards, but overall I did enjoy the job itsself. However after a year or so I became bored with the job, because I'm so used to fast-paced waitressing."
good,The job was a very fun and friendly environment. The management and co-workers were very nice. It was nice working and helping customers
good,"Enjoyed working for Macy's. I was employeed with them over 23 years before retiring and moving to St. Augustine."
good,Trains sales associate on how to perform great customer service. Provides great discounts for their employees as well as benefits. A professional and fun place to work and make clients.
good,"I've worked with the company as a part-time employee, aside my fulltime job as an educator in a classroom settings."
good,"A typical day was greeting guests constantly. Informing them of sales and special events! Checking sale goals for the day, organizing shelves and restocking displays. Making and closing sales with customers."
good,Great place to work for benefits and advancement in your career life. Have to be able to multi-task  and make required numbers set by management.
good,A typical day working at Macy's would be very productive and client based. The management team at the store I worked at were very knowledgeable in their job and informing employees on how to better perfect their job.
good,"On a typical day as a sales associate, I would take care of customers who were looking for specific merchandise. My manager was extremely helpful when I first started. She quickly showed me around the store, and I learned the lay of the land. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for 8-10 hours at a time. I was working during the Holiday Season, which was extremely hectic, but very rewarding when helping customers find perfect presents for loved ones."
good,"A typical day at Macy's was assisting customers, opening or closing the register, mark downs and mark ups, cleaning the fitting rooms and restoring the merchandise. I learned how to assist customers and how to properly deal with money. There were so many workers that I only knew a few but they were all nice at morning meetings. Hardest part of the job was shipment and inventory."
good,"A typical day at work will start off with our supervisors assigning us 2-4 trucks to load up, co-workers were all on the same page the hardest part of the job were when your lines get backed up and you have to clear it before your other lines get backed up"
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually restocking items, putting away new items that have been prepped and ready to put away."
good,"Flexible Schedule - You choose your own hours online. You can swap and cover shifts online too. It's very convenient."
good,You get the best training at Macys when it come to Customer Service. I did learn a lot of transferable skills to use outside of the company so I would definitely recommend Macys as a good employer. I like the environment and that kept me there so many years. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers everyday but it's rewarding when u can solve their problems.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to work at Macy's. I met a lot of new people and I got to give customers my feedback on the items they wanted to buy.
good,"I had great days at Macy's, some were okay due to the holidays. I've always had help when I needed it. My co-workers all had positive attitudes when they were working."
good,"Came in got right to helping customers , with their shopping items, or locating a section in the store. I also sold the macy's card to our customers , explaining to them the benefits and advantages. Light clean up and closing our register at end of night shift."
good,its a good place to work but sometimes make you do stuff doesnt relate to the job. I'll recommend. Pay is good and get paid every week.
good,"I started at Mac‘s as seasonal employee at ""Mens Department""."
good,"Macys does not require experience so, it is good for people who are seeking job with little or no experience. Timings are flexible and availability can be changed 2 times a year. They have the employee room with refrigerator, microwave oven and vending machines but it needs to have a cafeteria for employees. I have gained a lot of customer service experience there. i nave learned cash handling. Managers are cooperative, pleasant and ready to listen to us."
good,This job was very fun and also educational for me as I was able to expand my sales experience. The managers and co-workers were all very friendly and very willing to help whenever I was in need of it. The hardest part of the job was probably learning their register system. The most enjoyable part of the job I found was being able to expand my knowledge in fashion while helping customers and helping them look fantastic in what they were wearing or what to wear with a particular outfit.
good,"I loved working in the stockroom. It's a position that demands both teamwork skills and working completely unsupervised work skills. It's a job that you had to get up early the morning for, but I had to problem with that."
good,"While meeting sales goals was important there were many other job duties which took away from focusing on this. Cleaning, stock, and general customer service made it very difficult to focus on commission based sales."
good,Began working as store recruiter and was given an opportunity to recruit using Community Work Readiness sites to achieve low vacancy rate.
good,"I assisted customers with finding shoes and assured they left the store happy. I loved the management because my manager left us to complete our jobs and was not over our shoulders just watching us. I would say the hardest part of the job was telling customers we didn't have a shoe in their size but they could order it online because I did not want to have an unsatisfied customer. The most enjoyable part was working because it did not seem like work, my co-workers were fun and full of life and that made the job easier."
good,"My typical day at work is that I would come in and the first thing I do is go into the human resource center and ask them what area am I working in. When I find out what area I am working in they would take me there and have someone teach me what I am suppose to do. I learned how to fold the clothes properly when I put them on the display table since that is the first thing the customers will see. I also learned how to put clothes back on the racks, put them in size order, and learned which area the clothes go in. I even learned how to clear out the dressing room since the guests sometimes don't bring out the clothes with them. When I was not working in clothes I would work in handbags, fragrance, or shoes. The hardest part was for me to adapt to a new area each day doing something different but I was a fast learner and understood what I was doing. The co-workers are nice and very friendly and would help you if you have no clue what you are doing."
good,Really good job that also helped work with my schedule. They paid every week which was really good and when they had hours they really gave what they could.
good,"I pull daily reports and go over the days, week and months staffing."
good,High volume call center. Management is very supportive and resourceful. Typical day includes call resolution and follow up. Easy going work environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting results. The hardest part of the job is creating solutions to issues that satisfies the client while meeting compliance. This job allow for the highest flexibility in work functions and I learned a wealth of fashion knowledge.
good,"Usually a typical day at work is you clock-in, head to your department, and assist and customers who would be in need of assistance. If they didn't need help then i would spend a bit of time fixing up clothing fixtures on racks, or tables, organizing them to an acceptable appearance."
good,"Assist customers, greet store patrons, provide product knowledge, directing customers to fitting rooms, and completing transactions on the cash register. Follow all safety and loss prevention protocols outlined by the corporate offices."
good,Just like any retail job you work the register and clean your area. The hardest part was convincing the customers into getting a Macy's card and also keeping up with your sales goal especially when you work in a slow paced mall. There are some coworkers that are very territorial and will not take kindly when you're in their department. With in my department though everyone was kind and I even made friends working in the men's department. Working here was my first job and I stupidly took advantaged of the point system our attendance system had and was late all the time so I got fired. What a shame.
good,"The enjoyable part of the job is when I assist a customer and added an additional discount, which always bring a smile to my customer's face, they always look for me every time we have our weekly sales. Knowing the fact that helping one customer with their purchases can make a differences to the store, they always feel the magic of Macy's when they enter through our doors. They share with their experience with their families and friends and soon you know it, our floor is filled with customers which they are eager to shop for the holidays. I love seeing our old regular every week and it's a thrill once we have our biggest sales of the seasons."
good,It was a really nice place to work i enjoy working in the public. Management was like family if i didn't choose to go to school full time I will still be their.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Great place and people!"
good,"Typical day,Set goals, touch base with each counsultant on their goal,merchandising,touchbase each hour with consultant to make sure on track o make the days sales goal coach and develop team.The most enjoyable part of my job is my team and creating great skin and  color for everyone!"
good,"helping  people  to benefit with my skills, making the costumers feel gr eat about themselves"
good,I enjoyed working at Macys. I was able to meet lots of different and wonderful people. I was able to set my own shedule and pick up extra hours when I wanted them. It was however at times to get hours at slow times or meet my sales goal on certain days. When the store was slow and didn't have a lot of customers at the time.The customers were always very friendly and polite. The company really cared about their employees and did a lot of great work helping out different local charities. I would wake up each day for work and actually be able to get dressed up in my own clothes and not a company uniform.
good,"I would clock in and find out what department I was working in from management, open/close the register,straighten clothes, assist the customer, answer questions, and take bill payments. I learned how to professionally give better customer service, handle complaints at the register, keep the customer smiling and feeling better about their shopping trip. Management was helpful when you needed it, showed compliance, and worked just as hard as everyone else. My co-workers were wonderful to work with, fun, and made an effort to get to know you. The hardest part for me was keeping the sales that were going on straight. the most enjoyable was making sure the customer happy, satisfied, and wanting to come back to our store."
good,"It was a nice place to work but it does't pay very well. "
good,"A good job, but was only temp. Nothing too difficult co-workers were very friendly."
good,"it a ok place to work. what can you say, it is retail.  It is going to be tough on your family, especially on holidays,"
good,"Working at Macy's, was a great opportunity.  The environment was energetic, and constantly challenging the employees, to better themselves."
good,"Everyday was some different but very still the same as any other day, we alway would met up and setup what we would be doing in our department that day. Everything was pretty much scheduled for what we nedded to get done that day and also at the same time help our customers with what they needed. This also helps us keep our stores goal up! The management and co-workers were both alike and all very nice and very helping with every! They all were a great team through the holliday season. The hardest part would have been some of the crazy sales we would have, One was just rough but things turned out ok. My favorite thing I loved about this job was the regular customers that would be in almost everyday in our department! They were a joy to see and talk with."
good,"It was a good place to work. I really liked it. They gave me a lot support."
good,Great place to work.  The employees are friendly and the management pushes you.  You need to keep up on you sales goals or you can fall behind.
good,"Cosmetics counter manager  training and developing employees.Setting daily,weekly, goals"
good,great leadership. great place to work. I enjoyed working there.
good,"Seasonal position where i would keep the sales floor clean, help customers, and ring up purchases"
good,"Great start for me to find my career opportunities."
good,Its absolutely fun working at Macy's and meeting different customers everyday. Loving and caring co-workers.  You just have to do your job with honesty and sincerity. I wouldnt have left my job if my husband was not relocating.
good,Great job I learned  how to interact with others my co-workers where friendly and easy going. The managers and office personnel help me with any issue I had. The HR help me step by step on how Macys can contribute to my personal life and family.
good,Either it would be going in the morning shift or the afternoon shift. All would depend on witch one you would be assigned for the day. First thing that needed to be done as soon as you would get there in the mornings would be counting money inside register and if it was the afternoon shift it would be to count the money of what was going to stay in the register for the next day. A big priority was to meet our sale goals for the day. Very important. Meet and greet clients was important too.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Great company, politics of retail are there, definitely a good place to work. Benefits are great, people are amazing here, but career advancement is not there"
good,"(Fair Oaks Mall).  Served customers by helping them find clothing, answering questions, tag merchandise, take inventory, etc in various deportments such as children’s and women’s clothing.  Currently work in the cosmetics deportment at the Origins counter.

good,"I liked meeting sales/credit goals, because youre actually rewarded and theyre fun. The people you work with are enjoyable."
good,"Loved going into work everyday, but sometimes i felt too stressed"
good,a typical day is fast paced and you need to be able to meet commission/sales goal standards and open at least 12 loyalty accounts a month consistently.   management is good at coaching you to improve.the hardest part of the job is consistently making sales/commission goals since business in the retail industry is not consistent!  the best part of the job is interacting with my co-workers and customers.
good,"A typical day was fast pace, which taught me accuracy, there was little room for mistakes.  I also became familiar with customer service representation which I enjoyed."
good,I had fun working there and meeting new people and knowing the latest styles that's out.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Macy's. "
good,I liked working for this company because management really worked well with scheduling and time off..... they were very supportive and have a lot of interest in the well being of their employees..... I woked in womens shoes and the core area which included costume jewelry and hosiery.... also sold Handbags and loved my job.... due to health issues I had to take some time off
good,Working at Macy's is a very great experience. I love the management there when u can't seem to close a sale. the hardest part of the job is having to do a quota.
good,"Sometimes I have early hours where I have to come in before the store opens. I have to open the safes, and count all countable jewelry. other times, I have to stay until closing time which involves counting all the jewelry once again, and the money collected that day. When we have new shipment, I love looking at the new pieces. The hardest part of the job would be when business is slow and we have to stand around and pass time. My co-workers are all great and very friendly. We also just got a new manager which I am helping train. The only other things I don't quite enjoy about my job is when we hire new employees, I have to train them and the low amount of pay. Other than that, I love my job and what i do."
good,This company has extensive training in Customer Service that has proven to grow sale by the billions since the 1800's.
good,"I sold womens shoes and helped them find that pair of shoes they searched everywhere and were excited to buy. I made sure everyone stayed happy and found what they were looking for and had people come back weeks later and telling me how much they loved the shoes I found them and that they wanted another pair. I enjoyed making people happy. I leanrned how to tell what kind of shoes people would like and how to make a good sale. The management was poor, they had favorite employees and would allow them to sit in the back their entire shift and majority of the time the manager would leave the floor. Some of my co-workers were very nice while others would try to get you fired or get others fired. It reminded me of Highschool drama. The hardest part of work was picking up my co-workers duties when I had plenty of my own."
good,"In a typical day if I have a shift  in the morning first thing I do to get ready for the morning rally which I join with the sales managers and associates.So I print all the necessary reports for the rally.After the rally I do the cash office. Preparing the money from the day before for the bank. I need to make sure that there is no shortage or overage in the vault. If there is I have to find out where it is coming from and send an e-mail for the necessary people. I check the registers if they need any change. I replenish the registers if they need the change.After I am done with the cash office I go back to the executive office and see if there is any new hires scheduled for the day. If so, I do introduce myself in a professional manner and start on boarding and doing their new hire paperworks and the training which takes couple hours like 6-7. During their training I answer all the incoming calls from the customers and employees and try to assist them through the phone either on the sales floor.I assist the Hr Manager as an Hr liaison with transfers,open positions,resignations and terminations an so on. I facilitate the interview process such as preparing the applications and disposition them. And there are some other operational and administrative duties that I am responsible for such as putting a work order or organizing the executive office. I learned mostly about human resources, how to work professionally  in a corporate company, how to act as a leader, loyalty and dedication. Management is shortly perfect. I love all my managers. They are all ready to help me anytime"
good,"Overall it has been a pleasure to work at Macy's. Right now I would like to move on into something that is more challenging and  rewarding! My coworkers have been great and friendly at all times. There is no hard part about this job besides being a very seasonal workplace and the work load is unevenly distributed. However, seasons make a difference in routines and that creates an enjoyable environment!!!"
good,"I enjoy the actual cosmetic job. Macys can be a tough company. As long as you meet your counter's goals and Macy's goals, you'll have no problems."
good,"Macys is a very experienced and well established organization that accommodates quite well to its associates when and where it can. Management treats all members of their team fairly and to the same expectation. Customer facing and fast paced business, Macys in most cases is always in need readjusting to meet new needs and changing the needs of others. This produces new roles, jobs, and responsibly that spark internal and external opportunity to advance and be recognized. Good benefits and very flexible schedules made for happy employees. Down side is retail business is often in high demand during holidays and don’t allow much room for family time on those days of the year."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is when my customers leave the place with complete satisfaction and next time they make sure that they find me in the store for their assistance!
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I like Macy's there flexible and management is great i love the customers and my associates
good,They were very nice and a good company to work for. Enjoyed the experience gained there
good,"Management works well with the employees."
good,"Every day I would work with customers in customer service capacity.  I learned how to operate a cash register, process returns and exchanges, process payments and complete sales transactions. Management was very helpful and patient. My co-workers were also very helpful. A challenge was difficult customers but that didn't interfere with my high level of customer service and patience. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team-oriented environment."
good,Best factor of Macy's is the ability to work a flexible online schedule where employees freely pick up and give away shifts.
good,"They were organized. In touch with the employees, keep us motivated to sale. I really enjoyed the way management interacted with us with little games and prizes to drive sales and push us to our highest potential"
good,"Very busy, fast paced great environment and fashion forward. Returns and complains but very nice outgoing co workers. management was on call at all times willing to help,"
good,"-Fair pay"
good,sign in check area get supplies for the day and prepare your are for work. Meet and greet customers show merchandise and help them choose what is best. call credit to fix credit problems or get credit for customers.
good,"Macy's is a great place to work at, the employers and employees are great to work with."
good,I loved working for Macy's and only wish I had the foresight not to leave.
good,Working here is easy if you like working with many different types of people. The days and nights are busy a lot of traffic and questions being asked.
good,"my job was to put clothes on the rack and help out with customers. I love working at macy's because they know how to please their costomer and keep them satisfied. my co worker at macy's our very friendly. we talked about how can improve as work to make the customer fill more comfortable. The hardest part of the job is trying to please people all at once, But nothing makes me fill more better then to see another person happy. The most enjoyible pat of the job is to ineract with people with different cultures and backround."
good,"Collect payment's from good customer's, who love to be assisted on their accounts."
good,"Great place to work, good coworkers that provide a little competition, amazing managers that really know how to help you step up your game and get the most out of your job."
good,It's a fun place to work. I enjoy the atmosphere and the positive culture.
good,"Many tasks are repeated everyday, but there is always an element of spontaneity in this job. I've learned a lot about retail and business and how to interact with various members of a corporation. My co-workers are one of my favorite things about working at Macy's Galleria at Pittsburgh Mils. Sometimes it is difficult to manage all the job responsibilities but with my staff I know I can get my work completed timely and accurately."
good,"This job has brought me out of my shell, opened me up to new oportunities and made me a more confident and outgoing individual. It is the best, out of the three jobs that I have had and I wish to stay there for a long time. Because of my position I am currently not getting enough hours so I am looking for another job on the side."
good,"You will constantly have work to do on a daily basis. The work is not hard, but it could get pretty tiring after awhile. The co-workers are great, very lively people. You constantly build great relationships with different customers each day."
good,It is rewarding to be able to assist customers everyday and get feedback from them that is positive and/or a learning experience to improve customer relations. I gained so much product knowledge everyday because the merchandise changes often. I learn so much from listening to customers that makes my job easier and enjoyable. My co-workers and I work together well to help each other learn about new merchandise that comes in to sell. The hardest part is trying to keep up to date on new products so you can tell your customers and keeping a full stock available on the selling floor. It's fun to work with management because they provide support and teach you how to keep customers satisfied with their shopping experience.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"At the start of some days I would help open the store. I would get everything ready at the counter and on the floor. I learned how to deal and interact with a variety of different people. The management was professional and polite, and helped me out in my first few weeks. My coworkers were very competitive and we always were trying to compete with each other to get more sales. The best part of the job was making people happy."
good,I enjoyed working here although it was only for a short period of time. My managers were communicative with me and set team goals as well as clear instructions and direction for reaching them. The workplace environment was friendly and diverse and I got along really well with my co-workers. I would have loved to work longer and moved up in the company if I was given the opportunity.
good,"I normally had to be into work by 7am until 3pm. It was very exciting, I learned to dress managins."
good,Can be dragging if you don't keep yourself busy. I've learned how to make sales by listening to what customers want and favorite aspects of a certain object or clothing. Management is friendly and shows plenty leadership. Co workers are friendly and self motivated to encourage others to make better sales. Hardest part is keeping clothes neat and folded on a busy day. Most enjoyable part would be knowing you connected with what the customers want and knowing they'll come back.
good,A typical day at work involved competitive selling. I learned about the customers and what they wanted not what I wanted to sell. Management did a good job of handling problems and dealing with customer complaints.
good,"it wasn't my career ,it was just job for me .every thing was good good management,good environment,good co workers but as i said before it was just temporary job for me ,it wasn't my future."
good,"My short tenure at Macy's opened a new lifestyle and culture. How and when to dress for occasion was only a small nature of what I learned. At first, I had a hard time learning the science of the job but i eventually grew accustomed to it. My coworkers taught me how to be opportunist and when and when not to be eager. Even though when I left for my leadership program at NCCU, i didn't feel that the job suited me, I eventually grew to be thankful for it afterwards."
good,productive workplace had a flexible schedule easy environment
good,"As a merchandiser, I was required to be there long before the store opened in order to move or change displays."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work, I use my creativity everyday."
good,• Work with 15 sales professionals
good,"I went to work and just had to get through the shift. There was no customer interaction, nor much of any fellow employee interaction for that matter. I didn't feel as though this job challenged me or allowed me to expand my skills."
good,"My daily routine of working would be to clock-in and make sure to check the fitting rooms and clothing rack by the register to make sure everything is clean and put away. If there aren't any customers check over the sales floor to see if there are any ""bald spots"" where I can fill with clothes from the stock room. As well as assiting customers with any help, questions they have or need which is the most enjoyable part of the job, seeing how happily satisfied they are. I also like the friendly environment the job provided for me because it's very easy to get along with other co-workers and managers as well and we all help each other in some way if we are having trouble. Overall working here taught me a lot about what it really is to work in retail and even though it was a little hard for me at the beggining I truly enjoyed working for such an enjoyable company."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering customer's questions such as where certain designer clothing is located, and whether are not certain items are on sale. Sometimes I would work the cashier if one of the cashiers were sick. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers, but at the same time that would be the most enjoyable part of the job because it would challenge my skills as a Sales Associate"
good,"I have worked for Foley's for three different times; Christmas extras, once before I married, and again in 2000. I have always loved Foley's as a Texas based company; it was an extrodinary company back in the day. Selling Services took time to teach you how to ring, assist customers, or how not to assist customers, but to be there when they were asking a question, or were ready to pay for their merchandise, I loved Foley's also because they mostly didn't have many commissioned sales departments. You were trained to handle all types of situations, by Selling Services; and if you couldn' t get in touch with them, there was always a notebook at all registers with proceedures for all transactions for that department. I even rang up a contract sale by using one of these books. They would even retrain people if need be; they had pride, ""The customer was always right."""
good,It is very exciting to work with Macy's because i got the chance to interact with new people everyday. I had a goal everyday in which i would challenge myself to make before i go home. The managers are respectful and understanding. This is a job in which you have the ability to expand within the company. With this job i learned how to muli-task between customers and managers. I would have to say the most challenging part was to make the goal but if i didn't make it one day the next day i would double my goal to make up for the previous day. The best thing about the job is the multiple personalities you meet from the managers right down to the associates.
good,"I enjoyed working at macys, they thought me alot about the work force. They have excellent managment, my coworker were awesome, the hardest part about the job was going home, and the best part was going in."
good,I learned how to feel comfortable on the cash register even with the pressure of several inpatient customers in line. I also learned how use my out going skills to draw in customers and assist them in the selling process.
good,I held many postions with this company and enjoyed them all. I think everyone should work retail at least oncein their life.
good,In general Macy's was a great company to work for. Creating a work schedule is very simple and allows a strong work/life balance. The management at the Palo Alto Macy's was slightly disorganized as far as taking long amounts of time to respond to urgent issues regarding customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A very tight knit group. Employees are always able to find a way to balance the work schedule with their everyday lives.
good,"Macy's is a great place to work for. As a Sale Associate it was a great experiance, you have the feeling of earning what you work for, and also having alot of great benefits for being an employee."
good,"Macy's is known as an expensive department store, but for what it's worth, it's worth every penny. Working with Macy's have given me the opporunity to not only learn new things, but I also met new people who were always so willing to help when I needed. It is a lot of friendly service there and they treat you like they would want to be treated; with the upmost respect."
good,"fun, exciting, fresh and stylish. After working for a short period time they will see your potential and skills and possibly get promoted."
good,I like what I do and I have a whole new perspective on how retail works behind the scenes.  I enjoy the people I work with and it is a very friendly environment.
good,The job was fun it wasn’t that busy only on certain days it would be I would work there again if it wasn’t for football and my other school works but I recommend people should work there
good,"some of their rules are contradictory since the management says one thing but the rules would claim something else, it seems it all depends of whom is working that day and what they think is best."
good,"Macys is a positive environment, which you can grow and they are supportive of your aspirations. Most enjoyable part of job is the customer, second is the co-workers. The workload was sometimes overwhelming, however you had support from company to do what was necessary."
good,"Do your job , come to work , communication is the key , no stealing work hard also it’s very good to have good customer service customers like that so do the colleagues"
good,"-I like working in Macy’s. I always manage well under high pressure work environment."
good,"I really enjoyed working , my colleagues & management were great & supportive. Overall culture is good & I was given time for my religious acts during our holy month of Ramadan."
good,The experience was not bad at all. Everyone is nice and hard working and the environment was friendly. Everything is fair and everyone is respectful.  The salary was a bit low wished I had it up a little more but over it’s not a bad place and I’d recommend working there if your just starting out like I did.
good,"Enjoyable environment. Must be dependable and focused on your tasks. As with most retailers there are extended hours beginning with the 4th quarter of business.  Working the extended shifts can be taxing on your routine schedule. However, this is also an opportunity for those driven to boost their take home pay."
good,I had loved working at my location and I still would probably be working there if the location hadn't closed. The pay was a little lower than I expected but it made up for it in the culture and experience I got.
good,"What I loved about Macy's was the encouragement from coworkers and managers. Working there in the shoe department I got to learn a lot about merchandising. It was also great to meet the different brands vendors who would come in and take pictures of the displays, and being able to learn about the designers."
good,I could pick up shifts in any area of the store really easily. I could give away shifts that conflicted with my personal life just as easily. It isn't a difficult job in general.
good,"Arrive at work, clock in, check goals for the day, customer service, check area, sales floor, walk around area to make it seem like you were doing something, restock, help customers who come to your area."
good,"Macy's warehouse is any typical warehouse job. Friendly environment, steady pace work. Management could be a little better. Hardest part of the job is when there is no work. You will enjoy everything overall."
good,It was good working for Macy's good health care good staff good management just wanted better salary because I also reach my sales gold always driving sales etc.
good,"Perfect for the person truly interested in makeup. Learning to match foundation shades, give advice on the proper skin care. Able to cross-sell across the department. There is always something to do; clean, organize, help customers. Have to have confidence in what you are doing, what you are selling or the customer will not take you seriously."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was a seasonal sales associate and the flexibility of the job was amazing. You have to check online for the scheduling and choose the days you will come in. The only down side was that most of the time there was no openings in my department making me have almost no hours to work in and leaving me in need to look for another job. But  considering it was my first job and I was a seasonal sales associate I don't think it is that bad. But maybe for a full time employee, it will be problematic."
good,"working for Macy's was fun at first but it was very cold some days plus standing on our feet all day made my toes numb.  we were  able to have a 45 min lunch break,and management treated me good."
good,"Macy's has competitive pay, flex hours and good benefits. Macy's has core behaviors that truly engage and align the employee with the customer. Most employees have a minimum longevity of three years and as high as thirty-five years."
good,MY only honest complaint are the random (but definitely not rare) snobby high maintenance customers. There are amazing people to work with at macys and even more amazing management.
good,"The people there were really nice always happy ,and nice to be around.Some days they would let you listen to music while you walked around and picked."
good,"Perfect for college student and beauty enthusiasts..commission, holiday pay, uniforms, all training and schooling provided. Great way to learn how to sell product or speak publically."
good,Need more hours to work but overall good place to work. Has lots of room and lots of merchandise so is always busy and with make sure u have something to do and gets a brake ever 5-6 hours of working
good,"Macy's was a nice place to work, it wasn't a good career, but it got me through school. I enjoyed being there and never had a problem with a manager or a coworker."
good,A day at work at Macy's consist of long hours of standing and greeting/ helping customers with purchases or anything else they may inquire about. Management was great here and we even had the option to work on a flexible schedule as we choose. The only hard part about this job is when its a slow day and you literally have to find something to do. If the pay here was higher i would have loved to stay even though i was only a seasonal worker.
good,"I worked for Macy's for 29 years. Had many advancement opportunities and have been a Human Resources Manager for last 14 years. I supported three store locations providing guidance to store executives regarding employee relations, employment, talent management, coaching and developing and performance management. My job could be demanding and challenging at times but very rewarding. I most enjoyed the interaction with employees and able to assist with their career growth and overall engagement."
good,Overall it was a fun place to work for. I loved my personal customers. During Holiday it was the most busy and stressful moments that I can recall. Sometimes the sales goals where very doable and stress free. Retail life is fun and hard all in it's self
good,they were great to work for but did not give out great customer service. you will never know when they will down size and that happens often.Be careful
good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's but unfortunately they are not very diverse in their hiring and if you are able to get the job as a person  of color, they may make keeping the job difficult for you and you will face racial stereotypes that corporate will not help assist you with unless you have a lawyer."
good,"loved working here the people you meet and the things you learn about all the things we sold loved everything in that store, shifts were good for a part time job"
good,I learned a lot from my peers and I am grateful for the experience that I was able to pick up. It is stressful if you have a low traffic store with high goals.
good,"learned a lot from job, learned how to work on commission, and always had positive customers coming in to shop.  very friendly staff and loved the work entail"
good,I learned how to work with others that I’m not use to communicating with in my everyday life . The most enjoyable time was the staff party at thanksgiving and giving.
good,great experience with room to grow. Had the ability to grow a team and have a direct impact. i enjoyed the work and was supported from day one and throughout my time there
good,"Money was good , when I retired my schedule was set by a computer and my hours were all over the map.  The roof leaked;I was often scheduled to work until 10:15 pm."
good,"Macy's really was all about teamwork, and that was emphasized from the top down. One thing I really enjoyed that I haven't often seen in a lot of other workplaces is that the managers actually participate in the actual work, as opposed to just sitting in a backroom dictating and playing with their fingers. Macy's also made sure to show it's appreciation for it's employees in many ways, from providing not one but two breakrooms with many amenities, and often providing free meals and other small but much appreciated gifts, like free lunches and special discounts and prizes for hard work, or, achieving/exceeding expectations."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Fine Jewelry department, we were in charge of everything so there was always something to do. We had control of everything.  I felt empowered and important.  I could also work in other departments if I choose too.  Macy's overall is a good company to work for."
good,I would have to say Macy’s is one of them oat unforgettable experience I will always remember working at.  I really enjoyed meeting all kinds of new people. I like how I had the same frequent customers coming in to buy things just to up and support and help me on commission.
good,Productive and fun workplace with very flexible hours. Lots of customer communication to improve your communication skills. Multitasking is very common.
good,"I actually left because one of the managers dropped a mannequin on me and acted like she didn’t notice. Up until then I normally had fun, I do think that you can get a little overworked, I have a sciatic nerve problem ever since Christmas time from working so much"
good,"Open and inventory jewelry, removing jewelry case security department rally and cleaning before store open. Customer service for selections, repairs, locating merchandise, credit card accounts, payments. The manager was a super guy to work with and for. Variety of cultures in co-workers and customers"
good,"Macy's offers its customers a wide variety of product to chose from. Its prices are competitive, and fair. The only downside is that the customers, once having paid for their product, are for the most part discarded."
good,I was never bored working i love being busy and helping costumers all day. The work environment was very good everyone got along and costumers always left happy.
good,"Was fast pace job, managment was great. Never a dull moment at this location. Was there when the warehouse was in the process of relocating and Macys was just settling into Salt Lake City area."
good,"The company has many opportunities for you to grow. As long, you stay consistent w/your numbers and Macy's loyalty program. Excellent promotion, discounts and benefits."
good,"On a typical day Macy's would have me take things from chute to bin and send it down to be packaged and shipped. If we were slow they would send me down to the ""active"" department to either stock or pick merchandise. The most difficult part of the job was getting up at 4:30am to leave the house by 5:00am to be there by 6:00am. The most enjoyable part of Macy;s was talking to others while working and hearing their stories."
good,Come to work with a good attitude and perform your overall best grab a Starbucks drink and use it to fuel your day in which you help out customers with certain deals and doing recovery
good,"Very eager and friendly faces. Everyone is very active and helpful. Lots of diversity and culture. Excellent service dealing with both happy and unhappy customers. When problems occurred, they were solved right away."
good,Macy's was a good place to work. Easy tasks and great management team . The hours was very reasonable. You got the opportunity to cross train in as many departments as you liked.
good,"Love being in the fulfillment/receiving department this year. It's a fast pace, fun environment with talented employees. Manager is great to work with and for."
good,"Great place to work in special my manage, she was great! The workplace culture"
good,Come in and go to the department assigned. Get info needed to complete the dock assignments. Have fun while you work by which music is always playing and joking with your fellow co-workers and accomplish the task that need to be completed. Clock out and have a great evening
good,"A typical day at work is it's very busy although it may not seem like it. There are not too many relaxed days due to customer care of any nature in person or by phone. I have learned to be a lot more patient with some have extra ears to hear and extra eyes to pay close attention to another persons need including co-workers. Always be kind and courteous in any instant or seek management help to solve certain issues. Most of the time the managers will be right there to assist you or they may be helping other customers as well so you do your best to serve the customers well until help comes and apologize for any inconvenience. We all get along culture wise..as a matter of fact there isn't one. We are all one with the same common goal to satisfy the customers to the best we can. The hardest part of the job is a customer in front of you, one on the phone, the line is growing and help seems to be far away and an employee walks by and doesn't assist you. The most enjoyable parts are all of us working together getting it all done no matter what we went through, the special rewards for opening credits and morning meeting fun dance exercise!"
good,Great place to work and just mainly for seasonal and holidays after the holidays they cut your hours because there is barely work  great place to work
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great place to work. Nice people. Good pay. Great hours. Good benefits. Fast paced and productive operation. Nice management. Clean workplace. Safe workplace.
good,"Good place to be at, part time or full time, is super operational, you know what is what, where do things goes, how to stock rooms, counting, working on Customer Services, Service, and Service."
good,Wonderful work experience with an abundance amount of customers. Hands on with employees and very informative with training. I never felt like I was out of lace or misinformed.
good,"i learned the system fast and working with others made me feel more confident with customers. the work place was very upbeat and fast paced, great energy."
good,"Managers very transparent"
good,"I keep proactive approach towards my work and have a willingness to learn .I am a team player; as such i do not limit myself to only my duties. I am responsible and am able to work under pressure."
good,"Preparing weekly reports:"
good,"I loved working here and I miss it very much, but the pay was just not enough to pay the bills so a I had to move on ): I also found out even though I was a great worker I got paid much less than everyone else there! So sad ):"
good,Working for this company is an okay experience. I learned about retail sales and was able to develop and perfect good communications skills while working for this company.
good,"A typical day at work involves servicing the customers to ensure they have a good experience and are satisfied with the service.  I have learned to work hard to turn bad experiences into good ones. I handle  the customer issues to give them the best experience. Management seems to be most concerned with meeting sales goals and customer satisfaction.  Overall its a great place to meet, greet, and get to know customers, as well as help them identify what they are looking for."
good,"A typical work day includes cleaning and maintaining sales floor, checking out customers, and returning merchandise to the sales floor. It can be both slow and fast paced. The typical work day can range from being easy to very difficult depending the pace of that particular day. Of course pace is heavily affected by occurring sales and holidays much like other forms of retail. The management comes in to assist with customer needs, helping with floor recovery if associates are overwhelmed and enforcing store policy if customer does not adhere to associates decisions. Also, helping associates resolve problems with conflicting schedules such taking college courses and working at the same time. The people make the job refreshing and homely as they try to interact with and help each other. Friendships are encouraged but are mandatory. Being there, I am learning how to make decisions that best reflect the companies interests while maintaining excellent customer service."
good,Macys at Parkdale was a great and fun place to work. I really miss the store and the employees. there were great benfefits for the employees. Management staff was great
good,The typical work place would a very fast day doing make up meeting new people making my sales goal everyday helping people out over all.To get what they need
good,I started as a seasonal associate and became a full time maintenance engineer it has been a great place to work there and I'm still there going on my 6th year :).
good,"The environment at Macy's was very comfortable. Although it was a fast paced job the management made it possible to get it done. They were respectful, made sure we knew all we needed to know and were understanding.  I moved up in position right from the start and appreciate that my experience, talents, and skills were acknowledged."
good,Macy's is a great company to work for.It offers lots of opportunities to grow individually and professionally. It is very competitive.I love its work ethics and the working environment.
good,"I worked at Macy's in New York, at the time I worked at Macy's all the staff there were great. A great place to work it keeps me busy. Unfortunately the pay check could be a little better. The managers were very friendly. I had to leave because my husband got sick with Cancer and needed my support."
good,"Macy's is a great place to start out for employment, the work is fast but you do enough to not even feel the clock run until break. You do learn much about stocking and setting up merchandise for display and work with great people."
good,Workdays long. At the most you learn how different vendors of different states capture business do business with items. Workplace very diverse and fun. Special orders tracking takes time. Out of all interesting!
good,"I've never worked before, but after working as a seasonal sales associate, I've learned a lot. It was somewhat stressful and somewhat relaxing. I worked during the holidays, so of course it was stressful. There was a lot of customers to assist, but overall I enjoyed helping each and every one of them. Some would come in a bad mood and demand to perform certain transactions that weren't allowed and against the store policy, so I'd always contact the manager to deal with them after I try my best to help resolve the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job (don't call me crazy haha) was to clean up the floor and make sure my department was neat and presentable to leave a good impression to the customers. Customers are always a priority when it comes to working at a retail store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Recently, management decided to play a fun monopoly game with the associates to encourage them to open more credit accounts. Each associate was give a paper monopoly board including all the  department. Every time an associate opens a credit they get to pick a slip from an envelope and staple it to there monopoly board. Once, the associate has the board filled, they receive Macy's money. It was a clever way to motivate employees to open more credit cards, while enjoying the benefits."
good,"Enjoyed the clientele and sales promotion.  Product knowledge training was somewhat spotty, when available by  vendor personnel was a great benefit.  Store managers were quite involved and appreciated but department  managers changed too often and some without knowledge for their new departmentl and products.  Some managers were excellent and enjoyed their direction and support."
good,"Great teamwork and communication between sales members and management. Possibility for advancement. Clean work environment. Helpful co-workers. Flexible scheduling, choose your own work hours per week/month."
good,"Macy's is a great place to improve on many things like, communicating with customer's, selling and many more things that are taught monthly with training's."
good,"Working a Macy's was a very new experience opening up to the retail services. It was a good job that really worked around my schedule at home. Also, the amount of hours they gave me were very good and I could work with it real well."
good,"Great workplace culture, very diverse and fun to work. Great management team and reliable co-workers. Should offer better pay, but the company is always looking out to make the work environment enjoyable."

good,"I love working with a team and people who treat you well and at Macy's everyone respects everyone. I learned many things as a Macy's sales associate, one is how to treat customers and others that work with you. The hardest part about the job is if you don't understand how to use the computer then it will be very hard for you to work."
good,"Managed a staff to maintain and keep this store exciting a new, set sales displays shops etc. always challenging with projects basic job assignments and customer reactions"
good,Working at Macy's of Towson during the holiday season is both hectic and fun. It's a place that allows you to be yourself and connect with customers but during sales it can get a little hard to balance all tasks given to you.
good,Good Work environment. Very friendly. Learned a lot in terms of customer service. Customers were giving feed back on how they were treated and that was a tool for improvement.
good,I Loved The Experience I Had Working For Macy's. They Helped Build My Customer Service Skills And How I Leave A Customer Feeling Like They Are Apart Of The Macy's Family And Always Leave Them Smiles And Have No Problem Coming Back To Shop.

I also felt comfortable helping new employees learn the routines and procedures.  The atmosphere in our store was very friendly and employees felt like part of a family."
good,It was a pretty great experience. I enjoyed getting to know new people everyday and helping them get what they need to make their day a little better.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Working as much made me love to communicate and help people around me. It was a very fast and speediest job because I would have to run back and forth to find people there sizes.

good,Many good times working here. The workplace was around employees being interactive with customers. The greatest skill I learned is how to communicate.
good,"During the holidays, it tends to get very busy. Constantly moving and always something to do. Never a boring setting. Fast paced environment wile on the register."
good,"I begin my day by greeting each of my employees and ensuring there aren't any pressing issues that need to be handled right away. I then head to my office, check my emails, and figure out what's on the agenda for the day."
good,"Worked as a seasonal associate during the holiday season.Applied on Macy's website then got a email a couple days later. Phone Interview scheduled  a weeks later . Hired after phone interview with no prior retail experience.Overall,It was great experience to work at one of my favorite stores."
good,"Really easy going and fun job, worst part is the customers but thats the same with any retail job. Management and co-workers are very nice and helpful."
good,"I was trained well and there were always employees around to help me when I had questions.I never ran into any issues, and I loved working there. It was a close drive and the customers were friendly."
good,"I have good, understanding and friendly managers. Co-workers are nice too. The only bad thing is small pay and working hours, we usually work 3pm-10pm. But again, you can talk to manager and he will help to change hours. The 15 and 30 minutes breaks are paid, but if you take 1 hour you have to clock out. And you probably won't be able to work if you have allergies to dust. All in all, its a good job."
good,Great place to work at if you are a people person. I enjoy meeting new customers and co workers are super fun and friendly. I had a great team in  my department and always a key for a good success in any department.
good,"I started out as a holiday helper at Macy's chestnut hill, MA. I really enjoyed. Everyone was super friendly.  Busy place. It was a different scene from a grocery store. Management wasn't really around to help you but when they were they always had kind words. Sadly when I was there this macys went thru the going out of business."
good,"I did a lot of lifting, scanning with a gladiator, cutting open boxes, folding items, poly bagging, stocking shelves and shipping out merchandise to customers"

I enjoyed my manager & my co workers. The hardest was some of the holiday hours & working till midnight or after. I enjoyed inter acting with the customers.

I learned to communicate with people from different cultures not only the clients but also co workers,the harder part in this job is the cleaning from fitting rooms but i love to help people and open credits"
good,I had the opportunity to work with some amazing people back at Macys. I was also able to take the time and learn more and more about how to give proper customer service.
good,"Macy's strives to create a culture of employee engagement. (However, like all large companies, you might get managers who do not focus on such things). I have been with the company for 4 years and have grown so much in the short time span working from the retail side to the corporate HR side."
good,I learned alot and shoes and ordering shoes online. Its is a very fast paced environment and the managers were very helpful and talented.
good,"Great place to work at, to start a career. Workload is a hectic, but a good challenge. Associates understands team work."
good,Its a nice enviroment that helps you to grow and learn how to do your  job well . Help is always available and on the way. A typical day will entail doing a couple different things like working to register and helping customers. I learned how to man a register as well as how to asisit others. Mangaement was always helpful not always nice but for the most part everyone looked out for you. The hardest part was being on your feet all day . And the most enjoyable part was friendly customers.
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's. My usual day would be coming in at 7 am and leaving by 11 am. I learned alot about how to put products on the sales floor as well as dealing with customers. I enjoyed working with all the employees and managers.

good,"As a Sales Associate in the Women's Shoe Department, you are given a lot of freedom and responsibility to grow your clientele base. You have to be knowledgeable about your products and know your target market well. You are given training, but then are released to the floor on your own. If you are a go-getter who  is not afraid of a challenge, this commission based department is the one for you. I had a great boss who pushed you to reach your weekly sales quota and offered her time to help when problems were presented. Overall my experience was very rewarding."
good,Excellent opportunity to engage with others and deal professional individuals day to day. Hardest part about job was constant busyness with few employees.
good,"helping customers find their perfect outfit"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,nice place to work good benefits but I don't get paid as much as  I would like. I work hard but the money is not great. The management is great and I would definitely recommend this job for a teenager or a college student. if you are an adult with a family I suggest being a manager at Macys. They get paid more.

good,"You constantly meet new people that are interesting, funny, and full of positive energy. Working with a team has never been so exciting and educational"
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for. Their management is nice and easy to work with, just like my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having to learn about all the products Macy's has to offer. Also about the small details and rules for certain sales they have throughout the year. Over time you learn and there is always someone to help you if you have any questions. The most enjoyable part about this job was getting to learn something new everyday. There is always something to do and keep you busy."
good,So much innovation in this company. The best place I have every worked! So much opportunity for you to seize and get noticed. So much work to get done but you are rewarded so everything is worth it.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast and very physical. Lots of walking, moving and lifting. In the beginning there is a lot to learn but after awhile it starts to become repetitive. Management was nice but stressed about sales often. Co-workers were nice and mature. The hardest part of the job was stressing about making sales for the day, rather than enjoying to work there. The most enjoyable was the awards that can be won when selling enough product for the day."
good,"Overall, it was a great work experience; It taught me a lot. The people were fun to work with and the job was fairly easy to me. The hardest part of the job was trying not to slip and fall while carry the dishes around."

good,"I enjoyed working @ Macy's, the managers was very engaging in the concerns that their employees had as well as the customers. We were not looked over, to me that was a plus in my book. I worked in the kids dept, so my dept stayed busy :0) there was always something to do. However I wish there was a better team amongst other co-workers who worked with me, most times I was stuck having to do most of the cleaning up at the end of shift, NOT cool.

good,"A typical day at Macy's kicks off with a cheerful morning rally with opening managers and associates to ensure that the company meets its standards. Then, associates are to start with fulfillment to complete any orders made online and recover the sales floor before the store is open and ready for customers to shop. The workplace culture is very friendly, family-oriented, competitive, and diverse. The diversity at Macy's is one of the best parts about the company, because it gives everyone the ability to view the many talents, perspectives, backgrounds, and beliefs among many employees. Although Macy's thrives to ensure that all employees and customers feel welcome and are treated fairly, there are times when the store gets hit hard (messy sales floor, theft, and tons of go back racks) and it causes employees to stress out. But, even though the company/store has its ups and downs, Macy's treats everyone like family so it makes it less stressful during the harder days."
good,I was a seasonal employee and the culture created by the company was outside. Very much a collective group of people helping each other out with awkward situations in dealing with customers. The only problem I had was that  while working in a mall parking can get horrible.
good,The day starts with picking the online orders that customers have placed.  During the day the associates are required to clean out the fitting rooms and to put the clothes back on the floor
good,"It is a nice job to work at because you got paid every week. What I didn’t like is that we did not get paid during lunch, and there would be times that we can stay longer or leave early depending on our units."

good,A typical day at Macys for me involves interacting with all the associates as they enter and exit the facility. It is my job to make sure only authorized employees enter the facility with their employee badge and to see where they are going. It is also my job to make sure none of Macys merchandise is leaving the facility. I assist in checking on time fraud as well. I monitor the Security cameras to make sure we have no dishonest employees. I also give direction to the officers on the floor so they know where to be or were too responded for emergency or where they will be stationed that part of the day. I also control key access; I issue out key to certain individuals and make sure the key is returned by the end of their shift. If an employee forgot there employee badge I have to issue them a temporary green badge. I get there I.D. from there contact your supervisor or manager and confirm if they are still employed and if they are on the schedule today. If all checks out I keep the I.D. at the front desk and give them a green badge with a number on it. The employee is to where the badge in place of their employee badge until the end of their shift. At the end of their shift we issue back there I.D. once they give us back the Green temporary badge. I also monitor the Burglar and Fire and Weather alarm panels.
good,I adjusted to the work place quickly and extremely comfortably. Everyone in the workplace was nice and helpful! I'd definitely consider going back for the summer.
good,everyday we would strive to provide above and beyond customer service experience for our customers. as management we would control the selling culture and overall mood of the store. My job was to ensure sales were on track by hour and if they were not then I would need to come up with a strategy to boost sales by making sure we are assisting all customers and offering additional merchandise.

good,"Was my first Sales Associate position and it was pretty crazy some days. We'd come in have like a team briefing, but only on opening shifts, go to our sections and wait for the customers. The staff wasn't exactly friendly but there were a few cool people. The only hard part about this job is multi-tasking on a busy day, in other words under pressure and the best part was break to be honest. Overall it was a good experience and if your good with people I'd highly recommend Macy's."
good,"Great company to work for you get the benefit 20 percent discount and you can work other department in the store and they get paid weekly and you earned commission and base pay,"
good,"Per Diem position accepted at a Level One Trauma Center. Unfortunately, there were no part time or full time positions available. Job had great benefits."
good,"My days at work where always busy. I was in charge of kids and junior areas. During the holidays always busy which is good. I like too keep it busy. My co-workers where great always willing to help in the areas I was working,"
good,Springfield Is very understanding when it comes to Their employees. They Treat them with respect and handles all problems. Very flexable
good,like being able to get really dressed up for work.. very organized.. doesn't get too messy. Didn't really like how they really get on you about opening macy's credit accounts.
good,"Macy's was always busy both with customers and general work to do.  I liked that I was always busy and worked with bridal consultants.  After the Human Resources position was available, my job changed from cashier to mostly handling training and interviews.  That was great too and gave me an opportunity to gain social skills from another perspective.  The only thing I didn't like about Human Resources was the the office was very often secluded."
good,Weekends are mostly the busiest days at this department store. Working at Macys give you a chance to learn about different products and items threw out the different departments. The team members  give great  there costumer services skill and try to meet everyone's needs
good,Macy's focuses on development of talent and the creation of a great office culture. They make sure that you have the resources to do your job and have teach you the skills to do it effectively.

good,It is a great working environment and I enjoy working there.
good,good for the most part good work ethic management was i guess fair co workers helped each other the most enjoyable part of the job was setting up the jewelry.
good,"customer service."
good,"Normally I would work any shift since it was a seasonal job. I would restock any inventory, survey the area for store repair, and help customers. I learned how to be a multi-tasker and expand my communication element. Since it was seasonal, management was mainly focused on the product and clients. My co-workers worked with me very closely mainly in groups. The hardest part was it being a seasonal job, and the enjoyable part was to help a customer."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoy the fact that I get the opportunity to meet so many people around the world and they all know Macys. The fact that you can add or post shifts enables more control over your life.
good,my co-workerswere very great on any day of the job and were more than  willing to help out
good,offer opinion and ideas about womens shoes.  I would also help them find sizes and colors.  After that i check them out under my employee id so i can receive the benefits and commission.
good,"Working for Macy's was a good experience for me. I met a lot of people that were part of my growth there. Coming into the company, there was a new computer program that just took place. After seeing the old program, it looked far less complicated then the new one. So when it came to being training, it was a little confusing because there were very minimal similarities that both programs shared as for what was different, explaining it was a bit confusing for them, being that the trainers were trained recent. I like to learn no matter the situation and execute right away. This job requires employees to sit for long periods and answer inbound/outbound calls. I do prefer to be on my feet and active, but in the midst of the long shifts and high volume of calls, I did my best and many customers were satisfied with my service and professionalism and also the fact that I was able to make an upset customer calm and satisfied. I've gotten recognized for my customer service skills by customers and supervisors."
good,"Fast paste, sometimes slow, easy job, get long breaks, people I worked were very nice."
good,"Great place to work, great management team and an excellent venue "

good,"Macy's is a great company to work for. The customer service is outstanding. I love the warm feeling I feel when entering a Macy's store. This why I knew that Macy's would be a great fit for me. My managers are very helpful and I have learned how to be a great team player. My co-workers are very helpful and we all love our job. A typical day for me at work is getting my assignment and completing whatever task that I am giving, whether its merchandising, stocking, receiving, our cleaning."
good,"Record your daily goal. Providing awesome customer service while demostrating star products to customers. set appointments for make overs and eyebrow waxing or lash applications while encouraging them to try a more natural solution to make up and adding them to our clients list for potential sales in major events. Calling clients to book an appointment for upcoming events along with gift with purchase. I learned make up artistry skills. The hardest part about the job was probably setting appointments due to the cosmetic line being new to many people. the most enjoyable part about working for this company was training classes, gratis and also meeting our counter goals by the end of the day."
good,"Process transactions"
good,"•	Managed cashiering activities in areas of purchasing "
good,"Macy's makes you feel at home away from home and at work; Whereas everyone speaks regardless of who you are, Customer or Fellow Employee. Everyday everyone is recognized by name for their time and participation in Macy's. I feel as if we are even more appreciated with the gift bags on Father's day, or the Hotdogs and chips on the 4th of July, and even the extra 10 percent off discount to add on our 20 percent off employee discounts during certain sales. Macy's is one of the best employers to work for."
good,A day at work is a great experience. I get to meet so many different people . I really enjoy it
good,"I loved the management at the Lynnhaven location. Retail hours stink regardless of which store you work in because of the holiday season and sales, etc. I enjoyed my time at Macy's."
good,very fun job. great employees. only downside was the hourly pay rate.
good,Overall I like it at Macy's. A typical day consist of assisting guests with whatever needs they have in a fast friendly professional manner. I've learned a lot of good leadership skills just from working with my co-workers as well as the Macy's environment itself. The hardest part of the job I would say is keeping everything clean and neat.
good,Macys is a great company to work for with really flexible schedules for students and those who want to have a life. It is a place filled with employees of different ages and cultures. One of the best things is the management. They are extremely friendly and helpful to employees and customers alike. And they offer opportunities for advancement which is very critical nowadays.
good,Going to work was always fun. I got the chance to meet tons of new people from around the country.

good,"Performing competitively to create business for the company was done through opening up Macys Star Reward Credit Cards and overall meeting the customer’s needs everyday through greeting, opening a conversation/ making a connection, finding her needs, meeting her needs, closing sell and following up on past customers. Meeting the needs and building a relationship with a client is a key to a successful and ethical business in Macys. The management team was flexible and the customer’s needs always mattered the most to them. The other co-workers around me were pretty hospitable and open to giving a helping hand to other co-workers."

good,"Overall, this place is a great place to work! Crazy hours during the holidays, but it is worth it"
good,It was long hours but wasn't bad for a warehouse. Cleaner than factory work. It was better team work than factory work offers. I liked my position more as well
good,"I love working in Macy’s, the manager was nice everyone was nice I make some good friends they all seem to like me 🙂 which makes work more easy as a door security it was fun but if you not use to be standing all day you gonna hate it. Yes it gets boring sometimes! But once you get use to it is all good. The only thing I didn’t like was they lied that if we did good we would stay we all did great and none of us stay so they lie about that because when we apply they said it in the application ."
good,The job Macy’s is overall good and reliable u work a lot of hours and experience is good when u learn everything u need to learn about the company but is fun to work here.
good,"My experience doing security working at Macys was excellent. I love to do my job, watching everything and one. I love engaging with people, making sure the environment and all are safe."
good,It has been a good experience. Everyome was very helpful in the learning experience and I have been taught a great deal about the warehouse industry. Thank you.

good,Good work ethics with Macy. Great working experience for those who haven’t been employed. The benefits are accurate to you . The job is flexible with school schedule or another job you might have
good,"A day at Macy's is just helping people out with clothes, materials, and etc to find for themselves and the things that they need. I would help out customers in cash register, help them out look for things that we don't have in store on line and if we don't have it, we would order it for them."
good,It’s a nice place to work everyone treating you nice and bring in different foods they make at home. Also we get a lot of back office discounts on in store shopping
good,It's been really good. My coworkers were amazing and the managers were nice. Although at times it was very slow at Macy's it was still enjoyable. I wish I could work there more.
good,"this company is managment is very poor, its give you sales comission, after you have porcentage to sales and when the costumer return what them buy and you have less money"
good,"working hard, helping each other, be in time, follow the roles, be good attitude, talk to your customer and asking questions about anything and offer discount to customers ."
good,"if retail is your thing than macy's is perfect for you. Always plenty to do. However, being in retail for quite sometime now, Macy's is changing to keep up with the times, so things change A LOT, getting people to come in to shop is what they are all about but these days people want to do everything online."
good,I like their benefits it fit to myself single. I had a bad arthritis that made me loose my job.  I also enjoy working with different nationality and  cultural.
good,I loved helping the customers find what they were looking for. management was nice to all employees. I would work there again. and recommend the public to work there if they were looking for a job.
good,"An enjoyable place to work, especially the handbag section. It is quite a big store so there are many people and associates to help and guide you. The company is very big on customer service and keeping customers happy."
good,"Cashier jobs at Macy's involve customer service and basic computation skills. Primary job duties include greeting customers, ringing up purchases, and answering questions about products, merchandise, and services. Macy's may require cashiers to carry out sales associate job duties in some cases, as well"
good,It was really a great environment to work it's was great  on meeting new people  re-able to understand the customer needs and help them and provide them with the great customer service .  Most thing that I liked about the job is good to know a lot of new things and I have all of the managers of supervisor help you to do your best.
good,My whole experience here was great. It was seasonal so it got a bit crazy at times but management was really awesome and flexible with your work like and home life.
good,Great workplace good environment to work and great people to work with. Friendly workers make it easy to ask for help when needed. Great workplace overall.
good,Macy's is a good company to work for very layed back job. They pay what your job require and they give you plenty of hours. The management understand the employee needs and try to work with them.
good,"all i did was stock, replace the old with the new, fold, assist costumers. a typical day is nothing really but i remember one time i dropped all the clothes on accident it was funny to the manager and the job still got done, macys was friendly"
good,At 6:00Am I clock in and the manager talk to us while everyone walks in the building to clock in. Once everyone is clocked in the manager talks to us about what goals to achieve for the day. After about 5 to 10 minutes we go to our work area and start to get ready to open the store.
good,"A typical day at Macy's consists of coming into work and clearing off / opening the registers. Within the first couple of minutes of the store opening, I try to pick up any clothes off the floor and clear out any missed items in the fitting room. Typically, I greet every customer that enters the section. I greet them with a smile and ask them how can I be of service with them. My goal is to make a personal connection with them. One of the goals of Macy's is to achieve magic. Magic at Macys is having the customer leave from the store feeling better about their purchase than they did entering the store. Each customer should feel empowered about their purchase."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's was a great learning platform in customer service. The firm provides excellent training to their associates to understand the customer's needs. The co-workers provided help whenever needed as well as the management. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with many different types of customers and being able to fulfill their needs.
good,Macys was a really good place to work at. The hours were really good. The people were really nice. Wish I could've stayed longer.
good,Macy's is a good company to work for.The company drives me everyday to come in and do my best while I am on my job. I also look forward into growing as a better individual with this company.

good,Everyday I went in with a positive attitude I learned how to do presales working at Macy's I had fun working with my co-worker as a team there wasnt nothing hard about the job the most enjoyable thing of the job was interacting with customers
good,"unload trucks , make sure all my customers are happy ,maintain a clean work place"
good,I worked for the holiday season and I loved it. macy's in Stockton was great.
good,Great hours set your own schedule if school was involved. Managers are friendly and listen to when you you need help.
good,"Loved my boss, she was amazing. I met really great ladies and some are still friends. Those were the best times of my life. I was also in school and I had to concentrate in that."
good,This is a very nice place to work east to advance in this company and great benefits
good,Can be productive. Management always finds a fun way to connect with a customer.
good,"In this company everything was great, but you basically had to learn things on your own. I seen most of my co-workers doing things that I followed, but got messed up behind it and that the inly thing I didn't like about the job. I love the environment and the store itself but it was never any help."
good,Very fast pace  but you left feeling fulfilled and like you learned something.
good,"Working at macys wasnt just a good experience it was a great experience. I helped people find the right outfit they were looking for, for theyre special occausion. Management was really great. Co-workers were working as a team. I enjoyed working there it was a very great time at macys."
good,The co-workers we're very helpful manager very friendly. I learned how to speed up the pace during a lunch rush
good,"Macy is a fast pace and very busy,I learned the register,how to approach and deal with the customers,open new accounts,open and close register,my coworkers are team players we assist each other with promblems. There is no hardest part of the job its learnable the best part of the job is meeting new people assiting them with the merchandise"
good,The management is great. Its a typical day at work you learn your with co-workers that work hard on the job and the most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great company.
good,It was okay working here. Just was busy and managers don’t really care about the customers. The managers I’ve worked with need to better their customer service.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys. Coworkers, managers are really friendly and nice people. They're always there to help solve problems or any concerns that new associates have."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers in my department. My manager treated me like a human being not just a body on the floor running the department.
good,ok start up job the but u work way more than u should for the pay that u receive
good,"If you work here, you are no employed, they barely give you any hours.It is boring and the employees barely talk to each other, never smile."
good,On a average day at work i prepare to unload the truck! our lead and our manager helps the hardest part of the job is nothing gets damaged the most enjoyable part of the job is processing the cloths
good,"Most of all break was to short and far away from work area ,so I feel you were cheated out of break time some people work faster than other and then a person is being compared to other that work faster"
good,"When I left there in 2014, I heard a lot of people who work there are complaining about their work and their own boss that couldn't get a commitment to help one another."
good,"Enjoy working at Macy Baybrook Mall during busy time."
good,"I love doing make up, I love working with the people I work with. I enjoy helping my customers feel like they've gotten their needs fulfilled on the cosmetics end of their shopping experience"
good,it was a fun job to work only had a little time there for the holidays but i would go back
good,"Stressful environment. Pay wasn’t that great for the work done. Everyone was competitive even though there was no commission. Holidays are the worst, it gets chaotic."
good,"Manager - Housekeeping Assistant"
good,Little unorganized and  management no willing to compromise. Overall a Pleasant place to work and staff was very helpful. Would’ve stayed if the Home Store didn’t close
good,"I love the company, coworkers and customer. Sadly there was no room for advancement in my line of work."
good,"Very good place to work at, I'm not getting any hours at this time, haven't worked since April and that was just for one day."
good,I worked  at macys during the holidays it was very busy but at the same time it was fun. helping customers when choosing a gift of some sort was very rewarding
good,"It was a good seasonal job, fast paced for the holidays & slow any other day....the staff was really nice that’s about it, had to wear all black with some pops of color"
good,"This was the best job I ever had, Management was caring and king, co workers were great, often helping each other, Benefits were great, employee discount was excellent, I enjoyed leaving my first job and coming to Macy's in the heights. Hardest part of my job was when it was closing;"
good,"Macys is a great company. However, the building needs to be remodeled and thoroughly cleaned. Most of the employees have lost the fire and passion needed to push this company. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great part time and temporary place to work for the holidays. Very fast paced environment along with great discounts and fun opportunities are available to you.
good,"There is too much work to do in the amount of time scheduled, not enough support from management, not enough pay for the job done. Too much pressure for jewelry department."
good,I started at Macy's as a temporary job to help with my holiday shopping. I enjoyed being there but I feel the temps should have a chance to be hired on.
good,"typical day dealing with customers in retail, enjoyed working with the staff having discounts as an employee for friends and family,human always showed support for their employees when in need personal or private"
good,"I only worked for a little over a month. If i had applied earlier or had the opportunity to continue with them, I feel that I may have had an oportuinty for more hours."
good,"Macys is great company to work for, although I worked for a lease department inside of Macys, I can see how active the company is with it's employees and always pushing to keep goals up. Working for LIDS locker room, I had a blast, however the manager being of such young age, did not qualify to be professional in my eyes. If you get into a verbal ""street"" type argument with a co-worker who is scheduled to be off, and you decide to argue in front of customers and associates, then storm out of the store leaving shop unattended, then that is most def. UNPROFESSIONAL which is why I left."
good,"It's a nice, classy environment. The managers can be a little rude and make dumb decisions for the job even when you give your input on how something isn't working. The money doesn't add up to the hours. Starting at $8.50 is the dumbest thing to do I mean it's Macys."
good,It was just work to me but the people I work with was fun to work with but over all the time work their was not very happy at sometimes but would love to with people again
good,Good company to work for. Good location in mid-town. Fast-paced environment. Nice people.
good,"Close contact with people, work in a high pace rate, co-workers very nice guys."
good,It was a retail job and with most retail your goal is to make the big bucks and by being professional it is something you can achieve.
good,"I would some inventory, casier help. customer service, great people to work with, management was very helpful"
good,i loved my job at macys. there werent always hours but when i worked i was always happy to see the customers and my co workers.
good,"Worked in the show department and loved my co-workers, Not enough hours. Overall, San Bernardino store had too much drama and unprofessionalism from other departments."
good,"I wanted to grow  with the company  but the store closed ,I would love to have the opportunity again, but the pay was not that good, as a manager I should have been compensated better  like I said really liked the company  if I had the chance I would come back."
good,"Great company! Job security questionable, hours questionable. I was trained better by the associates vs management. Store level management not very keen on training"
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Macys, everyone works together to get things completed. I didnt care for the fact that we had sales goals and you are rated on those goals."
good,"I LOVED what I did.  Great management, although my manager was not trustworthy at all.  Retail hours are killer, no matter how you slice it.  My work was appreciated, and they showed me I was appreciated!"
good,The management isn't the greatest. I learned how to be more open minded and friendly. the hardest part of working there was them working with your school schedule.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Had a great time working for Macy's. I loved the warehouse position. Kept me fit. The people were really fun to work with. The leads were easy to talk to and listened.
good,"No supervisors, representatives with limited communication skills and absolutely NO desire to resolve concerns that may be unique to Americans. Just make sure take care"
good,To off load merchandise and take out of boxes or containers for processing followed by putting up merchandise after pricing and tagging for on floor sales.
good,"Great company, very fast paced, too much to learn, but a lot of fun. Senior management tho are always looking to see what else can you take on and hold you responsible for a million things in one day. Be prepared to deal with them... they are the ones that drive people away from the company."
good,"Wish I got my full time hours, management doesn't like anybody working overtime, especially for merchandise position. Don't make enough to pay my bills"
good,"Kindly greeted customers as they walked in the store asked if they needed assistance."
good,"I pack boxes to be ship out to company's and I unpack them as well."
good,"A typical day at work was customer service, the hardest part was standing on feet all day.  I am usually not a retail person but Macy's was a nice environment but it's not my choice of work."
good,"Typical day as a Sales Associate in the Fine Jewelry department, is log in, and walk the area to assist customers and do suggestive selling and develop customer relationships to invite customers back to the store.  I learned how to work the register during high stress sales events, perform sales support functions, make on the spot decisions to support customer needs, damaging. ticketing, and arranging the merchandise."
good,Smooth days just finished the work you're assigned. Managers get besides themselves with demands and how they talk to employees. All coworkers are cool and focused on doing their job.
good,Extremely fun but you will be expected to work very hard and there were times that you have full creative control. I was employed during the holidays so much of the work load was centered around creating Christmas displays.
good,I was a member of the Support team and one thing I learned was we were not as important as any of the other workers. We were only there to prepare the store for opening and this means we stocked the shelves and organized the floor. Management is very poor. The never wanted to take the time to give a list to do. We would sometimes come in to nothing to do and be there 8 hours. Friendly customers was all I liked about Macy's in Texas.
good,"This is a great place to work for someone maybe looking to build up a little extra money for school....   It's also a good job if you really aren't looking to make a whole lot of money...   The management is very friendly most of the time, but don't expect them to really know a whole lot about what is really going on with the company... If they do know, they will likely LIE to you about it..."
good,Company was a great one to work for. just was a bit to far away for my travels. Would love it if the company was closer to my home.
good,"I worked here only for seasonal during the Christmas holiday. I did not enjoy my time working here, but I needed the extra cash for the holidays. MY coworker in my department was beyond rude and made me cry many time while at work. My manager didn't seem to care about my situation, because she was friends with my co worker. I promised a position after the holidays were over, but I was let go in the end ."
good,Macy's is fun but can get very over whelming. The environment can also be very frustrating because the lack of respect towards employees is high. Other than that I enjoy my coworkers and love the management. Over all the team you get to work with helps you meet amazing people.
good,"like every customer service based jobs, ups and downs. I enjoyed my time, unfortunately I don't have much to reflect back on."
good,Supervisors and Managers were very friendly.  In this company I learned hard core collections.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when we were on the dialer which occurred twice a week.  We got paid $5 cash per every payment we would get with no limits.  It was something new to me and that is why it was exciting.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work includes doing shoe audit and replenshing missing shoes on the sales floor, reticketing shoes and placing them back on the floor, organizing the stock room, keeping sales floor clean and finally selling shoes and helping customers. I learned about computer systems and how to sell merchandise to customers. My management needs major improval. My co workers are amazing to work with and i have become very close with all of them and consider them my friends. The hardest part about the job is making sure that you make your quotas for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk and help people all day."
good,"I learned and gained great experience, and have met wonderful people. The hours could be a bit harsh getting out at 3am, but it's not anything I cannot handle. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity."
good,The pay is great. You are able to get overtime but it's first come first served. It's also very fast paste so if your not use to fast paste jobs this is not the job for you. They provide you with a place to put your belonging that also includes your lunch. They also have microwaves to heat up your food. There is also a smoke area for people that smoke.
good,My manager had a very bad temper and my coworkers were very strange and one would play the same song on repeat for hours during our shifts together. The work was fairly easy and quick to get good at but the environment they created was what lead me to leaving.
good,"I worked at Macy's briefly, I had just moved to New Jersey and was hired as seasonal help when that particular store went out of business.  I was kept on the payroll threw liquidation up to the final day of the store.  I enjoyed the job but could not live on the  minimum wage."
good,"Although it was a good place to work while I was in college. Their pay was very low and I was not able to continue working there. The management was good and the staff was great, but not very good for long term work."
good,"its ok to be standing in a register for 8 hours and putting back items that customers throw away anywhere in the store, but sometimes customers attitude is not worth the time, i guess retail jobs are not made for me."
good,"Making friends w Co workers is fun, and working as a team makes the Macys magic. I would recommend it so someone who is looking for a fast pace job who is good working under pressure"
good,"Busy place to work, great management, weekly pay is awesome. Macy's bucks given to redeem prizes. Money rewards offered during peak season is great as well."
good,I learned a lot about clothing working there. you are basically a stylist who dresses a women head to toe to complete the look. that was the most enjoyable part.
good,Macy's is a nice place to work at in general. A typical day is like clocking in going to your terminal then interacting/ringing up customers. Furthermore enjoying the day or night with music played and recovery to do to.
good,"I enjoyed working with the employees n the customers were friendly ,it was too hot in the store why idk it was winter time .the pay was everyweek .I worked hard here .the pay ok"
good,Enjoyed my job as I worked very independently and was not micromanaged as long was my work was complete.  I was able to move around a lot and did not have to stay in one place.
good,It was enjoyable would work there again it was some employees that were rude but there is always problems somewhere  ........................................
good,Macy is a good store must come shop there they have everything u need.  I was a cleaner there & I had fun on my job even tho it was four house a day
good,This is a fashion store. they mostly hire people in the Christmas and holidays season and in the summer. In the season they give you 40 hours week but off season you can get 10 to 20 hours.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"We had assignments, a quick overview and weekly meeting. There was a lot of high energy- very positive. As in any job, there were great coworkers and selfish minimal coworkers as well as cliques. Time management, team work, and communication are critical. The best part is sneak peeking the prices and merchandise before the public so you know what you could look for off the clock to purchase."
good,Good management and staff to work with.  Ongoing training is good.  Nice work environment.  Clean and safe work environment.
good,Company is looking to get the most out of its employees without giving them the proper compensation. favoritism among employees by management
good,"Process deals, do deposit's, also provide effective support by telephone for clientele by handling issues directly or delegating as needed, maintain filing system of all necessary documents and records."
good,"Everyone is great at Macy's, from the associates to the management. Love working there. Hardest part is of course working with rude customers but Macy's is all about making the customer happy."
good,Macys is a great place to meet and engage with customers. But the pay is poor and some employees take there jobs to far.
good,"My typical day at work is to set the price point for merchandise that enters the store. This has taught me a lot about record keeping and organizational skills. The management is pretty efficient in running the company, but sometimes come off as impersonal in their relations with employees. I'm on my feet constantly, which is probably the most difficult portion of the job, but helping customers purchase items is probably the most rewarding part of the job. Dealing with people is the most enjoyable part of the position."
good,"Educating members on product and making sure deliveries were received exchanging damaged merch or returning."
good,"Start the day off early 5am, change and set sale signs for current Macys sale. Restock merchandise, Replenish the sales floor with merchandise, assist customers with purchases, interact with customers making magic is one of the best parts of my job,"
good,fast pace moving full with tourist and people that love to shop giving them a great experience and great costumer service
good,Plenty of room for growth if you're willing to relocate. Great management.
good,"macy's was my very first job and I absolutely loved it from the very beginning "
good,i was bord waiting for customers but when they did come i would always try to help out the best i can all my co-workers were nice and my hardest part of the job find were the clothes go in the right spot i had fun get to meet new people and helping them out
good,my sale goal maintaining area pad it alway ready to shop i uses my expertise to help customers choose just the right outfit or gift if you walk into my area youll definitely walk out a satisfied my co worker are fun to work with the hardest part of my job is not making my sale goal
good,"during a typical day I will answer a plethora of customer questions, stock items, open or close registers. I learned a lot about each department that I worked in. Co-workers seem like they are simply ""tolerating"" a job that is a last resort. The managers are considerate, but only to a point(the turnover rate is quite high). Meeting difficult daily sales goals(with no commission), and opening credit accounts can be challenging aspects of this job. Having fun helping customers is a plus!!"
good,"The work atmosphere of Macy's is a fast past and productive. Its very crowded during the day and at the night the shift is more manageable, not as crowded. What I learned about the company is that they are very diverse, you make a connections with your customers and you become their assisting personal shopper. Macy's keep you updated with the changes to or special events that are to come. What I also learned from the company is that you have to be aware of your customers when they are they shop you can a feel or an gestures that signal you that they need your help. You want to make your customer comfortable to talk u about what they need. However, the company has 850 department stores around the world including Bloomingdales and also including one in Guam, Puerto Rico. My coworkers are very determined and persistent when it comes down to achieving sales goals that were set for us individually, which shows how the company is growing. The hardest part about the job is providing assistance to customers all over the the world, understanding what they are looking for and provide them with information about the item, searching for it and making sure that are satisified with what they are looking for. Putting on smile on people faces, is what Macy's want from there customers. Therefore, I had a very good experience working for them getting to know everybody and how they work. Not only that, getting to know my managers, they have pushed me to keep up the good work, when the atmosphere gets ruff, I'm there to sooth it out."
good,I went around the store to mark down everything that is on sale. I worked by my self and I really didn't get to know any one that worked there.
good,I loved working for Clinique. Great schools and programs to learn more about products.
good,"Macys, is a wonderful place to work, very friendly people, managers are great."
good,"Lied to : Worked p/t seasonal Christmas.  Was told that f/t would be available  after Christmas. Told after that there were NO positions available.   I had top sales,  gave phenomenal customer service , some were even gracious to let my manager know. and went above and beyond every shift.  So, I know it was not my performance.  Really disappointed.  Loved the job itself"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Job was great I had slots of training there  I got to meets a lot of nice hard working people they was successful and smart people I got to learn how count money and a lot of other things
good,It was a pleasure working at macys eveyone was very nice . i was trained for the position that i applied for and i enjoyed working there. Everyone was polite and dressed in a professional way.
good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's even tho it was seasonal. The pay could have been better. I liked the confidence they had in all their employees. I liked their training methods, I actually learned very fast."
good,The Macy’s I worked at in Long Island was ok to work at but some managers are a bit prejudice. The manager see and know your a hard worker but will over look the black hard worker to promote a white worker that doesn’t work as hard. Macy’s is only good if you need to make some extra cash.
good,"I learned a lot with my manager, the three years in macy  s in cosmetic  department."
good,"I love working Macy's , but they close the store that I was at. the offer me to stay on after xmas. Next i they were closing the store that i was at. Great job."
good,I like to stay busy i have to be moving and time goes by quick..i dont like how one supervisor has picks and lets employees do what they want while im working my tail off i also like to break records as i did last year and i got a bonus for that.
good,"It was a great work environment, the management was the only problem they had. They were constantly making cuts and weren't organized. Some days I had to work 10-11 hour shifts because they didn't have enough coverage. Customer interaction was always positive."
good,"Difficult to maintain steady hours, not so easy to move-up or get promoted. Offer great benefits to their employees (medical, dental, 401k, etc.). Must be able to deal with a great variety of personalities and customers."
good,Pay could've been better. Woke up super early and had to be there at 6 am to do merchandise. Pay and hours could've been more... Maybe a 10 minute break would've been nice even though it was only a short few hours. Very dark in the building when I was trying to build displays..
good,"Wonderful place to work nice people,  nice management. Meet lots of new people.  Lots of opportunities at Macy's. Lots of free stuff.  Good benefits. Great discounts;  Always receiving rewards from your manager for outstanding job."
good,They are very helpfull if you need something or dont know what yu are doing they are there to show you what you need to know...they are a very clean and safe work place they take 10min before quiting time to clean up and get things ready for next shift
good,"Macy's is a fast paced environment, it keeps you on your toes. If you can not multi task and work swiftly it is not the place for you. It requires you to learn fast, that includes the description of your title, having knowledge of products and their locations, and quick areas for checkout. The flagship store is ALWAYS busy there is never down time but that's what can make it fun. If you love to move about and truly help people then you can make it here."
good,"I worked in Cosmetics and Fragrances. i would start by opening the register. Then I took care of custumers helping them find products that work for them.Sit them down and find the right creams, color of foundation, Blush, eye shadow, and the fragrance they love. Once they made up their mind, I would help them cash out,  At closing I would clean up the counter I was at , and finaly close the register."
good,This job had its perks but for the most part wasn't my best job. I barely did anything besides recover the store and cash people out. Barely any customers came in so on most days the store was quiet and empty. It was an easy job but not something I would do again. Well at least I'm Albany.
good,Didn't work there very long. But all was well. Fast paced but it is mostly individual work.                                                 Great place to pick up a lot of hours and great pay.             .
good,I worked in the Petites Department.  When there was a sale going on I had to  maintain the Dressing Rooms and clean the area as well as run the Register.  It was a demanding job but I enjoyed it.  I worked there during the Holiday Season.
good,"En general el trabajo fue perfecto, me gustaba relacionarme con los clientes y cumplir sus espectativas de ventas"
good,Meh. I wish the benefits were better and that I didn't have to open credit cards. The pay is not amazing. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Assisted customers with purchases and returns of merchandise. Collected money for customer purchases. Processed Macys credit card applications.Worked in the handbag department, but assisted in other departments when needed."
good,"The people there are great, and I love my job. The only problem is I need more hours. everything else is just fine. I need to do something different now I have been with this company long enough."
good,"working here its alright they don't stress the associates too much over quota but they do nag and put some pressure into having you make at least two credit application per day, the initial pay rate is not good, and it takes years to have a significant pay raise. they do have a good system where you are able to pick up and change scheduled hours."
good,It was a nice place to work and it was nice to meet people of all different cultures but the management went down hill quickly. The company expected far too much of their employees and a small wages for the hard work.
good,It was a great experience besides the lack of flexibility with hours. My job wasn't really secure because it was seasonal. They didn't guarantee me a job afterwards.
good,It was a learning experience. It was very flexible with my school schedule when I was working there. The co-workers that were veterans really assist and help you be the best you can be.
good,I loved working here it hlep me stay fit an friendly to everyone i meet
good,Its an okay job. Not a career. People are caring and Management takes accountability of every aspect of the store. makes you work for every dollar paid.
good,Fun fun fun... But just would not hire me permenant after all the tiresome work I performed and all the endless efforts of trying to prove to the company I was worth hiring on permenant... Shaking my head to macy's corporation for that...
good,"the most enjoyable place to worked for, management is great, very professional, my co  workers are very helpful while i was trainning with them,"
good,I loved Greeting Customers and meeting new people from out of the country and providing them with excellent customer service.
good,They just don't pay enough. That is all. Other than that it is an ok place
good,I had a wonderful time at Macy's everyone was so nice and the work was fast paced but very easily completed. I learned how to fold and pair up a cute top with skirt or dress pants. The hardest part was trying to work in the children section. The most I enjoyed was helping  a little girl find her Christmas dress.
good,"Macy's is a great place to work. I have wonderful co-workers and managers. There are no advancement for what I am looking for."
good,love coming to work happy fun place to be management was great and was has on with u when anyone needed help
good,"Opened and Closed daily, Operated cash register, Performed line checks for food temperatures,Inventory,Operated Dishwashing machine,There wasn't nothing hard about my job at Macy's.My co-workers were very respectful and were great team leaders, and excellent trainers.The most enjoyable part of my job at Macy's were the discounts."
good,Working at macy's has been a good experience a typical day is usually great i help people find things they are looking for.I also unload racks with clothing on them to hang up.The management and co workers are a lot of help i enjoy working with them.i point out anything thats hard about my job i enjoy working there because i'm gaining more work experience.
good,"My work day consisted of helping customer find merchandise, complete transaction on register via cash, credit or debit, and process checks as well as open new accounts and accept payments on existing accounts."
good,"arrive at 5am trucks are delivered to floor start stocking floor with merchandise, my area was Lingerie. What I learned is that you have to have excellent time management skill to do this job you only have 4 hours to off load 6 trucks and 4 racks of lingerie. My manger was the best person in the work you she checked to see if you need anything and left you to do your work. My coworkers were the best. There were no hard parts of the job I enjoyed the job to the Max."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,offload a truck of up to 3000 boxes. organize cosmetics by department. hang clothes take plastic off clothes cut tops off shoe boxes sort clothes by department. censor clothing as grouped by price
good,You have to manage your own hours and make sure everything is correct.
good,"Security was great with employees safety ,nice co-workers ."
good,fun and can be very. Working long hours for cheap pay and feet hurt all the time
good,"Working for this stores taught me a lot about standing on my feet for long periods of time. Handling insulting customers and opening up registers in the morning hours. A typical day was opening up new merchandise on the floor because there was no room in the dept. Putting out jewelry in darkness while getting injured. Logging off shipment when it comes in and how many pieces, and calling LP to give the tracking # on cartons that arrived in the dept. Hardest part of job is doing all these things on 4 hours with a 5 hour day. Most enjoyable thing I did was watching a customer smile after receiving service from me and being satisfied."
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's because my co-workers and management were extremely helpful and had a great attitude
good,"great store to work in, always something to do, great team members. Over 17 years I have developed top-notch Customer Service skills. balance my work load according to events and what is going on around me."
good,"A typical day at work included helping customers find merchandise, inventory and providing great customer service."
good,Its fun to work in sales. Friendly co workers. Learnt how to handle rude customers.
good,Had great time working at Macy's HR Office for 2 years. Managers were very understanding and supportive. Recognition at work was the best thing.
good,Personally I loved working at Macys but what I didnt like is the professionalism.
good,"We usually load and unload trucks that are filled with merchandise, isolate the merchandise by their individual departments. I learned how to use a fork lift , bailer, and pallet jacks . The hardest part of the job was that we needed to move around in a quickly manner & the easiest part of the job would be to work on the floor moving fixtures"
good,I enjoyed working there everyone was nice and willing to help if you was new to macys. I felt welcome and drama free at work. Working there was very easy.
good,"Busy store to work with, area attractions, nice management, friendly coworkers, fun departments, flexible hours in availability, pleasant, comfortable"
good,"I've learned how to fill online orders, open new accounts, help customers shop smarter."
good,"Conducted up to 30 scheduled and on the spot interviews daily."
good,"-show up and fix the clothes"
good,"I loved talking to people and being able to bask in the music. The hours were flexible but, the opportunity for growth never presented its self. I did not like that fact that the commission was hard to come by  and, if someone returned something in three months, it would be taken from your commission."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The department that I worked in had no managers that had been in that department for much longer than I was there. None of them really had much of an idea as to what they were doing and played favorites. Managers nitpicked to fire anyone they did not like despite performance.
good,"A lot of things to do, good training but not much growth opportunity for long time employees. To many opportunities for a program design for resent graduate college students but not to many opportunities offered for long time employees."
good,I was just there cause I was in school at that time. I love the discounted we got it was awesome place to work. There was any growth at the store. When I was working that time.
good,"Very relaxing and easy, they're flexible and very understanding. Never complained about this job, however transportation is very important. Excellent management and good benefits. They have an insite program thats so helpful to every employee"
good,Macy is a good company all and all but pay and hours are horrible. Didn't enjoy my time working for them at all. Its quick paced and cut throat. Wasn't my cup of tea.
good,My typical day was to greet customers and promote Macy's.I learned to be more patience.Mangerment was never consistent. Workplace  culture is very basic .The hardest part of the job was keeping the customers from returning merchandise.The most enjoyable part of the job was the credits and sales that was going on each or every other day.
good,Great place to work. I really enjoyed my time there. Would recommend it to anyone who need a job. Pay was around $10 a hour. The management was great. Only problem is they let people go after telling they are keeping them and making them core
good,All I really have to say is that theres really no way you can force anyone to buy something. They pay hourly plus commission. Just to see commission you would have to sell at least $100 for every hour at work FUN.
good,"Fast pace work place, very clean, employees were friendly, management was very helpful. They gave me a chance after i had  been out of work for a while."
good,It always comes down to the people that work along side of you. I have worked with some great people. If you are a hard worker and like people -this is a good fit.
good,"I loved working or Macy's.  The pay isn't great, but then again, it's retail.  Great sales manager training.  I worked in many different stores and each one of them was like a family.  Wonderful community outreach as well!"
good,Worked in Merchandising. Supervisor was not very helpful and compensation was not enough to support myself. I liked working 6am-10am because I enjoyed being behind the scenes and getting off work before the store opened.
good,Macy is a good place to work. I enjoy working at macys. The only bad thing about macys is it is hour drive from my home and that drive is getting old.
good,"This was my first ""real"" job that I stuck with. It gets monotonous and it gets ridiculous that coupons work on nothing, but I always loved having multiple things to do and my coworkers were always fantastic to work with. Except one. But we don't talk about her."
good,I worked in the Lakeshore Grill resturant as a server. The staff was awesome and the guest were usually always kind. I was favored by many there and I excelled because of all the love and support from coworkers.
good,I would not work there again because they over worknyoi for littke pay they dont really care if you sick or not o only met my manager once but the co workers and customers make every thing do able
good,The job pay was fair and what was expected of me was also fair. The management for support was very understanding with me being a college student although i got no vacation days.
good,I worked during holiday time and it was the best the  Store is beautiful the people are happy and the associates are even more happier it makes the work experience that much better because you're focused on making the customer even more happy .
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"In the morning, I would have to take down the perimeter, get the master key and open the fine jewelry bay door. Then I would have to open 5 safes that included one master key safe. All of the others had jewelry in them that would have to go into the cases that were put there from the night before. The jewelry then would need to be counted. It would have to match the night count. There were 3 books to be filled out before the day would start.- a key book, a safe count book and a countable book. When a piece of jewelry is sold, it needs to be recorded into the countable book, as outgoing jewelry. "
good,very busy place to work. providing customer service all day long. learned a lot about answering phone calls and helping customers. management is good and they work with you and your schedule. workplace culture is good and its fun to work with coworkers. i had good time while working in Macys.
good,"It is an okay place to work, a lot of demand especially from the owners because excellence is their motto. And from the customers because they expect nothing less than perfection."

good,"I put up returns and fixed closed and worked in different departments and worked the cash register,  and I help customers too."
good,I didn't work here very long.I liked the people I worked with.My manager was a great person.I had some personal problems and quit
good,I love working where I can grown and still get paid the appropriate amount being that it shows how much a company appreciates you but with Macys you would do about three jobs for the lowest pay there.
good,A typical day at Macy's consists of numerous and pointless overlapping of sales and telling customers that their coupons will not work on certain merchandise.
good,"Working at Macy's in recovery, a typical day was walking around the whole store making sure everything was neat. Clothes were to be folded and to be hung back up, trash was to be picked up, accessories to be nicely organized and put on the shelves correctly, and customer service was always important. I learned how to work in different departments and how to use a cash register. Management was fair with their workers. My co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was when I first started working there and needed to learn all of the departments and learning directions within Macy's for the customers to be able to get where they wanted to with ease. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was easy."
good,Seasonal work  does not grant youa position along with the fact that management gives you the run around about hours and important stuff
good,The hardest part of the job is learning how to merchandise the floor when you do not have sufficient room or product in order to make the floor impactful.
good,"A typical day would be meeting and talking to new people. Helping them decide on what they want and need. providing customer service. There is a supervisor for each floor, there were three floors, so there different supervisors to help assist you. The co-workers are friendly"
good,"The best thing about working for Macy's was the employee discount. A typical day consisted of a morning team meeting, organizing the days work, and getting through the work before the store opened.Proper training was lacking and management did not interact well with employees. Co-workers were not team players and had to be cajoled into helping another team member."
good,It's nice part time job for students. They take care of the employees and very low stress level work.very flexible as well.
good,I learned a lot while here. I learned that integrity is important. i learned that you have to be careful in every way possible because we are working with machinery.
good,Assisting customers with merchandise..Helping them purchase. I learned alot about clothing. Workers were fantastic. Hardest part was convincing them to apply for a credit card. Celebrating the sale!
good,"................."
good,"My job at Macys was very fun. I would typically unload the truck  (merchandise), but the merchandise out onto the fixtures. While I was unloading merchandise I would also assist customers. The co-workers were always fun and energetic which was the most enjoyable part about my job,"
good,"A typical work day consisted of greeting guests, taking, editing, and selling photos. We had a great work environment. I learned how to operate a professional camera while working here and I also learned how to edit photos. Management was great. Co-workers were enjoyable. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to edit photos."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very busy from the time I get there to the time I leave"
good,"I love working in macys , I lots of things such as; to become sociable ,how to communicate with people ,and how to satisfied the customers"
good,"I would help assist customeers, ring up merchandise, and explain sales and promotions. I learned alot of the whole morality in working in a retail store. My co workers were very helpful and reliable. The hardest part was knowing what people want and the easiest was helping them. "
good,"I help with others "
good,I enjoy working at Macy's Twelve Oaks. It is a family unit and the most enjoyable part of my day is working with my amazing team. We make a point to make goal every week and are dedicated to working. I often stay late at work to finish tasks if they are not completed and I often work through breaks to finish tasks.
good,It was a fun place to work with tasks changing all the time. The atmosphere was a good one.
good,"Retail sales in Estee Lauder, beauty advisor. Selling cosmetics and applying cosmetics to customers"
good,"Working at Macys is a great opportunity to deal with all aspects of the public. You meet and help alot of nice and unfortunately not so nice people. It helps you develop a good sense of how to deal with difficult situations in the proper manner. For the most part, it is a pleasant place to work, however the hours, since it is retail are difficult since weekends and holidays are mandatory."
good,"being that i worked part time, i enjoyed job cashier/customer service. keep the department up. folding clothing, returnes, assisting customers to an easy shopping experience."
good,The job was great! It pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me realize that I enjoyed retail. My co-workers were very nice for the most part. I noticed a lot of issues between them though. My manager was amazing and I was happy to be working under him. I didn't enjoy days where everyone was working and our sales goals were high because then not only do we not make commission but we had to make it up the very next day.
good,"As a concierge, I greeted customers, ansewered their question about hrs. of the store, where merchandise was. looked up public transportation and schedules."
good,"A typical day at work includes : being on your feet all day, picking up after customers, checking your associate stats, looking at your watch. I have learned to be more assertive.Product knowledge is great even for personal use.The management on my floor is great... only reason why I'm still there. I get along with most of my co-workers...The hardest part of the job, is that we can't provide instant satisfaction to ALL customers ALL the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is making personal connections with customers."
good,"A typical day at work for me is when I walk into the doors and punch in. I usually say either good morning or evening depending on the shift to my co-workers. I ask them what is going on in the store. I always ask what managers are on for the day. Next, I check to see if the shoes have been tagged. Once they are tagged we bring them out for display. Once the lights come on we start our day. THe hardest part of the job is knowing what shoes are comfortable and really learning about the customer needs. There are times when I dont know an naswer so I will ask one of my co-workers. Together we find a slotuion for the customer. Other times if there is an issue I can alwasy get guidance from my managers. Although I have been in retail for alomst nine years there are some situations that I can handle on my own. If we didnt have a shoe in stock but had something similar I offer that or I look into our system to see if it can be ordered or if a nother store has the sane shoe. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer find the right shoe. I will not give up until I have explored every possible sloution for the customer."
good,"This was an interactive job on the retail environment with great sales challenges, in fact there we can learn how affect to the store category the relationship between the product prices and its qualities, the customer interests and psychology, and the management strategies according to the company policy."
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for. Even though I work part-time, I enjoy my peers and management team. I have a very understanding manager who works with me since I have to work a flexibile schedule due to my full time job."

good,"Es una empresa sumamente sólida que te permite crecer como profesional y como persona. En mi puesto aprendi sobre muchas compañías en el ámbito de la belleza como Estee Lauder, It Cosmetics, Elizabeth Arden, Clarins, Shiseido, Channel entre otros."
good,"Seeing as this was my first ever job, I was initially nervous about working retail and hearing all the negative comments people had about it. This job was amazing for me, amazing managers, co-workers, even people who I didn't work with were so kind and helpful to me."
good,"Great people and environment! I love the help they give positive attitude. Only this is that employees get mad about commission who gets what, the register is on ringer mood. They want to be stingy."
good,"I enjoy my time working at Macy's my manager is very helpful and every day is fresh and exciting. I multitask by working in 4 different departments including children's, home, luggage and lingerie."

I automatically made sure I was prepared with full uniform before I clocked in and was ready to start the duties I was assigned to. Three keys words that I learned as an employee was understanding, interacting and building great relations between team members and also customers. That is very important because you will be able to keep up with the flow with others and the company itself. Also you want to be able to keep customers smiling and enjoying their experiences in order the company to expand. Management is all about organizing and being able to plan carefully for ensuring that the company gets the correct products. Therefore employee's will be able to restock products or check for damage goods. If any damage goods it will be very important to take note of that. The Co-workers that I worked with were very friendly, creative and helping. If I misunderstood something about any task given, they were there to tell me more information I was unaware about.

I provide shuttle service on and off property. I assist in some accounting duties (billing,coding). I have done shifts as the Night Auditor and Night Security. I make myself available and prepared for any interaction with guests and answer any questions they may have. I have learned a bit more on the administrative side (managerial) like scheduling, holding stand up meetings to discuss upcoming conferences. I love the management team here.

good,"Macy's does an effective job of teaching their associates the best way to sell and perform customer service. A typical day at work consists of meeting and connecting with customers, performing purchases and returns, maintaining the fitting rooms in your department by the hour, and working with other associates who are doing the same thing. The managers are what help to make the atmosphere positive and it is why the location I work at has happy and motivated employees. All of them are different in their teaching styles and I would say that may be a fault in terms of who is the most effective in helping associates improve at work. The most difficult task is selling the well-known Macy's card. It is a credit card that customers use to purchase merchandise and receive discounts on them. It can be hard to sell and if there is one thing most of the managers have not yet succeeded in doing, it is helping all of us to improve selling them. It has become a store problem at this point, not just something that two or three associates are struggling with. When you DO sell one, or you help a customer find an item that they really wanted, it is very rewarding. The best part of this job is being able to make a customer feel great for coming into the store. There are challenges, but if triumphed, an entire day at work can be a rewarding experience."

good,"A typical day at work for me is help styling different people. I learned different ways of judging people by style I learned how to deal with different attitudes and also I learned more respect for myself and others. Management is not so good. As employees we basically manage ourselves because we usually only have one manager working one floor. My co-workers can be hard to deal with but being yourself you learn to keep to yourself and just do your job. Theres not really no hard part of my job because as you get use to it, it all comes easy. My most enjoyable part at my job is making sure all my customers leave my store happy."

The management and co-workers were fair, specific, helpful, and a true natural team."
good,"A typical day at macy's includes helping customers find the right items either on the floor,stockroom and look-up on the computer. Management is available to assist if we encounter any customer related problems. co-wokers are willing to help. This is not a hard job. The most enjoyable part is closing the sale."

good,I enjoy meeting new people and loved the environment of greeting customers and selling different type of designer shoes.
good,"A typical day working at Macy's was selling men's fragrance. It consisted of standing for long hours of the day but when working with enjoyable co-workers, it's easily forgotten that you've been standing all day. What I learned while working at Macy's was how to interact with customers. I only worked there for about a month, but within that month I learned a tremendous amount. By the end of the month I had ten times more confidence in ability to talk to a customer than I had when first starting this job. The management for Macy's is very good to work for, very organized and always on time. I would definitely have to say the hardest part of the job was having to stand all day, but like I said, it's easily forgotten about when working with such amazing co-workers. The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's would have to be being able to interact and talk to others. It was something that kind of kept you on your feet."

good,good customer service and the staff is very friendly.
good,"At macys we'd begin our morning with stats, goals, and game plans for the day. Reads stating our quotes and percentages of what needs to be reached. Sales, customer service, and credits were the goal. I gained alot of people skills while working at macys, I also picked up alot of speed because we were constantly busy. Management was personal and coworks were like family. The hard pard was getting people to sign up for credits. The best part was meeting and passing my goal each day."
good,cashier
good,Setting sales for that day sales or the next day sales for holidays. Doing markdowns of merchandise. Great place to work with great people. The hardest part was getting up early. The most enjoyable was finding out what was on sale.
good,Great benefits and training courses. Taught me a lot about customer service and managing skills in a professional atmosphere.
good,"macy's is a great place to work, they teach you how to better yourself in retail. you meet different people and get invove with charities and giving back. helping customers and sharing expericences to make them feel better about their purchase. to build your clients up by keeping them inform with upcoming events and if their certain item they want has come in. Macy's has help me to break that shy shell that i had in school and getting to know others and being able to work as a team or indepent. Also, being that confidence up to talk with every customer that comes to the store and shop. Macy's also taught me to bring cutomers and their friends and family back, letting them know we are here and can always shop with us. Macy's do have unpredictable work hours and long hours on feet less time spent with freinds and families. work on holidays and weekends."
good,"I Loved Macy's, the people were nice and the environment just felt nice. I worked in the intimate appearl area which is kinda quite and hidden so I loved that about this job.

good,I loved working in the womens shoes department of Macy's. It was a new experience from working in the mens department
good,I was the juniors customer service lead. First importance was customer service as well as greetings. I processed returns and purchases as well as customer inquiry calls.
good,"I was happy with the location of the store I applied to, had great co-workers, and an decent work environment. I knew the pay was low and there was no job security or career potential since I knew it was a seasonal job. I was only working there because I had been unemployed for nine months and was running out of savings trying to make up for what unemployment compensation did not cover and did not expect it to be high paying or secure for the long term. At the time of the interview, I had only been on TWO interviews out of over 300 full-time jobs applied for since February and really needed the extra money."
good,"This was my very first job and absolutely Loved it! I got to run the register, help coordinate outfits for the customers and maintain fitting rooms. I left when i started college, because I started working there right after high school. Management were very nice and upbeat. Hardest part of my job was not spending my whole paycheck on our junior selections! I loved my co workers because they were so welcoming and was a wonderful 'first job' experience."
good,A lot of traffic due to the holiday season. Many different personalities to juggle which was the most challenging part of the job. My co-workers were great and cooperative. I love being around people! That was the most rewarding part of the job for me.

good,Good company friendly people and the pay is good it's good pay and the people are nice and I met some new people that are fun to be around the job is not challenging and very good supervisor's
good,I have no comment besides the pay should increase they stress the star rewards and opening credit accounts so much it sometimes can scare customers away because not everyone wants to either add more things on there credit that they already are trying to balance and some people are afraid of missing payments and owing and messing up the credit establishment they have built. I hated how I didn’t really get to be open with my customers as much because I felt I was pressuring them to open accounts just because
good,I like the job  must walk around 9-15 miles a day  buy comfortable shoes in advance and get well rested. Great hours. Overtime available. Good management. Weekly pay.
good,"Have no idea of other locations as this is a very old company and has tie ups with old legacy service partners like IBM who dictate their own schedules when it comes to implementation... The mobile division, the web division are much more open and receptive to changes."
good,I give Macy's a great review. I love helping the customers. I was always acknowledged  for making good sales. Every morning the store manager would praise the staff and tell us what we need to work on.
good,"Macy’s is a great company and has lots of opportunities to enhance your career, but only if you put Macy’s first in your life if not then it will be hard for you!"
good,Good place to work but they have a little bit of management problem and they don't really pay that much money but if you go to school you can work part-time
good,"As retail outfits go Macy's is an excellent company. I compare all my retail experiences with my time at Macy's. It really is a magical place at Christmas. I would return tomorrow. However, this is no place to play fast and loose with credit. They have records if you've ever had a card and you will not be able to get one as an employee if your old card is not clear."
good,The hardest part of the job was when our computers were down and were unable to do any purchases just returns. Plus its stressful finding that one item left in the store for the customer that really wants it you have to go out of your way to find it.
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers shop all day, answering the same questions time and time again. I found it to be fun and interesting to meet new people from all walks of life."
good,Easy relaxed causal attire. How to prepare merchandise. Management was great. Great fun place to work.  Sometimes Heavy boxes. Working on the dock and jamming to Prince.
good,"I liked working at Macy but unfortunately i had to leave cause of other works but work was good the pay was okay , but other then that i was a hard working man"
good,Enjoyed diverse work culture and interacting with customers.  Did not enjoy working under a sales quota.  As a part-time employee it was hard to get enough hours.
good,"I worked part time flex hours at Macy's in Tn and then during Christmas when I moved to Ky. what a difference in the two stores."
good,I loved my job at Macy's.  I only left because my job was eliminated in 2009 when the market crashed and Macy's consolidated job positions within the stores.
good,"Enjoy the job.  You stay in your area and keep your area clean and organized.  Sometimes, they asked you to go another area to help.  Loved doing that.  I enjoyed helping customers.  During the holidays so it was temporary.  I wished I could have continued working here.  It was fun.  Gave breaks as well."
good,"Giving the opportunity to work at Macys as a sales associate I must say that its a nice and fun place to work at. You are trained for a few days and basically in order for you to learn the product and sales, they put you to work at a register of course with another cashier their to help you out if you get confused. But its very simple the cash register computer will not allow you to proceed to the next screen unless you are reading and following the directions on the screen so that is a major plus to easily learning the system. The hardest thing to do is when you are the only person in a department and you are very busy and you are in charge of that main department so your responsibility is making sure everything is clean and organized.. The fitting rooms is the hardest to keep track especially when its really busy in the store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The environment at Macy's is very laid back, you can clock in on any floor. Being a fulfillment associate I had to memorize my area to the tiniest detail and often times had to do cashier duties also with only computer training given to me and 1 hour of shadowing another associate. "
good,I enjoyed my time working here. The coworkers are very nice. It was a good and comfortable atmosphere to be around. The hours there are really convenient.
good,I worked two different areas and both seemed very fast paced and fun. The discount was awesome and people were friendly. I suggest high school students work there as they don't pay much.
good,"good employee, sometimes good managers too. it is not a place you can actually grow. so if you looking growth, you should look for somewhere else. That's all i can say"
good,"It was okay environment "
good,"Great place to work and earn skills and experience, enjoyed working with other co-workers and helping in customer service, where you learn people skills."
good,"Macy's Inc is a great place to work. It is a stable company that provides its employees with a good training/learning environment, clean and up to date facilities, average salary and promotional opportunities."
good,"I wish I came in as a fulltime security officer. The pay would have been better.  But my main reason for leaving was cause I moved here to Pa before my time to relocate was approved. Then by the time I was ready to work again, I had serious car problems as well as just living too far away to commute. So when they wanted to know when I was comin back, I had no answer for them. So they decided they couldn't hold the position open for me anymore."
good,"Busy always in meeting customer's expectations. I enjoy the workplace culture and the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer happy. I love  working with different people with different backgrounds. My co-workers are very helpful, which makes us a perfect team."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was to assist customer and interacting with management and fellow associates.  Commision selling was great tool to motivate great customer care.
good,"I'm not sure why but Macy's doesn't pay its employees enough money.  I appreciate and approve of all the work they do for charitable organizations but charity begins at home.  How about their employees?  "
good,"Its not a horrible job, Lots of physical labor. They try to be fair and make work as enjoyable as possible without losing focus of the job. I would recommend it."
good,Professional environment. Job is fairly easy but competitive when it comes to bringing customers to make daily goal. Training is thorough. Easy job to make money
good,Provided with customer service skills which they really emphases for the benefit of the company in making profits. Macys one the best company where I learned how to upsale.
good,Very easy workplace with the an outlook to always helping the customer and putting them first. Can be stressful around the holidays but pretty smooth sailing other then that.
good,Macy's is a high volume place especially during the holidays. There is hardly ever a dull moment. It requires a lot of patience as customer service is a large part of the job.
good,No career advancement and shift hours not great.  Point system unreasonable but culture inclusive and fun. Great co-workers and great discounts and activities.
good,"I spent 26 years with the same store. I was able to learn and grow as much as I wanted. It was once an excellent place to work. Many things changed as the years progressed, service and employee expectations became difficult to maintain. Less hours more work expectations without help. Less personal interaction."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"come in to your department either a co worker there or not, serving customers with the managers popping in and out of each department greeting you making sure everything is okay"
good,"I learned how to further improve and advance my communication skills. I improved my cash handling, and learned how to place orders for stock, as well as unpack and handle packaging."
good,"Macys is a great company to work for. I really enjoyed the environment, people, management. Being a cosmetic and fragrance sales associate, i enjoyed working with people and making sure that every single customer left feeling better than he or she came."
good,Fast paced work environment
good,"Macys was my first job at 18 years old. Great atmoshere with good employees. Management was ""ok"". They all trued to uphold a postive team effort type of feel in the workplace. Only problem i had which caused me to leave was management was not working with my school schedule."
good,"Came in at 5am unloaded freight truck onto dock floor about two hours, took boxes and removed items then added sensors and sales tags, after I took items ready for selling floor to the correct floor and placed them in area for the next person in line of work to place things on racks and inside cases. Inventory on damaged items at the end of the week"
good,I was hired for one day to apply makeup for the Thanksgiving Day Parade. It was a fantastic opportunity and I loved it!! It was a very fast paced environment and I love that type of surroundings as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the new people I met.
good,"Manager was nice, and the job was honestly pretty easy, which explains the pay. It was easy in the sense that it didn't really take critical thinking, but it did drain you physically. It's a good job to have if you just need some extra money but if you're looking to advance don't do it. I tried my hardest to unload faster than anyone else, clean up better than it usually is. I would even go through retail while we're waiting on a shipment and have not much to do and help pick up some of the clothes that the customers knocked on the floor, as well as neatly refold some things. Caught the attention of some people, but didn't really go anywhere, just a pat on the back. They do notify you of open positions but just because you've worked there for (x) amount of years doesn't mean that some new person with more experience in that field wont take it from ya."
good,"I enjoyed working for macys warehouse, i was always busy and on my feet. great management and was offered a god amount of hours. I learned a great deal of skills and have further developed them. I am now able to apply for other jobs with the skills that i have been taught."
good,"Comfortable and welcoming work place.  Everyone that worked there was extremely friendly and helpful.  It was fast-paced and tiredsome but fun.  The managers were very patient and tried to train and demonstrate expected tasks and assignments thoroughly but quickly.  Some days they scheduled to many of us employees for the same shift and same section / product of the store (ex: 6 ladies all working 5-9pm in the womens handbag section with only one register) , which was very uncomfortable and crowded for the customers as well. We were able to take a few minutes break when we needed it though."
good,"This job was very competitive. I worked on commission plus hourly rate and it just never worked out."
good,"My experience at Macy's was wonderful. It taught me so much and brought me out of my shell. It is a tedious job, but in the end it was worth it. You learn customer service, time management, patience, interactiveness, and how balance stress."
good,This is a very fast pace working place.very flexible working hours .However this was a temporary job position.Its also a very competitive working environment.
good,"They are an amazing place to work, very fast pace, time goes by quickly, management is amazing. The pay is great and I loved working with such a great team."
good,The managers are great to work for and lots of interaction with the customers. It's a fun place to work but the pay is awful. You can learn a lot about fashion.

good,"Place was very laid back, we could have our phones on the floor and listen to music. "

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,"Great place to work, with possible growth opportunities. Excellent employee perks and commission is offered in some positions. Work environment is stressful at times but has its benefits. Met a lot great people and able to work flexible hours."
good,"A lot of work with little pay. Part-time does not get benefits. Management does their job and the culture is pleasant. You can pick your schedule if you need more hours."
good,It's fun to work here the store is just small and doesn't carry a lot of product and people aren't paid that much. I have a lot of experience in retail so feel I should make more per hour
good,Love working at Macy's such a lovely wonderful place to work and have a steady lovely job. I enjoyed the pleasant work place no pressure and tough working conditions
good,"Good place to work part time, and good schedule to work also. I like the employee discounts and the management was really good to work with. The only reason i quit this job is because i moved"
good,"Fun co-workers.  Respect each other and great teamwork."
good,"speaking with customers about recent purchases, damages, or wrong size in clothing that was either purchase online or in store. the enjoyable part of the job was the macys discount."
good,Macys is a very nice company i got lot of experience form there they believe on providing excellent customer service to all customers. Macys do a lot of charities.
good,the store closed and I was laid off. the first manager i reported under was easy to talk to and get along with.  the second manager was strict and difficult to talk to
good,Macy's was an enjoyable place to work.  There was lots of employee engagement and activities for employees to participate.  Macy's was major corporate sponsor in the community.

good,"Can get extremely busy especially on certain holidays , excellent customer service is defiantly key. Time management has to be very precise and efficient. Certain customers may come in store with coupons have to be very careful to make sure coupons are still in effect and hasnt expired."
good,"Excited day every day here at macy's all kind of things going on day and night, Some employees will help you and some won't but, then they turn around and need your help. I enjoy working there with the people who I was working with in my department."

good,people where great in my department at least. Managers was poor. Part timers don't really get no hours at all. you have to pick up your own hours. Mangers wouldn't put you on schedule
good,"good job,all the managers are very nice and friendly. You are told what to do and they leave you alone. the managers go out of their way to work with your needs."
good,"You do get discounts, fun place to work for depending on the department and the associates. Closing can be hard  at times. Get wot work with great people."
good,"Supervisors were very understanding, co-workers fabulous to work with, workers willing to teach you the ropes, excellent environment, and easy to suggest ideas to help with making duties less time consuming and help with keeping areas neater/organized."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"In a nutshell it was a learning experience. every time i worked i always wanted to go back. yes its a fast pace, no slacking,environment but i always knew what to do and how to do it. I learned how to multitask, switching from cashier mode to recovery."

good,"Great place to start off for experience and very easy to get the hang of, good place to meet people and get your speech skill improved"
good,I enjoy working at Macy's.  Very busy environment. Most the most part the management was on point.  Macy's different access to get the customer what they need.
good,Interacting with customers; demonstrate and giving mini facial and applying make up. Keeping papers in order and reaching goals . The best part was making people feeling beautiful the hardest part doesn't really apply to this kind of job.
good,Good employer but hard to work around schedule for school other than that its good experience i would still be there if i wasnt in school not alot of hours .
good,I totally enjoy working at Macy's. The managers are a pleasure to work for and the employees are wonderful. The only setbacks are the pay and there is no room for advancement. I am an asset to any employer and feel that I am not being paid what I am worth.

good,Learned a lot of new things. The staff was definitely supportive. Real team players. The holiday season was very busy and challenging.

good,"this company is a good way to learn how to handle money, even though you cant not advance when working in the office and you don't received enough hours. for as the money and travel time to work was a waist of time. experience wise it was great."
good,"great company to work  , open store 2 to 3 days a week, greet customers, cash handling, provide excellent customer service"
good,Working with people from around the world in one of the biggest department stores in the world. It is amazing also to have a huge team to work with because it makes things a little easier and a bit more interesting.
good,I loved working strictly weekends. The dress code and work pace was simple and i enjoyed it. The healthcare was over priced for minimal coverage. Leadership roles changed every year and more than once managers had to be trained by their employees.
good,macys is the store that when holidays roll around you want to be there you want to help shoppers for all over the world come to our nation and see that our values are just the same. i learned that people matter people fuel our stores our personality even our way to bring happiness globaly and economically. management well lets just say we all do not share the values for people.never a hard part if there was one then i thinkit would be to stop smilling.and the enjoyable part why would you want to not smile its macys.

good,great place to grow and learn the business and a multitude of skills. surrounded by peers who are talented and can challenge you/share best practices.
good,A typical day at this job was fun.  What girl doesn't like to play with clothes.  I would start by moving the clothing on the sales floor around. I did this to make room for the new stuff coming in off the shipment.  I would then pick out a few outfits for the mannequins to wear.  I would spend the rest of my time interacting with customers as well as co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of support from management.
good,"I work full time, usually a 7-8 hr day. I look to see what needs to be done as far as my area being ready for customers. Day is spent making connection with customers, showing them the items they are looking for and suggesting add ons if needed. Good customer service and client book.merchandising when necessary and markdowns if found."

good,"great place to work with friendly employees and great hours"

good,I love working at Macy's. The management and location of the store plays a key role. I love working with customers; it gives me satisfaction to help people find what they were looking for.
good,A typical work day is a quick review of where you will work. Sent to various parts of store to organize and clean and straighten departments. Managesment is very helpful in the training.

good,Cool and relaxing place to work. Nothing hard at all. Easy money in my opinion. All the employers are nice and the days go by real quick.
good,"This particular store is doing quite well and it's fun to be involved in all of the  contests that we have. It's very motivating. Because it's retail the scheduling is a bit confusing and sometimes hard to follow. But you do have the opportunity to have a preferred schedule in place. Co-workers are pretty helpful and very knowledgeable about their lines and were able to help me learn a great deal about customer recruiting which is a new tactic for me. The most challenging aspect is getting people to open credit cards. There is a lot of pressure to do it and the fact is some people are really good at it while others are not. I think it should be a departmental goal. The most enjoyable part is playing with the product! putting it on the client, letting them smell the product, letting them feel it, giving her a complimentary facial. Knowing that I am selling a quality brand of cosmetics and working with a nationally respected company like Macy's is an added bonus."
good,I love this store. It is really great co workers and eployee discount

Hardest part of the job was just the long hours when it wasn't busy but other than that I really have nothing bad to say.
good,"A typical work day at Macy's was even tempered.  There was medium to high traffic in all departments.  Holidays of course had very a very high volume of traffic, specifically Christmas.  I learned to multitask and to work as a team, as well as build a strong rapport with customers.  My manager was never at work.  I believe out of the entire time I worked there I saw her/him maybe ten times.  The managers are pretty busy with other projects.  Very helpful co workers.  The hardest part of the job was determining which ""boss"" to listen to.  As I said, my manager was never there so Instructions would come from managers from other departments.  The most enjoyable part of the job was effectively helping customers and learning new skills."

good,"Macy's is a great place to gain experience and have fun. Watch out though it is fun to shop...the store management has a lot to do with the atmosphere, I've worked at two stores and the second was horrible. The management at the second store only pretended to be involved and that made it tough to take them seriously. I saw a lot of changes during my employment but paid vacation and decent schedule control are huge. Be prepared to work and have fun helping customers and you will go far."
good,"protect the company's assets. Perform internal and external surveillances using detection and investigation systems.

The most enjoyable part of this job was the friendly atmosphere. everyone was very nice and customer service was excellent."
good,"Being in visual provided the best schedule in retail! I worked monday-friday from 7-4. The new points system for attendance is still finicky, I was losing points when I only had a 10-minute window to arrive in the morning that was well within the set time limit to clock and not lose points. Although points are not the reason I left, many longtime employees were let go for that."
good,"My day-to-day experience at Macy’s consisted of individual work assignments, that were issued at the beginning of each shift; working in the A.S.T. department provided me the opportunity to learn more about HR software. The management team worked in tandem with their subordinates in order to accurately execute all of the applicants’ hiring process. Working closely with the management team, allowed for an energetic, fast paced work environment.  Conducting a training session that consisted of 70+ candidates proved to be challenging, due to the extensively intricate hiring procedures. However, I truly enjoyed the interpersonal communication with each one of the applicants, and the cohesive teamwork that my counterparts and I shared."
good,"To be honest, it’s a great work environment and I love the family like feeling of this job. However, The pay isn’t all that good if you are a parent.."

good,Decent pay and job. They have multiple positions you can work in. The training could be a lot better and leaving you in one position for awhile so you can learn it would be a great plus instead of moving you around so much and expect you to remember exactly what you gotta do for each area.
good,"Work at Macys is FUN and FAST before you know it  the holidays are over. I loved the people here and the manager was great. If they like you they are likely to keep you. flexible schedule,  pay is OK as long as you have  hrs."

good,I enjoyed my experience at Macy's they just weren't able to offer the amount of hours per week I needed. But overall it was a fun and great job to have
good,"There are a couple of managers in the the store but my personal manager is super awesome (she is in charge of me and one other person). I personally work in the HR office/department but sometimes i am able to work as a regular cashier. Through my encounters with working floor managers as a regular associate and as management, I can openly and honestly say that there is alot of favoritism and the only thing they care about is sales sales sales"
good,I believe in working hard and working smart I think you should get along with your employees and also get along with your people that you're serving inside of the restaurant I believe you should always work as a team and also help out your teammates if needed
good,"Fast paced environment with different opportunities to explore flexible hours , Competitive pay. Macy’s is filled with great attitudes and energetic spirits"
good,I love Macy's it's a fun work place and you will have discounts and you will meet a lot of people from a different area. Such a nice place to work indeed.

good,Very fun lace to work. Always meeting me people. And having regular customer was best part of my job. Enjoyed have the flexibility of picking up hours as needed or dropping hours when unable to be there.
good,I like my surroundings. The work environment is like a family atmosphere. The team leader and manager are exceptional and say thank you every day you leave to go home. Makes you feel appreciated.
good,"Typical retail job.  There are some problems with customers trying to ""return"" high end items for cash, but that is at any retail job and you do receive training on how to properly deal with those situations.  Otherwise, the job was easy and it worked around school times."
good,"I was a seasonal for the Thanksgiving-Christmas-New Years season, and it was pretty hectic. But I'm the type of person to like hectic, so it felt fulfilling."
good,Working in macys was easy the only issue I had was lack of communication and trust with the mangers. The only good thing in working there was getting out at 2 pm and not dealing with customers.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys was easy but didn't give many hours I would go two weeks without hours. full time employees are priority. it is hard to advance. For someone in highschool or college this would be good job, well if you have no bills."

good,Good company. Retail giant in transition. Exciting field. Worked in multiple locations. Great enthusiasm. Appreciated employees and training. Very good
good,"Macy is a great place to work but I have never worked harder.  You do have a lot of fixing  problems yourself which takes pressure off of management. Most times you work alone but part of a team.  I did love my customers, they made my job fun.  When possible I would get inventory, yearly inventory, We did get as full time and hour for lunch but no time for a 20 minute brake"

good,"I loved my job at the call center. There was room for advancement, raises, lots of company activities. The distance was a little far, but I worked 12:30pm-9:00pm so, the traffic was mild. Very understand managers, for the most part. The hardest part of the job was learning the products that we sold."
good,If you like being on your feet all day. Go for it. Depending on which one you work at you’ll never be bored. I loved the customers but Macys changed the rules on coupons and everything else every other day. It was tiring to say the say things over and over again. Then customers would get mad at us as if it’s our rules. & the managers doesn’t appreciate or understand us.
good,Laid back but employees who have been there for a long time feel superior they have lots of favoritism and the older people are as always rude n act like your not as important as they are

good,"Macy's is an iconic retailer and I had a great experience.  Unfortunately, they are struggling to remain relevant and profitable, and that causes annual restructuring.  Day to day experiences as a Macy's manager is great, but the uncertainty of employment year to year is stressful."
good,Macy’s is sometimes fun and sometimes it’s okay it all depends where and who is the manager.  Most of all the pay is not so great but the discounts are good.
good,"I typical day is unloading truck, setting sales, customer service, stocking the floor, recovery and cashier. Good job for workers with benefits and incentives."

good,"Macy's was a very nice work place. We were trained to meet the need s of all of our customers and when were uncertain regarding certain things we were guided to seek help from our fellow associates or management. As a beauty Consultant, the most enjoyable part of the job was transforming customers while making them feel beautiful and encouraging their lives. The experience was so rewarding and the customers left happy and satisfied."
good,I started working for Macy's when I was in college. I worked primarily at night or on the weekends. It was fine because everyone I worked with was great. It was fun at work and after work. I learned a lot about retail. After graduation I joined their management training program which also provided excellent training for every position to which you were elevated. The part I liked most was that you would get promoted from a store-line job into a home-office  job and it went that way until you went as far as you wanted to go.
good,"Working in the cosmetic department, was a fun and competitive environment. Each purchase is commissioned, so selling the most was always a goal. Along with opening daily credit card accounts"
good,Very busy and hectic at Christmas but liked floating around to different deparments. Started out with cleaning out dressing rooms never ending piles of clothes on the floor of each room!  Don't apply for that job at Christmas!  Just know you will be working your butt off.
good,"Typical work day would include being responsible, efficient and cheerful in performing my responsibilities to the best of my ability. Enjoying people and providing a professional  and pleasant work environment for all involved is my goal. My relationship with management has always been great in any job I have worked.

The most enjoyable part of any job is the positive relationships with the people around you."
good,I loved that I was able to learn something new everyday. There is room to moving in the company. Customer service is priority. I was able to meet customers from all over the world.

good,everyone one is productive and willing to work and take on to helping others. There is always work to be done and some one around to help to complete a task for others.
good,"Macy's overall is a great place to work. The management changed so much, that all the changes were exhausting, Made it hard to keep up. Not all changes were for the best, customers were complaining, and no room to shop"
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing up customers, helping them find what they need, working multiple departments at once due to lack of coverage, and everyone calling out. Sometimes it was extremely hectic. Winter working was amazing, any other time of the year... no."
good,"A sales associate provides service to customers. I learned that the customers are super because the more they purchase the fewer I put on the floor. also, its all about the attitude and how to behave with customer. building a good relationship with managers helps a lot to make the work more smooth and more productive. the hardest part of my job when the customer ask about more discount so I try my best to make him satisfied and at the same time follow my work policy. being in touch the customer is my favorite part, welcoming them and telling them our newest offers and encourage them to buy and open new charge to save more and make sure that the customer leave with smile."

good,"I love working for Macy's and have worked at a couple of stores "

good,"Working at Macy's was a great experience for me. I've encountered many didn't kind of people which taught me how to be patient and how to become what our customer need. Everyday at macys was busy rather it was organizing or simply helping out a customer. The hardest part of the job at Macy's was the coupons. Sometimes the coupons wouldn't work with the purchase the customer wanted so the customer would get angry and upset at me. but what I've learned from working at Macy's was to always stay calm and apologize to the customer and fix the problem right away. patience is key and being understanding with the customer. The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's was bonding with the customer. Getting to know how the customer while helping them find a gift or something to wear for a wedding or vacation , you really get to know someone in such a little time while shopping."

good,"Working at Macy's as a Freelancer was pretty dope for me, i really enjoyed it and my schedule was very flexible. The management there was great and i loved and got along with all my staff's. The hard part of this job was approaching customers to make a sale's because i've always been very shy but after a while once i got use to  it all it wasn't a problem anymore. It helped me to not be so shy and to be more out spoken. Overall it was a good experience time flies by so fast because you constantly have something to do, it can be a bit overwhelming addressing every customers needs and some tension from associates because at the end of the day we are all competing to reach our daily sales."

The hardest part of the job is not being able to locate or order an item the customer really wants. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer comes to our store in a terrible mood ends up leaving with a smile happy that I took care of them with what ever they needed."

I will assist customers in any purchases they intend to make or help them with anything they aren't too sure of so the shopping experience for them is a enjoyable one, I will also bring to their attention sales we are having, macy's star rewards program and any promotions we have at the moment.

Around 2:00 PM we would usually get a 30 minute break. I learned from working here that I do not want to go from one dead-end job to another for the rest of my life. I just need a job to help myself get through school. My co-workers were very nice, and supportive, and professional. The hardest part of the job would be to stand, and lift boxes all day.

I learned so much from the visual manager at my location, and loved the criticism I received because I knew it would benefit me in the future.

good,"Often than not, my work days are exciting and fulfilled.  Mostly due to good nature fellow associates and warm, friendly customers that help make my job easy. I look forward to clocking in and starting my day with positive thinking knowing I'm surrounded by good people in a nice environment.  There are challenging days which can be the hardest part of the job resolving issues with an unsatisfied customer. My efforts are met with a good prayer and a state of calmness letting the customer know I want to assist and solve their concern.  I learn something new daily from new designer products or business incentives which, of course, increases my product and business knowledge inducing my job credibility and business skills overall.  I appreciate my managers support knowing that the majority of managers I reach out to for assistance are eager to help. Thus far, coming to work has been rewarding. There are often special days and events that take place at the job that are great employee incentives to look forward to and enjoy!"

I enjoy our leadership team, they are fair, professional, understanding, flexible, and real .  The most enjoyable part of my day is the regular clients I have, problem solving, and that no day is the same.  I love fashion and seeing all of the new things every season and I will say. The discount is awesome.   I learn every day at this job.  I learn from customers, co workers, and the leadership team.  I believe that a person can always get better at something or do something more efficient or better and because of that I take each day as a gift and a learning experience."

good,"As a Sales Associate I had a very enjoyable experience. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Which includes the store manager, managers, supervisors, associates and the customers. I learned quick and easily. The location was good being able to shop and go to restaurants near by. The only problem I had was the stores small size so it does not sell furniture, A lot of customers would ask about furniture, rugs and mattresses. So then explaining that there is none, it would surprise and confuse them. And having to go to a different location wasn't ideal for some. I would definitely recommend the job."
good,Macys is driven to provide a magical experience for its customers and associates. I have greatly enjoyed building strong partnerships. Macys provides an environment to be innovative and forward thinking.

good,I loved my part of my job packing and labeling was fun. I enjoyed the quiet and small work space with some new machines I learned how to work. My manager was very nice and co-workers were very nice overall. The hardest thing or more like the most unenjoyable part for me was having to go on the floor trying to find things in a two level building with all the customers.
good,Macy's was one of the greatest professional experiences I have ever had.  The company really favors customer service which is why they are in such great standings with the general public.  I would happily work there again if given the opportunity to advance within the company.
good,I enjoyed working for Macy's. Everyone got along really well and made it a good environment. I loved being able to talk to the customers.

What I learnt with this job was how to put together outfits with colors went with each other and all of the latest trends.  I enjoyed all of my co-workers.  The hardest part of this job was not being recognized for a job well done.  The most enjoyable part of this job was assisting individuals with their shopping experience.

good,Macy's is a large behemoth that moves rather quickly.  The team I worked with and for was top notch from a culture standpoint.
good,"This by far was one of my most favorite positions. Although I had several co-workers, I was assigned an area every shift, I did not hesitate to get started right away, I always finished my area early n went to other areas to help. My manager was amazing, he let me work at my own pace, let me get started on new projects or areas when my area was complete. I knew what had to be done and I was given the freedom to do my job the best way I could. I always finished deadlines on time, completed all my tasks, and also helped other co-workers frequently. The hours was perfect for me."
good,"The flexibility this job offered was very appropriate for me while there. I learned a lot from customers and staff - customer attention, supervising, presentation skills, accountancy and responsibility. Although flexible, it was often shift work during unsociable hours."

The management is strong there at Macys.I learned to multitask, build up my communications skills, make connection with my customers, open Macys credit cards and keep the customers coming back. the hardest part is doing everything at one time.

good,"I love what I do . Just looking for more hours and better pay. "
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's because it was a very fast paced environment therefore it kept me on my toes. My coworkers were very positive and they taught me to remain positive no matter the situation to maintain a comfortable environment to work in. The hardest part of my job was the scheduling.It was hard to make plans for the future when the schedule was computer generated and never set. Over all i loved the opportunity the company gave me to be their employee.
good,"Macy's is a company that cares about their associates.  They thrive on providing a face paced, fun working environment.  Macy's is dedicated to the training and advancement of their associates and is always striving to be the best company to work for."
good,"pretty routined.."
good,Great company to work for they treat employees with respect and value.
good,"A typical work day consisted of stocking merchandise, pricing merchandise, as well as signing the merchandise. We would also move fixtures, and rearrange parts of the store. The management was great and very fair and understanding, and the co-workers all got along well. The hardest part of the job was coming in every morning at 5:30 am. The most enjoyable part was working, there was always something to do, and a very nice environment."
good,"Meeting great people to work with, assisting a variety of customers"
good,"Love the coworkers, the customers, I loved the job in general. Only bad parts were not alot of hours and if you had hours sometimes they would have to cut the little bit of hours to even less. And you really don't get paid alot."
good,"Good job environment."
good,I loved Macy's. I just wish I hadn't worked at the one I worked at. Good news is I learned a valuable life lesson from my manager. Sometimes even though you try so hard and do everything right some  people will find it impossible to like you due to their own internal conflicts. Learned this for free at Macy's. Loved the outlook of the company would of loved to have that career with them. This could of been possible  if I wasn't told there was no way for me to advance based on????? I asked why and I still don't know. All I know is I'm a hard worker and that's all that I can be. Based on the no hope to grow in the company speech I received from the store manager. I chose to leave but I'm on good terms with the company. They asked me to reapply for another store but needless to say I don't feel compelled to go back. I was only 22 when my store manager told me I would never amount to anything at Macy's for literally no reason and that hurt for a 22 year old to hear embarking on life as a professional adult.
good,The Thing that I like with this job is I have to dress up and meet people. The managers treat us well and Ive also learned to work as a team. I find my co workers helpful and cooperative although we compete with each other at the selling floor. I enjoy this kind of job because I meet all kind of people so Ive learned to adjust to each of them.
good,"Developed weekly sales and projections to disburse to department heads and vendors.  	Performed quantitative and qualitative researches, and investigated problems with projected sales figures and strategy agreements. Setting up advertisements. Responsible for the clothing line from arrival to the selling floor.  Hardest - was leaving after 13 years but I knew that there was going to be a change in Management and layoffs were possible.

good,"You'll work hard, but the company takes good care of its managers. Great paid vacation and benefits, but long days and tough schedules."
good,all the managers and co-workers were very helpful. they also value other cultures.
good,I worked in a team invironment processing business douments account payable accounting and vendor relations.  The management was very progressive and rewards were related to individual achienvent and productivity.  The most difficult part of this position was dealing with the high volume and the large retail environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being involved in a team and being rewarded fairly.
good,"Scheduling is not really flexible, but other than that it's a great job/"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Greet customers, apply make up, restock and have fun."
good,"I learned how to read a floor plan for products and how to properly restock a floor of merchandise. The most enjoyable part was being able to have a conversation while getting things done. The hardest part of the job was climbing the tall ladders and making room in the stockroom for all the merchandise coming in for the holidays. It was almost impossible to find the room. Management was good, a little sporadic. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful when I first started and helped throughout the job."
good,Macy's Inc. Has been such pleasure to work with.For the time I worked there I've learn alot & got the opportunity to meet & work with such great people.
good,"A responsible position where the fields of my high-level skills of cashier, retail, customer services, and home health aid skills are utilized, I have high-level technological skills working with math, and computers."
good,"Overall MACY'S is a good company to work for, if I had a better manager and supervisor I would still be employed with the company. They are ran on a credit system that I don't agree with."
good,Job is very physical but the people around me make work enjoyable.
good,my co-workers were awesome. My supervisor was the best made the work environmet very enjoyable.
good,my co-workers were friendly and always willing to help each other
good,"Overall a good place to work. If you are good at sales, you will be compensated well, otherwise you won't."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was giving customers an excellent shopping experience. I enjoy paying attention to every single customer that walks in the store and making sure they are more than satisfied with their shopping experience.
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers with sales, repairs,and returns. We also keep a constant security count of all of our jewelry with precious stones. If I open I remove all of the jewelry from the safe and display it. If I close I remove all of the jewelry from the displays and secure it in the safe. We have many security rules that we must apply everyday in fine jewelry, from counts to securing our keys, and checking and setting the alarm. There is a team of 6 that have been chosen to work in fine jewelry. We work as a team, and although there are very different personalities in our department, we all enjoy each other and work together well. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping our customers. I love what I am selling and to help our customers make an important purchase that they are happy with is very enjoyable for me. There really isn't a hard part to my job. I only wish that there were more hours available as I am at a point in my life were I would like to work full-time."
good,"I loved working with this company, management team was great, employees where even better. I established a wonderful, friendly relationships with lots. Discounts where good, including store bucks."
good,I learned that the work satisfied alot of people and it gave me that connection to the others.
good,Macys was a great stepping stone for me due to the fact that I one day would enjoying attending Fashion and design School.

good,"I helped the customers with their needs such as making calls about orders and shipments, cleaned the sales floor along with employee stations and helped the customers find whatever they were looking for."
good,The workers at Macy's created a feeling of cooperation and team work to help their fellow employees learn the methods of the company.
good,there was no room for advancement at my particular Macy's. Union wasn't helpful in any problems with employees.
good,Working at Macy's was one of the best jobs I had so far! They are very helpful when you need help and understanding. Everyone there is also very nice!
good,"really friendly environment, good pay to start off, hard working environment"
good,"There are ways to make more money than just a paycheck. Read the handbook! Its helpful. Open Credit card accts & the compensation is great."
good,"The company was wonderful to work for. I have zero complaints and they are very accommodating regarding interview time, start dates, etc. Customer service department would be busy but I did not ever feel overwhelmed."
good,"I love working at Macy’s because it allows you to be creative in the way you want to succeed. I’ve worked in programs where they have strict routines and steps that you must follow and don’t allow deviation. For those programs, anyone can fill the spot so it’s a waste of skill"
good,"Great place to gain skills to advance not only inside the company but will definitely help you in another. As long as you let them know you want to grow, they will support you and help you get to where you want to be."
good,I love the store...associates not friendly at all  ....overall good place to work...you have to create your own atmosphere...customers are really nice...management is ok..
good,Working with Macy’s is a very convenient job that offers great flexible service.& is great with putting customers first to make sure they leave with a smile
good,"Amazing place to work at while at school. They are very flexible and they work around your schedule if you have a good manager. However, it depend s on location and those in charge."

good,Everyone is very family-oriented they work together as a team it's a very fast-paced environment but it makes the day go by a lot faster. they also like to hire within when job opportunities become available which is a good thing so you have first pick it
good,"Loved working here.  Employees welcome you and make you feel at home. I’d advise you have some experience in sales because it’s all about commission. Weekends and holidays are a must if you want to make money. It’s a fun place to work so you won’t mind. Averaged about $350 per week if you pick up hours and sales. If not, about $150. You get paid weekly."
good,It's slow but that's why they keep you busy so you don't have to look at the clock for the time. I learned to have a cut off moment like a time of the day when i gotta calm down
good,Great staff and management. Wonderful trainers too. Great flexible scheduling. Great Staff. Nice encouragement. For the pay it's worth working here. Good
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Love staff and the store manager.  She proves herself time and time again. On how important the customer service is. You learn very quickly that you're important.
good,"- I love being of service."
good,I lovvvved the job and the work environment. It was a very nice place to work with good perks and nice pay. I did however get layed off after the holiday season so job security is not there with this company.
good,Cannot review bc I was only there for a month and because of scheduling and being part time I never got past the training. I do love the Macy's store and the atmosphere is friendly.
good,I liked working there really high pace job great pay great coworkers free lunch sometimes. The customers are real friendly and they let you work in any department if you choose to
good,"Working for Clinique at Macy's was fun, exciting, engaging and wonderful to work with new customers each day, giving me the opportunity to become the Macy's Magic Maker.  See Resume regarding this Honor."
good,Just what you do if you have a day to come into work please make sure you do and they have this new thing with having to leave on time too smh I mean unless you are helping a customer
good,"My work at Macy's was really exciting,  i think is one of best company I've work,  i love the all departments special the woman's shoes department.  Their products are the best , good brands,  also the benefits ."
good,"I've worked over the holiday season it was worth it and many hours, but after the season you are on flexible hours. Make sure you are on time and there on your schedule. The other great thing if you can not make it to work and you know ahead of time you can switch with another accsocaite or avertise your shift."
good,"I personally love working at Macy’s, keeps me busy 24/7 and all colleagues are super sweet and nice!! Management actually care and will hear you out about anything. By far the best retail job that stays true to their word."
good,Really enjoyed working at Macy's and getting to meet amazing coworkers and customers. Working in Fine Jewelry was an amazing experience. Learned a lot about diamonds and  precious stones.
good,"Very diverse, friendly staff, flexible schedule. Good location. Management encourages growth. Employee discounts. Over time available. Need more staff during busy times."
good,"Sales recievesd bonuses, Macy's money, and so much more. They do not even supply enough donuts for support. There is no coffee and hardly any cups for water coolers. Without support there would be no sales. How are we the least rewarded and lowest paid?"
good,Macy's carries a good selection of clothes and household items made of good quality. They aim to please the customer and there return service is also excellent.
good,Very easy place to work as long as you understand the proper way of doing things. You are often expected to do work of more than one person due to short staffing however it can be a fun place to work.
good,"I left retail work in 2002 for a different career path for morning hours, so i can hang out at night.I was out of work and applied to have a job for the holidays to have money in my pocket and it was the best. The Management staff and associates were friendly everyday."
good,"I think that Macys was a learning experience and it help me grow as a people person,management was the strength that every person need to groom themselves"
good,About the only downside is they couldn't keep me. I got to do jobs that meant minimal interaction with customers. I got to know my bosses and coworkers they were all nice.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I'd recommend working here if you need retail experience and some cash-flow. Full time sales associates get around 28-32 hours a week and the pay isn't that great. Besides that, the work atmosphere and my experience with the managers were very nice. Customers weren't too bad either. The only problem is that the only time you can get overtime is during the holidays, which kind of sucks if you're looking to work 40 hrs consistently throughout the year. Other than that, it isn't too stressful unless you aren't comfortable selling credit cards and adding clients, but you shouldn't be applying for a sales job if you aren't anyways. "
good,"The opportunity for growth within the company is endless.The hardest part of being an executive at Macys is short staffing at times, yet always busy. You will wear many hats. Keeping your team motivated and positive was challenging at times, but always rewarding."
good,I loved working there but I needed more hours and went to work for Journeys Shoe Store when I left there.  I have considered working there again if the opportunity arises.
good,I enjoyed working at Macy’s both times I worked there. Wish I could have stayed full time after the seasonal period but I wasn’t that lucky. Easy job especially if you like working in retail and don’t mind the customers.
good,"Working at Macy's was ideal for when i wanted to occupy my time with busy work, such as answering phones, cleaning the fitting rooms, and assembling the floor displays. The Management did not work well with the student workers (myself included) which in turn led to my leaving the company."
good,"The people who work there are so professional and cool, even the managers. It was definitely a great place to work in. I definitely felt welcomed the minute I started working."
good,"If you want to try different positions in one organization, this is the place to try it.  You meet so many great people here and this is what makes you stay and try to meet the challenging days in retail with your co-workers.  The pay is low, but since the atmosphere is great and the executives motivate you, you try to look beyond the pay.  I would go back without a doubt, if I wanted a retail career."
good,"I learned how to provide great customer service, coworkers were extremely helpful. As a seasonal I was able to expand my knowledge of the different work areas in Macys such as fragrances, cosmetics, home goods, backstage,etc."
good,"Typical work day was answering emails, pulling reports, scheduling travel for DVP following up on customer issues as needed etc. I learned that you need to be a self starter and a individual to seek out the information to do the job. Workplace culture was great had great giveback programs."
good,Macy’s is great! The culture could be more competitive but Macy’s didn’t advance the employee when time is appropriate. They provide you with benefits you don’t  get to use. As well as being particular with the way benefits are being used. Macy’s is short staffed with high turn overs. The sense of getting a high priority job means you have to show up and make necessary advancements: just to show consumers the Macy’s way is the best way everyone wants to be a star.
good,"Macy's is a great company to work with. Flex schedules, working with your personal life, commission is a plus. I enjoy working for Macy's due to it's work environment."
good,"My time at Macy's at The Bloc was an exciting time for me to grow professionally. Although I was hired for an entry-level Support Associate, I had great managers, shift leads, and colleagues who care about me. Yes I admit, working in retail is stressful; but, when I collaborated with colleagues and higher ups, my work becomes easier. For getting an entry-level job with little or no work experience, Macy's is the go-to employer."
good,"My time with Macy's was short, only about 1 year. I relocated and could not put in for transfer because the nearest Macy's to my new location was 80 miles away."
good,"Macy's is a fun place to work for a temporary position.  Management was super helpful, supportive, encouraging and overall positive.  Macy's seems to care about it's employees and is always rewarding them with special events, parties, lunches, balloons, etc.  Everyone was very friendly no matter what job they held.  I really enjoyed working with the temporary hiring phone team.  The people were very diverse.  The hardest part of the job was the monotony of the work interviewing people over the phone reciting the same script. BUT at the same time it was very rewarding hiring people esp. during the holiday season when people really needed a job.  I really liked talking to people all over the country!"
good,I do enjoy working at my current job. However I am looking to see what other kinds of inside sales are availiable. I feel what I have done at macys is very enjoyable.
good,"I enjoy the job because of the people I work with, the managers I work under and the customers I serve. I like helping people so its nice when I am able to help them find what they want."
good,"Pretty good job. I like what I do, it's the right amount of challenging, and I never feel bored. I'm given the tools I need to do the job correctly. Also I like my coworkers"
good,I would open and close register wait on customers hung clothes took to departments made deposits at end of night  I also filled orders in the morning cleaned up worked in different departments
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy’s has always provided me with a very welcoming and comfortable environment to work in. Had a great and fun time being a part of the Macy’s Team..
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's because I liked the merchandise. I also had a great team working with me in the impulse department. I would definitely work there again.
good,"Great service , not so many hours to receive work. Over all I loved the job just wish there were giving more hours to work and make money! The managers are great"
good,At the beginning this workplace was the best place to work but after that when ever you have different management everything change because everybody is not manage the same the way.
good,"A typical day at Macy's was very relaxing. Recovery was only hectic during the holidays. In recovery, I did a lot of folding and organizing. The manager would made it easy to transition to areas that needed the most work to areas not so disorganized."
good,"Awesome place to work, management very professional and engaging without being too intrusive. Always had the tools to do my job properly, job security was excellent."
good,A typical day at work would be a morning rally talking about our daily goals in accordance with our quarterly goal. The management team aren't breathing down our necks which is nice. I will say that the management team relocates a lot and the draw commission goal is very UNREALISTIC. They have so many deductions and commission percentage is too low. There is 0 incentive to be apart of the commission team because of how little reward for such highly stressful job.
good,I enjoyed working at macy's.  it was a great experience. The mangers are very helpful when need and so where my coworkers. Working there will make you feel like that's your second home.
good,It felt great being apart of a hard working team.I felt welcomed and safe. I loved the customers they were all sorts of consumers from all over the world.
good,It was alright working there. Lots of people who are just as in the same boat as you. Rude customers here and there. Managers were nice while others were clueless. Don't work black Friday!
good,I worked there for 9 mths. I loved it. I started as Flex & shortly thereafter was hired partirme. Made great money during the holidays. Had to leave for personal reasons. Trying to get rehired.
good,"I loved going to work and being around happy holiday spirited people. We had fun huddles, management was always on their game...we followed procedure and I was happy to be a part of the team"
good,The most  enjoyable part of the job its a  Professional work environment you will learn every aspect of customer service. the hardest part of the job is standing all day. The starting pay isn't a lot you have to meet credit application goals.
good,"Very family oriented company. I enjoyed working there as a sales associate. Met many different people, Worked many departments-  bridal, fine china, small appliances, bedding. women's clothing. Fulton St. Macy's had area where you could go for breakfast, lunch, dinner.Most employees brought their own, we were supplied with micro-wave, soda, chip machines. I give Macy's two thumbs up!!!!"
good,Everything moves very fast when event begins. There is a lot of work setting up and tearing down events. We get to meet famous people.Great place to work
good,Great place to work at. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Everyone was nice and respectful. The employee's kept with company policy. Management seemed to only talk to the employees that were there full time not the seasonal employees.
good,"I enjoyed coming into work to familiar smiling faces, we all knew what needed to be done and set out tasks to complete. We all worked as a team but also had no problem working individually. Our manager in charge was a great leader and helped the team when we did not have enough people power. I learned that I could teach, lead and build a team to make sure we did our task correctly and in timely manner. The team was versatile in different areas and had great communication."
good,Working at Macy's was a Awesome experience. I got to experience the management position and the interaction with all employees. I got to know my regular customers and meet new people.
good,This job offers a lot if you are really into working retail. Most times this is a great way to branch off to more renowned retail stores. The pay is okay to start with but they give raises according to your work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My work experience at Macy's has been very enjoyable.  I am of the belief there is always something new to learn.  At Macy's I got to see"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at macys as a holiday associate. "
good,Macys was a fun place to work. I enjoyed my discounts. I loved learning the ins and outs of credit cards and how it works. Macy had good pay and tried to make the work environment fun.
good,"Good experience. Helped me grow and become more of a people’s person. Sometimes there would be some confusion being thats its such a big store, but I maintained it & got through the day."
good,"Greet customer , help customer look up items that aren't in the store and complete order. Range up customers purchases . Walk through the department that has been assigned to make sure items was properly put away in the right area."
good,Changing the sale then jumping into markdowns. I learned that it is extremely important to communicate about tasks with people when they are working in different areas or at different times.The hardest part of my job was when rules would change some people were just stuck in the old ways. The most enjoyable parts of my job is getting my team motivated and having great results at the end of the day.
good,A great company to work for!! Great working hours and compensation. Management was amazing at my location. Wonderful discounts on holidays and weekly sales
good,"While working at Macy’s, I was in charge of Fulfillment. I would collect orders off the floor, package them, print the shipping label, and finally place them in the designated location. Based on the amount of orders I receive on the given day, I could have a long day or a quick day."
good,"Working at Macy's is like working at any other job. You get out of it what you put in."
good,I enjoyed working at Macys. Its a very relaxing and enjoyable place to work.I enjoyed the customers the management was fair and I also love the different walks of life that comes through Macyss yearly.
good,I worked for Macy’s when I turned 18 and it was so much. They used to host events and fashions shows. I learned so much about the different brands. I loved it so much I ended up going to school for retail management and merchandising.
good,I learned very many things everyday I was working there but the amount of effort and work put into all just to get a swat of a pay is not for me. There was no hardest part on the job you either do it right or don't do it right then get yelled at.
good,"They really press the idea of selling people to get a Macys Card. Work environment is friendly and nice, each morning everyone rally's to get pumped up for the day."
good,"Every job does come with its own quirks, but despite this, I had the best time working with Macy's when I did. I didn't like some things that came down from the company itself, but I liked the culture and the co-workers that I worked with. My management worked with me and got to know me on a personal level and I am forever grateful for that. I miss my crew and still have times when I go back and see them."
good,"It was a breeze to work here. Friendly staff and easy going customers."
good,"Retail isn't too hard, so neither is working at Macy's. My team was great and we always stayed on top of our tasks making it a relaxed job. The tasks are simple and easy and everyone is always friendly."
good,"Help customers with returns and purchases. Restocks shelves and repairs or set up fixtures. At the end of the day clean out dressing rooms, count down register and deliver days receipts"

good,"I’ve been with Macy’s close to 10 yeras, Im really grateful for all of the opportunities and growth it has provided for me. Great learning place definitely"
good,Even though I work for the holiday seasons  I have learned a lot on different perspectives of fashion.  I enjoyed working with a team and the customers.
good,"Great for young adults looking for first time jobs, fast paced at times, very slow at others. Super friendly coworkers and fun achievable work. Lower level management was incredibly helpful at all times."
good,I have always enjoyed working for this company. They treat their employees with great respect. They understand that their employees have lives outside of work and give them the ability to have the power to change and switch shifts with others without management approval. They treat you as adults and allow you room to breathe without someone constantly looking over your shoulder making sure you are doing your job. We work together as a team and it's one of the places I have worked that I can honestly say I loved My job.
good,"Loved the ever changing environment of retail.  Sadly as another sign of the times, they have changed.  Eliminating positions, restructuring clothing they carry. It's no longer ""the"" place to shop."
good,Though I was just a seasonal part time employee it was a nice job to learn the ropes of retail. The hardest thing though was during the holidays and having to deal with so many different people.
good,"I worked, got paid, enjoyed my time with the company, good workers, good Bathrooms, good water, good Pencils, good shoes good clothes, good cleaning things."
good,Its a great work place.  I had to leave because of close death in my family. I would of loved to came back but i was replaced from the schedule. great place to be and to work
good,"slow days & kind of a medium pace job "
good,"A typical day consisted of changing out sales signs, stocking inventory, keeping the dressing room clean, moving inventory when needed and helping customers. I learned how to price items and to restock merchandise when needed. Management was helpful and friendly. The workplace culture was fun and friendly. The hardest part was moving around and being on my feet for several hours. The most enjoyable part was getting an employee discount."
good,is a great job but the management is not good at all they got a lot of mess with the employers thats all is fun to work there just they need to get better management.
good,Very up beat employee's that shows great customer service everyday . Positive employee's that spreads posotive energy in the workplace.Macy's is Fast pace that requires dedicated workers
good,I was hired for holiday work but I loved the discounts and learning more skills I placed orders for customers and did cashiering it was only temporary work.
good,My time with Macy's even if it was for a brief time was an exceptional one. I learned so much in so little time and caught on a lot of different jobs. Management was a wonder and employees were exceptional to be with. I would recommend anyone to apply.
good,Loading and unloading the trucks is not easy but if u work well with others and have communications skills everything will work out. The warehouse is really big they have everything in there and its always busy there is always something to do and you learn new things every day
good,gets busy at times but most times its slow in certain departments. People are friendly but competitive. You kind of manage yourself as to when you go to break and lunch. You do get an employee discount
good,"Macy's was very kind to me. Being a recent college graduate, I didn't quite know what to do with myself and my English degree. Macy's provided a nice environment to get my foot into the working world and make money with a relatively easy environment. Christmas and Black Friday was, as expected, rather stressful, but most customers were very kind."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"remove things off the truck, sorted them by department got them ready for the floor stripping the plastic off merchandise tagging want needed to be tagged."
good,"Great company, that really does care about the employees and the community.  There are lots of different opportunities and many career paths to choose from.  Your career is really up to you, and if you put it in the hard work you can move up easily."
good,"Fun place to  work.  Management culture of inclusion .   If Retail is your chosen profession , this is a great place to  work    Tv , coffee maker , refrigerator, microwave in break room"
good,"Macy’s is a good place to work over all but the management sucks  . Great people very friendly and helpful , need to give more hours to there employees."
good,"Great advancement for associates and other managers, HR restructure limited opportunities for HR personnel. I enjoyed the job but was stretched too thing. Years ago there was an HR Manager in each store, and they all had an assistant. Now they are eliminating in-store HR and will rely on a call center based HR function. It will be interesting how it all pans out."
good,Work independently but with a team to achieve high numbers to certain departments. Scheduled breaks and lunches. Start and stop times are also all set.
good,"My Experience working for Macy's logistics in Portland Tennessee, was excellent. this is a very well organized and productive company. they love their Employees almost as much as they love their customers. this work place is very fun and vibrant. this is a great place to grow and move up, and also meet people from around the world."
good,"I enjoy my time whenever I work there. Even I don't feel like waking up, when I interact with the customer, or see a friend, it makes it worthwhile. When I come to work, I clock in, and usually begin to check customers out. If there isn't a line, I will try to clean up around my area. Making sure clothes get out back in the proper place and speak to customer and make sure they're doing okay. The people I work with make the job even better and I've made friends quickly. I like that they don't seem like coworkers but more as friends who I can talk to. The hardest part of the job is that you're never really finished. There is always something to be done, clothes to put away, or a customer to help. The best part however, is knowing that I just made someone's day by helping them find what they need, or give them the information they needed. My managers, are very patient, and I personally have never had a problem with a manager. Overall, I like my job, know that I am very lucky to have it."
good,"Introductory sales experience. A typical day in the Women's Shoes Department includes serving a customer and providing them with correct shoe style and sizes. When they are ready for purchase, we check out the items at the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job is the happy and smiling faces in the company's atmosphere."
good,Good place to work good managers lots of fun always something new to learn about packing items from the store. Fellow employees very friendly always willing to help me with any problem i might have during any shift
good,"Never a dull moment. Not the same every day. "
good,"My typical day as a Sales Associate involves talking with customers about Macy's sales and promotions, cleaning up the sales floor, and asking each customer if they are willing to apply for a Macy's credit account. Very laid back job."
good,I enjoyed working here. I met a lot of people and ran into some friends I had lost contact with. I worked during the holidays so it was a very busy time. Everyone in the store was very nice. It was a joy to come to work.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the crew you work with and helping others learn the job and grow in the workplace. The management is awesome, my manager works with me through my school and work schedule."
good,"I worked at macys for over 6 months and I liked working there. Its more fun when you are cool with your coworkers and have someone to go through the work day with. I had friends in my department which is what made working there so fun. I would recommend fully, especially working on the first floor; juniors, active, jewelry, shoes, perfume, makeup etc departments."
good,You are able to be creative and lead your team with your own personal style. It is fast-paced but compensation is worth it (including an extra week PTO).
good,"Working at macys was a fun experience. On my first day they put me on the sales floor alone, so I was pretty nervous, but i did great, by the second day i was already a pro you can say, I had no choice plus a person can only really learn if you actually wanna learn. Overall it was fun."
good,The job is very laid back. The workers work as a team to complete orders. You will be standing all day at this workplace. This job helps you develop a work speed and have goals you must meet.
good,"Great place to work, but wish Macy's had a higher pay structure. Besides that, everything was fine. I worked at several different locations too. Had fun while working there."
good,"Based off commission. The culture of the job was very fun, but some employee's would clash because of sales (taking their sale). Overall the managers were easy to get along with and the hours were reasonable."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I loved working at macys .. fast working and i love associating and assisting customers .. i worked during thanksgiving holiday and was offers to work in cosmetics but i had to relocate downsouth to help my sick mother hope to one day go back to work there
good,Greet customers as they walk in the store assist the customer with finding their item I have learned to be patient the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers .The most enjoyable part is folding clothes cleaning messy displays helping customers.
good,Macys is a great place to work. If you need certain days off or have an emergency their system is almost full proof if you plan accordingling. This would be a great place to work for students and single moms. Most of the people are friendly some aren't but that's any job. This is the only job where you get yourself fired.
good,Macys was a great oppurtunity for a recent graduate.  They had the most recent technologies.  Career opportunities were limited which is the reason i left.  I would ask anyone to review and consider everything before working there.
good,This was my first retail job in a factory setting. I did enjoy having competition in the work place. Once every week we would have a meeting and the people with the most amount of units processed would be rewarded.
good,"Fun place to work. Fast paced environment. Learned a lot such as dealing with a difficult customer, making sure the merchandise has alarms on them and placed in right area."
good,"It was extremely difficult to get hours to work as the schedule for seasonals depends greatly on taking shifts that regular workers do not want. I never had a set manager or area to familiarize myself with and, in my experience, it was difficult to perform many tasks that I was expected to know, even though I was never given any such training aside from basic register functions. "
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's  I enjoyed with other people working at Macy's helped me out a lot the employees are nice the boss understand  me I went out on breaks
good,"Our competition were sales. But when i worked they counted as someone else who wasnt temporary. Not fair."
good,Productive and fun workplace.Lost of opportunity to develope personally and professionally.your typical day at work is face paced on your feet picking or packing.you can learn everything in the warehouse very good company at cross traning.Management seems fair.Hardest part of the job is communicating with lower level management.Most enjoyable part of the job is your left alone for the most part to accomplish your work.
good,My time while at Macy's was very busy and interesting. I was constantly busy showing customers products that they could use on the skin depending on what the issues were. I showed them how to do certain makeup trends that they wanted to learn. I also assist with helping people find the perfect smell for them or they wife/husband.
good,this is a great place to work management was not always the best but no job is perfect job recognition was good it's always great to hear what an awesome job you are doing it only makes you go harder
good,"I enjoyed working there.  Supervisors were nice.  Need more training. Walked about 10 to 14 miles a night in warehouse"
good,It was very relaxed and very patient supervisors. I learned how to use a scan gun. The hardest part of the job is you have to lift heavy items which was hard for me.
good,My work experience at Macys is amazing I love my Manager. My co- workers are awesome to work with. Everyone works together as a team. I couldn't ask for a better work experience.
good,"I worked part time.  Went in about 6 and left at 9:30"
good,"Great work environment. Management is knowledgeable and willing to help new employees learn."
good,"A great place if you need short 3 hour shifts a day for possibility 8 hour shifts a day. It depends on your job title. During the holidays, they encourage overtime work and the rewards are pretty good too."
good,"Customer service is their highest priority every day, and making a certain amount of sales. they would commend those who make the most sales each day. I didn't see very much room for advancement though, although they say there is. As a merchandising associate, I really liked my job and I made a lot of friends while working there. Everyone is friendly to each other and always willing to help anyone who needs it. the thing I had the biggest problem with though is the hours, they cut my hours severely towards the end of when i worked there to where I was only there maybe 4 or 5 times a month."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"macys was a great work experience for me, I enjoyed my time there and met many new co-workers. I learned to keep a good work pace as well as good work ethics."
good,"My manager is very helpful and helped me adjust to the environment better. Although i'm only an intern and my internship ends at the end of the month, I have enjoyed my time here"
good,Good and decent place to work at. No complain. Wish the store wasent closing  but regardless good team members and hope nothing for the best for the company.
good,"I love working for the customers and helping them with their issues. I have worked at various companies, I must say they are very pleasant and loyal to the Macy's brand"
good,"Every day is different than the next. Faced paced, exciting and highly functioning. You learn as you go which is an amazing opportunity especially in learning different policies."
good,I loved this place if I could change my situation I would love to get another opportunity to work here. they work on a point system that can work to your benefit or hurt you if you take advantage of it. the co-workers are wonderful like a big family
good,"Great place to work. Friendly employees. Great 1st retail job. Great training before released to the selling floor. "

good,"Customer is king! Customers always right!"
good,"As an energetic retail executive with a record of delivering both operational and merchandise success at store, district, region, and national levels, I thrived in this environment. I had the opportunity to launch 10 RTW Private Brands at the store level. My dual majors in advertising and merchandise marketing, and my ongoing business / management training, also give me an excellent grasp of targeting operations to increase profit and effectiveness."
good,"For the most part everybody lets you work and nobody really bothers you as long as you're working time flies by, managers are real nice and they offer extra hours often if you want them"
good,"Macy's hired me as a counter manager at a cosmetic counter, I do have my cosmetology License. My manager Chris was awesome! He always found ways to advance my business and promote my skills. The pay was decent because you get hourly and commission! The company sends you on makeup trips and pay for everything. You also get free products all the time! I loved my job at Macy's but unfortunately my Macy's in Maine closed down. I miss it a lot!"
good,"Great as a part time job, I really liked it. Especially the people I worked with & the regular customers that came in. I just wish the pay was a little bit more."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I enjoyed the ability to hone my customer service skills as well as my sales skills while working at Macy's.

good,"Macy's was a good company to work for. Good vacation benefits! Travel was good days were busy and fast paced. Cosmetics is event driven, so you were always planning and executing events to drive sales. Coaching and developing was a part of everyday. Recruiting for open positions. On boarding and training was on going."
good,Nice place to work with flexible hours.  You must be able to work with people and have strong customer service skills.  You must have thick skin  because you encounter all types of personalities.  The management is great to work for.  There are also sale goals to meet along with securing customer relationships..
good,"A nice and fun place to work; organized and have a system"
good,Macy's on 34th street was amazing place to work. Help me build greet organization skills and better customer service skills. Different cultures was there got to interact with a few. You just have to be ready to work. Folding clothes and dealing with a lot of different people. The job was seasonal for the holidays.
good,retail stores are always busy you just have to want it. you have to know what your working with you have to know the needs of your customers. get to know them.
good,Macys is a great company to work for but unfortunately retail is stuck in a prolonged downturn. Macys constantly adapts in an attempt to stay relevant and competitive. They have great overall leadership and will survive this tough climate.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I have worked at so many different locations for this company and have grown in different departments. I was the youngest of all working for Clinique which is a cosmetics/ skin care line for Macys and I was only 18 youngest to be accepted to work for such a high level position in store when I didn't have the most background in work at that time but I did have background in cosmetics.
good,I love my job for the most part but I am very irritated that my store is closing despite our sales being more than another store in our area. 109 great people will be losing their jobs and still we have no word if we will receive severance and things are not looking good as far as our ability to transfer to other stores.
good,"Wonderful workplace, feels like family. Lots of events... never a dull moment. There is help whenever you need it. The holidays at Macy's are incredible! Great employee discount."
good,"I just want to say that while working with Macy's I had so much fun there. I have learned many many things like customer service procedure, how to manage the customers, how to engage with the customers, P O S procedure, how to manage the stuff like clothes and everything they sell in store, where to place and what to place on the rack or table. The most of it I like to work in almost every department but the least I don't like is to clean the messy fitting rooms. Thank you."
good,it was a fast paced environment and a lot of young people that i could relate to on different topics.  they worked around your school schedule as well .
good,"I didn't care for the company all that much "
good,I loved it because of the workers and the customers. The managers were harsh a little bit but the one that was ahead of them was very good to the works and controlled the store very well. The lady that was the store managers ahead of other managers handled everything properly.
good,i give it a five star review great pay and your schedule is always full can always find an avalible shift. fun place to work
good,I have enjoyed working for this company. They do really try to work with you and help you improved in certain areas they feel you need to improve on. They do their best to help up to move up and if you a hard work they do see your work.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I got to learn the protocol set ups for retail industries, what works, what doesn't. How much time and effort it took to make changes to displays & sales."
good,"Retail- Busy, patience, fun.. Management was ok.. Co-workers very understanding, hardest part was the train ( do to Metro) Enjoyable part was the company the family of macy.."
good,"I really loved doing make overs on clients and then having them say wow and then having them purchase the products I used on them. It was such a great feeling helping clients pick out the right skin care products and new make up products. I loves it when I was able to teach them what colors looked best on them and how to apply the make up the correct way. It was a satisfying experience, when I would ring up the customer/ client who purchased all her new make up, thanks to my assistance."
good,"Macys is a great place to work and gain customer interaction. You may come across a few rude customers, but this will help build your patience and professional manners toward clients as such. I enjoyed my time working there, but to have as a career was not my interest."

good,"Maintained, stocked and ordered merchandise on a weekly bases. Maintained excellent customer relationship, securing trust and confidence through providing complete, accurate and timely service. Listen attentively in order to assist customers."
good,"This place was excellent to work for, but the management was way more worried about the way the employees dressed than the way that they worked. And the funniest thing about it all is that everyone dressed the same way, but some more fashionable than others."
good,"Productive, like working with team players.Everyone is on the same page when it comes to getting merchandise on display and selling them to customers."
good,The managers and staff are all welcoming and enjoyable to work with. Everyone treats the customers with respect and integrity even those like myself who work behind the scenes and have little customer interaction.
good,"I would take inbound, but some outbound call were I was calling to collect a debt on a customer's account. I've learned different possibilities a customer would have of not getting the payments made on their due dates, but gave proper professional gestures of how to stay current and manage money. Management is helpful through the assist line. Co-workers are very helpful when able to assist. Hardest part of a job is when you've explained a customer's account to them but they still don't understand all charges. The best of the job is helping customer understand their bills and taking lump-sum payments"
good,"Client and Staff Relationship Management∙ Administrative Support∙ Staff Training & Development∙ Billing, Collections & Cash Management∙ Policy & Procedure Development∙ Finance, Budgeting & Cost Control"

good,"Can be fun, consistently active, solid pay, busy work, good workout as a receiver, reasonable management, safe work environment, unfortunate surprise closing of dozens of stores including mine right after being told I'm retained & given a pay raise so that's a pretty hefty issue but that aside, lovely job as long as you're actually there to do your work."
good,A typical day at work would be cleaning the counters at the fragrance  department. I would also greet costumers and check them out once they have everything they wanted. I learned how to communicate well with people and how to work well with others.
good,Macys was a nice place to work. I meet a lot of new friends & I had a good time working there & learning their ways of working as an order picker
good,"I enjoyed my time at Macy's, this is my second term being employed with them. I first started working with Macy's in 1995 to 2000."
good,"tasks were easy to accomplish because they provide necessary tools like conveyor belts, flat beds dollies etc. and customer service was minimal because we were usually in the stockroom."

good,"Great position to work with people and an eye opening experience into the lives of others. Only could work five hours a day due to Department of Labor. My director was among one of the brightest people, it was great to have worked with her. My co-workers were hard working individuals, however, since it was AARP there was a lot of turnover. It was not a difficult job it you knew how do the job, which I did. It was a pleasant position with a lot of activity."
good,"The best part of the job was working with customers to help them resolve any issues with their orders. It was also fun researching clients credit history to help  them get credit for upcoming events ie: television series and movies."
good,The coworkers are definitely the best part at JC. The customers could be harsh. Pay raise is slight. The hours you work and schedule can be very flexible. You should always keep an eye on your online schedule because managers have a habit of changing it not too long before your shift. You have to have patience for this job.
good,its a great place to work if the right person was in charge.the work environment was clean and sanitized.many people stopped working because of lack of hours
good,I meet a lot of people with different personalities. Management is good. My co-workers are always friendly and always helpful.
good,"Working at  Macys was like going to work.... only I was inside of  my  own closet! The customers were quite often my friends and acquaintances so the daily conversations were filled with laughter and familiar faces. I truly look back on my time there with smiles and joy. Daily management meeting started the work day, briefing associates on sales and store events; this allowed co-workers to become familiar with new happenings as a team. The hardest and also the most enjoyable part of my job, I would say was trying to get through all the questions asked by my customers...I found myself wanting answers and wanting everything ""just so"" as much as they did it was hard not to get personally involved with every opportunity."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"At Macy's every day was different, always meeting new people as well as having some of the same great people come in everyday. I learned how to connect with people on a more personal level and I seen how different cultures all came to together for the same things with many similar styles. My manager was great she knew how to work with the employees and make them feel comfortable in the work place.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to help every customers needs. I enjoyed making customers happy."
good,"Call center setting but over night so its quite for the most part of the night. Co-worker was nice and friendly, management was also nice"
good,"Morning rallies were great kept people upbeat and ready to go. Very into the customers needs first, always giving great customer service."
good,Macy's is a great company to work for that helped me build excellent leadership and communication skills.Every day working here is a great experience.
good,"Provide excellent customer service, and maintain an appealing floor.  I learned how to manage other, my self, and time.  My co-workers were the high light of this position, making shifts fly by.  Management was lacking, and never gave true direction.  Hardest part of the job was maintaining multiple areas, and still providing excellent service."
good,I Andy Williams had to get up in and be in at 6:30 in the morning to unload truck and stock the stock rooms it was fairly easy was not to much heavy boxes I work different positions so it was always work loved the hours I also learned how to read the floor plan in the furniture dept.

Most of my co-workers are very work friendly and hard workers. I don't think that there is a hard part to the job, I believe that you can do anything you put your mind to. The time management is also very manageable. lastly, I love being able to engage with the customers and making them leave the store with a magical experience."

good,A great day at Macy's for me would be a productive sales situation: Customer walks in and wants a particular pair of shoes for her wedding party of 5. The shoes were highly exclusive and only available in stores across the east coast. Persistently and expeditiously I extended the Magic of Macy's customer service and called every store to ship those 5 shoes out to her residence. The customer ended up writing a great review about the extraordinary customer service we extended at Macy's.
good,Very fun and its a great atmosphere employees need to get along a little better but the way the employees are treated by the company and the steps they take to keep people excited i....it works
good,A typical day is usually not difficult. The department I work in requires loads of product knowledge that drives your sales. Management was usually quick and responsive. If you have their back they have yours. Most of the co-workers were friendly or at least easy to work with and everyone understands that sometimes others need help. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers or customers that want to haggles prices that cannot be changed. The most enjoyable part is helping customers choose items that they are truly happy with.
good,"I worked with this company for 7 years. It was wonderful at first , but after the economy went down  a lot changed. Good job if your in high school or working through college but not good if you have a family to take care of. Advancement was also slow due to politics within the company."
good,"For most applying for the call center they will be answering phone calls from customers about either an order placed, their credit card account or the purchase of furniture and bedding items.  However there are other teams that are offered such as e-mail and chat.  For the most part you come in everyday doing the same thing over and over.  Once basic job knowledge has been reached the job is simply it is just getting used to listening to customers complain"
good,"Competitive Department because it is commission based. Only problem is that if you do not match your commission, you are in deficit to Macy's."
good,Overall i would say Macy's was a pleasurable experience.  Although i was a seasonal employee  they had all sorts of incentives to make it a fun  atmosphere.  Difficult things on the job was when they had too many employees on the sales floor.
good,My immediate Supervisor taught many short cuts to get things done.
good,Being able to work before the store opens.  Being able to change all price signs out on the sales floor.  Being able to work with the signing and merchandising team and being able to achieve everyday goals.
good,"I like working at macys ... It's cool , but sometimes I feel like walking off the job."
good,"i work on the support team for Macy's, so I don't have very much interaction with customers. typically, you have to be at work by 6 am and work until 3pm at the latest, so its easy to work another part time job or go to school. The job consist of marking down items like clothes, handbags, etc. to new reduction and clearance. Although you learn how to do other jobs for the support team like setting sale signs throughout the store, processing and receiving new truck, and merchandising."

As a Holiday Operations and Staffing Executive, my day to day responsibilities included managing, supervising, and training a staff of over 25 associates on the store policies as well as resolving multiple customer services issues that may arise. Macy's provided an excellent environment to polish various human resource and administrative skills such as hiring and termination policies,scheduling, sales forecast management as well as interdepartmental communication. The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily interactions with various vendors, merchants and potential customers, while contrastingly the most difficult part was dealing with the multitude of issues that may arise with managing over 25 associates."

Trying to get a response from a claim I filed disputing my status is taking longer than expected. After speaking with the main office of the Macy's corporation I could not get an explanation as to why I was put on that list except for ""somebody may have entered that code in the computer wrong, because there is no explanation of why that code is in there. I would enjoy working there again. For people that live in Cumberland, the buses Macy's provides is wonderful and I commend them for that."

good,"I loved working at Macy’s as an interviewer. It was the best job I had! The only reason i left is because it was temporary. Management is very interactive with their employees. Very relaxing stress free environment. Paid every week. The pay was ok, but I rather have a stress free work environment! They had a lot of employee related activities going on. The position was very easygoing. A little friendly competition at times, but nothing major. Always room for Advancement. The best job hands down!"

good,I have learned the data analysis and how to track products in store and how to do Fulfilment also shipping and packing also how to work on the dock doing damages.
good,Its okay but it is repetitive and the hours interfer with life. It gets really boring and just being there is depressing. You can easily lose your job and friends.

I enjoy working there in the workplace environment. The hardest part of my job was helping customers find what they're looking for. The most enjoyable part of my job was running the register because i love communicating to the customers.

good,"Macy’s is a good place to work, there was never a doubt in my mind that it would be a terrible place. IIt can be stressful, but as long as you try, it’s a good place to get used to. You just have to keep trying in picking up shifts and not call out if your manager asks you to come."

good,I had a lot of fun working with Macys the environment was really laid back until the holidays came. I would recommend this job to anyone looking to work I retail.
good,"I did not work there long, the associates that i met where pretty nice. Store picking and receiving was very unorganized. The company still does everything by paper and i feel as though they need an upgrade."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, if I could I would go back. I really took my job seriously since I am a business major and really cared about meeting our sales goals to bad Im not working with them anymore"

good,"Flexible hours and timings. You got to pick your own time and day. Get to know different people coming from different background, overall a well mixed culture environment. 15 min breaks twice in a 6 hour shift. The only hardest thing of the job is to maintain good credits, you take one off and it takes whole 2 weeks to earn that credit back."
good,"I understand companies are different how they do things  but I thought Macy's would be more advanced in their technology, and other practices..."

All sales associates are expected to be helpful and engaging no matter what department you work in.

This was part of your job performance and would be address during evaluations and were measured quarterly for bonuses.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with and satisfying the customer. That includes knowing and understanding the product, problem solving and conveying this information. In order to do this, many questions are asked."

Moreover I believe by coming together we felt knitted together. My experienced made me feel apart of company which also felt like family.

Soon after my daughter went to College and I needed to finish up as well. No regrets, excellent communication skills team work Business accounting retail displays Customers."
good,"I worked with a team for recovery during the holidays as a temp associate, so it was a lot of fun getting to know everyone while we worked on different floors every night."
good,"A great large company to work for that still values their employees highly. I've never heard them make goals for the associates, but rather having associates make their own goals in whatever aspects of the company whether if its selling something, credit, or doing something in a different way to improve performance."
good,It was good experience working with different kind of customers and learning how to wrap gifts and do the bow their way.it was good working in different departments

good,Typical day was fast paced with lots to do with plenty of time to get it done. Learned how to operate a computer to receive items that came in useful in other jobs. Management was great due to being understandable to circumstances both in the warehouse and outside circumstances. Hardest part was packing huge customer orders and best part was getting big amounts of the same thing to pack.
good,"While I was there I couldn't experience much, not only because I was on seasonal, but also because I was pregnant. But while I was there and I work it was fun. Macy's Bloomingdales warehouse has amazing people to work with and also had a nice work environment. Anybody would love to work there if they love to work and get things done! People are so cool and kind to you there as well. They love to conversate and you end up meeting some nice and cool people while working there."

good,Picking orders to be shipped . For the most part a fun job working to the music . Macy's was a job where we all work together . It made the day go faster.

good,I loved my time at Macys.I have nothing disparaging to say really. The only thing I could say is the pay could be a little hire there. I only left because it was time to try something new and stretch a little.
good,"Professional work environment, pay is commensurate with skill set."
good,Macy's is actually one of the best jobs I've had. They give anyone a chance to show interest in moving up. Don't get me wrong every place gets nerve racking sometimes but the thing about this facility is that they try to look for a solution to the smallest of problems. I think there could be some minor tweaks to the system but honestly I couldn't say too much bad about this company as a whole. It's really a home away from home and I think that is a good quality in a job. We laugh together fight together fix things together and rebuild reflect and renew together. And I'm just a MHE driver. I'm not some fancy person high on the totum pole. I like my job. It's just the cost of living and having kids makes it to where I almost have no choice but to work two jobs to get by semi comfortably. But I don't plan on leaving Macy's that's for sure. If I get lucky enough maybey second job will also be like this. I know these are the qualifications I look for in a workplace. Thank Macy's Logistics in Portland. Y'all really are an amazing company.!!!

In the store they thoughly train you for the job you’re going into. The managers are very helpful and are super nice! The employee discount is 20% which isn’t the greatest but they have special times when it is 30%. I loved it so much I did seasonal again this year."
good,"I applied for a seasonal position, I was never given a schedule. In order to get hours I had to log in every day to see what full time employee wanted that day off and pick up their hours. After a few weeks, some of the full time employees would ask if I would fill in for them so scheduling time became easier. I was not retained at the end of the season.  Macy's closed 300 stores after the Christmas Holiday season."

Therefore, some were disappointed but others stayed and made it a holiday to remember."

My new store is the most culturally diverse work atmosphere I've ever had (we are very close to the city) and meeting all of these new  people, both customers and coworkers, has been so rewarding.

good,"Macy's a truly wonderful place to work, and motivated us associates to put forth our best.The best part about Macy's was the coworkers I had built relationships with, thus allowing for a more intimate work environment; we could always laugh with one another and share our experiences, both on and off the clock."
good,"Typically in a days work i arrive to tag and send up merchandise to the upper floors, occasionally the merchandise is not correctly placed and items have to be taken to their right place, extra effort, because coworkers would make errors in placing merchandise, the work environment is fun and easy going and it is an okay place to work at, hardest part may be when we are delayed in the unloading of trucks and we have to rush to get everything in order."
good,"Each day varies, during major holidays and weekends it is pretty busy. Our building gets packed almost every weekend. During the summer weekdays it is pretty slow just because people are away on vacation."
good,A typical workday at Macy's is very productive and fun meeting customers from all over the world.While working there I learned how to problem solve different situations and working with a such a divers group of people.
good,"Customers want and we provide the need. Macy's go above and beyond for each of its clients. Always save the day. Very chill job. A typical work day would go by so quick, if you worked in the morning. During the evenings it would be hectic because of so many customers. Management was mostly fair about scheduling and sticking with hours based on your availability. And the best part is, is that depending on how many hours you work, you'd typically get an hour lunch. Overall, I thought it was a great job!"
good,I have many years in customer service and in retail. I'm fast at working through shipment and bring the merchandise quickly to the floor. When I'm on the register I try quickly to get the customers in and out as quickly as possible

The day may have had several conference calls and meetings. Spent as much time as I could walking the floor coaching associates and leadership while ensuring outstanding customer service. The store population was very diverse. Most enjoyable part of my job was the people both the customers and the associates. Hardest part of the job just not enough time in the day."

good,"If you get bored working in a department store you're not doing it right. There was always some thing I could be doing. Organizing, cleaning, folding, and so much more. The people I worked with were amazing group of older ladies as well as others my age. The management team was always very understanding. There hardest part of this job is every retail workers nightmare, Holiday Season, but if you are like me, then its a cake walk."
good,"If you like a place where some days are dreadfully slow and other days are extremely busy where customers treat you like you are beneath them and management doesnt really know how to motivate their employees who most of the time dont make enough money to shop at Macys to sell more product, then this is the place for you."
good,I was able to pick up shifts whenever I wanted. This was beneficial since I went to school full time. The atmosphere was great and I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,good expirience !! working there was great ...i loved it .i had a awsome expirience it was a great environtment and a good atmosphere to vibe at with folks.

I helped build the company to where it is today with my vast experience in Media marketing and was a very proud employee. Many challenges and I met them as they came my way, and very much enjoyed seeing the business grow and the consumer's view of our business. Happy customers are loyal ones and I always put the customer first."
good,If you love fashion and meeting new people this is the place for you! Macy's has beautiful fashions at incredibly low prices and offers so many chances for making conversation with customers.
good,"A typical work day at Macy's warehouse is you're on your feet most of the time. Once you get there you're doing your job. limited breaks and no sitting area only in the break room and supervisor office.

good,"Working at Macys thought me how to be able to communicate with different nationality of customers, understand their complains and needs and satisfy them with a great skills of customer service. Macys it is a good place to learn how to work hard and fast under pressure. Who ever has interest to grow up in retail career, macys is the right place! But if you are looking for a living wage, it's pretty tough to make ends meet at Macy's but the work culture is fun and the computerized attendance system makes it a flexible and easy to navigate around a busy life. Managers are friendly and helpful. The hiring process is stress free and things happen quickly. Benefits are good and start right away, but they don't cover a lot of the expenses. Overall a good place to work, but the low wages and the tenuous nature of the retail giant possibly closing stores and laying off employees looms large."
good,Even though I was just seasonal the enviroment was great there was a few workers that didnt really like the seasonal workers but it was still a great happy place.. It was much to do and many to greet and see I met alot of wonderful nice shoppers I would ask for a better environment.
good,"I had the most fun when I worked as a Handbag Merchandiser  Everyone on the floor was great and wanted to work.  I even made a new friend.  It's true, nothing prepares you for the crazy holiday rush.  As a merchandiser, it's because you'd see the pretty (and yes, ugly) items that arrive before the public sees them.  Opening boxes was like opening presents on Christmas and marking down items was like playing with stickers."

good,"When I started working there from the begining they respected my school hours with my work hours. I started as a part time associate so at first everything was new but little by little everything started to go well. I beleive that in every store theres at least one or two customers that make us want to quit and forget about the store, but you always want to forget that and find that one customer that will bring the joy back in you. The part i liked about my job is when I was able to help in the back in fullfillment. The only thing I had to do was to pack the clothing or items customers from out of state asked for. I like going to the back and help."

I learned that not everybody will be pleased with our service, however, it is our duty to make them feel welcomed and to join us in the future and to that degree we succeed. The hardest part of the job for me, was when I first stated and everything was new to me.

You must wear all black or your outer most layer has to be black and small pinstripes are acceptable.. The hardest part of the job was really just having the patients to deal with customers that are trying to haggle with you for a cheaper price and soliciting credit is just awkward and uncomfortable for both sales associate and the customer.

My co-workers were a lot older than I was so I felt like they thought they were better than me, like they could boss me around and slack because I was younger..but they were mainly nice people. I learned a lot of customer service and retail skills. Management was pretty good, some of the managers abused their power in my opinion, but most were nice and reasonable.

The management and employees work together to achieve sale goals. I have pitched in to help in many different departments just to keep the flow of things. I have learned many selling techniques.

They give you monthly customer service training classes which helps you become more confident in yourself and your sales. Rewards are plentiful for a job well done, as well as recognition. Every day the team gathers for a meeting in the morning to go over department sales and acknowledge those who did well and go over sales/promos coming up, which helps with team morale. There are people who have been there for years and some who are seasonal and its combined as a great work environment. I loved all my co-workers and felt support in every department.

You want to show a customer that you are doing all that you can to help them because you want that customer to come back to your store.

I believe that this job was a great place to work and everyone there were really good at teamwork."
good,Good thing about this job is that Macy's allows workers to pick up and drop their own shifts on the computer based on your availability. Negatives would be that they hire too many employees leaving very few hours to pick up.

good,"There was not a ""typical"" day at work. Everyday was fun, My customers made my day, as did my co-workers. I always learned something new, either by my customers or by my co-workers. The management I had were tough, but they were fair. If they weren't tough, then I would not of learned all the material I did learn and I would not of had all the structure I had, then I would not of absorbed and carried the material with me. The hardest part of the job was all of the material I had to learn everyday. The material would change on a daily basis. It would sometimes be very hard to keep up with the changes. I believe the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and to celebrate the special moments with customers. It would bring joy to me when I would hear the special stories to why a customer was buying the special diamond, ruby, sapphire, or pearls.

good,"Good attitudes. Good environment. Friendly, professional, skilled efficient. One of the best retailers I have worked for. Easy workable schedule, with online tracking system."

good,I loved how the managers and my fellow associates were always so ready to help out and answer questions from the new guy. Everyone were understandable especially when I told them that my employment was definitely temporary as I was planning on moving after the holiday season.
good,"Retail is retail, it’s never going to change for you but I will tell you this , Macy’s in my experience working here has been the best place of work. This place has a lot to offer ,you just have to be willing and ready to take those offers. Management gives you the space and tools you need to help you grow and most of all give you the support you need to achieve your goals."

good,Starting as a sales associate and being able to grow with the company was an exuberant experience.  I started at the kids section and worked my way up through the different departments of the store to make up consultant with Lancome makeup.
good,"It's been a while but Macys has become a swap meet, ""Last Act"" needs to go or be better organized. There should be constant recovery to get clothes off the floor. How do you expect customers to buy clothes worth $30 or more when they are on the floor? Other than that, it's still has decent brand and products."
good,I loved the fact that Macys was flexible when it came to the hours I worked. I also liked that that in-site allowed you to pick up extra shifts.  The sales associates are also very helpful and they go out of their way to make sure the customer's experiences are the best.

good,"Although my role was just seasonal part-time I enjoyed working at Macys because you were able to pretty much choose the shifts you wanted. Besides some hours scheduled to you, you were also able to pick up shifts people would leave which make you gain more hours. Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely go back."
good,Macy's is a company that values their colleagues and how they are treated. They are always looking to help their colleagues to reach the next level in their career at Macy's
good,"The managers there are super nice and are always willing to help with any situation that comes about. No matter how hectic the day can get. Everyone is very professional, and love being there. I wish the pay would be a little better for the amount of work. But it's still a really good place to work. I would definitely recommend working as a sales associate at Macy's in Vero Beach Florida."

good,"Working at Macy’s was fun, the coworkers were kind and the customers were polite. You get experience in every department and you’re constantly doing something and learning new skills."
good,With the ability to pick up shifts to ensure i get the hours im supposed to is great. Not only that if my department doesnt have any hours im able to pick up more hours elsewhere.
good,I loved the people I worked alongside with. The manager I had back when I worked there in 2013-2014 was amazing. Nowadays the managers only care about crunching numbers and not so much about their staff. It's a little sad to see. I'd like for them to care more about the feelings of their staff and check in with them more often. Other than that I loved the people I met there while working at Macy's!
good,Enjoyed the job and the staff and supervisors. Flexible hours and gave holiday and vacation pay for part time. Had incentives and contests to earn extra money or gifts.
good,Typical work day was slow except during peak periods and Holidays. They give you a Prepaid Credit Card or a Regular Credit Card for employee discounts.

good,This job is good for a student. It is hard to get hours but you do have the option to pick up hours from people wanting a day off. On avg I worked close to 40-50 hours a week picking up hours
good,"The jobs are very easy and manageable, only bad thing would be during the holiday season they hire a lot of people and end up taking hours from your schedule, otherwise is a great place to work at."
good,diversity is what i like at Macys: you were assigned to diverse department. Celebration spirits when holidays come with all the trimmings and fanfares.
good,I want to work next seasonal position it was faced paced and people were friendly i would recommend working there. It helped me through the holidays. If it was 10 hours and 16 an hour would be better.
good,"Macys is a great place to work and show yourself what are you capable to do in retail, Always working with a good team players, management are really professionals what they do."
good,Macy's wasn't the best job that I had but it was ok. I worked with a lot of people from high school. I just wish some people were a bit more happy but overall it wasn't a bad experience
good,"It was a great experience in selling I learned a lot about customer oriented and approach to customer in a right way how to convince costumers to buying the products "

good,"its is a good starter job for anyone who wants to get into the retail business or just needs to earn some money for school and what not, hours are jumpy and not always reliable however"
good,Wokred here for seasonal was pretty team based place everyone was pretty friendly and evrything. They were fair when calling in sick and with breaks and lunches
good,"The employee discount days, and the additional coupon days. Always finding something to wear new or buy something new for a friend or loved one. Having extra money to shop was the best days."
good,"Honestly speaking, my experience at Macy's Warehouse Distribution Center was both fast paced and steady paced at the same time. One of the things that I learned was how to use a price scanner. Another thing I learned was how to pack merchandise into boxes and packages. The hardest part of the job was the fact that it conflicted with my school schedule a little bit. My most enjoyable part of the job was gaining knowledge in retail/customer service culture significantly."
good,Lots of different job positions and operations of the store which creates super diversified culture. They like to promote from within and give good raises for hard work.
good,Clientele /staff is older......most staff is working because they want to which make it a very positive environment. Lots  of incentive to sign up customers for credit cards. Good w making sure you get your breaks and lunch. Lots of respect both ways.
good,"I never truly enjoyed security jobs until I worked AP at Macy’s, many things to learn, Great way to practice Hospitality skills, in my area however I believe Mandarin is important to learn and understand, meet new and awesome people.."
good,"Always helpful, works alongside employees to achieve goal.  Doesn't just delegate. "

good,Great working environment very high pace. Room for growth and great schedule system making working very flexible great discounts to workers a variety of work areas
good,I learned a lot about working at Macy's. I learned that people who work behind the scenes do lots of different jobs. Learned how to use a pallet jack for moving large pallets of boxes. Also used a scanner for inventory and shipping. The hardest part of the job was moving the pallets that were extremely heavy and going down narrow hallways with turns in them. The most enjoyable part of the job was not knowing what you would be working on that day could be shipping for it could be just breaking down pallets and distributing the boxes to the correct areas.
good,fun place to work. Job teaches you crucial life lessons that no book could ever teach you. It gives you experience in how to be a hard worker and how to be independent.
good,I love working at Macy's. The position I work is challenging and fun. The team I work with is compassionate about what they do. I enjoy stopping to help customers find the product or brand they need. The entire staff is helpful and has a real team mentality.

good,"Great place to work, pay is great and management is easy to get along with. Lunch is too short but the work is good. This is a great place to work if your not afraid of hard work. The pay is comparable to the amount of work you do."
good,Macy's made me feel like family and helped me become an even better worker and helped me with my knowledge of knowing products and what they do and how to help you!
good,The job was easy and oaid very well but it's only seasonal. The managers treated associates with respect and catered to all the needs of the associates.
good,I enjoyed working with Macy very friendly and understanding  work place and overall good job for someone need a career. I was only reason for leaving was growing family and need to make more money.

good,Macy's was probably the best job i ever worked at. I applied there looking to do stock but ended up working in the fashion jewelry complex. My coworkers were all great and so was the manager. I worked seasonal during there most busiest time of year but everything was organized and wasn't very stressful. Word of advice remember which keys go to which container and have confidence and don't stand around.
good,I really enjoyed working for such a great company and the people I met are awesome. The way the company represents itself and the brand that it fosters was such a powerful impact on my career that I take with me forever.
good,Fast paced and fun place to work. Workers are friendly and management is reasonable and understanding. Sitting area to eat and to take breaks. Customers were really nice also.
good,I love the fact you get paid weekly. The co workers were good people to work with. The hardest part of the job was the customer. The  work place culture was friendly and happy.
good,good people always good smiles everybody does there job and exceeds most of the time some slack work but not much i would recomend a full time position if available

good,"Had fun working here, even better around the holidays. YESSSSS it was hectic BUT all the employee discounts were GREAT !! On your feet all day except for lunch break. HAHA."
good,"There's not much else I can say about my job at Macy's Corporate services. The work is repetitive, but the pay and work life balance are some of the best I have ever experienced. If you're looking for a fair paycheck and a Monday through Friday full time job, apply at Macy's corporate services."
good,"Management is a bit too much sometimes but thats life and work is work. Pay is great, especialy when you cash out weekly. Great benefits, amazing team"

good,"The crew I worked with in my seasonal job were amazing. They welcomed me and treated me nicely and fairly. Although I was there for only a short time, I feel glad to have worked with them"
good,Because Macy's offers commission on-top of an hourly wage the sky's the limit to how much you can earn in a weak. Management was always very helpful when it came to scheduling and technical issues.
good,It was a good place. I enjoyed the people and flexibility. I just hated the pay and minimal raises every year. They had great products and we got great discounts.
good,i don't know on hand but i did have a great time there meeting people and doing other things to increase the company profit. staff have respect to there customers and employees.
good,It was unfortunate in my case that my manager had not been trained at her job prior to my becoming employed there. Due to her errors in regard to my credit deduction I was terminated. I very much love the company and the customers. I will try again in the future!
good,"As a loss prevention detective I was responsible for the security and safety of the business as well as all employees. My main objective was to covertly monitor shoppers, employees, and aid Macy's in thwarting theft, while treating all suspects with respect and diplomacy. I was responsible for apprehending all shoplifters as well as employees who were guilty of theft. I also monitored and maintained surveillance cameras and documented footage to be submitted with police reports. Additionally, I was required to access and secure the facility, maintain store safety, enforce company rules, monitor inventory, and train floor employees in spotting shoplifters."
good,I like it because of the bonuses they offer just for you to work your shift. Not to mention the over time & extra $100 per shift you pick up. It's a easy job with straight forward tasks.
good,"Work was always full of excitement, planning events, gift with purchase, and making connections with new customers, or customers who became your friends, that would come to see you."
good,Was only  temporary  But easy going place  definitely wouldn’t mind  A full time  position  . You must be ready to work if you are a  couch potato it’s not your job of choice but if your like me and don’t mind hands on work its great place
good,Macy’s was beautiful and experience I was glad to have the opportunity to work there I used to and still do allot of shopping there so it felt good to be on the other side of the customers
good,The customers can be very nice or you can get the customers that are never happy. But customers are always right. So you have to figure out how you can help the customers need.
good,Great place to work just some managers make it extremely hard to see that. A lot of great co workers to help you get aclimated to your new job. Very very busy
good,Macy's is a great place to work. The employers treat the employees with the utmost respect.  The staff are always vibrant and full of energy.  There weren't a lot of boring days.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Love working for this company. Overall the advancement opportunity is accelerated which is what I was looking for. Unfortunately some really good workers cannot readjust to the changing of roles and fall off the wagon.
good,This position included working during the black Friday weekend going forward. I would have to pick up the pairs of shoes customer just left laying on the floor or put the shoes in the right location on the shelf
good,this is a great place to work like any other job it is what you make it. I would definitely work here again and I really enjoyed my employment.if you have a passion for the fashion field I would recommend Macys it was a great experience working with the company.
good,It was a seasonal job that I liked I was able to work directly with the customers as well as in all different departments. I feel that anyone in the field will like it
good,I loved my job working in Fine Jewelry. Employees were amazing and Macys really does make sure their employees are taken care of. You always had enough 15 minute breaks to get off your feet and lunch breaks were always between 30-45 minutes. If I wouldn't have to had to move I would definitely still be working there.
good,Very competitive and detailed oriented.  Super energetic and high energy always around you with staff and management.  Always hiring all year long for new employees.
good,"Macy's truely cares about their people and you are not just a number.  It is refreshing for a retailer to have a ""people first"" mentality.  The only downside is staffing, sometimes it can be stressful on busy days when staffing is low and we still need to get the job done and help customers."
good,"working with macys is fun because u get discount and free  samples.. you see great customers , always fun to help them with thr hert desires. a great place"
good,"By doing different tasks in the sales area, you can grow in knowledge that will serve you for your future work, you also learn a lot from working with clients, and to have a better relationship with people. It is a very pleasant environment for cleanliness and pleasant to interact with people from all over the world."
good,"I worked the night shift so I would typically start at 3am and dont get done until 11 or 12 in the afternoon. All the employees were amazing including the management. The only con was when we were working throughout the day certain customers would get mad that we were not able to help within certain departments or sometimes when scanning the price tags you can get really sleepy, so trying to stay up can be hard. lunches were an hour, breaks were 15 mins. We couldn't get any bonuses since our department wasn't part of sales. Management would sometimes order us some pizza and sweets when we achieved one of our goals. When you do work hard, they do acknowledge that and they tend to get you even more hours on top of your 8 hour shift. I honestly love working there. No complaints"
good,"I was on call so it was very flexible, they work with you on your hours, definitely have to know how to multi task, and management was great. I personally never looked into the benefits, but I know they had them."
good,For anyone who loves to shop and communicate with others then I suggest Macy's.  I had a great time helping customers with their needs.  The co-workers and the managers were very nice!
good,dealing with many types of customers on daily base working with very diverse people in general very relax environment work place culture is relaxed many people loved to shop here
good,I really enjoyed my time at Macy's. I liked the work I was doing. The people there all seemed to be very happy. The management were so good to work with and they were so friendly and helpful.
good,"Fellow employees were always amicable and supportive. The managers were always checking up on me to make sure I was getting along fine. Once you show them that you can succeed at the job, they slowly increase their trust in you."
good,In my opinion it was a very nice place with a lot of team spirit considering it is a call center. My only complaint was that I had been there for 6 years and had worked up from $12 to $16+ an hr only to have new employees hired at a hire pay than me. I felt under appreciated so I left to pursue my degree full time.
good,Macy's cares about their employees.  Macy's drives hard on sales goals and gives you goals to attain each day that you work.  Macy's management team was supportive and supportive of its employees.
good,"I love my job at Macy's. My MTM is the best boss I ever had in my life, a real people person and hard worker. It can be stressful as there are many things to do and a high turnover rate. I was paid fairly for my education and it being retail."
good,Shoe department is hectic during seasonal shopping. Good environment. Interviews are great and done with super friendly staff. Very fun place to work if you need to be constantly on the move
good,I worked almost seven to eight ours a day. five days a week. or less. but most five days a week. 23 to 38 hours a week. included weekends some times. workplace culture I really liked the are and culture and style. the hardest part. sometimes it was a lot of clothes to put away. or  organize. and overall I like working there. and had a very good managers and supervisor. and enjoyed working there in holidays. it is fun. and sometimes to busy.

good,"unload trucks, check all the merchandise, set the show floor, clear out the back rooms, check the store for damaged products and make sure the warehouse is clean before i leave"
good,"I get to work independently most days"
good,I Love MACYS!!! But Management was horrible. I was assigned an inexperienced manager who was recently promoted to the position and I guess the pride got to their head. I was in Macys Backstage store
good,"Even with the fast paced environment associated with the holiday seasons working retail, I found that my experience with Macy's was an overall positive one."
good,"The people there were very welcoming, warm hearted and helpful. The management seen potential in me and exploited in the best of ways, letting me get the experience working in various departments, even left me on a floor level on my own around Christmas, one of the busiest times of the year. I did very well and proud the people there never gave up on me and kept pushing me."
good,"macy is a fast pace work place loading docs are very busy and the work keeps coming and the work gets done, we stay busy and we keep the customers happy to the best of our ablitiy"
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's for the time that I was there. If it wasn't a seasonal position I was hired for, I might still be there. The pay is good mainly because it's weekly, and above minimum wage. The job tasks aren't difficult, and the co workers I had were extremely helpful."
good,"Working at macys is a great experience, the workers there are fun, caring, and to be honest its like working with family. Everyone takes care of each other, I would most likely go back myself to work there."

good,"Your hours would not be the same every day.  Started out at 32 hours a week.  Eventually went to approximately 24 because of hiring more people and reconfiguring their  online sales which took up our floor space in Receiving. Because of my background in Retailing, I soon became a lead person training others.  I wanted demanding physical work and I got it!  Typical day would be breaking open boxes and unloading truck to rolling racks if the merchandise was hanging goods; stripping plastic off clothes.  When rack was full; you or someone would  sensor merchandise.  Folded clothes off truck would  be done by another person.  Loved the people I worked with!"

good,"Fun job, all you're doing it stocking clothes and placing them on display. You would even finish before your shift is over. I wanted more hours so I started taking on more shifts that involve different positions. The more you know the more shifts you can pick up on. I picked up fulfillment and picking which is just packing and shipping items. I prefer that because it keeps me busy and I get to work with my hands. Picking items can be fun because it's like a scavenger hunt, its fun when you can actually find the item."
good,I worked at Macys for awhile and I have great respect for the management and employees that I have worked with. Great job was fUN.

good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's because they really allowed me to push myself to be better. They also allowed me to put personalize my services all the while following the rules for a safe work environment. The only things I would say that would need a little work is the following...I was Cosmetic Flex Associate which meant that I worked for every cosmetics brand in the store, which also meant I had to know about every single product new or old.  If new products were launched, I had to learn about them from the own packaging or by going online and researching the products in order to sell them correctly while my co-workers would get training on the products. Also my coding as an associate didn't allow me to accumulate sick and vacation days and I didn't have a minimum of hours."

good,"I worked in the Macy's RTW department for over 3 years. Like any retail job it had its up and downs. Customers can be a pain, and so can inventory season but it was the most flexible hours any college student could ask for. I was part time during the week and full time on weekends.

good,"A typical day at the store was prepping our area, meeting with management to find out events for that day, and making sure the floor was staffed so that when the doors opened we were ready to service our customers and complete the sales. One of the most important things I learned from the store is that repeated customer business is the goal and if it doesn't make dollars it doesn't make sense. The management team worked hard to fulfill the demands of our company, and worked hard to inspire the sales team. The culture of the workplace was very diverse, but everyone strived to service our customers. One of he hardest parts of the job is not enough product knowledge, and sales support. The most enjoyable part of the store is the customers, being able to make them happy is very fulfilling."

good,"Macy's is a great place to start your career. Lots of connections, resource groups and training is offered to entry level to mid level employees. Macy's lacks a career path plan for Senior level employees."

This is also the time management would acknowledge various associates for good customer reviews or for outstanding achievement. Then we would unlock the doors and the day would really begin. The clothes really sell themselves, but it was important to always greet customers and ask if they need help. A lot of time went into recovery and keeping the department and fitting rooms neat and organized for a better shopping experience. Register duties were the best part, because it was fast paced. Macy's gets a ton of traffic, and anytime I was at the register time just flew by. I enjoyed being part of a close knit department of sales associates and the recovery team. Overall I had a lot of fun, and scheduling was so convenient to pick up shifts when you needed some extra hours."
good,"When working at Macy's as a cashier for the season, I folded and restocked clothing. I put away returns, removed and replaced all items from the fitting rooms back to their respective racks. I also rang customers and helped when they were looking for things around the store. I made new price labels for clothing and took phone calls from the dayton mall for holds. I also made and retrievedo holds for customers. I have worked in the Juniors, young mens, mens, children's, women's, textiles and china departments."
good,My time here was well spent. This job is one that will carry me into so many good things. The executives here make a difference in the lives of each custoner and associate they speak to.

good,Sales and customer service. Meet your goals. They want you to sell 2-3 items per transaction and sell the Macy's card but if you don't make it they wont fire you.
good,This position was key in developing strong sales techniques.  I met my sales goals on a consistent basis.  I completed many sales training classes while at Macy's.
good,"My job as a sales manager is very challenging and I am always busy.  To be a successful sales manager with Macy's, you need to have great organization, planning, and multi tasking skills.  Exceptional customer service and selling skills and have the ability to coach and train associates so they can be their best.  It is fast paced and many things happen throughout the day that make you have to adjust your plan for the day to accommodate business."

good,Management everywhere has to get better. if they people want there jobs to be secured and for their employees to actual benefit from working at there establishments.
good,"Balance Register upon opening and closing. Perform audits as needed. Ensure register has proper mix of funds to operate. Process stock shipping and receiving. Use Company Schematics provided to properly display product. Promote Sales and build quality Business. Generate Sales by engaging with customers. Invite them to the counter for a consultation. After consultation, its time to begin to close the sale. This begins as you find out what the customer needs are. Start linking star products to increase productivity and bottom line sale. Ask if they are saving on their purchases. If they are not a Macy*s card holder, it is highly recommended to encourage that they  become a card holder. Macys is more loyal to you as a customer by being a valued card holder. Once account is open they start saving right away. Clientele the customer so they can be contacted on future promotions. During new product launches. Invite new and existing customers be part of your Beauty Event. Don't worry . You go to class and Business Manager Meeting to participate in training and product knowledge and how to Set up an event. Give a door prize. That always bring excitement when you are in Gift.

Macy's is a huge store so the chances of you running around working department to department are high. I would definitely suggest wearing comfortable shoes. The environment at Macy's is very professional and fun in a corny way. Management tries to interact with employees with sweepstakes and competitions to make it fun but sometimes the pressure of selling Macy's credit cards gets overwhelming. The managers do their jobs, period. They are very professional and don't run you the wrong way. It's easy to make friends at Macy's since so many people work there and I guarantee there'll be one or two people you can have long lasting friendships with."

I leaned a lot about women shoes, advertising, opening accounts, and merchandising.  The hardest part about the job was dealing with customers that couldn't find a shoe in their size.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people that had no idea what they were looking for."
good,I would pack all merchandise for costumers and send them to be shipped. I learned organization skills and packing. Management was friendly and respectful. I made great friends and acquaintances. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes and loading them onto the conveyor belt. I loved this job all around!

The workers their were extremely fun and the management did their best to do what they could for everyone. The hardest part working their was trying to find an open shift. Macys was the job where you got to pick the days and hours you wanted to work, which was great but, a lot of people took most shifts. This really was horrible due to the fact that while working it was great. I really enjoyed it their everyday. No matter what everyone was great to everyone."
good,"On a Friday morning u can expect to scan about 6 thousand items in a day, I was cross trained in packing, induct, sorting items, matching items to invoices that would be printed with the customer online order and all the orders we dealt with and took care of were from Macy's website. The management there weren't people that wore ties or didn't have excessive tattoos,male or female it differed from each section of the warehouse I enjoyed each managers company and training I realized that I learn by hands on experience but if it is explained to me properly then I can pick up on the task, job, etc. I am very friendly towards other so I became friends with my co- workers and socialized while working at a fast pace because u had to work fast pace at Macys Warehouse like I said there are goals to be reached and it is smiled upon when u go over the goals although it was not frowned upon if it wasn't because there would be a day crew/shift  that come in as soon as my shift ended which was 5 am to 6:30 pm it was the shift I chose to work with. But I have to admit the hardest part was not to slow down in the middle of the day. In addition I enjoyed finding work, keeping busy, seeing my co workers and mangers  I've worked with and it was easy to keep a Great and happy attitude because of the management and people there."

My co-workers were helpful, and would help me learn how to do certain aspects of the job, such as work the cash register, since training didn't do a great job at doing that.

good,"My experience at Macy's Herald Square had pros and cons. I had fun conversation with the customers and coworkers. Ive learned that retail its not only about helping customers with their needs, its about selling the best products and how we can maintain revenue throughout the year. But I have dreams that I want to achieve and its not part of Macy's. Macy's just count you in as a number, not an employee. I thought employee gets big rewards after they make big sales, but they only care about putting people into more depth. Im going to admit that they have the best clothes in town. I wish macy's employees can get real rewards... I don't mean rewards as macys money.. I mean rewards to take a vacation or go somewhere away each year. If I was the owner I would make my employees happy, because we only humans not robots."

I've learned how to understand different accents with ease. Management was helpful. I could call them when I needed to know something right away. My co-workers were helpful and nice. We all got to know each other even though we worked in different departments. The hardest part was the customers' attitudes and all you are doing is trying to serve them with a smile. Another hard part was being on my feet all day and not sitting down until my break. The enjoyable part was getting along and getting to know the other employees. For Macy's to be my first job, I really enjoyed it."

good,"Honestly, if I could have worked for this exact store with the same people again, I would do it in a heart beat. All of the workers were so genuinely friendly and hardworking and management was well trained. Unfortunately, I presently live too far away to take up that mantle, even if I was offered the job, or I would volunteer to work commission for their shoe section. It's the most challenging one, hands down, and it's exciting to me. I love helping out the customer, and if a tiny puzzle is included in that factor, it's strangely fun. I learned how the shoe section work, I gained extensive knowledge in their Point of Sale technology that most cashiers and customer service never get to be involved in so they never memorized it. My typical days at work seemed to vary radically from my coworkers as I always seemed to get landed with the customers who required the most difficult type of POS transactions- improperly written checks, international currency, ordering items from different stores, returns lacking receipts and their UPS; you name it, I probably had to do it- but despite the frustration of my inability to service these customers in the fastest manner possible, I was glad to help and I was fascinated by the challenge behind the level of specialty needed to adequately help my customers."
good,There was always a positive work environment. Very family oriented and supportive of one another. I learned about several different pieces of furniture including hand-made area rugs. I had the opportunity to interact with the customers daily so that made it even more enjoyable.

The managers where always professional, yet very laid back people. My co-workers were also very friendly. The most hardest part of my job was leaving because it was such an honor working there. The most enjoyable part was the scheduling system, which was online so everything was much easier. "
good,"Its a very good place to work. Each day is different but it is also an opportunity to learn new things. I have gained many skills, such as my ability to approach customers and carry on a conversation with them to make a sale, or gain a new customer. My manager is a great leader and has broken me out of my shell. Co-workers help the flow of work and vise versa, we are a team and help each other out. The hardest part of my job is having a problem I can't fix. The most enjoyable part of my job is the returning customers. You make an impact on them to make them want to come back, and that says a lot"
good,"A typical day at work includes a 6 am start time. Upon arrival either myself or my boss will print the execution guide for the day and company directives that need to be accomplished for the week. The remainder of the day includes executing the standards and directives while promoting sales growth for the company. My co-workers are a diverse and diligent crew with all tools and knowledge required to make everyone as a whole successful. Management however can be difficult and indecisive, which complicates things for everyone. I have enjoyed my job since high school and the past 8-9 years have given me invaluable experience and knowledge. The only issue I have with my job is the lack of potential for career growth. At this juncture of my life I am in search of a career, not just a job."

good,This company is a established organization with all modern systems in place - for this reason is great for you are always learning new technology. The co- workers were great there is a sense of community. The job itself is not really hard for
good,"I love and respect Macy's because their management, from the store manager to the department managers, use positive reinforcement instead of negative. All employees are treated with respect and this transforms to equal respect for the customers. You can often see the manager of the entire store helping customers and ringing up sales, and he never identifies himself as such. It's just a great place to work and shop!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Great company to work for, with great benefits and room for growth."

good,My department is fragrance. I learn every day about how different body oils affect different frangrances. Its Always a joy to help someone find the right smell for themselves or someone they love. There are small rewards for helping someone open an account. I enjoy the competition. We have a great management department always willing to lend a hand. I would say the hardest part of my job is not being able to find a fragrance for someone.
good,"I will help multiple customers that need help. Fix up racks and fitting rooms also i would learn where alot about where the merchandise is located , which helps me help the customer."
good,I like to go to work everyday
good,like to go and do my work and get to know new people that i was going to work with.

good,"This was a fun job to have. I had one child at the time, and that made it easy. Loved being in management.

good,Macy’s features a variety of worthwhile causes as the focus of special marketing and sales efforts.
good,"I would arrive in the morning and meet up with the price change team of the day. We, as a team would go all throughout the store and find every item that needed to be marked down and I would make the adjustments to the price tags. Working with a team helped to complete each task very efficiently."
good,"Great place to work, easy work for the pay. Schedule is fairly consistent and there are easy options to swap shifts with another employee if necessary. Coworkers and management are friendly."
good,"At work i usually closed so it was my job to make sure that the department was well kept, cleaned and stocked with items at register (bags,change for register, etc.). I had training on how to use the register and what coupons work with what. Co-workers also helped me and showed me quick easy ways to ring people faster. Which is the hardest thing during the holidays because the store get every packed and my lines are extremely long."
good,my job at macys was an great work expierence all the way around from co-workers to the customers.
good,"It was great here. Made alot of friends, great pay, good workplace."
good,Macy's call ceneter is very well organized and quite so that you are able to respond to customers needs in a timely manner. They staff is very friendly and energetic and the hardest part about the job is the lack of benefits offered to part time and seasonal workers.
good,"We typically start early in the morning and work until the store opens. The people are always great, but around the holiday season work can get a little stressful (like any retail store i would imagine). It is amazing how much work can get done in such a short amount of time before the store open. Communitcation can always be a little better, but that is easy to fix. All and all Macys is a fantastic place to work, with great benifits and people around the only thing you can ask for a better pay check."
good,The best job I've ever had I loved making other people look great anf providing extensive customer service...
good,i loved working with Macy's visual team. it was more fun then work to me. loved coming in each day to make sure the store was ready to give customers a great impression on the customers. i would love to go back any time they have open positions.

good,"a typical day at wokrk is clocking in opening up the cash register , counting money clean up around my cash register."
good,Great company to work for. Fun Sales Environment. Allows you to personally interact with the customers face to face. Build a working relationship. The Company rewards you for making your sales goals as well as acknowledgements for acheivements. Learned how to make tough sales and overcome objections. Learned about the Cosmetic Industry. My co-workers were adequate. At times you do have to be constantly agressive to get your sales. The hardest part of job was jugling multiple work schedules thoughout the year. I loved my job. Enjoyed my customers and their stories. They made the job worthwhile.
good,"I love Macy's is a good environment to work, but I don't see myself building a career in the next few years"
good,"Keep the store organized, meeting and greeting customers, encourage them to apply for the Macy's credit card.Assist the customers in what ever they needed."
good,"Great work/life balance, fast-paced, entrepreneurial spirit, good team"
good,Macy's i believe has the best staff. They to me are at the top of the retail industry and if not they should be. I have no complaints about them what so ever.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoye my job at Macy's as I was able to learn so much. I did the human resources and was in charge of employees. I did not get along with the store manager as I had to do all of her work as well as my own. I loved my time at Macy's.
good,"A typical day at work would consist in department store tasks and procedures if opening and similar tasks if closing. Opening/closing registers, making sure fitting rooms are prepared for the new day, and organized to the perfection of management. I learned multiple things in regards to retail over the years I have worked at Macy's each holiday season. Each management I have encountered while employed at Macy's has been positive and professional which has rubbed off on me. I have had great co-workers over the time periods I have been affeliated with Macy's. The hardest part I must presume would have to be a one day sale or an unhappy customer just wanting to start ruckus for no known reason, but I always do my best to make them feel we can help them and that everything will be ok. So far I have maintained high sales goals and have done great at rendering excellent custumer service. I enjoy working at Macy's each holiday for the great sales and to me they have the highest rating in customer service in regards to retail."
good,"each day is a typical day with different customers and new store look. never feel bored in there. I gain a great experience in customer service, cash handling. I worked with wonderful team managers and coworkers,"

My manager talks to me and let me know what needs to be done and she also show me my scorecard so I will know what my strenghts are and what I need to work on to get a better score.

good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's the opportunity was amazing to work with others different than myself. I had two bosses to answer too, So communication was not complicated and very clear. I was not put into any bad situations with others. I got the chance to solve my own problems without being retaliated against or ganged on. I also received great reviews from other employees. They enjoyed my work performance and pleasant character. I had a chance to show my Skills in a professional manner.

good,"Overall nice place to work, great people. The experience was amazing, learning how things go working in a department store.  There's always something new to learn"
good,"On a typical day at Macy's you must prepare your self for face to face interaction with customers. If you are a people person and enjoy striking a conversation with clients Macy's is a great job for the next employee. What I have learned so far from working with Macy's is people control. The reason why i say this because we are Customer Service. An employee must understand that we can make a persons day, and we want to make each transactions as easy as possible. Light conversation and change a persons day. We must aim to satisfy each customer. Management at Macy's is very hands on, they also give you the free range to make decisions on your own. Management gives you the ability to set your up as a person who can make decisions on a short notice. If a manager is then needed they have a quick response time."
good,Very friendly helpful place to work it always feels nice to get complemented by employees and customers alike it's a very easygoing job and nice managers
good,I enjoyed working there. Great staff and management. Very magnificent place. Minimum wage compensation. Employees are like family. I recommend this job.
good,"This was a fun company to work for. They value not only their customers, but their employees as well. As an employee, our breaks were acknowledges. We always have different contests and events going on. Department contests, events, parties, and we were always giving back to the company. Sometimes customers were tough to deal with, but putting things into perspective and being really able to analyze things mead things more flush."
good,Macy should review salary payment. Many hard working staff are leaving them for more rewarding and paying jobs. It's is the most less paid retail store that I know.
good,"It's been five years since I worked at Macy's. The products are great. Persons come in, ask for help and not overwhelming crowd. Took pride in keeping the shelves organized and enjoyed when I was asked to go to another department to fill in. Always something new to learn."
good,I started to work here without knowledge in as a cashier and my colleagues are very helpful.  I loved working with people help them find what they need and sized them on intimate stuff and I mostly love catering to the older people as they needed more help.  I am a very conscientious worker and I like to organized and have a clean environment to work on.
good,"Being my first job, Macy's taught me a lot and the friendly relationships with my managers and fellow colleagues make work enjoyable.

good,"Overall Macy's is a pretty chill place to work . "
good,"I'm not sure if I can describe a typical day at Macy's Logistics since I'm never for sure which job I will be doing from night to night.  I've learned to not let myself get overwhelmed and to do a better job of communicating with other coworkers and team leaders.  Working at Macy's Logistics has provided a lot of benefits, as they provide quite a bit of grace of which I have been thankful for.  The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's is when I get to do jobs that I'm more successful at."
good,Would love to work at Macy's again. Learned things that I didn't know about furniture and bedding. And the training was very helpful with the job that I was doing.
good,I really enjoyed working for Macys just wasn't enough advancements for management. The discount was also a great incentive. I would go back but I would want a higher position.
good,"I would normally go in a 6 in the morning and work at any department they need that day mostly in women's shoes. In women's shoes I would mostly be on the back and restock boxes and lable. Sometimes I would be asked by customers about shoes sizes and if they were available, Then I would answer the best I could and also check for sizes. The hardest part I guess would be finding hours only because of my position and hours weren't always availble, but othewise the job was great. The most enjoyable part would be the co-works who were fun to be around and helpful."
good,"They are amazing I started as a seasonal colleague and ive gotten promotions every year I'm now a safety specialist going on 5 yrs of employment."

good,This can be a great place to work if you don't mind slow days or busy days. There is an open door policy. Management keeps it lively. We are a team!!!
good,There has been a lot of management changes which is a challenge. Each with a different perspective so there is always a learning curve. Seems like the company is struggling with direction.
good,"It was an overall great experience to work there overall. The managers were chill, not too pressing about anything (other than safety). We had one paid lunch and one unpaid break. If I remember correctly, unpaid was at 9:30pm and paid was at 1:30am. Co-workers were reliable."
good,It was a great company Nd I wish to work there again or to become a sales manager in the future. I wish the best for the company Nd Keep the hustle going.
good,"I loved working there on floor 1and half."
good,Beautiful store with a lot of employees trying to get sales so they can get commission. Very stressful the constant demand for credit card . At least 3 per day. Very hard to make the goal. This is one of the thing I don’t like about the store
good,"Really enjoyed working there but having to look on the computer for hours is not a good policy. They should give people hours"

My manager is specifically very nice man willing to train and teach to become better in the company always understanding. Nice easy-going laid-back company so no pressure made me want to do the job better.
good,I was a seasonal employee for Macy's and enjoyed the holidays with the store. There are many management layers but I always felt like I was part of the team and my hard work acknowledged. You definitely get back what you put into this job!
good,"a typical day at Macy's was cool, clock in go to my area and start helping customers. customer service is huge part of a sales position and its also my favorite part."
good,I was given good hours and the job wasn't really asking for much. I mostly was in the stock room arranging shoes and getting the shoes for the sales associates. Management is great. The work environment is very diverse.
good,A typical day would be clocking in then attending the early morning meeting to discuss the quota for the day or week. Then we would begin to lower the ramps and pull the conveyor lines to assigned trailers. It would be usually be 4-6 lines. then they would start the lines and packages would come down and we would stock the trailer for the rest of the shift. 8 hr shifts we got a 45 minute lunch and a 15 minute break.

good,"Macy's can be a busy environment. I would say the hardest part of the job can be dealing with a customer who is trying to return an item that has exceeded the 30 or 60 day time period.  The item cannot be returned, therefore, you have to call a Manager for that issue.  "
good,Good job but the hours they give you aren’t enough. . I don’t make  30 hours a week maybe about 18. I like my  work family but I need a job where I can receive benefits and work full time hours.
good,I only worked part-time therefore most of the questions did not apply to me. I only worked on week-ends. I have a weekly full time job. I enjoyed the retail experience. There were no hard parts of the job.
good,"it was a nice place to work no much more to say it all depended on your emidieted manger"
good,Macy’s was the first job I ever had and it was one of the best things that could have ever started me off. Five days a week for 8 hours a day I was on my feet walking the store picking online orders or I was packing orders and shipping them out. It was fantastic and I already miss it.
good,"You just had to scan items and change the price of items. Since I worked at the galleria location, for lunch there were lots of choices. Also, we were in charge of loss prevention and returns."

good,"It's very chill and relaxing when you know what your doing and if you don't know something just feel free to ask the managers are real nice real helpful. Hardest part of the job would probably be just looking for certain clothes that are really hard to find but you shouldn't sweat it a lot of times another customer just has it, also you have to be on your feet for a good amount of time. Most enjoyable part of the job would be when there is hardly any customers and your just in your zone on the job finding clothes and cleaning the dressing rooms and re-racking the sales floor with no disturbances, its very peaceful."

At my location, in Aiea, Hawaii it was a bit fast paced but there is always something to do. I guess thats why an 8 hour day seemed to pass quickly.

good,"Great environment, good benefits and excellent customer service. Great management, good policies. Treated equally and fairly. Fixable Availability. Friendly team."
good,The atmosphere is great as are the people. It did not pay as well as I thought but the atmosphere was really relaxed (except during the holidays) They expect you to always smile and greet everyone. It is very pleasant
good,"I loved working here. I intended to continue this job for at least a year, but the company broke their contract, closed stores, and I was forced out of my job."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work. The coworkers are always kind and love to help with any question you may have, management is amazing and they always work hard to provide a safe and friendly work environment. I have learned how to do the job right and to do it at a quick pace. ten out of ten would recommend."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them meet their clothing needs,My United Way experience provided  excellent preparation for my Macy's position."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I enjoyed the employees and customers,it was a fun environment. They are fair on wages and breaks. They have a good schedule if system that makes it easy to take time off"
good,"Macys is a great place to work!! Highly Recommend!!! "
good,I loved my job and my store from day 1 and cried when I left. Our store was among the second round of closings and we were all devastated. I had an incredible experience working for this company.
good,"A typical day at Macy's would either include if you came in for the early shift, is to do BOPS or picking out orders from customers that ordered online to have packed and shipped. Other than that, you would clock into a register and start helping with customers, keeping your area neat, and/or greeting customers as they enter the store. I learned how to work at a very fast and, sometimes. a very pressuring rate to make sure that the customers that you serve are satisfied."
good,Macy's is a very professional work environment with yet a still relaxed and comfortable vibe. I would def recommend working here although the hours to pick up are challenging
good,I would strongly recommend Macy’s for a potential job seeker. You have more  good days than bad. There is  always something going on at Macy’s so there’s never a dull moment.
good,"Ensue compliance to company operations procedures including payroll and shrink reduction, Manage various departments such as Cosmetics and Women lines, Manage corporate and district managers with promotions, maintain records and files, Recognized as top manager of the year."
good,"I very much appreciated how helpful my co workers and the management team were. From the first day I started working there, to my last day. I truly have enjoyed this job more than my past jobs."
good,"Macy's was a very nice experience. I can't say that it really felt like work. Maybe there were work related activities such as undergoing returns and hanging up apparel, but for the most part it was a cozy occupation. Handling transactions and meeting new customers was always fun. It was also a pleasure helping these customers find certain items or discounts. This is a job that is highly enjoyable, and also not one that is very difficult."
good,"Hardest part of the job was knowing where everything was and what floor. Most of the time people would ask you where something was and you were on the spot if you hadn't been there previously. Seems they don't get too many serious workers in there, so if you work hard and put in the time, they'll notice."
good,"It's been a great experience and I love all of the people I work with, including my manager who is wonderful! This is definitely a team player environment, with everyone working together to take care of customers while supporting our colleagues and jumping in to help each other out whenever needed. Retail can be stressful and hectic, but with a great team working together, it certainly makes it more enjoyable!"
good,"Checking the mails and responding to them."
good,"I would clock in. View my work assignment for the day. See which manager on duty was present for the day, incase of conflict management. Proceeded to my area and began working. The place is easy going, however it can be fast paced at times. The hardest part was busy days, holidays, especially christmas. During those peak times you can expect to not leave on time that night."
good,"At Macy's a typical day may include fun raffles, free lunches for our hard work and I cannot forget about the joy my colleagues bring into work, it makes my day better. Management actively listens to all of our concerns and tries there hardest to accommodate our needs when possible. This position allowed me to learn a whole new set of skills and they still continue striving to assist us when they throw new policies and programs our way. Which I enjoy learning new things, it may be hard because things are always changing but I love a challenge and Macy's does challenge you."
good,"Teaching coworker Sign language"
good,Come to work ready to assist the customers. Make sure the fitting rooms and clothing racks are all clear of unwanted clothing. The people are real. The places are real. This job has given me the opportunity to showcase my skills towards customer service and has given me a genuine glimpse of what the company is about.
good,"Good place to work for,  flexible hours. Nice management. Great supervisors, except for one evil one. Good place. Flexible schedule. Plenty of breaks. Good discounts"

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,everyone worked together as a team should talked to one another about the products that come in the store would work there again in a heart beat to see all the team members again
good,Macys is not what you think its is. The fact that you have to work alone and also how you only work 4 hrs a day and yes the pros are you get paid weekly but thats not enough
good,Macy's is very supportive of employees and encourages career advancement.  The culture is fun and lively.  Everyone feels valued. I would definitely recommend Macy's to anyone interested in a career in retail.
good,i like working here the customer will make you have a heart attack other than that it’s a pretty easy job but there is not option of finding a partime job if your full time
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's and the friendliness of the environment."
good,"the environment was very friendly and welcoming. Nice pay, the food is half off for employee. its a very smooth and pretty much easy job. However, I was told the more Macy's card I sale the more chance I would get of getting hired permanently. I sold 16 Macy's cards and I still didn't get offered the position."
good,"It was a multicultural environment. I had the opportunity to meet customers from all over the world. It was a very positive environment. Management would find creative ways to motivate & encourage employees. On the rare occasion of an extremely difficult customer, management would immediately step in to help. It was a team environment. I always felt supported by the management & my coworkers. I loved working with customers. The hardest part of my job was having to leave when I took on a full time position as a wound nurse. Macy's requires employees to work every weekend. As a nurse I am required to work every other weekend. Unfortunately I could not do both jobs at the same time."
good,The managers were amazing when I worked at Macy's. They weren't micromanaging everything you were doing.The customers and co-workers were easy to get along with.
good,Great other than the fact that there is a lack of need for overtime. part time is not upon hire. Can not move around company until 6 months from hire date.

good,"Your co workers are all very kind and helpful. We all help each other out always. Managers are super cool and love their coaching, helping, and advices."
good,"Management wasn't great but it was okay, I loved everything about Macy's EXCEPT THE PAY. Macy's made over $5 million a day from one store and they only pay minimum wage. I stayed so long because I love meeting new people and it was diverse. I tried to become a manager and they came up with a lot of excuses and kept saying i was going to be a manager. I even tried to get a pay raise because i been there so long and I didnt get it."
good,I left because it was a seasonal position so the season was up over all I enjoyed Macy's everyone pleasent the manager are great and the work is fun and easygoing I recommend it to anyone who loves working with and around people
good,My days are busy but full of diversities. On every call I have the opportunity to engage with the customers needs. I really like to take ownership of the call in order to resolve what they are requesting. The hardest part of my job is when I have to hear a bad situation that a customer is experiencing with their personal life. I don't  focus on negative remarks when customers are upset.
good,A typical day at Macys is a fun one. Helping customers with their wardrobe choices is fun and rewarding. Meeting new people and giving great customer service was great at Macys.
good,I loved working for this company because I enjoyed sales and meeting people from all over the world. I am a peoples person and it was a joy to work there.
good,"Macy's is RICH with tradition and heritage which makes you feel very proud to be a member of an American Icon.

good,"Was a very fun place to work and I was saddened when I was laid off. A typical day was provided customer service, inventory, and cleaning the department. I learned again what it is like to be laid off. Management that I worked for was very nice and always hard our backs. The workplace culture was fast paced during the holidays and slow placed during the winter months after Christmas. The hardest part of my job was when we were understaffed and customers had to wait for me. The most enjoyable part was the pay because we also received commission as well."
good,"My position was seasonal, Christmas, Easter Bunny and any special events such as Chef demonstrations."
good,"Sales and stocking merchandise.  Answer customer questions regarding products, maintained fast friendly service.  Hardest part of the job working weekends and late hours. I like working with people."

The benefits are great, and the company does a great job giving back to the community surrounding their store with great events and participation in annual programs"
good,I enjoyed working there. The work was to my liking they did not teach me much or tell me what was gong on with deals so I could assist customers if they asked me about a deal or coupon.
good,"When I got hired for Macy's in the shoes department it was my first job ever! It was very productive, never dull. This place definitely helped me build my customer service skills. "

good,its a good start off occupation where you can get a lot of cash handling and customer service experience. A lot of hands on job can get annoying at times.
good,"This job has to be the most easiest place you have ever worked at. Because it is pretty much new, you dont not get as many customers you will like but you have some. In order to get new customers, you will have to walk around and really advertise your business."
good,Always acknowledged for meeting goals or being a positive representative of Macy's. Anytime there were opportunities for advancement the sales associates were considered first above outside applicants.
good,"typical day was sign in grab your walkie, go to assign station and stand around for a few hours until your break. i learned how to give better directions of the city working at macys and dealing with visitors from out of the city. the management team was always great. the hardest part of my job was standing for 8hrs+ and only getting a half an hr break.the most enjoyable part was the smiles on the visitors faces when greeted and the other employees i got to know over the time of employment. and not a judgemental enviroment."
good,"I Learned how to be more open towards different cultures and being able to apply myself in ""M.a.g.i.c"" which is a procedure you take when  working with customers which is to engage with people and the product they are buying and relation to them"

good,"This was my first store management position for Hudson's, Marshall Fields and Macy's. This was a training store. Meaning it was my job to coach and develop future leaders for the company. The store was in a mall that was eventually closed due to competition from Somerset and Great Lakes Crossing. Although there was a lack of stores in the mall we continued to drive a business.That was the toughest part of the job. the best part was the pride of every associate to make the store successful."

Other than that most complaints my managers were welcoming, caring, and all around great. If they pay was better I would have stayed."

good,Working for Macy's was a fun experience but I very under paid and I'm sure most of the employees at Macy's would agree. Macy's also doesn't give there employees as much gifts and gratis as Dillards. It makes me feel as if Dillards values there employees more then Macy's.
good,"A ""typical day"", not so much. When working with the public, fellow co-workers and trying to control ""shrinkage"", the job proved to be challenging. Every day proved to be different from the previous."

good,Worked seasonal and loved the fact that I could work at night. Perfect for a night owl like myself. Very easy work can choose from differnt types of jobs to do. I personally liked the beauty department. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes because youll be standing for long periods of time on concrete floors. Safe environment.
good,"I enjoy assisting the customers find what they are looking for and provide the customer service they expect and more. At all times, I achieve my tasks and proceed to look for new tasks to help with. In macy's, or in any other job, the knowledge of what the job entails is the most important aspect of your work.

good,"Working as a manager require minimum 43 hors per week. Schedule done for 6 weeks in advance and each rotation is different, require to work 2 nights per week, 4 out of 6 Sundays and you have only 2 weekends off per rotation. Hard to have work and life balance in retail. Macy's is a great company, started my career as a recovery - cleaning the feting rooms and being promoted multiple times. At this moment running multimillion business. Great partnership with management. Hardest part of the job - don't have one. Retail - you ether love it, or done with it and looking for another job. The most enjoyable part of the job - the people! The customers, people who I working with and people who working for me as direct report."

good,My days were generally not too busy only during holidays and audits. I learned a lot about the administrative position including conducting audits and training employees.

My coworkers would sometimes lead me to people if they see them before I do and help me with the sale by telling them about deals we would have at the moment. The hardest part of my job was really just the holidays because when its really crowded you have to really be on a fast paste because there are customers every direction and there asking for a lot but I still managed to always get my job done right and make the store a lot of money on holidays.

good,I do have to say I love my hours and pay at Macy's but the problem that I have is when I can get my hours. At times there are days I don't work and I wish I could so I can make it a forty hour week. A typical day at Macy's is I start work at 6AM to see what I am going to be doing for that day so I don't always do the same stuff every day I could be starting my day off on a forklift and then half way through the day I get told I'm needed to go help out pallet build. So its very spontaneous and fast past most day. I've been taught a lot of there systems in a short period time to see if I could remember how to do them and I think its worked out for my benefit because I am more flexible to be put anywhere and it makes my day more spontaneous.
good,If you plan a career in fashion this is the place to start! Amazing benefits got my promotion within the first month and a half!

good,"I have been with Macy's in Walnut creek for over a year now and they have become like my second family. Everyone that works there is so friendly and when I first started they were very helpful. You do have to be a fast learner but it's not that complicated. The managers that are there are extremely helpful. They help you with different situations and will help train you in things you feel weak at. They also don't ins partnering you up with a fellow associate who knows more and is more experienced. They love to give credit where credit is due and they certainly love to announce promotions. Here at Macys it's all about asking. A closed outhouse doesn't get fed but don't think you can be a lazy worker and get any where in the company. Hard work is appreciated and noticed and is properly placed. I was promoted within 1mnth of working there. And don't be hesistant to let them if something is going on at home. Your managers a Macy's want to work with you and help you. If you don't tell them don't get mad when they can't help. They are professional yet fun. I will say however that they don't pay the best but they have the best benefits, and I'm not just talking health care... Want to know more about what I'm talking about, be bold and apply and you will soon find out."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work in because it allows you to grow as a person, while giving you the opportunity explore different positions. The environment there is very warm and welcoming, especially when you get the chance to meet and interact with different employees. It is a perfect place to get experience dealing with customer service, as well as the chance to be a part of all the support team and everything that happens in the background. In the office it can get pretty busy with all the dead lines approaching for certain things and some interruptions or complications that may arise, but it makes the day go by faster. It really is a place to learn how to deal with different situations and learn to make decisions on your own."

good,"Typical day at Macy's was customers calling in about your Macy's credit card, either the cards did not work or they needed to activate their Macy's credit card. I learned a lot when he came to people Macy's customers were surprisingly respectful, that allowed me to tap into a different form of customer service usually in the field of customer service you do with a lot of angry customers fixing their problems opening with certain solutions but with this it was it was a breeze it was beautiful was nice I enjoyed the job so much."
good,"A typical day at work was to review procedural timelines to receive important medical documentation for employee FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) paperwork and Workmen's Compensation. I would contact employees about their status and doctor's offices about the completion of paperwork.I would manage the checklist of the accounts before turning it over to the data representatives. My co-workers would advise me on the completion and any necessary documents were needed. The hardest part of the job was in working part time did not allow me to reach offices or employees in the afternoon; therefore, co-workers had to wait for paperwork until I would return.I most enjoyed the ability to ensure people of their job security and payment plans; as well as, the option to seek training in-house for promotions. The corporate office moved to Florida and I could not relocate."
good,"SALES ASSOCIATE ∙ CASHIER ∙ CUSTOMER SERVICE  "
good,"Macy's Herald Square is a wonderful place to work at. It is the flagship store of the company, and a tourist attraction. It is always busy at Herald Square so be prepared to have all your skills put to the test daily. As the saying goes, ""If you can't make it in NYC, you can't make it anywhere."""
good,"Inventory was coming in all the time which kept me very busy."
good,"This was the best company I have ever worked for, and I have worked for a wide variety of companies. They do not know the meaning of micro manage. They allow you to determine your levels of success by promoting self-sufficiency, and on top of that they treat you like a human being. This made coming to work extremely easy. You had the support you needed when an issue would arise, but the job was so easy that you hardly ever needed assistance. I worked in the call center in Bridgeton, MO. They also promoted inclusion, so there was always an activity going on and they were always awarding you when you did a great job. I was so sad they didn't have a center located where I was relocating to because I would have worked for this company forever. They are awesome!!"
good,Great company at northland store. Much work to be completed with not enought staffinf so as far as management you dont have a good work/life balance.

I learned that having the one on one with customers makes them want to spend more time with you and come back to buy more. Cooperative co-workers. Opening Macy's cards would be the challenge of working there but most of the time did not have difficulty. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people feel good about themselves.
good,cashier and fold clothes and unfold clothes. get the store in order. sign up customers with macy's credit cards management was great. the hardest part about the job was not enough hours.
good,"I always loved make-up I also like to apply it into different type of skin and always making sure the occasion for the right look.

I learn how to multi-task in being in different departments I learn a lot of different products from make up to skin care to different brands that i was able to share with customers .My managers and co-workers help me to get better by showing me and helping me to learn about the company.

Working across station from other associates kept everyone in a positive attitude and kept everyone productive with their work. Management always walked by stations throughout the day to check up on productivity as well as passing out candies to keep employees motivated and active. Associates continuously bring you carts of items you are to ship out.
good,Receiving and unpacking merchandizes. Work in a team. Time-management. Communication with co-workers and manager.
good,"Go in, get assinged your area or task and complete it. Management was fair with scheduling and understandable. During break time we would play ping pong, very fun enviornment."

While I was working there I ; helped change price tags which were on clearance, found merchandise for online orders which needed to be packed, and did inventory for the whole store after the holiday season."
good,"A typical work day is clocking in, getting your headset on, and just jumping right into checking orders and placing phone calls.  I found it very easy to have fun with the job.  Making friends was not hard at all, mostly because of the orientation every employee must complete before getting on the floor.  Once you get into the swing of things, the job becomes second nature."
good,Macy's was a great company to work both for and with. I would recommend this company to anyone!
good,inbound call center to grant customers increase on their macys credit cards when  i make a customers day when i give them increase on their macys credit card  i have customers service certificate
good,"a typical day at work was opening my register. Then making sure my area was up to par,helping customers with finding new outfits,helping them with anything they needed. ringing up and bagging purchases. my co workers were amazing people loved working with them. management was also great.

I like how macy's have all the emplee work as a team.
good,"In my short time at Macy's I grew to love my work place and all the people in it. I had an amazing boss who was reasonable and kind and very helpful to me through out my time there. A normal day of work at Estee Lauder consisted of me coming in and doing a number of things from restocking our shelves, to applying make up, trying to recruit people to generate more sales for the counter, to just being a friendly face to greet people. All though I only work at Macy's for a short period I learned a lot of communication skills, cosmetic skills,  and how to generate a lot of sales for the company. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was the retail hours, not knowing when you have to be in next and not being able to plan things in advance. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the job its self, meeting new people everyday, talking to my co workers, applying makeup to a client and enjoying they're pleased reactions and gratitude when I finished and just the overall experience."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"days at work were fun as far as I remember. I remember my manager as a fun and humorous person that makes life of employees easier with co-workers who're easy to get along with."

I had a blast, from my amazing co-workers who worked extremely hard to make sure everything was ran right and that the children would have an amazing experience.

good,I will meet several different people everyday and engage in conversation with them while helping them find the product that they want.  The management keeps us informed and helps us keep abreast with daily goals and accomplishments.  I have sharpened my customer service relations skill immensely since I have been at Macy's.
good,A typical day at Macy's included assisting customers with their mattress purchase. From working at Macy's I learn the benefits of time management and few new computer applications such as mainframe. The Management staff at Macy's is exceptional i had no problems with any of my managers. I also enjoyed working my co-workers some of whom are very missed for their helpfulness. The hardest part of the job is when problems occur with delivery and sending the wrong merchandise. the most enjoyable part is when everything dealing with ordering and delivery goes smoothly and  your customers are very satisfied.

All of the managers know your name and are genuinely interested in how you are doing at home as well as at work. Coworkers essentially become an extended family as you strive to make goals for the company, as well as personally because they provide coaching and support to help you better your job performance. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers who are negative and you feel will not be satisfied with any remedy that you have the ability to offer, but the most enjoyable part of my job is the extensive knowledge that I get regarding magic selling, and product knowledge, but most importantly the human interaction that I experience personally and professionally."

A typical would include me either working on the till, or stacking, shelves, making sure all the aisles looked neat and clean, or dealing with customers complaints at the customer service desk, or just preparing samples for the new promotional sales. Fortunately we had a manager who knew how to be professionnal and supportive. However the hardest part of the job was for me to work 6 hours long with a short break of 30 minutes. I tend to find it a little brief. "
good,"The usual day at Macy's is about average. This company was my first full time job. I first started with them back in 2011 for the holiday season. I learned quite a lot. I learned how to run a cash register, speak with customers, and how to keep a sale going. The pay was in a good range. Co-workers I always got along with, most of them even helped show me around the store, things in the department that I haven't seen or dealt with before. The hardest part of the job is only when you are trying to reach your sales goal when there are very few customers in the store. Sometimes we would have goals of over 1000 dollars to sell, but there is only people that buy no more than 50 at a time. The most enjoyable part is surpassing the sales goal. I've known a few co-workers that have made more than double the goal. We had a percentage of how much we've sold during our shift, some made the star daily, which is a list of associates that did a excellent job within their department. On that list, you can see the top 10 sellers of the previous day. Very few times, i made the list myself. My highest sales percentage was a little over 180% back in 2011. I greatly enjoyed working there, and I would definitely enjoy working there again."

good,"The management and training for holidays is very quick and challenging but rewarding. Overall I felt comfortable with my position, and worked well with my supervisor, counter manager and faculty. The experience working with customers and the demand for credits are often overwhelming but after some experience it tends to get better. Handling money and counting drawers should be monitored by someone before doing it individually. This task for beginning employees is a lot to ask. Overall I was satisfied with working at Macy's for the holiday season and look forward to future employment. "

Such as if a customer wants to use certain coupons or to look up customer information the system allows that to happen with no problem.

The most enjoyable part of the job is being rewarded when a credit is opened or someone notices an associate going above and beyond.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, alot of customer interactions. I learned how to handle the customers more effectivly and about mens clothing. Managemnt is always nice and very dependable.

good,"Scheduling / hiring / termination "
good,"You have work Flexibility, you can swap with other employees. Overtime Options. Easy job picking orders for the customers. Doing a lot of walking. Hardest part it just not finding the items that are on the order  "
good,I enjoyed getting more experience however they was unorganized I had no department but I loved helping the customer and being there but it could be a lot better
good,"Macy’s is truly an amazing place to work, they take care of us and everyone for the most part is super friendly. If call centers are your thing I highly recommend. My only discrepancy is they expect you to live there it feels."
good,I always enjoyed coming into work. Sometimes I would be in an area by myself because some other associates would call out but management would always do their best to help me out as best as they could and always made me feel appreciated. The managers were always checking up on me and asking if I needed any help or even just offered to help without even asking. Macy's was always a wonderful place for me to work and the managers were always pushing for me to move up the ladder.

good,"Macy's is a amazing place to work for anyone who is interested in a family type place they really have your back, and you can really feel at home with this company"
good,"i dont have anything bad to say about macy's at all, we hired thousands of people each season, the pay is great, i was an Ambassador an a forklift operator, i delt with 50 to 60 people each morning as in new hires to show them there departments an speak on safety, i loved it but then i had to move."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Theres a lot of people easy to get lost. I worked in the mens department. There was a lot of people who would look and not buy so be prepared to stand for long hours. They barely give hours so get to know your managers and co workers.
good,Room to.move up in the company. Learn a lot from the supervisors. Macy's have a great work environment it's safe clean great staff. If your a person with an outgoing personality I recommend you to apply to Macy's you never know where an opportunity can take you.
good,"Macy's culture is a fun working atmosphere, colleges are friendly. Seasonal positions are easy and fun. The holidays are the best time to become employed with Macy's and you get the employee discount."
good,"It was the best job because it was retail and something that I really enjoy.                "
good,management is understanding when it comes to balancing your life outside of work with their work environment and they work to help you surpass expectations
good,"Working at Macy’s, you’ve got to be quick with what you do. It’s pretty easy to get lost in the store and working in each department. It is mandatory to walk around the store and fix the merchandise, to make it look presentable."
good,"I enjoy working at Macy's.  I work in the Backstage Dept.  I love all the aspects of working in this dept.  We do everything from stocking our own shelves, setting up displays, markdowns, etc.  Everything but unloading Backstage merchandise from delivery trucks.  I have a great Dept. Manager and 2 great Leads who have all taught me alot in the almost 7 months that I've worked at Macy's."
good,"I've had a really fantastic time working at Macy's. It's a busy, often hectic, fast-paced work environment, which is a great fit for me. My managers and colleagues are wonderful. It's a job I look forward to going to each day."
good,I think Macy’s is a great  place to work with greAt opportunities to advance. Management is wonderful about understanding when you have personal crisis  the company is good about taking care of its own
good,I have been working for Macys for 3yrs. I work in fragrance and have learned a great deal of info from just working in the department. Although competitive there isn't too much stressed. The hardest part of the job would be stock if there was a hard part. My most enjoyable part is connecting with customers and helping them with a fragrance.
good,Job was pretty easy as well. Stocking and go backs are the worst if you don’t like standing for long hours or folding clothes. Cashier is hard to Learn at first but once you get the hang of it it’s a piece of cake
good,The schedule is very flexible. Managers are helpful and friendly and so are the co-workers. There are good benefits for everybody. Macy's is a good place to work at overall.
good,Good Team  good management very helpful very respectful on time polite understanding reasonable always can ask for rearrangement for scheduling with no problems
good,"Individually based safe working environment on every level. Willingness of every employee is amazing. Their patience is outstanding when hiring individuals with disabilities. "
good,One of the best jobs ive had. Everyone was nice and willing to help when things got overwelming and i would do the same. All the managers were very strict on being on time so I was always atlesst 10 mins early each day. There was plenty of overtime and i would always be the first to  any extra hours that were avalible!
good,Macys is a good job. Except during peak season its horrible they hire nebody that does app. Ghetto n all its a mess n i hate that time of the year and all the childish gossip rumors n drama is at its worst bt wen peak is over i really enjoy working there bt sum supervisors need some training learn how to talk to employees tho. Ive crossed trained in all departments. The only dept i dnt care for is jewerly.Bt other than the terrible peak season its a good job weekly pay. Ive been there a while so the pay isnt too bad.
good,Many of my colleagues were in the company for over 10 years. Their explanation to do certain parts of the job seemed very... unconventional and not to be used by everyone. Macys is a great company but it can suck you dry
good,I always like coming back for the holidays seeing people I worked with before and meeting new people hopefully I be coming back to the store I always love that for the Holidays
good,"I loved it, everyday was something different and fun. All the staff at Macy's are extremely nice, and helped me with whatever I needed. I worked flex shift so basically I could work in different departments every day, and I got to choose my hours and when I wanted to go into work. If you want to be constantly moving and busy, I'd recommend applying for first floor juniors section"
good,"Macys is a friendly environment to work at with a lot of activities to keep employees motivated, they also like to do a lot of charity work. ………………..."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy’s at herald square is a literal magical place to work. I never experienced any difficulties except with 1 manager but that’s normal there’s always that one person to make your life miserable
good,This was one of my favorite positions. If you have a good understanding and pay attention. This is a great place to work. In this position you are given simple undestandable instructions to do the job. Once given the job instructions it's very peaceful while working. The more you work the faster the day goes.
good,Staff and management are awesome and make you feel welcomed. Mature staff so no kids. Everyone works together to help each other out. I would recommend for a retiree or a second job to apply.
good,"Everything was great. Flexible schedule hours and great pay, the environment was very good. Everyone worked as a team to achieve goals. Managers were very helpful when it came to improving on anything that was needed to succeed"
good,Working there was the greatest experience of my life. Everyone there treated each other is family and that was very important to me. Management was above board and did everything they possibly could to help you and train you. If we were short-staffed they seamlessly move people around to cover the store. I would highly recommend anybody working there.
good,During the time I’ve work at Macy’s I enjoyed the time been there. The people I worked with was very helpful & understanding being that I was new & didn’t know the ropes to the store .
good,Es una empresa que te ayuda a crecer hay un ambiente laboral muy sano
good,"Tips I would give is to be on time to work, pay attention during cashier training, and you have to be flexible to work at Macy's. Also there is always something to do while working here so don't ever be caught doing nothing."
good,"I’m working for the company passed a year already and I like it it’s kind of fun "

good,"I loved working at Macy's Guam!  My co-workers were fun, energetic and positive people.  Management and peers were extremely helpful and did not hesitate in sharing their knowledge if I needed help with anything.  Our customers were also awesome and I do believe that stems from their shopping experience and interaction with not only the sales staff but any employee at Macy's."
good,"Greeting customers enthusiastically. A casual conversation leeds to customers need. Teamwork from colleagues and management help in executing sales. Reacbing daily targets. Great company culture very professional and friendly. Only difficuty when sale is down. The most enjoyable part of job is when you see your client fully satisfied. Building a strong business foundation."
good,"Work merchandising stockroom organizing  "
good,I worked for Macy's doing a variety of rolls staring out as a Dish washer for the marketplace food court.

good,Working at Macy's is one of the best part-time jobs one could have.  One gets the flexibility of scheduling according to one's own availability. I never got bored.
good,There are many things to learn at Macy's.  Employees are given choices about their schedule- great model for that.  Management is driven and expects the best.  Company could improve ratings by adding more employees in departments to complete workload and to improve store organization.
good,"My typical day of work at Macy's involved moving product via stand-up forklift, which in my opinion was fairly easy work. The quota is not high at all, so it is fairly easy to keep. Management was great and treated people with respect and dignity. There was a bit of drama, which was annoying, but is fairly easy to avoid. The hardest part of the job was really only the 10 hour shifts, but you are provided a few breaks."
good,Overall great company to work or start your life in retail. The room to advance is based on your work performance . The pay is ok so it is worth it ..
good,I have fun working with the customers and helping them to find what they are looking for. Having fun working with my co-workers. Managers are doing well their job.

good,"I liked very much worked at Macy's, you can learn a lot there.  My managers were really nice. Sometimes the old co-workers were little jealous of your sales, but that is normal in a sales environment."
good,"I worked for Macy's for the holidays since I knew I was going to be transferring to Austin, TX in the following year, so I didn't get a chance to experience the full  benefits. Our macy's was much like a family where everyone took care of one another and was always on hand for when someone needed help."

good,"I loved working at Macy’s , I only left because they didn’t offer enough hours. I worked there for almost 3years and I never wanted to leave , I just had to because of the hours"
good,"Fun environment to work in. I've learn to work with the environment.  Management listened to my choices. The workplace was strictly business like. The hardest part of the job was finding the look for the Ad.  The most fantastic part was the enjoyment my boss "

good,"i loved my time working at macys. It was my first time as a cashier and having a big responsability of a sales floor and knowing where thigs were located. It really taught me to be independence and be by my on. The management can be poorly because it a busy store and they have a lot to do, they should a bit more friendly and give you more recognition as an employee that is working really hard."
good,They have amazing management. They will train you to make sales and assist customers. Great work place setting. Provide the tools you need to do your job daily.

good,"Macy's is a great place to work on a part-time basis when needed, I don't mind working here but it is very stressful on my health standing for long periods of time. I am looking for a Clerical position with very little standing and at least maybe a place of education or legal."
good,they had a way to make work fun with balancing work and goals.  this company was very passionate about giving back to the community and involving employees.  this company really made it feel like home away from home.  they used your skill set and would help with advancement.

good,"A typical day:"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I've been there for almost 6 weeks now, I work the weekend shift, and I love it. The supervisors in my department in weekends and weekdays are great,  I sometimes pick up shifts on weekdays, very professionals yet fun and easy going. I'm already a trainer after just 6 weeks and anyone can do it as long as you show good work ethics, work hard, be sufficient and  Meticulous. My coworkers, I wouldn't trade them for anything, hard working very fun to work with, competitive and there for you when you need their help. I made few mistakes when first started but my supervisor didn't grill me or say anything to me out of place, in the contrary she told me it was ok with a smile and explain with great details how to best avoid that mistake the next time. Same thing for the weekdays supervisor, she is a genius at solving problems, she walked through the steps of how to best do certain task and if a mistake is made how to find it and fix it. There are rates you are expected to meet however, to them quality is more important than volume and the rates are doable after a while. Work can get hectic or boring sometimes but not too hectic or boring. I simply can't say enough about Macy's."
good,Awesome store manager and rest of management also ensured employees were satisfied and happy while maintaining a productive environment. There were events at least once a month that kept it fun for us.
good,"As an AP detective, you aren't making as much as a police officer. This is an entry level job. There are strict rules and guidelines Macy's Asset Protection goes by and one mistake could cost your job and Macy's brand. Along with the legality, apprehension, paperwork involved, I personally do not think we get paid enough. At my store, our schedule are very flexible to meet your needs with school or any personal responsibilities. There isn't too much room to move up unless you want to move. I would recommend this type of position for starters who are seeking the investigation and criminal justice side. For example, for every shoplifter or dishonest employees we catch, that is one less perp we have to deal with in the future."
good,"Macy,s is a wonderful company and place to shop and work because it is a great company and competitive work.I am a person who likes helping people to make easier what they want and like to do my job right way."
good,One of the better place to work but in store retail is going downhill. Good incentives and can be fun with the right manager supporting you. Wish they paid better.

good,Honestly they tough me fast and I learned fast I had a good time. Hours were great never worked on the weekends it was great and I can honestly say they were very understanding with anything and would give you extra hours if you asked for it.
good,I worked with amazing staff. Great opportunities to grow within the company. Great benefits and salary. Must have great costumer service. Overall a great company to work for.
good,"I was temporary, But my experience was good. Management is one top of its game at the location I was in and it was very organized which I loved. Its very clean and everyone who works there is like a family and they will really take care of you."
good,"This was a part time position that was quite enjoyable.  In fact I looked forward to working on my scheduled days. I had a strong following of personal customers who looked to me for assistance and advice.  With my previous work experiences, there was nothing hard about the job."
good,"During my time at Macy’s, I was asked to advance multiple times. I was able to experience many opportunities which enriched and challenged at the same time."
good,"Managers are fun and easy to talk to, People you work with are cool, the managers  are chill until their bosses come around then you have to actually do your work, when there is notghing to do you can always make returns"
good,Macys work environment was a easy  slow- to - fast paced environment. Macys taught me how to learn what style a person is willing to buy with just as simple conversation.

good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's. Management was great, easy to work and communicate with my associates. Teamwork was a plus!! The environment was easy going.

good,I enjoyed the whole Macys experience.  The environment was positive.  I enjoyed my customers as well as employee discounts.  Flexible schedule.  Great managers.
good,"Me encanta, haces solo una cosa, mi jefe era súper buena gente, nadie  te molesta"

good,"It's a great place to work , you get to meet great people , the management is awesome and nice , and they work around your hours if you have an emergency or something ."
good,It's retail... if helping people makes you happy then this is definatly for uou. Just smile and be helpful and if you don't know find someone who does. Treat them how you would want to be treated if you went into a store.
good,Great place to work at. People are often friendly they tend to give you flexible schedule and work with what you need. I worked at the downtown macy in boston so I can't say for any other Macy's out there in different location.
good,"Considering I was not a full time employee I really enjoyed my short lived time there. It was a new experience for me to be outside of food service and i am so glad I had the opportunity to work with such a great team of people. The management team was more than amazing. friendly coworkers, great environment for the open minded. Room for advancement assuming full time. What else can I say this is by far my favorite place I have ever worked."
good,"Working for Macy's was by far the best work experience in my life."
good,Enjoyed my time working with the company. Had wonderful co-workers and managment with a wide range of customers. Holidays were hectic but wonderful sales and products!!
good,"Worked here for about a year and a half, always had manager support, great with scheduling. If you need a day off they’re good at working with you. I did LP so it was a little different for us, but it was my favorite job I’ve had."
good,A typical day was in and out. Do your work and move on. Simple and easy. Everyone was very helpful if you didn't understand they are right there to help.
good,"Get there every Friday-Saturday morning at 5:55a.m. and clock in to head back to stand up, listen to our goal and other announcements that either our manager or supervisors put out for us to know and then go over our safety topic for the month. We then go collect our gladiator and scan in for attendance and look at the board to see where we have been placed for the day."

good,"a typical day was to be prepared to greet and help guest. I've learned to always be courteous. Management is really professional and friendly really good at assisting and helping you along. The workplace culture is a positive, so many great people to work with and around. The hardest part of the job was leaving for the day or for the end of the contract. And the most enjoyable part of the job was wanting to stay."
good,"Working at Macy's allowed me to stay on my toes, a typical day at work was always exciting because you'll never know who you would interact with, meet, and make relationships with. Majority of the management team at the previous location I worked was really calm & collective. If I had a problem or confused about something pertaining to my job I was really comfortable enough to talk them. In my perspective, the hardest part of the job is the High Volume and High Stress from the customers, especially women. But, the most enjoyable part of my job was also the customers.

good,"I grew up visiting Macy's in NYC every Saturday along with my Mom.  It was breathtaking for me.  The clothes, the toys, the magician in the toy department all fascinated me.  Working there as a seasonal hire has been a joyful, and meaningful time for me.  It is unfortunate that as a seasonal hire I need to leave."
good,"A typical day at Macy's was always being productive, courteous, getting to help customers and seeing the smile on their faces as you would do so. It would be challenging sometimes in terms of the work load, but it was all worth it."
good,Retail environment is very different now but Macys changes with the times. Unfortunately my job was eliminated. Time to see what opportunities are out there for me.

good,"I've learned a lot of things in Macy's especially my computer skills.When I first start at Macy's back in 2015, I have no experience in computers. I started improving my computer skills when I was assigned to be a packer/shipper. It was an amazing experience and each and every day I'm learning but also having so much fun."
good,"I prepared my station for opening with opening registers, cleaning, putting stock on floor. Once store open my job was to build rapport with my customer and saw what brought have to the make up counter,  rather if she wanted to get a skin information about what skin care she should use to doing her make up and educating her on the productsI'im using and the benefits it will have on her skin. I learned that when you educate yourself on the products then educate them they will come back because you are trust worthy to them.  Macys is a fun and friendly place families can shop and  workers have to work at a fast pace while meeting all your customer needs without them feeling rushed. The hardest part of working there was other employees trying to steal your customers. However, I just had to remember whats important is the customer experience while shopping. The most enjoyable part of working there was to see a smile on the customer face and building rapport with them and seeing them come back and shopping with you."
good,"Macy's is one of the best places i have EVER worked. The managers and fellow staff are fantastic, the environment feels great, the hours are good (if you can get them!), and you never feel bored. would HIGHLY recommend as a part time job!"

good,Great place to work flexible with almost everything. You have to be able to be efficient and on top of product knowledge. You have to have great customer service
good,"As an Asset Protection Detective, we are expected to stop and apprehend (hands-on) as many shoplifters as possible. Because we have numerous gang-related and ORC thefts it can become stressful when alone."

good,It was a great job with great managers. Everyone was really nice and inviting toward one another. We would help one another and on holidays managers would supply food to thank their associates.
good,"Macy's was very flexible with hours. Majority of the staff was quire friendly and the managers were great. There were points of crazy rushes and then there were points of calm. The store was sometimes disorganized, however."
good,"As a seasonal associate, I was at Macy's for only a short period of time. The time I spent there was spent learning the process of how online orders are taken from the sales floor, to the customers front door step. It was a great way to learn the other side of retail."

good,"My typical day as their levis coordinator was clean, stock, and help customers in the levis department. I was able to go on lunch almost any time I wanted. You get an hour lunch and a 15 min break if you are there for an 8 hour shift. Its a great job if you are in school or if you are able to get a manager position because you can advance in it. So far this was my most favorite place to work at. Unfortunately they didn't have any manager positions open at that time I was there."
good,Nice perks for Associate discounts. Associates are very hospitable and willing to help you succeed.The store environment is beautiful and pleasant; makes you want to come to work everyday.

good,Very energetic and a fun company to work for. Very professional. I loved it. I love the customers. The atmosphere was very family oriented and we would see some of the same customers who would ask you to help them because of the level of service that you gave them. It was very fun.
good,"Working at Macy's was a lot of fun , engaging with customers from all around the world, introducing them to new fragrances and holiday packages, for them and their families"
good,I loved working at macy's. If you love fashion then its the best place to make a career. Making customers happy was the best part of my job and customer service is key.
good,During the morning hours right before opening the store I had to rearrange the display to put the new items in the front next to the glass. Majority of the time I spent straightening up areas and inventory on what items that needed to be taken down and which items that stayed out. Several times I gave helpful advise to some customers that were having a hard time making up their minds.
good,The store was very flexible in assigning hours to you being able to pick up as many hours as you would like with three call outs available for just a seasonal employee was good and have recently emailed me back for another seasonal opportunity but in Massachusetts.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,"I enjoyed working for macys, although the pay could be better, its not much to complain about. The managers are important. I got lucky and had good managers. They make or break your job, because they are the bridge between anything you need from the company and any higher ups.  The discount is great and almost outweighs the pay."
good,"Macy's has taught me so much skills about sales and customer service, all that I still apply today. I was just a high school senior when I had this great opportunity to work with a great character building company that helped me advance my skills in styling clothes and accessories, making sales, and providing excellent customer service for all the prospects. "
good,Standing around for long periods of time monitoring customers entering and exiting the store. Provided customer service with essential information and the ability to assist in health incidents.  Lead a positive and strong attitude with the knowledge of deterring theft in addition to procedural apprehensions. Always in communication through a two-way radio to maintain safety.
good,"Great place, very few career opportunities. As a millennial I am looking for jobs that offer growth. There is very few opportunities here as people hold jobs for a long time."
good,Working at Macy's was fun I guess met new people and most of my days I hardly did any work but I was still working slow pace during the day evening time that's when things start to pick up more people coming in and out the stores to b honest I liked evening shift the morning shift
good,"They moved my around where I was needed, it could be packing one day, then picking the next. I've done a lot of different duties at Macy's and I must say, I enjoyed them all in their own way. However, my favorite job there was restock, I was able to be creative with the methods to getting higher production and that made it very enjoyable for me, I like challenging myself and when the work load is high in restock, the only thing that limits you is yourself. I took pride in getting over the average production quotas and they would even reward sometimes for your obvious motivation. I learned many things about logistics working there and find it interesting even to this day. Management was always fair and understanding, that made the overall experience great. The only thing I found difficult was the physical wear and tear on your body during peak seasons. You would receive many hours of mandatory overtime, but the extra money during holiday season is fantastic motivation. Other associates not pulling their weight was frustrating at times, but knowing management was very good at handling that themselves, had it to where it wouldn't weigh heavily on my mind."
good,Macy's treats their employees very well for a retail company. As long as you do your job and follow company policies management doesn't bother you. You are recognized for your accomplishments and management is very encouraging.
good,"decent ace to work at! cafeteria was big & very clean! pay was decent, management was a little up tight and non friendly but the company itself is very good to work for! Had a lot of fun working there even though it was just seasonal it opened the doors to other opportunities"
good,My typical day consists of a steady flow of incoming customer and sales representative calls to help process purchases and account maintenance. I learned a lot with my time at Macy's about the overall customer service experience and what to strive for with each experience. Management and overall workplace culture is very by the books and somewhat generalized most likely due to the size of the company. Don't have any pertinent negatives or positives to mention but overall was a great learning experience for me and again would highly recommend.
good,"Had a variety of jobs to stay busy with and never was bored."
good,Everyday I would be assigned into a section within the store. The people that worked there were kind and helpful when I had questions or needed help. The managers seemed busy but they made time to help out as well.
good,"Complete special setup as per company directives, Worked closely with merchandise to insure they had proper training with placement and presentation of Merchandise, Worked closely with Sales Managers so they had the proper information to train their associates how to properly recover the store."

good,I loved working at Chandler Macy's. The environment was fantastic! The manager's were always encouraging and striving for me to grow as an individual. Someday's are crazy and others are very calm but you always have something to do. There is nothing like this Macy's than the other ones.
good,"Macy's is a fast paced environment and tests your abilities to meet sale goals. It's very culturally diverse as far as customers and employees, also your peers are enjoyable to work with. If you're new, help is always available with any questions you have but don't depend on them completely. Try your best to be independent and learn on your own, you'll learn faster. Learn as much about the products as you can, it's vital to your job no matter what department you work in. Meeting sales goals will typically be the most challenging part of the job but you work as one team. Once you learn more about the company, products, sales, etc., your performance will increase. Always focus on your personal growth and the company."

I gained some awesome life long counterparts in the process and made great connections Co- Workers who i can  use as  a reference for future endeavors whom also help me snag my current positions.
good,you are placed in a work place that literally believes in the happiness of their associates. They have master the art of treat their associates as equals and not as slaves. they pay well to do not as much hard work. I love that place but I want to take what i've learned there and be beneficial else where.
good,"This was actually my first job in merchandising and is actually the reason I started to love being behind the scenes in retail. I would recommend it to any one who was interested in what merchandising is all about, this is a great entry level job."
good,"A typical day at work was to be ready , have a positive attitude to provide excellent customer service to our clients. I learned to be patience and not to take things personal. The management was very motivated and helpful. Macys is a company with a great climate very strong, positive clearly defined and well-communicated. the hardest part of the job was being on your feet ( sometimes) more than 10 hours. I enjoyed the most making customers happy after a makeover."
good,"Like most off price retailers, the company culture is more relaxed than what you would find at a full price retailer. Benefits like flexible work hours add to the positive aspect of the company. There are always improvements to be made. Macys Backstage is a new company as it stands on its own and they will continue to learn and grow."

good,"Working at Macy's has been a great experience, considering it was my first job working directly with people, and everyday was filled with meeting new people that were very friendly. Working my first shift I manged to pick up on most of the hands on training with the co-worker they had me shadow, with her I learned how to ring up customers, clean around the floor quickly and effectively, I also got some advice from the manger that was in the area and when I struggled with opening up a new Macy's card for a customer the manger showed me how it was done. The work place was very fun, considering it was a small Macy's branch, all the co-workers knew each other and I easily picked up on who is who and became friends with them very fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers when they needed it, also just being around people that were as amazing and friendly as my co-workers and customers, made everyday enjoyable."
good,Macys was nice for a first job. They worked with a part time schedule and gave incentives to hit daily bonuses. Easy to move up in the company if desired.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"HOW FUN IS PRODUCTIVE"

Every sales associate is independent, and seems like everyone is conducting their own little business inside this big business in order to provide Outstanding Services. That's the MAGIC of Macy's"

The work place environment was great which required you to get involved, helps you learn to communicate better with different kinds of people everyday.

good,"I worked for Macy's for three years and I could go on forever about how much I really enjoyed this job. After working for a few other companies, none matched the level of commitment to their employees. A typical day included reaching personal sales goals, maintaining a clean work area, and interacting with customers to help give them a great shopping experience. The hardest part of the job is meeting your personal sales goals and credit card applications. The most enjoyable part is definitely the culture. I would recommend it to anyone."
good,I loved working there I enjoyed every min of the job there and would love to work there again. My typical day at work was always changing which made it interestiing everyday when I worked. I always learned new things every single day well on the clock. Management was always their tip top shape and I got along with all my managers. The workplace culture was variously fun to be around I was slowly making connections with my co workers there. I would say the hardest part of the job was the recovery after the day was over.

good,"When I first started with Macys it was entry level. I did not want management to know I was experienced with management background. But, my employee file was looked at and the management wanted me on their side of the tier. I declined at first but later gave in and said yes, as long as the support is there from the higher tier of commands.  Well, 5 years later I am happy to say that the job work/life balance is still unstable but I am still happy with the company allowing me the opportunity to exceed and excel to what I believe I can accomplish. They give you inspiration that it can be done. When help is needed, the support is from each manager willing to assist. The store manager and Asst Store manager are always looking for what is best in each and every manager as well as entry level staffing. Macys is a great career growth and financial stability with many benefits to offer too.  I am glad that the company gave me the opportunity to stick around and be successful as I vigorously climb up the tier of commands myself. I am not quite there yet, but one day I will be indeed be successful with self-actualization!"

Macy's was my first job at 18 years old, started off as a holiday associate on BLACK FRIDAY and in the Women's Shoe Department. If you are familiar with working in shoes in any retailer it is one of the most prestigious departments to work in, You have to build your own clientele, you work on base pay plus commission, handle multiple customers at once and sometimes ALONE and you have many sales goals to meet. The Macy's team is amazing! I must say the way they do training as most retailers do in this day and age on the computers is what I didn't enjoy but being thrown into the sharks couldn't have helped me more!!! I instantly was forced to get over my fears of approaching a diverse group of people and built my sales skills! You have lengthy breaks (1 hour depending on your shift) and there is always a friendly manager/co worker around if you have questions! "

good,"A typical work day for me was coming to work polished, sparkling like a penny.  I felt like a movie star, because attention to detail was the focus.  Image was everything, not in a vain and conceited kind of way, but empowering.  I would come in to work about 15 minutes early and find out how the counter did for goals and if each consultant was close to making their goals, if I had any appointments lined up and contact my customers that had recently purchased products or attended one of my day spas.  I learned how to work as a team with women from Turkey, Brazil, California and places that I'd never heard of that were as different from night to day.  I learned to negotiate, argue and forgive quick enough to take a still photo and noone noone on the outside would know the difference.  I learned to compensated for weaknesses and imperfections, how to impact a sale and empower a lady and male.  I learned the power of M.a.g.i.c.  The hardest part of my job was the down times, because everyone wanted to go home, but it was during those times that seperated the complainers from me, I couldn't just wait for a customer to come to me.  I had to engage the customer, I had to make a connection, I had to get completely out of my way and recommend services to people that had no intention on coming to the clinique counter.   It was then that I found out how powerful that I could be. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I did my own thing with the support of my manager, cosmetic manager and store manager.  It's like they validated my ideas and gave me angels wings at the same time. "

Management was always on call and when it was time for them to break they would always let you know who to contact during their absence.

Co- workers were always willing the help and make the work day go by fast."

good,"My typical day at work begins with the sales goal which is given when I clock in. I strive the whole day to complete the goal, and maintain customer satisfaction as well. The management at my former job was amazing and very motivating. I couldn't have been the top selling associate without their consistent support and challenges for me. The hardest part of my job  was maintaining a perfect area on one day sales. Reason being is because there are always large crowds and it can be very difficult to balance the too. I always made my customers my first priority. The most enjoyable part of my job is selling amazing products to customers. I loved interacting with frequent shoppers and keeping them up to date with the latest fashions and trends."

good,"I arrive there at the store for a morning meeting to start out the day, greet customers at the door, answering incoming calls for customers, folding merchandise that was left the night before, restocking the merchandise that in that section of the department and recover the department throughout the day, What I've learned about the job is that your working along side of the customers to see if they found the item that they were looking for on the sales floor. The management does check out the layout of the department and the sales associate who was supposed to be there and working. The co-workers, were there incase you had needed their help in the department or cover your department when you need them. Not knowing on what some of the customers were doing and placing something on their person, or in their bags, and the list goes on this category.

good,"Macy's is very goal oriented and driven by customer service. ""Customers come first"" regardless of what you are doing. Every morning there is a staff meeting stating the goals for the day by the energetic managers.I truly enjoyed going to work everyday to the awesome energy, staff, and customers."
good,working at Macy's was my first job and it is a great job to have you know being in a work environment with where people enjoy being around other people .even though we had a few bad co-workers it was  still great you had mangers who wanted to see everyone do great and  go up the ladder of the company. the best part of working there to me was making that connection with the guest and making them laugh smile because that meant you were doing something right but sometimes it was hard cause you might run in to a few rude guest but at the end it was worth it
good,"Maintain cash register. I,ve learned to stay calm and flexible. nd when in need, call for assistance. Management as well as co-workers were a joy to interact with . The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to open credit accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was by far the friendships developed through out the years."
good,"I am part of the flex-crew team and I like it very much. I rarely get any hours, but when they call me in, I am more than willing to come in. Perfect job to have while going to school."
good,"While my brief time working at Macy's in El Centro, I had a great time. The staff is extremely helpful and approachable. The management, especially Carla Valdez, are just amazingly caring and supportive. Macy's in El Centro works as an incredibly well oiled machine. Team players. Fair wages. Fair hours. Extreme flexibility. If you're considering an open position with Macy's El Centro, don't hesitate! All the best! ;)"
good,i would go in and open boxes with the box cutters and  then start prepping them to go to packing
good,"After clocking in we gather around for a morning meeting where the managers will go over our daily goal and or upcoming events. Awards are given out daily to show gratification amongst hard working employees. Afterwards, we assume work in our designated areas. The rest of the day is like clock work. While I was there I learned a lot about the inner workings of a warehouse type setting. My managers were diverse and very helpful in my training and development. My co-workers were what you would expect from your typical job sight, but none-the-less cheerful. The hardest part of the job was to make sure not to wrongly ship out an order. The enjoyable part of the job is the constant challenge and competition during the everyday production."
good,"Keep area neat and clean, also trained new employees on a daily bases. I learned that there was room to grow within the company. We had a great team working together to get the job done, but not enough of security on hand when needed in some areas. The most enjoyable part of this job was it's location."
good,A typical day at work would be early mornings laying the new merchandise out moving the out pricing and places sales out

good,"Help customer's find what they are looking for, and keep floor area presentable. Co-workers in the Women's department were amazing at working together. After a few years of not working with the company, a lot has changed. Competitive sales and co-workers in the young men's department don't work together and often steal sales from others."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"There are no typical days at Macy's, which is why I do enjoy being employed there. Every day when I walk into work I have no idea how the day is going to unfold because I do work with the general public and customers bring different vibes and energies into the building every day. That being said, I learned how to interact with a lot of different people and give each of them the special attention they may need. As far as co-workers and management, there's a strong and friendly work setting, no matter if you have to lend a helping hand or be the recipient of a helping hand, criticism and judgement is the furthest thing away which makes each of us feel comfortable. The hardest part of my job is when there is nothing in the store that my customer is satisfied with and they leave disappointed. But on the other hand, the most enjoyable part of my job is when I can help a customer get exactly what they were looking for and they in return give positive praise and feed back."
good,The day began with a meeting with the managers to discuss the layout plan for the clothes. After collecting the inventory I cleared away any plastic and proceeded to hang the clothes. Very frequently I assisted customers needs and questions.

They are also supportive. I found some good friends in this job. My manager is very nice, he helped me build my work experience in professional way that I believe I may apply to anywhere I go.

I appreciate being able to forecast and improvise when necessary. Setting up Holiday decorations was a lot of fun. My manager would direct me if he needed to. Other than that following the ZOG was pretty straightforward. My co-worker was awesome. She and I worked as a team when we needed to. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers having purchased what had been merchandised on the mannequins. I knew I needed to improvise due to the shipment our store was due to receive in comparison to the sku's that were outlined in the ZOG. It feels good, just a bit."

good,This company is a very good company to work for. The manage was very professional and understanding. The team works well together and it’s so much room for growth. I really missed everything about Macy’s. The only reason I’m not there anymore is because our location closed down and at the time I couldn’t travel to another location.

good,"A typical day is just fast paced, always something to do to keep busy even with customers walking around. Always had to make sure the area you worked in was clean and put together before closing. Management was the bomb.com hands down, reported to several managers and all were willing to lend a helping hand no matter the situation."
good,Each day at Macy's is a typical day that came with similar but comforting tasks that were not hard to accomplish in a timely and exciting manner. Never was I rushed or felt under pressure.
good,"The clientele you were in contact with were much better behaved than the clientele in the discount department stores I worked at. The fitting rooms were horrible, however.  Whenever there were busy sales days, most people were sloppy and careless with the clothes, especially prom dresses and good clothes.  Management were good on the whole, but I did have one that could be very verbally abusive in the fact that they felt put out if you asked them to help you with a cash register problem that most managers would have helped with easily.  She was also angry on days where the sales were heavy.  No one really liked her because of that.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting cash for the accounts you secured from customers.  I also enjoyed my ten percent discount in Shoes/furniture, and men's suits, but really loved the twenty percent in all other departments of clothing. I thought that it was great that they taught us what Security did for managing store losses in protecting store merchandise from getting stolen.  Keeping store losses to a minimum was very important and good to me as it could eventually effect our pay if we have too many losses in that area.  I wish I was taller so I could see over the racks and report any suspicious activity. I was only able to report one or two suspicious incidents where one of my co-workers who was very tall could see over the racks and caught many shop lifters.  Rewards were given for reporting suspicious activity after they were caught."

The atmosphere made Macy's a trendy and fun place to happily find just about anything you are looking for, for any occasion.

The hardest part of the job was learning where all the products were located."
good,"Overall i enjoyed the work environment, despite the fast pace of it. The managers are kind and helpful to new comers, the employees are for the most part kind and fun to talk to. The starting pay is decent, and hours aren't bad. My only complaint really is that the customers can be quite rude at times, but other than that overall a great experience."

My work schedule consists of us having two breaks one being around 9 in the morning and the second around 4 in the evening. for my position shipping was the easiest part of the job for me. And packing was the most difficult for me because of some of the packages people ordered. And around 6 at night we get ready to clock out and end our day at Macys.

As a Specialist the responsibility for particular brands, keeping the area clean and orderly.  Always making sure the displays and racks were shopper friendly.  I was given the opportunity of assisting in some private customer makeovers. With the approval of my managers I worked privately with a customer to create an updated look, whether professional or otherwise.  With the help of answers provided by the customer, I was able to pin-point exactly what were the wants and needs of the customer.  Getting to know her enough to pull items specific and colors to enhance her traits.  Trying on from under garments to different outfits and combinations,  The customer would leave with an incredible feeling of self-worth and I felt an incredible feeling of satisfaction for having helped the customer find exactly what they were looking for.  Time is the one short coming of the job. We always wished we had more time to give each shopper."
good,"Macy's offers an incredible career option in all of its departments and positions.  The focus on customer satisfaction and the empowerment given to the associates to do what is best for the customer makes success all but inevitable.

Also the manager was understanding. Relationships within the company are always good to have. There are some employees who you will not mesh with but that is expected. As long as your cordial with each other in the workforce, then there are no major problems."
good,"First off, their discount is the best I have received at any job. I quickly advanced from a position that worked less than 8 hrs a week and made only hourly, to a position that was commissioned and was full time and was also a very high traffic department because of my sales. They reward you well for your hard work. You couldn't get me to leave the building, even on my days off because I enjoyed being there so much. I ended up marrying into the military and had to relocate to my husband's duty station. My only qualm is that they do pay minimum wage."
good,"Associates were allowed to work at their own pace. Also break room was pretty big and comfortable. Management wasn't very included in keeping up with Associates, telling if things workers did was right and wrong."
good,"My job at Macy's was very interesting, every day was a fast pace challenge that motivated me to increase in production in my work habits. I was promoted within a two-year span, because of my leadership, dependability, reliableness work ethics, a team player. the work environment was awesome."

good,"I was recently hired at Macys as a Full Time Seasonal Women’s Shoe Associate. And so far, I love it. My experience has been positive from beginning to current time. Sure, it gets fast paced and stressful at times, but the job itself is worth it. The people in my department are very nice and always willing to help. I get a nice amount of hours plus commission, so my checks are pretty good, even with the pay being weekly. I love being able to actually walk around, explore my workplace, & actually talk to people while working instead of just being stuck behind a register like my past jobs. I was very skeptical about working here at first due to so many negative reviews, but I’m glad I gave the job a chance. I hope to become a regular after the holidays."
good,Good Seasonal Job if you are looking for some money around the holiday season. Very consistent work. Professional managers and workers. The hardest part of the job is the first few days because it is a warehouse and your feet will hurt and you will be very tired.

If somthing is going astray wether it be with your personal life, policy, procedure, software, ect. Tell someone.

I have been in sales for most of my tenure with Macy's and have also been a manager as well. Macy's is the type of company which allows you to grow within the company. Macy's also allows you to balance your work life with you private life. I highly recommend Macy's.

good,Really fast pace environment. with in the first week of working I was opening by myself with no other help. management works great with their employees.
good,"A typical day at work would be me circulating the sales floor talking to associates about sale and credit goals and assisting any customers that need help. What I learned at Macy's was time management and how to talk to people.  My managers and co-workers are hardworkers and friendly. The most enjoyable part of mu job would be, being able to interact with customers."

There is a lot of cross training so that the individuals are capable of more than one function.  This goes a long way in customer service!"
good,"It's a job that a person can stay and work for a long period of time. my only concern is the scheduling system change."

Retail hours can be hard. Making a positive difference in customers day is very rewarding. Must be professional and love working with people.
good,"I've worked at three different locations and loved the majority of it. There were issued with one location in which regulations weren't being followed, breaks weren't being given and managers were intimidating employees but that location was actually shut down not too long after a corporate investigation. The other two that I worked at were great. The training was detailed and evolving, the managers fun and involved, and corporate a constant support. There was often food in the break room and always coffee. When they are being followed, the break and lunch system was amazing, with two paid 15 minute breaks per 8 hour shift and a 1 hour lunch. The schedules were extremely flexible and you very easy to pick up extra hours or trade shifts with other employees."

good,"The most important thing about working is making the customers satisfied. You have to move at a fast pace and also accomplish a lot of tasks. Not every work day is busy.

good,"maintaining supplies such as box', packing tape,paper and labels for 40 to120 packers. Management and co workers are very easy to work with and the hardest part of my job is being on the weekend crew and working 3-12 hour shifts which is also the most enjoyable part"
good,"Macy's gave me the experience I need to succeed in America's workforce. Management changes were present; however, the organization still ran as these people adjusted to change very quickly and efficiently.

good,"Retail is not easy. It demands a balance between labor and sales - which means not enough Sales Associates to keep up with the demands of the sales floors. When this results in long lines at the cash registers, one must be skilled in keeping customers engaged and happy.  Co-workers need appreciation and encouragement to do their best."
good,"a typical day at work is meeting sales goal and asking customers if they would like to open a credit card, i've learned a lot about fashion and customer needs, the managers are very understanding and give you positive enforcement, my co-workers were easy to talk to and even easier to work with, the hardest part of the job was working the holidays but nothing to unbearable, the most enjoyable part of the job was greeting customers and getting to know them on a personal level."
good,My managers would always help out with tasks as well as give me hands on training with new tasks needed to be done. I've learned a lot of skills regarding warehouse work and how to properly handle a scan gun. The only downside is that they don't give many hours.

Each day was new learning experience which included assisting customers with selecting clothing, distributing clothing to varies arears of the store, and maintain overall sales goals..

good,"Really good company to work with, flexibility great team. Macys is such a great fun place to work. Compensation wasn't the greatest but that's to be expected in retail. Especially in a large department store."
good,"My Supervisors and the Management team are so nice, they also acknowledge excellent work. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist customers with their needs. The hardest part of my job is when I am not able to assist the customer due to the warranty has expired, for example.My co-workers are wonderful, always saying hello, and care how you are doing."
good,"I stopped working at Macy's when I was going to get married. I needed time to plan, but every time we enter a mall I say how much I liked working there. Working at Macy's was like not working at all because so many customers would always treat me like a friend, especially when they asked for my help. You see, it was more like shopping with them. A few times I had to go downstairs to the shoe department and help them pick the right shoes that would go with the outfit we had just picked out together. I'm not talking about teenagers. These were women ages 20 and older. I enjoyed working with them because it always reminded me that customer service is much more important than numbers."
good,"At the time, Macy's had the best merchandising and buying training program in the retail industry,"
good,"A typical day at Macy's as a Merchandiser began three hours before the store opened. During the holiday season that could be as early as 4 AM. The morning would begin by the team gathering near a register where we would check in and discuss our schedule for the day. Then the team would split up into groups to tackle our assignments.If we had a merchandise truck arrive the night before the team as a whole would begin placing that merchandise onto the sales floor. The goal was always to have all of the merchandise on the floor and/or in the stock room before the store opened. Then, ten minutes before the store would open the merchandising team would meet with the sales associates for the morning rally. This rally would include discussing events for the day, as well as recognizing outstanding employee performances. After the rally, the merchandising team would re group to discuss what needed to be done next. If the truck was not finished, that was always first on the agenda. Then we would move onto smaller projects such as filling in areas that were looking low on product, creating and moving product displays, completing online orders, and price changes. We used many different tools including carts, cages, price scanners, and registers. My co- workers were great people, always hard working and willing to help. The same can be said for my management. Macy's has an open door policy that allows employees to simply walk in and talk to any manager or supervisor at anytime. Both my co workers and supervisor always provided me with feedback both positive and with ways to improve. I would"
good,i would come in and greet everyone and everyone had a positive atittude.it seemed like we all knew each other before we even got the job. every worker there was productive and active.
good,"Working as a perfume consultant was one of my favorite jobs. I was able to help people find something that really suited them. It was great to learn about different ways to wear perfume as well. I learned most of my customer service skills here due to having to take a customers wants and needs and deciding a product to fit them. Working at Macy's was so fun, there were event sale days and we would have DJs and different fun booths set up and the customers seemed to really enjoy themselves and that was fun to watch. The hardest part was big stock days and trying to help multiple customers at the same time. It was challenging but made the day fly by and that was really nice. he most enjoyable thing were the way the company works. It's so diverse and it's really nice to get to know everyone. It really is one big family."
good,I enjoyed guest interactions as well as getting to know my coworkers.  Creating lifelong impressions for a prestigious company as well as driving hourly sales goals made time go by extremely fast.
good,"Had fun With my customers and co - workers, they were great people as individuals and i learned alot through them. Loved getting compliments from my manager and had alot of fun learning about the products we sold"
good,Everyone at Macy's looks out for each other. If you need help with something their is always someone to help. Nobody looks down upon the other we all function as a family. I would recommend this job to everyone.
good,Overall I think Macy's a great company to work for. There are definitely lot of opportunities to advance to middle management. co-workers are easy going.
good,"Working at Macys has been a great learning experience. The environment is fun, productive, and easy. Everyone is very helpful and team oriented. I love that the scheduling is so flexible!"

good,Great place to work.  Great company culture and the management team is great.  Training is top notch as well.  Big company with a great reputation.
good,"can start very early in the morning, met some really nice people there, my hardest part of the job was finding exact clothing items from guest because the store was so large but i had a basic understanding of where things were placed."
good,I set all the sales in the store before the store open. Make sure everything is correct with pricing. make sure everthing is organized within the store.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Every day was something different and new to learn from. Meeting new customers and connecting with returning customers. I grew as an individual while working with Macy's. I truly enjoyed working for this company because i loved being around people and interacting with them. My co-workers were like a second family to me. Management had its ups and downs here and there. The hardest part was leaving.
good,"Great company! I learned how to communicate better and be more patient. The most enjoyable part of the job was ringing up, I loved it because I already knew how to do it. There was nothing I disliked, my co workers made me feel welcome."
good,Well I started with macys October of 2014 not to long ago. I leaned alot in the little time I had with them. I had to leave in December because my mother was sick with breast cancer an she needed me home as much as she couldd have me. Macys was very understandable my manager was willing to work out with me an I was able to come back an get rehired if I wanted come back. My experience there taught me alot I got to work alot with all kind of people. An i got to interact everyday with all different type people all over the world. Somedays customers were terrible an you learn to let go others days customers were looking for me to help them. An now my mom doing well I can work towards my dream of being a macys employee.
good,My overall experience with Macys Logistics was great! My co-workers and bosses were for the most part very positive and helpful. The pay was very decent and you got paid weekly. They had a good bonus for working on holidays and even had catering frequently.
good,overall i loved working in macys as a beauty advisor because you get to help people learn and become knowledgeable about how they can enhance their natural beauty and give their skin amazing products that will reverse their aging process all while building a good relationship with them!
good,Macys is a fun place to work. The other employees and managers are very nice and super helpful! The break room is nice as well with tv and couch and a refrigerator to store your food in.
good,"Learned a lot about working in fast paced environment."
good,"I learned how to use the register, assist customers & restock shelves."
good,"In a normal working day, it starts with a small meeting to know the status of the company in the previous day. Also, different assignments and short term goals are established. Work as retail merchandiser is very rewarding and fun, because the appearance and presentation of the product has always been one of my strengths. The most complicated work, is when too much merchandise is received and there is no space on the sales floor and warehouses. My coworkers were always looking for me to cast my opinion on the outcome of their work, as it was the only one who had the knowledge in visual arts, besides it was a job assigned to me by the head of merchandising."
good,"A company that surprisingly actively seeks out the hard workers, and continually seeks to help either promote, or make sure that employee is taken care of.  It is a warehouse job though, so make sure you have proper foot wear or your back and legs will be dead and sore by the end of the day."
good,"Excellent training and managers very encouraging in meeting sales goals. Training very fast paced. Customer service skills are put to the test on busy commercial days, staff remains positive. Enjoyed working seasonal and would definitely consider full-time empoloyment with company."
good,"Get to work early, open registers, set up area for customers to arrive and purchase. I learned how to multi-task even better such as taking a customers phone call, completing a customers purchase while on the phone, bagging their purchase, and giving correct change without making a customer feeling like I'm ignoring them. Management were very nice and helpful in difficult customer situations I learned how to handle it on my own without calling management for help. Co-workers were amazing there. Hardest part of the job working a 10-hour shift plus another hour on the busiest days of the year with a line in my department back to back down the aisle. Proud to say I did my job got every customer out of their in a timely manner and happy with the purchases.That was also the most enjoyable part of the job seeing all my customers happy with their purchases."
good,"Macy's is a very awesome and friendly environment "
good,"My typical Day at work would include Replenishing coats to the floor and setting them up . Co workers and Managers are very friendly and make the work setting very easy to work with. the hardest part I would say is replenishing the coats over and over after the customers try them on, but after a while you'll get accustomed to it  but the most enjoyable part is actually helping the customer find what they are looking for and making their shopping experience an enjoyable  one !"
good,"Great people, great store, and great leaders. "
good,"I patrol the Macy's two floor Walden galleria store. If I see anything suspicious I call it up to the Asset Protection Detectives on duty. I interact with associates and insure out static security measures are implemented correctly. (Ink tags, 3 alarms and cabling systems)"
good,"A typical day consisted of doing mail in returns,creating Pick lists at 2pm and 6pm and closing out the systems. Management and Co-workers were always friendly and wiling to help. the hardest part was simply finding the products in the store to ship out."
good,"fixing my area, customer service, great management..great co workers. hardest part is losing a customer."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,the part of the job I loved the most  was working by myself .that let me give customer service as needed
good,Macy's gives everybody a chance to work with customers and learn new skills quickly!
good,i like working at Macys and the people i worked with wish i could of been there longer
good,Being a part of the Macy's team for the season was a great experience and even after a long tiring day at work you would still be able to describe it as an enjoyable day. The atmosphere is great and so is the management and co workers. Macys has great benefits especially for people who love to shop. I would definitely look forward to working with the company again.
good,Macy's allows freedom for life outside work while maintaining a very  positive work environment. Macy's believes in servicing the customer and giving the employee empowerment to do so.
good,picking items and shipping them out learned how to work in a warehouse drive forklifts and be steady n a good hard worker and bring my knowledge n growth to the workforce
good,"This had to be one of the best companies I worked for. I was so stupid to quit. Such a great management team, always willing to help! The only thing I did not like was the ""credits"" you would lose when you called out. And how far it was from home."
good,"enjoy working with diverse people have a lot of fun, the management is great"
good,"A typical day in the Signature Kitchen in Macy's was always filled with fun and excitement. I learned excellent customer service as well as how to work as a cashier. Management was always encouraging and helpful whenever staff needed them. My co-workers were typically joyous. The hardest part of the job was not over sampling the delicious food we were serving as well as the long hours of standing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Holiday season. All of the decorations, songs, and the warm joyful environment it included."
good,"I enjoy working with Macy's MLA because it is a very positive atmosphere to work in. The management and employees possess a very eager willingness to attain the goals that are asked of us. Great vibes begin at the morning meetings where the administration congratulates and recognizes each and every employee that helped contribute to reaching certain goals daily. They also reward employees that go above and beyond their workloads as well. I thoroughly enjoy my coworkers and their strong wills to get the job done as a team. The hardest part of the job would be getting new customers to apply for the Macys card, but their needs are always fulfilled in the end. The most enjoyable part of the job is truly helping the customer find what they need and seeing the smile on their faces as they say ""thank you so much, see you next time!"" There is truly magic that goes on at Macy's Mall of Louisiana."
good,"It was a fast paced environment where I would talk to people everyday and assist them of where they needed to be. I would fold clothes and hang up any merchandise that needs to be put away. Their is always something to put away in every department. I was always busy and worked very long hours for example I started at 12PM and worked through 11PM. My co-workers were very friendly and helped me through my first day of work very well, they showed me just about everything and where everything was. Management wasn't really around but my supervisor would tell us what to do then leave. Most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers to where they wanted to find clothes. The hardest part of my job was putting away little kid clothes because it was so small and it looked so similar to a lot of their products."
good,macys was a great job the only issue would have to be that they dont give you enough hours . other wise its is a wounderful place to work the people are very nice
good,"Absolutely amazing place to work; this job is perfect for someone who is looking to gain experience in business and potentially branch out into bigger things.  I started out as a regular associate, but with dedication and communication with managers, I was able to move up the ladder and earned to become a sales supervisor during the Christmas seasons; this is GREAT for resume building and earning experience.  The best part of this job is definitely the people and the connection with each individual.  Of course being that it is retail, it is not easy work, however, the experience earned is definitely worth it.  Management is great, and they are always looking for ways to better both the sales floor and their associates; absolutely no complaints here.  Job is very hectic, and scheduling can sometimes be a hit or miss, but overall the company is definitely worth it and has helped me drastically strengthen my resume and skills."
good,I love working at Macy's. It's a very diverse place to work and i love that about any job but mostly Macy's is number one in that. You meet a lot of different people. The co workers are very friendly.

Macy's has incentives for opening credit accounts. Macy's is also very diverse. There employees come from all over the world which made it interesting to learn about other cultures.
good,"A typical day in retail can depend on what is happening with the weather,  or if there is a sale taking place at the store.  We may have stock to put away, take care of returning items to the vendors, I am responsible for doing weekly department product damages.  My co-workers are really the most enjoyable part of the job.  There are some absolute characters amongst the staff that make you laugh constantly.  The enjoyable area of the job are the senior customers.  They love to talk, but since I work in cosmetics, they love the attention.  If they leave happy, then you have done your job."
good,"work well with both management and co-workers"

We all made feel that road was crossed together.
good,For me a typical day at work was after class in community college. My hours were from noon till about six in the evening. I learned a lot about employee and customer relationship. The managers in the department taught me quite a lot during my first days in Macy's.  The hardest part about my job was standing on my feet all day after recently receiving injuries in other physical activity.

good,"How long will it take to get you up to superstar speed? Spend time on the floor or mirroring a top performer. Ask them point blank, “How long until I can do what you do?” Then double it, just to give yourself breathing room. Is that a comfortable amount of time? Pros: You get to learn a new product, a new system. It’s a basket full of new. I personally thrive on this; I’m a quick learner. I’ve worked with several reps who take a long time to ramp up, and this can cause stress to a new work environment.  Some people need change; new ideas energize them. When I study the numbers of reps who give up, I see a trend of not seeing the real progress that is being achieved in the daily grind. Did you give up too early to even make a good decision?"

Also stocking and cleaning was something I did as well, Macy's management was very great and well professional. The techniques I learned were working on a register, great customer series, and a better approach at setting up big loads of merchandise goods. The hardest part at the job was working on the register because it was a seasonal job and it was on a Christmas holiday.

good,"Everyone there is SO nice. My managers are the sweetest people I've ever met. There's some joking around but it's more about how productive you're being and if you're meeting the expectations, which isn't hard at all. They do have a point system though so it's half a point if you work half your shift, and a whole point if you leave before, or you don't show up, after 4 points you are terminated. You have 6 minutes to show up to your shift, on the 7th minute you are late and lose a point. Pretty standard stuff."

good,its your typical retail job. you do the same thing every day. customers come and they need help and you as the employee you help them. pretty simple and that was every day.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's call center. The teams were great, there was always someone available to assist you when you had an issue. They were very particular about break times - don't talk to anyone on their breaks! Which is pretty awesome. I have never worked anywhere like that. Most places, being on a break doesn't stop people from bothering you."

good,You went through a long training experience to ensure when you are on the floor that you can handle the call flow correctly.

Good friends, good management, friendly atmosphere, daily morning rallies which were mostly fun and informative.

Of course there were some rotten apples (mostly young lazy people who know nothing about work ethics) but aside from that, great place to work."

They start off the day with a daily meeting for everyone that is scheduled to go over plans and just to let everyone know to have a good day and smile. The management is awesome. Every manager is there to help you succeed. The hardest part of the job I would say is trying to hit the credit plan by opening a new credit for a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is with the daily morning meetings. With those it makes the entire day enjoyable."
good,Management is always there for you. always on the move learning onsite and being the best you can be.  Training is always on managers always there for you.

As asst manager, I played a role in which I was proud of and loved everyday.  Working with the buyers was a high light as we connected to what the paying customer wanted and was looking for in a very competitive market.  Being one for detail, displays were always a joy to assemble and assisting elderly customers who came in to purchase newborn garments for their new grandchild or great grandchild, made me feel connected with enhancing their shopping experience.  My favorite, were those who were on limited income but wanted it to appear they spent a lot on a new gift.  I would ask what they had in mind, boy or girl, price bracket, and with  a few clearance items, they had wonderful gifts to present to new family members and no one needed to know they didn't pay full price!"

We sat about 1,000 or more people per day, along with fairy's walking around, which did not make the job easy to maneuver. I decided to make the stressful but fun job worth my time there. I remember how I view things an which the restaurant operated. Once it became flooded with tired shopper ready to eat, but still had hours to wait. I thought of ways to keep them in the sprit. For example: I ask a question about Macys Tree; how tall is it , how many bell and ball on it and how many lights on it.  While they would thing of answer, I would go help other areas. Such as; bus tables, run food, roll silverware and wash dishes.

good,"In all honesty, the Macy's where I work isn't a bad place. The managers and leads do their job accordingly, and even though there are people with bad attitudes everywhere, Macy's employees seem to be a pretty cool lot overall.
