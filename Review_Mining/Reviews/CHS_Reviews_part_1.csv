rating,review
bad,Greedy and have no care for personal life.  Treated me poorly when i went on military leave.  Had the options to help me while i was on leave but chose not to.
bad,Brief employment. Many times watched certain staff belittle and provoke clients. These folks need help. Not treated poorly. Therapists are awesome. The rest not so much
bad,A big corporation only after advancing themselves. Doesn't matter if you've been there two years or twenty. Beware of backstabbing by administration. You are a number and are replaceable.
bad,"Nurse to patient ratio in the ED was 4:1 even with ICU holds. No teamwork. No help from management. Nurses were worked to death and couldnt get any help. There were several ""clicks"" and if you werent park of the click you didnt get any help."
bad,"Made sure we had all the correct information for insurance. Would offer discounts or payment plans or Charity. Had to make sure all reports employees had to do were turned in on time, Faxed, emailed and talked to hospital billing department"
bad,Working for Chs with the kids was amazing and made going to work there easy and the pay isn’t bad for the job requirements.The work environment was horrible no professionalism at all and very stressful because of the people that work there .
bad,"This place is a joke. The only thing decent is the pay. I accepted a contract position part time originally ONLY because the agency and mgmt at CHS said that a position would be opening up in my field within a few weeks. I had never worked in a Fullfillment area, however it was a print shop, and those weeks turned into months.  Started with another woman and she left after 2 weeks.. They went through one other person who left after 2 months and the last person I was working with is now gone as well.  I worked part time and needed full time.  I was put Entity Mgmt doing some other work but placed back and forth. I believe I asked my staffing agency 10 times as well as mgmt at CHS where this position was I was promised and only thing that led me to take this job.  There wasn’t a position they guaranteed from the beginning.. they needed someone to fill the spot and lied to do so. Our trainer was pretty much the reason each person quit. Aside from micro managing he was a spaz. I will say very smart and knew what he was doing but in the print shop.  Talked down to everyone and his verbal skills were all over the place.  He basically remained employed from what I was told because each Dept could order him to do something and he would run and do it. Either way the place lost a lot of employees that were executives and all due to the poor mgmt and little knowledge of running a business."
bad,"Would not recommend wasting time at the CHS facility at Addison Pointe in Chesterton, IN as the manager is unprofessional, disrespectful, rude, and lacks management skills, period."
bad,"This organization needs to be re-structure completely. The upper management constantly lie; yes lie and they only favor those employees who back up their lies.  "
bad,the organization is changing  and I have had the opportunity to be exposed to a new budget software named Adaptive Insight. There is constant change in processes and because of this the support that is provided to the regions is higher.
bad,Not idea place to work.  Most of the time you are doing the same thing over and over again.  No room for growth.  No desire to train you and make you better.  Eager to yell and scream for things that they do
bad,It is not easy to work with children that are on their own with no family members by their side. For the most part the moral among indivuals is pretty low.
bad,"They started a new training program just before I started and I was not trained to do the job I was hired to do. My manager ""sat"" with me to observe me and never taught me a thing. I had to sign myself up for payer websites, get phone numbers, and get email addresses for payers. They are productivity driven without worrying about quality of work and getting resolution"
good,"Management of a 17 bed critical care unit and 23 bed PCU was extremely challenging. The 2 units had been under the leadership of 5 managers in a 3 year time frame, and morale was at an all time low. After working there for 2 years and asking for another manager to be made available for the 2nd unit so that the staff could be adequately trained/supervised for more competent patient care, I had to step away from the facility. Once more stabilized, the staff of both units worked well together as a team. Manager was expected to step in and staff any shift at short or no notice, sometimes working up to nearly 20 hrs. within a 24 hr. time frame.  Management colleagues were good to work with as a team."
good,The work environment is very indenpendent.  Your honesty is very important to accomplish a tast in a timely matter.   Managers are very helpful and are willing to assist you when needed.
good,"I want o work at those places where other staff members are very kind and symphathetic.where staff members are not good there, i try to control my emotions."

good,"I took the position because of a recommendation from a friend."
good,Everyone in the company wants you to succeed and become better for the company as long as the community. The farmers are the most important part to the company.
good,"Good company with a lot of internal oportunities, despite some bad managers and a little of desorganization. The office is really serious,  but with good coworkers."
