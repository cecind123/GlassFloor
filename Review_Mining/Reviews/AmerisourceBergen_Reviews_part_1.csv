rating,review
bad,Poor training and management not aware of all thats going on. compesation is not base on experience and knowledge.  what was offered on interview was very different of what i was given.
bad,"Unorganized, messy, even verbally abusive. This place is the definition of toxic. Who ever kisses the most butt wins. The quality of your work means absolutely nothing if you aren't kissing your managers but morning noon and night. Please for your sanity do not work for this company."
bad,"If you have any kind of mental illness or emotional problems  they will fire you    "
bad,"I enjoyed working for the first department and manager I was hired for; however, the contract ended and most of the department was let go a few weeks after I started. I was one of the few employees they kept that was transferred to a different department.  Although I was grateful for the opportunity; I found the position to be very stressfull due to increased quotas, bad systems and inadequate help from management to achieve success.  Several of my coworkers were let go or quit due to being unable to meet their quotas. There is a high turnover and they replace permanent employees with temporary employees to keep from having to pay benefits, such as insurance and paid time off."
bad,"I would go into my shift and not ever know what time I would be clocking out. In the middle of my and my fellow employees shift, management will tell you in that we are working mandatory overtime. If you worked the night shift you would not be clocking out until almost noon. That is insane. No thanks. A lot of warehouse jobs are like that these days and I am not okay with that.  "
bad,"I have never worked at a company that has such little value for their employees.  They hired over 300 temp workers and had no place for them so they put 200 in the basement, expected us to work with 1 monitor with over 10 pages pulled up at one time and elbow to elbow."
bad,"This amityville location is not a place you want to work. They treat you like your a slave. They’re disrespectful, unappreciative, Conniving and straight up foul. No one deserves to be treated the way they treat us. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME!"
bad,"Too fast paced for a normal human being.....maybe for a bionic robot. Even the young people were very exhausted and tired."
bad,Not a place i would recommend at all absolutely no benefits what so ever at this job they offer pto but u can't use it if u speak English lol they really seem to hate Americans for some reason all they ever do is cater to Cubans
bad,"Your calls are audited 3 times monthly. You're constantly told what you do wrong. Never what you're doing right. You're on production. How many to-do's you clear in an 8 hour shift. If you can't keep up, You're written up and eventually terminated. Family is not important here. All they care about is numbers. Save your time and stress. Toxic Work Environment. Do not apply."
bad,"They hire you on with talk of how your production will be compensated and the cream rises to the top ect. A couple months later, there are mass layoffs, and top producers in the same batch with everyone else."
bad,"This warehouse is a great Comapny before, but once this new manager took over every hardworking person in that warehouse quit, everyone was treated like they were nothing. No good raise, he fires people for the stupidest reasons. And cooperate can’t do anything about it because his boss is covering for him. Not a good place to work. Please don’t waste your time working here, you will regret it"
bad,Disgraceful place to work. Company is very bad. Do not apply to this company. There are better places to work. Management is also poor. No opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Human Resources with a combination of management hires family & friends; in addition to, doing special ‘favors’ for special projects and promotions. There is no room for growth & development. The management & Human Resources work collectively in treating employees unethically. ( The LASH Group sector)"
bad,"I have been here for almost 3 years, and this is what I have gathered."
bad,"Absolute worse place to work at , I would not recommend this place to someone who is starving to death! Management is so unprofessional and has no type of knowledge on how to manage , also  no type of knowledge on how the company runs or the rules and regulations. Favoritism takes a big part in this company if you are liked you will not work if you are disliked you will be overworked. Overtime is mandatory at world courier , if you want to have no life feel free to take this position. Also they will not work with you to help you grow within the company or out of the company . They pay will get you through but most people stay for the benefits. I would rate management a 1 1/2 , co workers were great."
bad,Horrible job do yourself a favor and stay away. Only way to make good money is to go to casepick and work16 hour days no room for advancement even amongst there most valuable workers
bad,Pays well leadership not so good they treat you as just a seat filler. Location is well kept and nice breaks and lunches are nice. If you are looking to
bad,"I'll make this quick and simple. If you want to work here fine but you should know this first."
bad,"They literally bring people off the street and pay them more. They dont compensate the employees that already work there. It's a dead end job. With very little room to grow. And if you happen to advance... you will not be compensated for it. Billion dollar corporation and they pay the bare minimum. These are people with families, mortgages, debt, etc. And the company pays you as if you are a college student living at your parents. It's bad enough it's a glorified call center. The least they can do is pay the employees fairly."
bad,"I recently started working as a telehealth nurse with Lash. Training has been very unorganized and information is not taught so nurses can learn. Trainers talk very fast and run through complex material and expect the nurses then to be competent and capable to do the job.  A trainer said, if you keep asking questions on same topic I will report it to your manager."
bad,If you do a good job you would be expected to do 2 other people’s jobs as well. Management/supervisors are often too lazy or too stressed out and get frustrated when you ask them questions. This is just a garbage place to work and everyone there acts like they are back in 5th grade and are bitter all the time. DO NOT GO WORK HERE!!!!
bad,"Senior Manger from California and Team lead ..both work remote in the IT, are terrible to work with. they have the boss kind of culture. they collect the money from the team including the contractors and share the gifts among these two people. no human respect..and they know how to manage the topmanagement"
bad,"Started as Inside Sales rep then promoted to outside but ran into a buzz saw of a newly promoted District Manager that was not involved in my coming onboard, so tried his damndest to get rid of me and he did!"
bad,"Was a pretty awesome place, company to work for, supervisor was on the ball and all ways had a positive attitude no matter what challenges popped up."
bad,This was a temporary assignment. The job was not hard but the training was very unorganized. The seating arrangement made it difficult to successfully do your Job. The management was poor
bad,"Lies Lies Lies, its a shame how many Lies I was told. "
bad,"This job was the most stressful, unorganized, horrible job I have ever had. This job provided no organized training."
bad,"Catty, cut-throat, clubby. Your teammates may be next to you today, gone tomorrow. No idea where the bar was set, employees are regarded as ""replaceable."""
bad,Very little quality of life as a manager with this company. Upper management needs to understand what it is doing to its people. The turn over rate is a great indication of if this is a great place to work.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. Especially this location. Everything was seriously disorganized. Products all over the aisles. It was disappointing because in the interview and orientation, everyone spoke highly of this place."
bad,Majority of employees are contract. Advancement and opportunities are based on favoritism. They value quantity over quality and ignore the unethical tactics used to increase numbers. Poorly or untrained team coordinators and chaotic training. It is as if no one has done this before but are in a position of leadership. Contracts end abruptly and you are ushered out of the building like cattle as you are no longer of any use to them. Unprofessional environment. Not at all what I expected.
bad,"Terrible place to work because management is not open to new ideas from employees and will micromanage you and corporate just cares about making money so that CEO’s, VPs and such can get fat bonuses. They don’t care that people have families and buy homes or that employees are loyal and sacrifice so much for the company. They pay lip service that they appreciate you but actions speak louder than words and their actions say you are replaceable. Very backstabbing culture only work here if you face being homeless and find something else quickly because you are constantly in fear of being terminated. Fast food companies would be a better option for work. At least you can move up and have some sort of chance at the American dream."
bad,Management is terrible. There's a different problem every week which no one seems to be able to fix. They work you 12 hrs every day. The hr is corrupt. I've been told by the general manager that if I don't like how they run it to go find a new job. They do anything they can to not give you a raise. Overall worst warehouse I've been to.
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked they micro manage you to death you are on you feet for over 11 hours a day and the Management their is so bad and they have no clue on whats going on they don't help when it gets busy they stand around looking stupid and they will not tell you the truth when you are applying for this job they don't tell you about the over time and you have to be 95% to standard all day that means you are running around like a chicken with its head cut off do your self a favor don't work here ever.................
bad,"Bad morale from day one as people don't like their job."
bad,Managers don't care about employees. Bad morale. Not many people like their job. High turnover rate. Managers expect you to remember how to do  a task after learning and doing it once. No grace period for new hires.
bad,"Harassment. Plain and simple. Pinching of my privates, slapping and pinching of my rear. Women acted like I enjoyed it. They didn't foster and environment in which I felt comfortable to come forward. They acted like because I was single I liked it. I would never behave this way at work and really wouldn't ever reserve the right to touch someone without consent."
bad,"The managers have their favorites and they do not provide the appropriate training in order for you to do your job. We had to sit downstairs for three hours for our first day because they had nothing prepared for us. Our manager was out of the office that entire week and she had her team leads to assist us. Yet, they were unaware of our training beginning this day. It was a horrible experience with this specific client that I was working for."
bad,A very unprofessional company with a diminishing reputation. Your success with this company is dependent upon who you know not what you do. Not a good company to work for.
bad,"Manager and team leaders were not professional they won't teach you anything, instead they find mistakes penalizes you for it, but don't teach you how to correct it, the training was suck they throw employees into their cubes to do the job  then when they were asked questions about anything related to the work or for clarifications on something you were asked to do  they won't help."
bad,Terrible management. HR is not helpful. They do not inform you your job is about to be dissolved instead they work you like a slave until the bitter end reassuring you there are no changes.
bad,I have never worked for a company that treats you like a dog and find ways to fire you. They ask for you to go above and beyond and you aren't paid for it.
bad,"Managers and supervisors are very unprofessional and unorganized, The managers are always on your case about you numbers and your pace, They pay poor for how fast they want you to keep up your pace all night for up to 10 or more hours a night. The hardest part of the job is being spoken to poorly, they have no respect for you or anyone. It was a terrible experience working for them."
bad,"I think the company is a very shady place with favoritism.  Employees are back stabbers and it wasn't an enjoyable place to work.  Working for this company was very stressful and didn't take your family life into consideration, especially for emergencies."
bad,"Company has a high turnover rate, no value for employees."
bad,"Please if it is a Temp to hire for this company,don't waste ur time. Especially through Agencies who work for Amerisource.company pick&choose the favs"
bad,This company is ran so poorly. Upper management does not know how to run the warehouse properly. Workers are overworked and underpaid for the amount of work they do on a daily basics. The new quota requirements to work for this company are unrealistic and when not met once you are right back on the streets with no job.The turnover rate is unreal I have watched over 20 employees either quit or be fired since I started 9 months ago and if your a temp you are better off going somewhere else because you will be treated worse than the regular employees. No proper training to prepare you for your position so you will never have the tools to be successful. Hope you like long hours because your typical work day will be no less than 10 hours a lot of time between 11 to 12 hours days 5 days a week!!!!
bad,"Overcrowded, detached management and a culture of apathy did not keep me at the North Charlotte Campus long. I was happy to relocate to a different spot."
bad,I dedicated myself to the operation and supervision of the organizations' new NDC. After two years with the company I was terminated for simply doing what my superior asked. Never trust any member of management or expect them to respect you. They are only worried about themselves and their own agendas. Working for this company ruined my life and career.
bad,"This company has a high turn over rate. People do Not last 3 months. I read the reviews and thought well I'm going to still apply  and the reviews I read could have been from a desruntled employee.  The reviews are very honest. I dreamed about this job at nights, dread going into work each day, miserable, unhappy  and stressed. Had heart palpitations at nights and the stress was overwhelming and I had to resign. The management team is the worst in the world. You will Not last 3 months. Trust me; heed my warning.  Do Not work here. The stress, pressure, and sleepless nights from this job may kill you."
bad,"The people are hood, the management doesn't;t know what the heck they are doing, and the bonuses are subjective.  I would not recommend working at this company."
bad,The amityville location is a joke. They don't respect workers. Management are rude and condescending. They have a union but they are not of any use. Do not work there!. The turnover rate is crazy. They disrespect the workers and if u dont comply they harass and write you up. Very bad managers.
bad,Long hours and unachievable goals add up to misery. Low pay when it comes to the industry standard. Management runs around like chickens with their heads cut off. They are more interested in getting rid of you than helping you achieve success. They have their favorites.
bad,"After working there for sometime, I've learned about about the company. I knew from the start it was a bad idea to work for a company that does not have an onsite HR. Every bit of communication with HR, I had to wait for a reply. HR will always agree with management. They make the rules as they go and add them in the company handbook. All about numbers and they expect you to move your personal life around their schedule. Worst thing is working on holidays if the schedule falls on it. They make you work on your days off, write you up when you don't show up. Use you and when their done, send you home. It's good for a paycheck, but your better off working for a company that values their workers. Cheap company that pulls in billions but the raise is minimal, and bonus is that of a bottle of medicine. Save you time. Don't bother applying at AmerisourceBergen"
bad,"Easy going job, pay was decent, family oriented. I love working here. Management at times may suck but overall they try to help."
bad,Be sure to ask why the person left you will be replacing.. More than likely they resigned because they were unable to meet the unreasonable requirements for the job or they were terminated for no cause.
bad,"This is a job for World Customs Brokerage/World Courier which is located at New Hyde Park, NY - brokerage manager (who got fired from Fracht FWO Inc and AN Deringer) will lie to you on a daily basis and promise you big things to come and then you'll hear that she never promised you anything and that you just making things up, Many people quit from World Customs Brokerage and no one cares why, that's why they're looking for people now instead of trying keeping people who worked there for 6 years or more, Complains were filed to AmerisourceBergen HR about brokerage manager and brokerage lead abuse but nothing was done, So if you want to be a slave and get nowhere  -  this is the place for you, good luck"
bad,We are treated like robots. Ridiculously long hours. Not allowed to talk or we get written up. We run around like chickens with our heads cut off and they still yell over the intercom every 15 minutes and tell us to hurry up. Sweat shop...
bad,Most people that work there are temporary so that they won't have to provide benefits.
bad,"This job was a complete nightmare and nothing but stress. The fact that all you got all day was hounding emails from management and their little peons that was below them. No matter what you do nothing is never enough and they clearly only care about quantity versus quality but when you make a mistake which is clearly likely and going to happen you have to hear about what you did wrong and what was discussed in training. Oh please! How can you remember everything when every week there is a change and clearly not enough communication. The parking lot is far away from the building seems like a mile away. Very unprofessional, rude  management."
bad,"Never work for this company. If you respect yourself and mankind, you'll run from this place. Job is extremely stressful and thankless. As a 3 year devoted reimbursement counselor, I was basically pushed out the door so they could not give me a raise. They just want to hire new people occasionally so the pay rate stays down. Your job basically consists of being on hold with insurance companies for the duration of an 8 hour shift. If you don't get the quota of casework out a day, even if its out of your control, they will fire you. You could give your best and they say thats not good enough. If you want to be rushed, stressed out and always scared your going to be terminated, then this is the job for you! You are constantly getting emails all day telling you to work faster and to not talk to anybody. Emails were monitored and there is no privacy at your desk. Rules were always changing. They expect quantity over quality. They promise overtime yet Never give it, unless you are one of the ""chosen"" employees. They have weekly meetings which are just the supervisors screaming at all the employees for not ""being perfect"". There is no opportunity for advancement unless you are a total butt-kisser. Supervisors have no personality are very cold and there is so much favoritism. They will see you in the hallway and not say a word, but when you get to your seat you'll receive a long degrading email from that same supervisor. They promise raises and job advancements but when the time comes, they give lame excuses as to why they can't achieve either of those options. Yearly raises are .20"
bad,I enjoy working with people also to assist with my customer services skills.
bad,"**WARNING** Don't take the bait and fall for the misleading job description. As an inbound patient care coordinator you simply answer the phone from patients / and prospects to enroll them into a drug discount card. You are never allowed to deal with doctors if they call. At the interview they tell you that there is overtime available, bonus program, rewards program Blah, Blah, Blah. For ( Bilingual ) they train you "" If you can call it that "" for 2-3 weeks in the morning and after training you are told by email that your new hours are 11:30 am to 8:00 pm therefore eliminating any chance of overtime. I was told by supervisor that the early shift will "" never "" be available for bilingual reps. This company is happy to pay for language line that cost's ( $ 2.99 per minute ) ( $ 179.40 per hour ) and plenty of calls that require an interpreter in any language last 1 hour or longer. There are many calls made to and from interpreter "
bad,Don't work there. It's back breaking work and the pay isnt worth it. I'd rather work in fast food.
bad,"The warehouse located in Brooks, Ky is ran by the worst management. They do not care about their employees at all. DO NOT APPLY. The human resources department is even worse than management. You can't trust anyone."
bad,"I joined the company for the benefits, location and compensation was ok.  After working there for a little while I realized the work environment is a dog eat dog environment.  Like crabs in a barrel.  Human Resources does not have proper support and backing for the management team, they will do whatever to avoid a law suit even if it means wronging the employee.  Your superiors DO NOT care about you despite the fake smiles.  Management constantly talked bad about their staff.  It's just a toxic environment and you are constantly working, no time for breaks or lunch.  The best part about the place was the lake view, I had to get out of there."
bad,There is not one positive remark I can honestly say about this company. Amerisource is only interested in money and does not care how its achieved. Taking advantage of terminally ill is despicable.
bad,I spent almost 2 years here. Waste of time. Poor poor training. Supervisors and managers do not care about you and do not want to help you grow and learn. They spend more time writing you up and putting you on performance plans that even exaplaining to you what you did wrong. Low staff and too much work. Supervisors and management do not seem to kept but just walk around and talk all day. He does does nothing to help when you take concerns to to them. This is horrible company with horrible leadership
bad,"I was interviewed to be an order puller, spent the first 30 min training to be an order puller then was thrown into shipping for 6 days. I spoke with management about the fluke and they explained to me that most employees are cross trained.Then explained to me that i didn't apply for order puller but (WAREHOUSE ASSOCIATE) which was a lie, because that's what the manager interviewed me for and had applied to. Then explained to me they don't have time to train me in order pulling even though they are short handed in that department, and that supervisor just sits down all day doing nothing... i quit after that since i didn't agree to stack boxes all day. This is a revolving door of a company, with low pay and low hours. They lie to you since day one, no honor or respect among management, co-workers are nice but the company is a joke and a half. They have mandatory breaks and cut that from your pay, so out of a 12 hr day you only get maybe 9 1/2 hrs what a joke for a Billion dollar drug company."
bad,"The management here can definitely be overhauled. The system is set up for employees to despise others. Training is inconsistent and as a result of the poor training floor workers do not have the tools necessary to do their jobs without high levels of stress. employees who care about their jobs and serving the clients usually end up leaving because management cares more about quantity over quality, another stressor."
bad,Do not work for this company they are fraudulent! They give you a 500 dollar sign on bonus. Also up front PTO that you do not have to put in for because they will do it automatically for you! But there’s a catch! Should you for any reason leave or be terminated from this company they will take back half of the bonus and whatever PTO you had in the negative!
bad,Manager is bipolar and not on meds. Has temper tantrums and throws things around flips trash cans on floors. If you have an emergency or appointment good luck getting time off .My mother passed and they only wanted to give me two days instead of three as is company policy.
bad,"I was treated poorly by management, by HR, and co workers. The only reason I stayed for over a year was because the pay was good. The employees would send messages about me through messenger, and they would call HR on me for nothing. Eventually I gave in and quit. Save yourself the hassle on applying. If you are mexican or asian you'll be treated fairly."
bad,"I worked a customer service position. When I started they promised professional growth opportunities which I never saw. First they called me and informed that I was chosen for a job opportunity. The day I started it was a whole classroom full of people. Yes, they hire in groups because they know that people are going to quit because of the heavy load of work versus the pay, and how they treat you.  They also tell you that you have 20 PTO days but, God forbid that you get sick. They will write you up and go against you. I saw people going to work very sick because otherwise they will get in trouble. Another promise is that they promote within. They first told me that I had to wait 6 months. After the 6 months it became 11 months. Then it became another excuse. I applied several times to positions because I had all the requirements and never heard back. Not even a thank you for applying. I spoke to a manager which they were 7 and ended with only 2 and she informed that when they open a position they already have someone for it. So, what's the point of applying? Finally, this company does not support their employees. The customer can be rude and disrespectful to you and they don't back you up. I am very serious about everything I mentioned here. I use to drive almost 2 hrs. each way daily to work here believing their lies. This is a Fortune 500 company that has become a big monster and they don't have any control of their management and how to treat their greatest assets which is their employees. Sad but, true."
bad,"Worst place to work, only do it if you are desperate for money, you won’t have life and you will work a lot for not much money, good benefits though but super poor management, it looks like the management here doesn’t have any experience to be a manager"
bad,"Poor management. You have more people watching you and running telling stuff really not worth nothing . Training is horrible.whovj they will hold you accountable,though you had a bad trainer"
bad,"your day may be busy and irritable. if you're a good worker they will take advantage of you while everyone else gets to slack off. management is poor, Favoritism and discrimination supervisors try to make you quit rather than fire you."
bad,"Bad management "
bad,"Irregardless of the modern, progressive image that the company very much wants to project, it has a very traditional corporate culture. Your success depends more on your connections and political savvy than your skills."
bad,"poor management, poor planning for anticipated increase in workflow."
bad,It's a shame that a company in the US has this slavery environment. The overtime is mandatory every day 13 hours or more  and they ask you to come earlier for your next shift. A lot of favoritism. Supervisor treats employees like slaves. If you want to be treated like a slave and no respect as a human being this is the place . Worst company to work for.
bad,I WOULDN’T RECOMMEND THIS JOB TO ANYONE!!!! Poor management! Never know what time you’re getting off. 14 hours days ; work every holiday if you’re working nights. No time and a half for holidays!!!
bad,The emloyees who have been there a while suck! Management are out for themselves. Some of the long time employees are lazy and oblivious to what role they play.
bad,"I have never worked with so many people and yet knew nobody. You were not given the proper training nor tools to do a good job. The job had potential if you are one of those people that just do as you are TOLD, go home and come back the next day. Rinse and repeat."
bad,"very hard place to work have to watch out for management all the time management makes your workday very very stressful the attendance policy put in place is a joke. You can clock in 5 minutes early but not 6 or it is a tardy. On my very first day was given a tardy for clocking in 1 minute early. 2 for not clocking out, the last one was 2 days before my 90 days was to be completed and the HR guy who fired me was smiling the whole time."
bad,"Management was only interested in their own interest and ensuring a share value to maintain their positions.  Patients and customers suffered due to a lack of products necessary.  In some cases, the lack of products created serious issues for patients in life-threatening situations."
bad,"Stayed 8 weeks and left after lunch and never looked back."
bad,backstabbing directors that take pleasure in being condescending to make themselves look better.  top heavy organization that instills competitive rivalry amongst top levels causing insecurity and backstabbing nature that is passed down to subordinates.
bad,"you are just a number here and numbers can be replaced easily, they are always short-handed so the good employees are fatigued and overworked all the time. HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES ! when there's down time use that time to get other things accomplished that employees have been complaining about so things can work smoothly. its pretty darn simple"
bad,"Management are liar's.when new product comes into the warehouse for distribution,their spouse to do a time study to find out how much time does it take the workers to fill the orders to the client's."
bad,"Extremely unprofessional, horrible work environment for work from home employees. Bullying, retaliating, and no one there is qualified to be in their positions. Everyone does what they want, there are no rules and therefore you will get targeted almost immediately. The reviews are wrong, they have people quitting all the time. Stay away."
bad,"I didn't mind working at AmerisorceBergen. There were a couple of  problems I had with them though, they never tried to put you in an area that fit your needs and the manager had an investigation against him for treating his employees wrong, but they never did anything about it. He also cursed out a lot of employees. It was a very hostile work environment."
bad,"I have never worked in place that refuses to allow employees a break for a 10-hour shift.  They did provide lunch but it was to be eaten at your desk. The desk wasn't really a desk at all. It was a table that was shared with another person, in a room with 100 other tables shared by 100 people. This was the set-up for seasonal employees. The training was awful, every team leader showed us a different way to do things, no one knew what they were doing. One team leader was CONSTANTLY yelling and screaming at people and not one of her supervisors did anything about it even after multiple complaints. Totally unrealistic ""production"" expectations. This company will tell you they value a work life balance, but it is a lie. They expect 10 hours of straight work with no break and if you do that and actually meet their production numbers you get rewarded by being forced to stay to produce more. You can never schedule a doctor appointment because you're never allowed to be late or have a day off. This is the absolute worst job I ever had!!!! If you want to be treated like a slave working in loud sweat shop, get yelled at all the time, be lied to, and no matter how much you produce be told it isn't good enough, then this is the job for you! If you have a mind, an independent thought, self respect, or any type of life outside of work, do NOT accept a job here! You will be happier working at McDonalds."
bad,"Amerisource Bergen is a one of the most despicable place I have worked the management is like a working with jr high girls. there was gossip, people personal like getting spread thru out the company, and a the manager used to wash dogs for a living at pets smart had no experience in warehouse at all. the regional manager was a bigger idiot had a answer for everything didn't believe in solving issues. daily the workday was a guessing game on number and lies on how they don't know anything till the last minute working from 11 to 13 hours with no warning or announcement of a ""system error"" till the last hour when all along they sit on the production number for the shift before we start and lie to our face and say they don't know. save your self the trouble applying unless this is you absolute last resort."
bad,I recently got hired and worked a couple of days and i was rushed to the emergency room for chest pains. I called the two days that i was in the hospital talked to my supervisor and my wife called my manager explaining what was going on with me as Sunday I returned to work 3rd shift and my manager said welcome back as i showed him the release form from the hospital then about 5 minutes later  the manager and supervisor called me in the office and said i was terminate without a written or verbal warming and the 3rd shift management has no business running as he listen to the supervisor who is arrogant and seems like he don't like Americans  and the manager only been there 6 months and he acts like the character from the tv show my name is Earl very dumb.And I got a hold of H.R they are for the company they are useless I guess we live in a NO CARE WORLD we are falling apart within I guess we are not allowed to get sick anymore they expect us to have a heart attack there. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY IT'S ALL ABOUT THEM
bad,"The Williamston Division; Horrible unethical visionary with destructive leadership abilities, skilled at ruining teams, with no knowledge in change in a competitive and complex business environment. Proficient at destroying morale. Horrible decision-makers with weak problem-solving and organizational skills. Inability to smoothly manage complex and conflicting needs in a dynamic environment."
bad,Low morale no raises. They would implement a new quality policy then change it b/they didn’t want to give the raises that were introduced with the program but never had a real answer as to why they wouldn’t give a raise...horrible place management sucks!
bad,This job is all about who u suck up to. It's way to much favoritism and to much gossiping along production workers and mangers. Let's just say if u not in the in crowd u will never advance. They promote compation more then teamwork which creates ego problems. The QA manager on 3rd shift doesn't do his job well and also speak to u like your a kid. They created pmo levels that also creates conflex with coworkers. There's always someone trying to throw someone under the bus just to make themselves look good and the mangers and supervisors condone that. The 3rd shift supervisor has a huge attitude problem and doesn't knows how to be a people person. Instead of trying to build a team or promoting team work they would encourage coworkers to point out each other's flaws or compete with each other.
bad,"interim leadership roll opportunity"
bad,"Don't give this warehouse the time of the day. The management team will talk down to you, they will disrespect you, they will threaten your job with no solution to improve because they have no clue what they're doing.  "
bad,"I really tried liking this job, I'm a top performer. The pay is good and the benefits are okay but the management are ridiculous and have no idea what they're doing. They'll lie to you, talk down to you, play games with you, tell confidential information about you in group meetings with other coworkers. Theres a reason they cant keep anyone and everyone quits. And if you talk to anyone about maybe changing how something is done because its ineffective or can be improved upon they throw your ideas out the window and continue the old way. Then write you up from deviating from an sop that was constructed probably when the company first opened. Management has zero idea how to do your job and its really up to your coworkers to train you. And because they cant keep anyone because management is toxic you usually work 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week because your shift ends when the work load is completed. "
bad,"I always read reviews before starting a job and this is one time I wished I listened!! The Poor Reviews are True even the ones on Glassdoor."
bad,"One of the worst companies that you would work under, Littered with Favouritism and Politics. The Distribution manager and the Lead hand are absolutely clueless and useless, Keep giving long and useless speeches whenever they get a chance!!"
bad,"Not the place for anyone who appreciates having a competent manager, work/life balance, or a place void of politics. This was the most miserable job I've ever had and everyone around me felt the same to such an extent that employees left in droves, not the company has to resort to advertising on the radio that they're hiring. The red flags are legion. If you're desperate, get hired and immediately start looking for something else because management will be the main reason you leave."
bad,"If you work here you'll know what a failing warehouse looks like. A lot of the items picked for orders get brought back because they're either the wrong item, to much of an item, or they got sent a damaged item. The inventory is a horrible mess and the only reason this warehouse passed the audit is because he got a list of product they will check before the big wigs came in to check. There's a lack of true leadership and good management, for example the leads and managers refuse to take proper actions against people who continually mess up or distract others from doing their jobs. When we changed from Scale to PKMS it added more steps then needed to do a simple job (it sets you up to fail basically). You will work on average 11 or 12 hour days every day and the overtime is required. One of our biggest customers is Banfield and because of how terrible we're doing they want out, which would be amazing on their behalf. Management and leads refuse to let receiving receive in products opting to pull the to pick or pack instead of doing the job they were hired to do. The incentive bonus doesn't do much for you when they let you get trained improperly and you fail from lack of proper training. Management and leads like to play favoritism over employees as well. To top it all off for people who have been here for at least 2 years, you have people who have never done any warehouse work telling you how to do your job when they can't even do your job. The only good thing about this job is good PTO. The pay isn't even worth it at this point. Do your self a favor and stay away from this"
bad,The company needs to place more value on grooming and promoting from within rather than hire externally and offer those candidates/associates a much higher salary than internal hires.
bad,"Typical day consisted of changes due to the fact no one was on the same  page, managers never checked remotes work to see if they was doing the job like they should, WHen you spent your time fixing the remotes mistakes you would get warned or yelled at like a little kid. Not to mention a manager would be bipolar and freak out if you didnt respond automatically to her emails. and Voluntary OT ment you better do it or your in trouble or possibly fired."
bad,"One day they called a meeting said we did a good job we met our quota a head of time and told us we had 30 mins to finish up turn our badges in and leave. Then rejected our Time sheets for 30 mins after kicking us out.We had 2 months left on our contract."
bad,I worked for a year with no problems going from contract work to being hired on full time. And then...all of a sudden my work was poor and I needed to be retrained! I received numerous customer service awards for my work but they said I wasn't doing my job right! In your 10 hr day you were only allowed 10mins of bathroom breaks. You were not allowed to talk to other co workers. PTO time was only approved for managements favorites. I would never recommend this place!
bad,"I knew what I was signing up for, however the location was a beautiful location a little short on encompassing culture but the people there tried to make you feel included."
bad,"I work there for 4 years. Its was OK at first until they got bought out by another company. They work until the work is done, that could be over 12 hours. They call your breaks, if the the truck is late leaving your going to break late sometimes four to six hours till your last break. You have no life working for this company. I don't recommend this work environment to anyone. And yes they do show favoritism. If you have no life no family and you like a lot of overtime and bullcrap, this the job for you!"
bad,"This company either likes you or they don’t! The staff are cliquey and mood and under trained.  The HR department is a joke! Management picks and choose the “all star” employee and then plays one against the other! There is no direction and people do whatever they want there. "
bad,"you learn nothing here , management are not professional , too many meetings just to waste time and do nothing , one manager for the night shift controls everything even the other managers afraid of him , its a big mess managers dos not know if their guys are working today or not , they dont know what is the duties of their guys , ."
bad,"Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful  take your talent to companies who will appreciate dedication and hard workers. Constant bulling, used as example, constant fear of losing your job. Open door policy means close door policy, reporting means retaliation."
bad,very stressful. very unfair the have here favorites treat you like you in pre school spy on you. Write you up for being late for break being late or anything especailly if your on the phone to a customer you get in trouble for helping.
bad,The company is made up of about 70% contractors and in the technology costs for unallocated time each month have gone to $1M.  Lots of job openings because people are leaving.  Business Portfolio Managers are nasty people that do not know how to collaborate  but lead by throwing knives at people.  Process changes weekly and is never socialized correctly
bad,management will literally lie to and say it is okay to go home when your are visibly sick and on medication then fire you and pretend that you never were approved to leave and will even make false docs against you. i will never ever recommend. never. not worth the stress or labor
bad,It seemed like their was no room to grow unless you knew someone that was higher up in the company. The hardest part of the job was working nights and being a single mom. I wouldnt get the rest I needed.
bad,"Oh where, oh where do I begin?!?! As a registered nurse of 15 yrs & oncology certified, I have NEVER worked at a place with such total disrespect for their employees!! If your ""shift"" is 8 a.m. To 5 p.m., you better make sure you are in your shackles by 8!! If God forbid a child falls ill at school, you fall ill in the middle of your day, or anything else life throws at you...you will be ""awarded"" w/ an occurrence!! Oh...and please keep in mind, your work day consists of telephone calls, NOT direct patient care! So please explain to me how leaving an hr early to pick up your dead dog off the pavement after being run down by a semi, really affects ANYONE!? And as far as your nursing knowledge...forget it!! You read from a script & cannot under ANY circumstances, offer your expert suggestions or opinions. Worst of all? This company has their clients (pharm companies) completely SNOWED!! They are in breech of contract on a daily, if not hourly basis!!"
bad,"This has to be the worse company I ever worked for. Management is like none I've ever seen. Very protective of their positions and have to be a ""company"" person or your out. Management treats you like children. No chance of advancement unless you become one of ""them"". DO NOT WORK FOR THEM, YOU WILL REGRET IT."
bad,"Abusive management — the kind who uses his or her authority to torment subordinates. Bullying bosses, often with the goal of humiliating. They write up false evaluations to put good workers’ jobs at risk. Serial bullies, targeting one worker and, when he or she is gone, moving on to their next victim."
bad,"Work 10 to 12 hours Monday and Tuesday, even working at a hectic pace all day. Management doesn't have a clue of how to run the place. Also workers are treated very unfairly and if you are not on somebodies good side in management, don't expect anything more than a paycheck."
bad,"This place is completely insane! Will work you 15 hours and tell you when it's time to go home to come in early the next day, you basically work 1st and 2nd shift all in one day. No appreciation, VERY VERY racist against Americans. Management doesn't have a clue. Workers are unhappy and complain constantly. Would never reccomend this place to anyone."
bad,"This company has been undergoing a reorganization for the past 3 years, and there are no signs they are going to be done soon. Management does not value hard work and promotions are based on politics not performance. I wish I found this out before I wasted 3 years of my career."
bad,Mangers will ask for your opinion and tell you you’re wrong. 1st and 2nd shift never have to finish all their work and goof off most of the time and leave all the work for third shift. Worked over time all the time. They hired leads that were flat out racist and said would not Trina anyone that could not speak proper English.
bad,"My previous manager was very  complacent and thrived on hiring people that couldn’t think outside the box, in which provided job security for their position. To have worked at this company all their life “Proves It.” Always talking about the team yet smiling in their faces. My manager kept the drama going and feed into gossip. They build alliances to cause a divide within the department and coworkers. Basically play people against one another. This causes friction and leads to a very toxic department."
bad,My experience at Amerisource started out good but they have a high turnover because some people do not know what the job entails and then others are fired because they say they are not meeting productivity levels. Then others if they don't like you for whatever reason they will find a reason to get rid of you.
bad,they have associates train you except the first day and the person that is  yo do it only does it for one day.  Management is not good.  they act like its coming out of their pocket anything you do.  you are written up for going to bathroom and water fountain if its doing work.  They have an extremely high turn over rate.  its good pay but they don't care about their employees.
bad,"Thete is no work life balance. This DC will suck the life out of you. Never enough time to complete any task. Never know who will be terminated next. Management is only concerned about their self. DC bumped all associates rate to $18 per hour. Great pay why so high turnover. Current month hires 30 associates, 45 associates left DC. Run far away until this company does something about its lack of managers/supervisors including the Diector of Operations, nothing will ever change. Look at the history of this DC."
bad,This has been the worst job. Its practically slavery.  When they want to get rid of you the manager would even make up things that never occured and do write ups behind your back.  The worst thing is that upper management believes them as they are not around to see what the individual does to the associates.  Its abusive
bad,If you want to work hard and not get paid what you’re worth this is a great company for you. No advancement opportunities unless you’re super old and have been working there for years. Or unless management likes you.
bad,"Supervisor sleeps with team member and team member uses that to her advantage. Supervisor lies, cheats and steals to make sure his non favorites are beat down. Team members will throw eachother under the bus every chance they get and back up and do it all over again just to watch others die slowly."
bad,"Sadly, company need to change the management style where most higher management micromanage teams. people come and go every few days which leaves staffing needs open at all times."
bad,"Unless you plan on being in the same role for years. I wouldn't waste your time. Management is poor, and gossips or never available. The only person who seems to have interest is our VP, But of course they're never around"
bad,This company doesn’t care about there people. Management sucks and their racist. New rules daily to set you up for failure if they don’t like you. The benefits are good. Hate the long hours. You get incentive pay but the don’t pay it all to u when u earn it. U won’t only be going what ur hire to do . You will do ur job plus others if ur done for the day. Product have had mold all on it and mice. I just couldn’t take this place any longer. If you get sick u might as well be ready to get a corrective action the day u come back .
bad,"AHP is owned by Amerisource Bergen. The pay was excellent, but the work environment was stressful and dysfunctional. It is by far the worst place, I have ever worked. There are no women in leadership roles in this company. The women that have been in leadership positions have eventually been forced out; the culture has been very male dominated and a very ""head down, mouth shut"" culture. If you know FDA/GMP's and have an opinion - do not work at AHP. "
bad,Management is a joke very rude an unprofessional your just a number to him. Worse job I've ever had...................................................
bad,"Management  know they  are telling a fat lie during the interview process. Then once you start it's not what anyone imagine,  too much work and under paid. All of the DC centers have professionalism.  Salary doesn't have people skill especially Olive Branch Ms. Everyone is new and not who the say they are from 1st shift day Manager on down.  Don't no salary with there training run they dept.  Just ask any one there if you know of anyone that works there, they say they are looking  for employment."
bad,This was by far the worst company I have ever worked for.  They treated their employees disrespectfully.  Most employees do not have degrees.  The management was extremely discouraging and unprofessional.
bad,"I was heavily recruited for over 6 months before I came on board.  From what I read and heard the place sounded awesome, and they had great comp and benefits, but that is so far from the truth. Once I started though, I realized that they pay higher because they work people to an early grave. Once on board I was shocked at how unorganized and thrown together the entire enterprise was. It was very apparent that they grow way to fast without proper planning and vision.  There is a huge gap between what the executives say versus what is in place.  Hardly any funding for R&D, training, or additional headcount.  Everyone is expected to work themselves as hard as possible all the time.  I consistently worked almost 70 hrs a week and every weekend.  In the middle of my short tenure, they had a reorg and I was told my role would switch from technical to mostly administrative.  I was given no training or guidance, just a pile of unrealistic responsibilities and expectations."
bad,"A good place to get experience, but would like the opportunity to grow and explore higher realms of the business world.  I would like to use my college degree and apply it towards a more satisfying job opportunity."
bad,There is alot of nepotism and favoritism.Promotion here is based on race rather than qualification.Job openings a filled in advance before being posted.No room for advancement.
bad,Would do 3 hours in inventory then 5 hours in customer care.
bad,This would be a good job if they could keep employees. Management is horrible and no one wants to work in that environment. It was difficult to finish task without the proper amount of employees.
bad,"The Lash Department of Amerisource is the worse department to work in. The Lash Department dont appreciate the hard work that their employees do. They hire the worst managers and when you have a disagreement with the managers or the managers are unfair and dumb. You go to HR, nothing is done about the situation. Also, the Lash Department does NOT and will not do much for their employees on Employee Appreciation day. The overall company AmerisourceBergen is a great company to work for but I WOULD NOT advise anyone to work in the Lash Department."
bad,When I first started I was filled with high hopes and thought this was a place I could stay and retire from. I think lash overall is a good place to work even though they put a blind eye on how we are treated because our drug makes them a lot of money. My program was an absolutely nightmare with no support and you were treated like you were an incompetent child that needed to be micromanaged in every thing that you do.
bad,Would not recommend this job to anyone. Racist management put in place . Little to no training because of job restraints on other employees. Extremely judgemental company.
bad,The culture and atmosphere is not professional.  Management turns a blind eye to the dress code violations.  There is no consistency and a lack of communication with the management team.  The training is almost learn what you can and from whomever you can.  The company policies and procedures are not consistent across the board.  Each manager had their own policies and procedures they choose to use when it suits them or depending on whether you are in their clique.
bad,"Management very low moral, don’t understand how to manage. More of the rule over instead of understanding. "
bad,"Seek a company that cares about their employees and patients, do not apply here, RUN! This company is not structured very well. The morale was awesome prior to 2019 and now management has changed for the worst. Never apply to a company that has upper management quit or leave abruptly saying that the company doesn’t support them. Please be cautious about applying here, you will not be valued."
bad,You're stuck there till the world is done so you never know when you are going home management has no idea what they are doing none the management has ever worked in this field before the whole management team is from the gap distribution center in Fishkill N.Y  so they run it just like that place was run the favoritism there for the former gap employees is not hidden and they promote butt kissing  there is no work life balance and they don't like it if you have an opinion so it's their way or the highway
bad,"They will fire you over your first mistake. Management would rather throw you under the bus and have you fired than admit to their own faults. They will fire you over something you were never trained on and accuse you of lying and claim that you were negligent when the lack of training was negligence on the part of management. There is absolutely no communication between management and the people that work under them. They may interact with one or two favorites, but rarely anyone else. Too many overpaid managers always claiming to be busy but they never actually do anything important. "
bad,"Was happy once. Very frustrated last. Micromanagement rules. Call volume at the call center is horrible, plus emails to be worked, follow up calls. Communication with the distribution centers is broken. Terrible communication! A lot of customer complaints. A lot of errors every day! Training is a mess, and when on the floor, totally different, you're totally lost. The benefits and pay are okay. The system used is archaic, for a billion dollar company! The company boasts to be patient oriented, not really, it is more profit oriented rather."
bad,"Dont work here"
bad,I would never recommend working in the Amarillo Tx location as a driver. The fleet manager has no business supervising employees. He is more concerned about himself than his staff. When this person tells you he owns you for 70 hours a week that tells you what kind of person you are working for. You will never receive a sincere thank you for the job you are doing.  He is always putting down his employees in front of other drivers and others within the company. You will get a call when you make a mistake or someone accuses you of something which happens a lot. It is a very hostile environment in the Amarillo office. You have been warned!
bad,"Bad management treating employee as slaves, very low salaries environment is not helping to grow and be promoted. Left it very soon to go to a better place."
bad,During the year and a half I was with the company I was moved to three different programs. As a FTE not knowing if you're going to be let go was extremely stressful. I've never seen any company like this! There is no job security and lack of training. They promote anyone to management positions that do not have the proper leadership skills. I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Hired in Sept. with LASH. To say that this organization is the worst in my 20+ year nursing career is a gross understatement. Huge group of us nurses in class. No 1:1 training. Everything was read off a power point in class, that no one could see. So-called nurse instructor rushed through everything, would become frustrated when class would ask questions or ask to slow down. Continually belittled us with statements like ""When WE were trained, we didn't have it so good"" etc etc. Training has been an absolute rushed through joke. Seasoned employees are aloof, read through training documents, then basically we are 'trained' and responsible. There is no flow or algorithms for our calls in relation to the policies. We have had to create our own 'scripts/call guides' to capture everything. Threatened by a manager that we would be reported if  we asked 'too many questions'. Literally, if you are a professional, RUN from this place."
bad,"Ok place to work if you have no life or family. Management has no clue...you can get away with taking numerous smoke breaks bc management doesn’t pay attention. You work at your own pace but be prepared to work crazy overtime. Good money but no life...draining..apply elsewhere! New employees make as much as experienced employees, definitely not fair."
bad,"This company was the worst company I have ever worked for. Managers micro-manage throughout the day and make sure you don't talk while on the clock. Work was overwhelming because they didn't like to hire individuals in order to keep costs down for the clients. Training was non-existent yet you will get written up for not performing correctly."
bad,"Loved and lived it for 10yrs! Until new management didn't like or want me there any more. How can I give a review?  They won!!!! Everyone needs a job, right?"
bad,Management preaches openness and focusing on associates but does nothing to execute on these stated goals. Little or no support from the upper management. The leadership does not practice what they preach.
bad,"Amerisource is not a place to work if you ever need to be hired on permanently they constantly hire a lot of individuals to work contract work.  In all honesty it is seasonal work because they tend to only keep employees until the open enrollment season is over and then they start doing large lay offs, generally with no warning."
bad,Three managers in 10 months (very disruptive to employees)
bad,"The company is ok but some of the manager are very racist .They don't care about anyone but themselves.....                "
bad,"I was a scanning clerk."
bad,Lack of management. Good luck working here. You will get used a lot and they will expect more and more. The raise is a joke. This company knows how to discourage workers to quit instead of firing them. I've seen it over the few years I been there.
bad,"Groups form to seek out people to bully and lie on... "
bad,"Everything was good except the management. Then once I got sick and had to go to the hospital I was fired. I provided a doctors note for every day that I was out and it wasn't like I had the flu or something minor. I had an infection that would have killed me if I didn't go to the hospital. I explained all of this to my supervisor and HR and they told me my job was safe but when I came back to work they fired me and then told me that I could come back in 6 months, I just needed to get better."
bad,"Worked there thru temp agency, was then hired full time - not long after that was harassed by another employee several times.  Went thru all the correct reporting procedures several times / was told was being investigated - and with no on-site human resources dept. after several months was told they were disciplining this employee but could give me no information or evidence that this was happening - I worked too hard for this co and was always there for long long hours, was always on-time and they did nothing to protect me or support me - after months of investigating my complaints - to get no support or real evidence that something was being done to protect me and my safety I left.  My safety and well being was not a concern for the managers at my facility and if they didn't care someone has to - and that someone WAS ME.  So I left, will never go back."
bad,"Worked a yr and was pretty much a call center not a help desk. Would take 40-50 calls per person but mostly worried about numbers not helping the customer. Product was never fixed during my time. Not a good environment , people I worked with were excellent under the circumstances. Received pay raise in November and then let go after 1st of yr.  Salary not great but was paid more on my hiring than a guy that had been there 1 1/2 longer and with my raise made more than him, so be careful on that."
bad,"The company took a very long time in hiring me. On a typical day, I was in the facility inspecting elements as well as conducting time studies. In the end, they said they wanted someone more experienced, and when they began downsizing, I was was cut."
bad,Job is very busy. 10-13 hours of case picking.The Management could be improved. a lot of good people I met at this company.
bad,"We were hired on as full time employees. So I agreed I could work Monday through Friday from 4pm until the job was done. I had no idea that would mean anywhere from 2am to 5am in the morning. The pay per hour was only $12 but they expect you to perform fast paced grueling work for very long hours, minimum breaks, and it ruins your feet, sleep, and health."
bad,This is a very nice place to work but as a contractor there are no clues as to what is to come.
bad,"This company is good at putting on a good show to lure you in.  However,  once you are there, you see what you have really gotten into. I worked with only one professional, fair and decent ADN and SNM!  All the rest of the ones in nursing management showed NO support for the nurses. All that mattered was the pharmaceutical companies,  who whined, complained and were "
bad,The company provides excellent training. Managers listens to gossip they don't call you for you to defend yourself they fire you without notice and dont give anyone the benefit of the doubt. They believe what they hear instead of being neutral and thinking for themselves. Preferably close to Friday so your weekend will be ruined.would be ruined. Team leads have favoritism.
bad,The 2nd shift managers are huge on favoritism. If they don't like you watch out because they will make up stories and lie to fire you . I worked here for 5 years trying to care for 2 children all while leaving home before 5pm and would be lucky to make it home by 4am. If you are 1 second late you get a tardy if they don't like you. Management makes it impossible for females to advance even if it means the female has 5+ years of experience they will hire a man who has less then a year over the female for higher open possession. Also the main manager whos responsible for both shifts allows the lower management to treat employees horrible and single people out. He also knows the management will leave a couple hours into shift but will allow that same manager to fire people if they are not joking 1 second late. They offer excellent benefits and paid time off but thats the only pros
bad,They laid me of and they never called me back for a full time job. And they left me with no place to go. But  a part time job.Which does help me for what I need to support my family
bad,"Management at Amerisourcebergen is unreliable, unorganized, and unethical. They only pro the ote those that look, act, and dress up to they're standards. They pick and choose who they want to excel instead of basing things upon your knowledge and work ethic. Management also uses employees to do their work and are rarely around when needed. You're expected to learn a great deal of information very quickly and make fewmistakes. They have several different teams in two buildings in Texas and other states. If in Texas be sure to only apply for US Bioservices positions. DO NOT ACCEPT A POSITION WITH LASH GROUP THEY HAVE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT AND UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR EMPLOYEES NEW AND OLD. However the pay is good, and the benefits are decent."
bad,"If you need money, i understand why youd work here. Managememt is bubbly and friendly but know nothing so when you ask a question you have to ask other coworkers. ABC could care less about your safety, 10ft of snow better be to work on time, and not complain about it. They mass hire people for welcome season, then fire everyone when its over, then post jobs in the paper for half the pay the very next day like ??? 3rd party verification, so you basically call insurance companies to get treated like a nuisance who they wont talk to. No one is on the same page, unless you go to the senior manager to get an answer...you didnt get one. The person responsible for quality doesnt know how to do her job gives bad scores that have to constantly contest because she doesnt know the current processes. This place will give you a full on migraine..."
bad,"This is not a company I would recommend to anyone. The company is lacking management skills badly. If you are one of their top workers they will come to you and ask you to work harder instead of asking those who just walk around and stare out into space to do some work. It just seems like they are scared to say anything to anyone who is of a different ethnicity, because they don't want to be labeled as a racist or that they are descrminating against certain individuals."
bad,"Decisions are not made in company's interest; decisions are made by what is best for your dept.  Lack of teamwork and everyone fighting for a bigger ""kingdom"".  After working long, long hrs, there is never a thank you or any recognition.  Attitude is why didn't you do more, faster.  High turnover!  Typical week is over 60 hours with criticism for not working more and constant ever-changing demands ."
bad,"Culture amongst non management was positive and cordial.  Some days, even enjoyable.  The management ruins the experience by doing too much or too little at once.  Once an overall direction is decided upon, it won't last long.  In my 5 months there, company objectives and projections changed each much for short term and long term direction.  No one cares if personal issues come up."
bad,"Personally, this job role isn't a good fit for my skill set. I would like to find a role more complementary to expertise. The people are nice but I don't think anyone truly understands what to do."
bad,"Out of my ten years of work experience I have never had the displeasure of working with mangers more than I have at this place. The mangers at this facility could care less about their employees. When I told my manger that my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer the news was met with indifference. All they cared about was productivity and nothing else so when I told them I might have to miss a couple of days to help take care of her it was met with opposition. That is why I decided to quit by putting in my letter of resignation. After putting my letter of resignation in the mangers started to avoid me and ignore me like I was in the wrong for wanting to take care of my mother.  I learned from a coworker that another associate went through the same situation I went through with losing a family member to cancer. That person was met with the same opposition I was met with. Don't work here, you can do a lot better."
bad,"Was written up after being sick at work. Showed up on time ,but was sick vomitting. Management sent me home, next day reported back to work, was called to office by supervisor who informed me, I was to signed document for not being able to cover my shift."
bad,"High turn over rate. This place is a joke. Save yourself the time and look elsewhere. You’ll be grateful you did. There were a few perks at times, but nothing to make you really want to stick around."
bad,"Favoritism & unfairness  Hard work means nothing, If they don't like you, no bonus, raise, recognition and you are terminated.  No way to treat people"
bad,"US Bioservices Divison of this organization has horrible leadership & management skills. They will only promote associates whom they  ""personally like"" and consider a friend OR someone that they feel  who would be a great benefit to help them do their own job functions to make them look successful. The department has had high turnover for  several years. Every complaint to HR about management always get swept under the rug eventually. Management is receiving higher salaries when others under management struggle with less pay to assist with daily functions without additional required manpower to make the workflow and everyone's job less stressful  Some Supervisors & Managers are not qualified for their jobs, they are just in these positions because of who they know or because they have been with the company for several years. The leadership team is dominated by females making it difficult for males to be accepted or advance. Race & Gender will/can and has played a major role when being considered for advancement opportunities within the US Bioservices organization. Things will be better change when specific associates within the management team is removed from the organization completely"
bad,This company uses staffing agencies to do their hiring. Management belittle the employees which are majority black. The staffing companies hires anybody and then Amerisource Bergen employees are blamed for their errors
bad,Colleagues were fantastic. The training was inadequate and sub par. Not enough information supplied to learn the insurance certification which made it difficult and no binders or information to follow. Only two trainers to 65 people and very hard to get concerns addressed. Only after second week they want to accredit everyone when there is supposed to be eight weeks of training.
bad,There are only two words that can possibly describe this place. This description is because of the management that is always trying to bleed blood from a turnip. You will be constantly implemented to take over tasks for others and other shifts. Believe me when I can say you can do better. The two words that best describe working here is...… Dumpster Fire
bad,Worked the night  Very unprofessional management team  if we have a question they call us out all my questions was answered by co-workers no management they was always busy browsing the web they don't know what are they doing they just sit down and watch youtube videos and facebook and  browsing the web I was a driver previous supervisor showed me my performance and tricks on how to do my job better current management is only good to writte me for anything another problem is the bonus programs they don't even know or explain how works
bad,Have been working in many warehouse but this one is the worst..very stressful work..they will push you to work fast and end up with 7hrs a day..The Management is good..but is not worth it to work there..the hands will numb and back pain is normal there..too much work less people to do job..Thank God I left.
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company. The hours were long and the training was extremely poor. Worst of all, you cannot park your car in the parking lot unless you are permanent and even so, some of the permanent employee had to take a bus to be transported to the work site. I felt like I was on a plantation. Because you could not park your car at your work site, you could not get out and ""breathe"" or get away for some time alone on your lunch hour. I will never work there again."
bad,"I was working as a Remote Associate and this was a great match for me. I enjoyed the work and communication with my patients. Lashgroup is the company that I was working for: an affiliate of AmerisourceBergen. "
bad,"The Bergen way of life is counter productive. Bergen was underwater in debt when Amerisource bailed them out. AmerisourceBergen was run great by the former CEO. But now the current leadership is going back to the structure that almost bankrupted Bergen. When the Walgreens contract is up, I would not be surprised if they buy AmerisourceBergen. My review would have been much different 6 years ago."
bad,"When I started with the company you were a name, and once we moved to the new facility you became a number. Amazing how the director of operations would walk the floor and talk to you in the old facility but once we built the new one was built she was no where to be found. Can't believe she still has a job with the company."
bad,"Company 2019: Made $1.7Billion in profits, received a $300Million+ Tax Break, and landed on Fortune 500 top 10 in 2019. "
bad,"NJ Site is the worst place to work. Coworkers & management are back stabbers and job is based on who you like, to many family members working here. Not a good Co."
bad,"The compensation is good and the benefits are top notch. However, they advertise as a 7am-3:30pm shift. This has never happened. It usually goes til 4:30 or 5:30. Then they regularly change the start times from 7am to 6am and recently they are even asking people to come in at 5am and makin the notions that we are going to be expected to work weekends. This job is not friendly for anyone who has a family because the upper management doesn’t care about your outside life. They expect you to work outside your availability. If you have no life and you just want to make money go get it. However, just do not walk in thinking you are getting what’s advertised. You WILL work long hours. You WILL work mandatory weekly overtime. You WILL work on weekends. They keep asking for more and more. I wouldn’t be surprised if it became a mandatory 7 days a week job"
bad,"Very punitive culture. Sr. Directors were very harsh and unfair with poor sense of business. No training, but standards were strict. It was very difficult to thrive."
bad,Programs are constantly changing and management is not great. no room for growth. favoritism from management. if you choose to switch your shift they penalize you by not being able to apply for any other jobs within the company for a year.
bad,"I was only there for a short time. The management was very nice and helpful, however some of the staff on the team I was on was very competitive which made it hard for me. There were staff members that became very jealous because I was a fast learner and when I learned how to do something I was very good at it, and they did not like that."
bad,Micromanage people. Talk to them any kind of way. Not in a professional manner. Office space is small and closed in. Job is not bad. Hold time is crazy. Want you to meet a quota when there is barely any work.
bad,I was employed with AmerisourceBergen for over a year. The management does not encourage advancement. It was a very high stressful position and they do not give raises.
bad,Always keeping busy
bad,"This piece of you know what company called me in for 2 interviews for separate jobs/departments. They gave a good talk game during interview but never responded I had to email & call their 3rd party to check status of my app. Don't waste your time applying for the Greensboro, NC location"
bad,"This place is a complete mess. It’s unorganized, unprofessional and management didn’t even know how to perform my role. I was told on numerous occasions to “refer back to the SOP’s” and “reach out to my peers” when I had questions. Co workers would wear pajamas to work and talked to patients/payers/providers like they were friends. Training is a joke."
bad,"Pharmacists turn over is high , totally unorganized, poor management, insufficient training, so many people were leaving this place, overworked , do not have plan"
bad,Management had a lot of employees to handle. Over 200 people hired on at one time and almost 100 people in my training room alone. It made learning the material very challenging
bad,Didn't like that I had no home life and the pay for that was not acceptable in my opinion most days you go in at 9 and and don't get off until 9:30 or 10:30 at night so again no home life
bad,"The people you work with are very nice. People are hired for positions and find out that they are doing something else.  This is a multibillion dollar company and they have these resources.  I was put into a position I was not consulted about and given no choice, my work was tampered with by my direct supvr which is an ethical violation when they use tampered material against you. It is also a HIPAA violation."
bad,"They tell you to get nine records done in a shift, more or less one an hour. Very hard to do when you are on hold for like 45 min if not longer with the very first call for the first record of the day, or any record for that matter. To make all the calls you need to make for the records, and do it the CORRECT way, that means not just calling and asking if anything changed since the last verification, because something could be wrong, you need to take the time to actually speak with someone and put all the information you received into a template and then into the database. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS JOB TO ANYONE. They will get rid of you no matter how much you try to do your job correctly."
bad,"This was a great place just went in with a contract and not full-time,but I would love to work there. They give you access to many different types of extra  Curricular activities"
bad,The company  runs on old ideas and old systems. Which means they were always behind on work. Then would have to pay off to make up for lost revenue. Then would start the process all over again. Like a lot of companies do.
bad,The company was shut down. Therefore I never got the opportunity to actually compound anything. We were in constant training. They changed procedures everyday. The company is disorganized. The pharmacists are nice and help anyway they can. After almost a year they laid just about everyone off and rehired half of the employees. The severance package was great!
bad,"Management pits employees against each other for advancement and preferred job roles. Co-workers frequently tattle on each other in order to improve their standing with management. "
bad,i am not willing to leave a job and not have one to go too. being a independent courer for the company means that i'm contracted to deliver any means necessary!
bad,Mgmt and employees do no work well together. No team work amongst mgmt and the bosses are not open to new ideas. The employees have clicks and do not work together unless it’s with the people in their click.
bad,I really enjoy the current employees.   I really enjoy my hours 7:00 to 3:30pm.   I feel they need a training program- which is non existent at this time.
bad,"If you want to jump straight into $15 an hour this is the place to be. "
bad,poor management must work all holidays. Must work weekends. mandatory overtime and start time may change.Night difference is not enough for hours worked.
bad,The TRAINING for this BILLION dollar company is horrible!! They have and will if they keep their training like it is a revolving door. Management do not care if you get the applications to do your job. New hire and Tenure people have quit or is wanting to quit. Hopefully in the future this BILLION Dollar Company will have BILLION Dollar Training!!!
bad,If you are looking for a job where you can be micromanaged and have no flexibility over your own schedule then this company is for you. Inside sales at this job is a joke with unrealistic goals. Do not work there
bad,Very political and only a few employees are set for success. Won't recommend anyone to work there. The company is very big and resources are tight. They prefer people who work 80-100 hour weeks.
bad,I know there are good areas to work within the company but the customer care center is not it. Nor is the training team that supported them. The care center is a revolving door typical call center and the supes delight in catching their employees doing something wrong so they can fire them. This attitude is fostered by the upper management. This makes supporting them in any meaningful way impossible. You rarely get past onboarding which is a hot mess itself. Then there is the junior high school antics between the two training sites. And the management that supposedly has deep training experience knows nothing about current training trends.  Bottom line is this is NOT a learning environment. Unless you enjoy petty behaviors run away.
bad,"This is a warehouse job so numbers is a high priority for them, and from what it seems like, management cares more about the numbers than caring and having to train new employees to get them and their skills better/faster.  One moment they can tell you that you're doing fine and then the next, you could get written up or let go without any warning or indication that you were failing. During the week, overtime is always mandatory and that could go up to 10 hours or more a day. A beneficial thing is that you get a bit of a raise for working night time hours. Co-workers there are always positive and fun to talk to so they make the job easier and less stressful. Some of the management promise to give you all the training that you need but, in reality, they could show you barely once, with a certain thing or two, and tell you to learn an entire section comprised of multiple things on your own. Some of them are even friendly to you one day and then the next, have an attitude and be short with you. This wasn’t a one time thing either. New hires and new techs should be careful of this because management will not always be there to train and can tell you one thing but do another, so be mindful of this. If you feel that you're not getting the training or the time to train that you need, make sure to tell them before you get a random disciplinary action or worse."
bad,"I worked for lash group during the 2017 recharge and it was a terrible experience. The leadership was very impersonable and unfriendly. Other employees where unwelcoming to the recharge personnel. They treat the seasonal help like we were in the way and referred to us a ""the temps"". If you're just looking to get some experience to move on to something else then yes this is a good choice. As far as making a career out of it, absolutely not."
bad,"In my first 3 months, I drove 14,775 miles just getting to work.  THEN, I went to work.  At the time, the company falsely claimed I was a salaried individual.  This was a flagrant violation of the FLSA."
bad,"Company was once a really great company to work for. The bigger they have grown the worst they have become. If your not kissing some untrained ma angers butt. You, could have worked for them 10 yrs and gone the next day. Promoting is done a lot on personal level. Who you know."
bad,"Not too bad of a place to work, the main issue is just management is lost and has no idea or direction and don't know whats going on."
bad,"A total lack of organization, all the staff as there way to work, no structure. Old computer system, the training is given by Employers leaving the company. "
bad,"I worked as Administrative Assistant at ABCC. The job description was misleading, the overwork without any appreciation. "
bad,was unfairly treated as majority of contract workers got 4 weeks more training on systems than the backups hired. Yet still expected to meet quota after 1 day on desk. Very few older workers here. Has some perks like free coffee and occasional meal. HIPPA violations galore. Transportation issues as they make you take shuttle that may or not be there when you need. Training is lacking on certain systems.
bad,The culture was very stressful. The Lead Teams openly shows a lot of favoritism regarding the associates that work for them. This type of behavior make the work environment very uncomfortably.
bad,"Admins and analyst are over worked with miminual job guarantee, management is very sneaky, little time off and stressful managing with other employees, also not a diverse atmosphere you see favoritism not based on who's the best but who kisses butt!!"
bad,"For the amount of work that is required of you the pay doesn't equal out to the amount of work your putting in. If you complain about it, It will be taken out on you in extra work. Management sucks. They really don't care about there workers. High turnover, No family life. Don't expect them to back you up on anything. Your always wrong."
bad,"Management is above rules and act however they see fit. Rules are bent to serve those in higher positions, and associates have to deal with the consequences of lousy management and inability to advance and learn while favorites are chosen to move forward."
bad,was shown basics of job for about 30 minutes then sent out on my own there was no hands on training if you cant figure things out by yourself or teach yourself how to do the job this is not for you they walk around with a laptop once a week to review you but rarely talk to you or ask how things are going they do not work personal with employees very well at all if you miss time at all during probation you will be terminated was let go because of this even though I was doing my job well up to and beyond their standards
bad,The culture isn't great. Very laid back but that's not a good thing after a while. Not much accountability. It's hard to get things done and take care of the patient.
bad,"At one point this was a great place to work, with opportunities and advancement.  The recent changes to IT have created a terrible culture with new senior leadership that only trusts colleagues she brought over from previous company.  Your only chance to survive is to be located in Frisco office."
bad,Working in receiving then receive the fridge items in. Mangement kept me busy. The workers were moved around a lot. Tried of watching the bums get away without working.
bad,"if you like raises below thirty cents, then this is the place for you! All management cares about is quota."
bad,"This job is very fast paced. We are filling prescriptions from the moment we arrive, till the minute we leave. I love it, because of how busy it is. I believe there should be a huge improvement in the management. It is very unorganized in my opinion. Co-workers are friendly and courteous. The hardest part of the day is ""crunch time"" when we are hurrying to get the last bit filled. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I am washing my hands to clock out and go home."
bad,could be a great company to work for if they got there stuff together.
bad,"Plainly, gours are LONG.  They say average 10 a night but its usually 12, or even longer.  Very hectic pace; too many people in the way and not everyone pulls their weight.  Can't comment on 4 benefits because I never received mine!  They lost the info!  That was the last steaw for me"
bad,Probably would be better if communication was better and managers was experienced and professional.A better strategy as well .Corporate should follow up with complaints instead of closing them out and allowing the managers to handle.
bad,"The managers/HR are horrible, they hold you back from job promotions. No one looks out for your best interest. The pay is below average. Lazy people get away with everything."
bad,No work life balance.  They will work 10 to 12 hours daily and will occasionally work Saturday over time. The management is very poor and disconnected from the team members.
bad,"No concern for work/personal life balance. Calls for overtime in the middle of the shift almost nightly. When interviewed was told it was occasional OT. We have it almost every day. Under no circumstances are you allowed to talk to a co-worker on the floor. Unrealistic time management goals. Positions open up but are ""filled""  before the job is posted on the company site even though employees are told to apply. ""Boys club"". employee morale is the worst I've ever see."
bad,Overall this would be a great place to work if they better trained their management staff. They need to hire more qualified managers. Corporate needs to be more involved in what’s taking place in each location. Specifically when it comes to inclucivity.
bad,My experience here has allowed me to grow as a professional and individual. However the management team that I'm currently under is the absolute worst working environment that I've ever been in and I've been in the healthcare field for over 20 years.  For this company too have any kind of future and compete in healthcare they will have to hire people who are motivated who are happy with themselves who can encourage others. The work itself is totally doable with the right motivation in the right training however when you have management in place who have no idea what they're doing and it shows clearly in their work how they speak to you how they treat you and how they walk around with the same look on their face every day that they don't want to be there that brings the morale down so until this company faces the truth it will never lead.
bad,"Ok company thought I would get a lot more of it, but it a company that changes and changes and changes and any little thing or mishap you can find your self unemployment."
bad,Never felt appreciated and they were very strict to the minute as far as time management and you were never allowed to take vacation time around holidays.
bad,"Never enough time ask questions about procedures, Consent changes, frequent changes in management, favoritism toward who "
bad,"The company is so far behind in there technologies,  does not take advantage of outside applications. Information obtained is resubmitted multiple times over 3 to 4 platforms.  stuck in the 70's"
bad,"Being understaffed by 50% the days are long and grinding.  Ops Manager & Supervisors seem to lack insight or interest in getting staffing to working level.  They usually make a joke of the long hours and the ""chance we might get to work weekends to catch-up""."
bad,"Job security is not good here, full time employees always getting laid off unexpected, then around busy season they will start hiring a bunch of contract employees around November. The environment is not that professional either, they will hire anyone especially those that has no office etiquette.  From what I have seen is that the environment is not as professional. If you are desperately looking for work consider, but I wouldn't retire here at all."
bad,"A typical day involved working harder than smarter to appease the array of competing agendas.  The culture was in a word ""immature"" from top to bottom. A very difficult organization to fit in if you are an experienced leader who did not grow up in the company."
bad,i learned the basic needs of patients who are dealing with mental ilness as well as working hand and hand with pharmacies to ensure they receive their medications
bad,"A typical day at work, is overwhelming at first, when you get there, its like you already cant wait to get home, the best part about the job, is learning how to pace yourself. We do a lot of fast pace walking all night, and you have to pace yourself to get good numbers and not feel so exhausted by the end of the night. I also learned how to help others, not only myself. Once you start working, all you think about is the product and what needs to get in the tote, where it is, and how much you need. Work consist of just working, the night moves along is your mind is free and not thinking about working, The management wasn't all that great, they did a lot of favoritism, and two face acts, they didn't treat us with that much respect, but some of the coworkers, were awesome to work with."
bad,"Good experienced in the good old days. Time changes market needs and companies must cope with changes. Unfortunately, Atco suffered from change."
bad,"A consulting company that reaches out to physician's office's and offers to look into their patient's benefits to see if their pharmacy coverage will pay for their company's drugs."
bad,i didnt like the job to much but at end of the day i got a check. the best part of this job is i see the football games for free
bad,Typical work day required a multifaceted response to a variety of challenges.
bad,"great benefits are provided. However, environment lacks team cohesiveness. Management tends to be clicky with certain individuals. Morale is very low their and advancement is unlikely to happen."
bad,"Great company to work for if management was better. I enjoyed working with different patients and providers. However, if management focuses on employees and respected their needs and hard work instead of favoritism I would recommend this company to others and probably still be apart of company."
bad,"Training was very unorganized and confusing. Management would change information from one day to the next but hold you responsible for knowing what changed BEFORE you were provided with the new material. Way too much to learn with unrealistic expectations for the low pay you receive. No room for even one error or it will be counted against you. QA very strict...pass/fail, no in between. Putting an extra space or dash would count as a fail.  Extreme micromanagement.  Very nice coworkers and managers were nice, but some managers often reminded employees of their  expendability which seemed to be used as leverage to intimidate employees which lowered overall morale. Stressful environment."
bad,I was laid off because I could not relocate to Texas to perform a job that my manager wanted me to take. I was an intimidation to him and my experience was more up to part with the customers and the Corporate team.
bad,"I have worked in warehouses with non of the tech. And had half the problems. When i first started i work in recieving. The training i recieved was ""go to this program in the RF unit and you'll figure it out"" . Heck the recieving lead was never around. If you did manage to find a lead from my experience you were not going to get much help. But if they needed something you were expected be able to do it and know the S.O.P. with out the proper training. They have alot of good ideas but very poor execution."
bad,"In my case, I had a bad experience and it stemmed from who I worked for, not the company overall.  For that reason, I will say that this is a good company to work for."
bad,it's great company to work for I worked here back in 2006-2008 but went to use my knowledge I had developed in the medical field a great place to grow
bad,"Although Lash Group offers good benefits to it's employees, there is no job security. The workplace culture is very diverse. Be expected to work extra hours."
bad,"Management is not professional at all , needs more days off and better pay . To much overtime , they  feed you pizza and tacos , like every Friday , that is because your being paid so poorly ."
bad,Discrimination and harassment towards women is common in IT and reporting will get you laid off. Positions are not filled when vacated so other team members must pick up the slack which impacts work/life balance. Culture is not consistent across all teams/divisions.
bad,"I was at ABC for 5 years. Within 2 weeks there were signs of instability as 4 or 5 people were laid off. The remaining staff was very confused on why some of these folks were let go. Each annual raise was about 2% with the top performers getting maybe a 2.2% raise. There was maybe a .2% difference between the top performer and the bottom performer. No incentive to go the extra mile. My boss deflected any team conflict and enabled the people creating issues for the team. Communication by email was the norm so you could CYA - very sad. HR refused to get involved with team issues - what's the point of having them, right? Some of the work and tools were awesome. Good luck finding a good manager there since many would take on some of the bad behaviors as done by management. A great place to capture some content for MBA case studies."
bad,"The management plays favorites and you must become a puppet to be recognized in anyway. There is no value placed on actual work, just who you become beholden to.  If you played games you could be seen a favorable.  Management constantly looked for reasons to give warnings and write ups for no reason."
bad,You have to be careful what team you get on. Company have so many rules that management don't even know they make it up as they go . And have you feeling unsecured about your job. Management have no compassion for other team members only if they are close to you. The pay is good but the stress will kill you.
bad,If you like drama this is the place you should go. This probably a great company.. I just don't see it . Too many office politics and unclear policies
bad,"It was a nice place to work when I started but too many changes have been made, management is a joke and very unorganized. Very poor/lack of proper training when you take on other segments."
bad,"This is very repetitive positions you will be in the office with no breaks other than your 1 hour lunch break at noon doing the same thing over and over again. In my opinion in order for you to be successful you have to be very confident, self motivated and strong minded knowing that each and everyday you are doing your best and producing great quality work. As long as you have that type of mindset you will do fine, Good* luck *"
bad,Beautiful work environment.  Brand new facility.  No additional information is available at this time.  Nice state of the art facility.  Still transitioning from Charlotte to Ft. Mill area.  Construction is still underway.
bad,everyone is friendly. that is about it. this place does not offer benefits for part timer which is what everyone starts  off as and takes a really long time up to a year to get full time.
bad,"I was heavily recruited for over 6 months before I came on board. From what I read and heard the place sounded awesome, and they had great comp and benefits, but that is so far from the truth. Once I started though, I realized that they pay higher because they work people to an early grave. Once on board I was shocked at how unorganized and thrown together the entire enterprise was. It was very apparent that they grow way to fast without proper planning and vision. There is a huge gap between what the executives say versus what is in place. Hardly any funding for R&D, training, or additional headcount. Everyone is expected to work themselves as hard as possible all the time. I consistently worked almost 70 hrs a week and every weekend. In the middle of my short tenure, they had a reorg and I was told my role would switch from technical to mostly administrative. I was given no training or guidance, just a pile of unrealistic responsibilities and expectations."
bad,Did not receive any type of orientation. Training was done over the phone with a co-worker that was states away. Starting taking calls on programs with no training. I basically self taught myself.
bad,I have never .ever been treated so disrespectfully as I was at this job.I had an Indian lady boss who yelled in your face her lead also was the same way.Horrible place to work. Do not take any job there.It was a relief to have had my assignment end..
bad,"I appreciate the knowledge gained and the opportunity given. This is a growing company and I wish them the best. The insurance, healthcare and pharmaceutical side provides vast knowledge of the industry."
bad,"Management is the worst. Inexperienced people are often hired and placed in these positions without any idea of true leadership. Nor is the company willing to train a manager to be a better leader. It is a very autocratic atmosphere. The managers push to get maximum efficiency from the workers and do not offer any positive reinforcements when a job is well done. "
bad,"I have been in customer service for over 20 years, this organization is very disorganized."
bad,"This was a stable company, but the overall experience was negative. The hours were intrusive to work life balance, and were not based on performance but manager and supervisor choice."
bad,It can be a good place to work. it was not in my field. Under different circumstances I would have been there longer. The co-workers are great.
bad,"This Job has you practically running from the time you enter until time u leave. lots of overtime, must be in physical shape to keep up,pay is good decent but you will work for it. I wanted to quit after my first week lol poor management and operation"
bad,"I took this job because it was the first one I could find after being unemployed for a while. The schedule is good, 8am-4:30pm Mon-Friday. You only earn 10 days off per year, you get major holidays off like Christmas, thanksgiving, day after thanksgiving, new years, fourth of July, memorial day, and labor day. Other days you will be working because its a doctors office. The office is pretty old and a little behind on technology, pretty small, so close quarters to work. It's a big practice and job is easy to make decent money, only recommended or a 1 year time and you should live close by, it's in Greenbelt, MD."
bad,AmerisourceBergan doesn't care about its employees and routinely shows favoritism towards employees who clearly don't deserve it. Management does an adequate job when they are actually there and do offer help when you need it (provided you can actually find them). You had better be fast and accurate when it comes to picking orders or else they kick you to the curb. Medical and dental were good but vision and prescription are optional. Co-workers range from super helpful to indifferent to you even being there. All in all this company values the almighty dollar above all and has no problem canning you for the littlest thing.
bad,A deadline everyday for something. Never was able to keep up with the lack of departmental help. My boss was no help in hiring new folks.
bad,"Lots of buggy code, lots of turnover in developers, constant chaos of meeting deadlines only to have something break on go-live, constant meetings with remote resources who offer no value, ABC proper is likely a better company but the Project Amazon team is toxic. So many questionable management choices, impossible expectations, expensive overhead on consultants, improper Scrum execution, and difficulty reaching consensus on functionality (see: Scrum problems) meant a few making the bulk of decisions and horrible go-live dates. The Healthcare portion of the project was especially painful to observe. My decision to leave was the best ever. Bottom line: if you really want to work in pharma distribution, stick to the core company and avoid any special project teams."
bad,"Management, supervisory, and training is poor. No one is held accountable for their unprofessional behavior. Leadership is non existent. HR doesn’t make them self known to employee. It appears to be an extension of management."
bad,"If you're not part of the clique, be prepared to work your tail off. If you're part of the clique, just feel free to make your own schedule and lump all the work on others. "
bad,I did not work there very long.  I had hands on training for 2 weeks and during this time the trainer did the majority of the training thru Skype.  I became extremely frustrated as I cant learn in this matter so I went to my manager to express my concern.  She said she would handle the situation and talked to the trainer as she wants to see me succeed.  9 days later they released me from the job for poor job performance...LIKE WHAT??  Are you serious?  I was the one who was not being trained properly to do what was expected from me.  I was the one constantly asked questions  and NEVER the same question.  NO OPEN DOOR policy for this place.  Other than this issue seems like a nice place to work.
bad,"As others have said, good management has left the company recently.  Long hours demanded but with no compensation.  Expected to work on vacation and holidays.  Not the same company it was a few years ago, and not a lot promoting from within.  You will get good experience but  also be expected to work long hours without the pay to go with it.  Benefits are good, but there are better companies in the area to invest in.  I'd recommend to management that they focus on developing the employees they have and place better value on them."
bad,"Easy job but management makes the job very stressful, your doing too much for the pay working in other departments with lack of help in your own department"
bad,Pay is good and co-workers are awesome but that's about it. Management is awful. You pretty much live here and they expect way too much for production. Don't bother calling out because they'll use that against you and will not give you any type of raise.
bad,no review for the company due to lack of safety equipment. No breaks given at scheduled times and extended times without breaks. shortage of personnel that does not allow employees to be off when requested in advance.
bad,"Don't apply unless you have nowhere else to go. Some of the people are cool, but the supervisors and managers try to make you quit rather than fire you. "
bad,"I loved working for ABC. I had many fantastic customers. Unfortunately when management forced goals over customer service there became friction. There were many instances where you were told to ""do it or else"" even if there were questions of ethics or legality"
bad,Great place to work but very little family to work ratio. Plus the pay is so low. Management micro manage department. Makes work difficult to complete.
bad,Odd overnight shift hours. Open ended shift. Couldn't leave until job was done everyday. Managers are too uptight. Didn't ever feel comfortable. Felt like someone was always watching your back.
bad,you have to deal with irrate customers and know products as if you was a doctor but you cannot say you arte not a doctor cause it will affect your job
bad,"Poor management in certain departments, never ending shifts often leading to 12+ hours overnight shifts. Great benefits and plenty of PTO available, if lucky enough to get days you actually want. 12 hour overnight shifts, then ask to come in early the next day."
bad,Management changes and not a lot of communication.  Not understanding the direction of the company by hiring outside consulting company and pay big bucks to them while associates are receiving a 1% pay raise
bad,"Have to be able to adapt to always changing of the structure of organization. Great working amenities such as food vendors, indoor and outdoor working lounge."
bad,"Job pays well and has good benefits and a tuition reimbursement program. Don't like the management personally that's my only issue with it. The job is not very difficult at all but does require people to be aware of their surroundings so as not to make your own job harder or someone else's. Hardest part is working with other people because the communication level between associates is very minimal and some just don't see eye-to-eye. I have brought my concerns about things that go on there to management and while they might handle it initially sometimes, they don't continue to do so and just ignore your complaints at times. Being taller is helpful here and being short is difficult. On your feet all day walking on padded mats but will ware out shoes often."
bad,Used to have a completely different atmosphere... Management is far more concerned about the bottom line and making themselves look good even if it includes throwing you under the bus.
bad,A typical work day started with the record documents being behind while management pushed all employees to get them done old or new. Management is never on one accord and employees get many different answers depending on who you go to for help. Management says one thing but does another. The company brings you in to push quantity over quality but later unfairly punishes you for quality.
bad,"It is undeniable that there are people in place at this location that hate working for this reputable company. Amerisource-Bergen has a wonderful incentive program, making extra cash is as simple as working a little faster; job function is not difficult to learn either. Be wary at their Eden Prairie location. Though management knows, there are associates working for them that do not strive to meet goals and standards, in hopes of getting over-time. They will not appreciate your hard work, henceforth. Unless you're okay with working overtime (up to 65 hours a week), I would go to a different location."
bad,"Laid off after less than 1 year, no rationale as to why I was laid off other than a corporate downsizing.  This was probably the first time that I had met with my boss in over a month when I was given this news.  I was essentially a placeholder until the company could hire the person they had been pursuing from Walgreen's prior to my hire.  Good compensation, but lack of clear direction, process, and what's in scope / out of scope for projects.  Lack of assistance on projects, expected to be a generalist in the role.  Lack of formal training or assistance, most employees are in it for themselves or their BU budget/ goals.  The culture is completely centered on self/ BU objectives, and not team objectives / greater good objectives.  Not worth my time for a review.."
bad,"Okay, so when I first started at AHP, it was a wonderful place to work.  It was a lot to learn, and the work could be fairly complicated. I didn't mind though, because most of the staff, including upper management was supportive.  I quickly became one of the top operators on the production floor, and things were going as well as could be expected, when you consider the condition of the machinery that we had to produce off of.  Long story short, our VP retires, and a new one is brought in.  He brings along his 12 year old nephew to run the production floor, and if all falls apart.  These two guys are disrespectful and condescending to the staff, and it has sent production into a downward spiral.  They police EVERY aspect of your job, and they are constantly creating new processes for machinery that they don't understand.  The kid running the production floor has clearly confused having a degree with being smart, but these are two different things.  Running a business is a talent, and these guys don't have it.  When I left, production was half of what it was just several months prior.  Most of the talent has left, including some in management, which is a bad situation for anyone considering employment with this company at this time.  Untrained people have no choice but to train others.  The blind leads the blind, and if management is not impressed with your work, I've seen them let go of people after only a few weeks.  You have two guys trying to train four shifts.  Its ridiculous.  It's not like Burger King where you can train someone for a day, and then leave them alone at the"
bad,"A once small company growing fast and unable to quickly adjust internally. Enjoyed my peers (wonderful team) but extremely overworked due to managers pressured to keep cost down. A challenging part of the job is keeping track of each business unit's individual computer systems, but you can expand your systems skills. Company recognizes employees once a year - approx 8 out of thousands.  I enjoyed the employees but not so great managers so do not voice your concerns to management. Good organization for college graduates first job."
bad,"Work consisted of (in my position) entering faxes from physician offices, and daily problem solving based on the needs of the office. The work was monotonous, but fulfilling enough. Management was ok, depending on who you talked to, but politics play a large part, and ""Enforcers"" in management are more about the bottom number than individuals, and do not mind stepping on the little guys to claw their way to the top. Co-workers were generally nice and agreeable, but enforcer management in the office pretty much killed any sense of team building by limiting communication almost strictly to work and email."
bad,It was to long ago.  It was not a good place for me.  The people were not friendly and training was not adequate.  No one wanted to help you.
bad,"MANAGEMENT TAKES CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES...."
bad,A typical work day is very laid back. Very friendly work environment.
bad,Not very supportive of work/life/balance. Advancement opportunities are limited.
bad,Didnt know what was going on with their own staff at anytime.
bad,"Dupixent is a nightmare. The upper management is very unprofessional, especially  the DON. If you like to be confused and micromanage than this is the job for you."
bad,The company has incredible benefits and decent pay. Recently this has been a company with high rollover relying on temps to fill the open positions. The has caused high levels of stress that no longer make the pay and benefits justifiable.
bad,The company always asked for hard work but pay did not match. They want you to work overtime and meet daily goals. Everyone is constantly being written up for not meeting production. It's next to impossible to max out on bonus every month.
bad,"The managers dont do a good job, they're always understaffed, you have to work holidays and have to come in if there's a blizzard. Sometimes after a holiday you can work up to more than 12 hours. I would not recommend this job unless you're absolutely desperate for money because you can say goodbye to your social life and your sleeping schedule, sometimes I wouldn't come home until 4 a.m. in the summertime. Also something always seems to break and you have to spend more time there."
bad,The job was not what I expected.  The training was very brief and did not address all aspects of the position.  Co-workers looked intimidated by management.  The work atmosphere was very cold.  The hardest part of the job was coming from a LOW tech organization to an organization that monitored your every move.
bad,Within my 1 year experience iv noticed that the customer was more important than the employee. I think they should be equal. Without employees there would be no customers.
bad,"The company has good benefits, but the pay is too low. Enjoyed time with my coworkers. Company changes management too much."
bad,"EAT WELL, EXERCISE, AND ALWAYS BE MENTALLY PREPARED because this job is physically demanding. It is important  to get enough rest ti pull long hours, and walk a lot."
bad,"Hiring managers has always been a weak area for the Frisco group. People rush in for jobs and then rush out. Human Resources was very weak area when I worked there. They need good nursing leadership and occasionally they get it."
bad,at work barely any talking goes on unless its during break but you learn tons of warehouse things that goes on at other warehouse management a bit harsh and set in there ways and the job start to finish every now and then they work 18hrs a day usually 12-14hrs a day on a good day you may work 9-10hrs a day
bad,"The happiest employees at this company are the ones who do the following:"
bad,"The company benefits and culture is okay, however the management throughout the company needs working on. High turnover rate. limited training, no room for growth as they pick only people they like to promote them it does not matter your skill set or not. Very bias company."
bad,Management lacked communication and vision to correctly secure advancement of the program that I ran from Porter Hospital.  Corporation is based in Pennsylvania and upper management rarely visited to see how the program was being run.  We truly felt unsupported and isolated here in Denver.
bad,"Management likes to promote ""TEAM"", but they truly show the total opposite."
bad,very unprofessional in dealing with customers and employees
bad,Not worth giving up your entire life for. Not unusal to be required to work manditory overtime at a momments notice of any where between 6-7 days a week. You always are made to feel that your job is in jeporady at any given momment
bad,"Extremely stressful, no room for advancement, poor management style.  Culture of unfair, micromanagement, offered no bonuses or incentive for quality work.  Co-workers encouraged to sabotage other's work instead of lifting other up."
bad,I enjoy working there because it’s very laid back easygoing everyone got along and work well with others. Everyone was very nice and friendly always helping one anothe.
bad,"AmerisourceBergen as a company is great to work for. The ones who are in charge of hiring are not aware of the managers they choose to employ. "
bad,"Working for Amerisource was fun in the beginning, but management has been making a lot of changes against the established SOPs and writing people up for not doing things specifically their way. They are pushing unrealistic goals of on standard time whether or not you're still working when doing off standard tasks."
bad,"Training went over one thing and job was pushing numbers, the management only looks after themselves and wouldn't know how to do the work if their life depended on it, so asking questions is a no go. This is my review for lash group, the work from contract to contract nothing is stable, they hire to fire and do it all over again. If you are looking for experience ok go for it, but if you plan to retire good luck."
bad,"Its a job to get you by but not worth the abuse your body takes for the job. Management lacks communication. Management has no idea what sigma six really means. To many people get promoted without advance degree,"
bad,"The work itself is not bad. The hours are reasonable.  The management is the problem. They play heavily on the pet system.  Experienced workers do not get formal training after initial month. Promotions are predetermined before posted and rarely based on best qualified."
bad,"This business paid us very well. The training we received was very useful. I believe I can use what I learned for future positions. The things I could not cope with were the way things operated. There was a dress code in place that many people chose to blatantly ignore and there was no disciplinary action in place. It seemed like no matter how many times a person showed up late or left early throughout the work week, that too was okay. There were noticeable conflicts throughout the building and nothing was really done about the issues. People were made to sit in front of each other and attempt to talk things out, but all in all, it made things much worse."
bad,"My sole feelings about this job is based on the fact that 15 days after I was hired, the DEA came and locked the building down due to noncompliance with DEA standards on November 30, 2017 and it’s now August 7, 2018 and we’re still not working."
bad,Functioned as a Computer operator on IBM 2086 mainframe. 
bad,Management is horrible. Turn over rate is ridiculously high.  Only benefit is the experience you can add to your resume. Management do not care about their employees.
bad,"Lack of support from management when it mattered.  Would be given ""verbal"" reassurance things were being done but lack of follow through in a timely manner.  Associates provided feedback and suggestions for improvement but management did not act upon suggestions.  Managers did not have experience in working the programs and therefore, could not fully comprehend issues that the associates were encountering in daily activities."
bad,"The management at this company is not great. I worked there for about 3 years and they have changed HR and its not the best place to be anymore. they are in fort mill, sc."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid."
bad,"It is ok. Job security may be better than most. Many co-workers are kind, friendly people."
bad,"come in and start working returns . if they need us in another part of the building we go help them, stocking, receiving and put away. the hardest part of the job is trying not to make any mistakes and do over 135 percent , we are on a percenage base for our incentive pay."
bad,"very stressful and fast paced. You never know when you start your shift or finish each day is different. You can work 10 hour shifts all week or barely work 7 hours, there is no in between. cross training is a must so since this warehouse is based on incentive each department is different and it can either bring up or bring down your incentive pay."
bad,I worked at the AmerisourceBergen dc in Orlando for 6 months before quitting for another job no job is easy but this type of work was really tough overall not really a good place to work. Very long hours with backbreaking work sometimes 15 hour nights I still have foot pains to this day because of this job and I left 4 months ago the benifits and pay was the only thing that kept me pushing...starting pay was around 13.50 with limited raises.. At the end of the work period you'd be averaging around 108 hours.. They have by far one of the best benifits pto programs I've seen so I guess that's a plus and you get Friday and Saturdays off
bad,"ABC is a ok place to work for, you can get pass shady managers and being understaffed. I liked the pto request because it was pretty fair with time approval."
bad,would recommend anyone to work there. good pay even through temp aganecies they are still a good job to work at. very clean. very professional and respectful company.
bad,"Amerisourcebergen was a hard job to do. Very fast paced on production,but the customer comes first. My co-workers were great to work with,always there to help if you fall behind as I did as well. We always had a fun activity for once a month. Like Halloween,we dress up.Management is great and they understood how hard we had to work to get it done."
good,"It was a job, nothing special, poor training, you learn by teaching yourself basically, the shadow effect they use needs help, my experience was not the best, most enjoyed part of my stay here was that it was a 15 minute drive from home. As for the job , it the same as any where that you order and set up medication delivery, verify insurance, run test claims ,set up delivery."
good,"I've learned a great deal from my experience with the company. However the ability to showcase my talents and be recognized for them is virtually impossible unless you are good friends with the ""powers to be"" . I have on several occasions had to explain my background AND experience to my mgr (who interviewed me for the job) and team lead just to show my capabilities that always go unnoticed. I really like the company but the good old boys network is unbearable. :("
good,If you get a job there try not to get sick and have to be taken out of work if so they're going to get rid of you.be on time from breaks and don't call out if you can help it
good,"The facility in Buford is under horrible leadership.  They only care about themselves and will stab each other in the back.  It's also the good ole boys club.  If you're not a white male, you may as well forget it.  "
good,"no comments under the ground that this position is at-will employment, and I do not wish to incriminate myself. A regular day consists however of coming in and working on tasks that are swiftly changing and in high demand."
good,Processing orders for pharmacies.  Very fast-paced and more work than hours to do the job.  Management changes all the time no consistency.  They are focused on making money and do not have any work life balance.  Making sure that all orders ship correctly and having to track missing shipments.  You work at your own speed without someone looking over your shoulder all the time.
good,"They will let you go without any notice, there is no benefits, PTO, or job security.... good luck. The process changes weekly so when you are trained, it is actually different than the work you are doing which was quite frustrating."
good,"Not a good place if you're working for Corporate. Try working for one of the smaller companies. No Work/Life balance, job security and corporate leadership shows signs of favoritism (with friends) and borderline corruption."
good,I thoroughly  enjoyed the teams that I worked with. Amerisource has  incredible employees and they are working hard to become the # 1 Health Systems Services and Drug Distributor in the US
good,"Typical work day is to pull from a que, make calls to insurance companies and constantly emailed about productivity. This position also comes with constant QA emails from quality reps who will fail your quality for small mistakes. Make sure you're learning everything that's needed to be successful."
good,"Stagnant place of work, management is self righteous and old school mentality. There is no coaching and mentoring just entitlement. It's not what you know but who you know."
good,Job was pretty good and benefits were good in the beginning. Although management was not good they messed with insensitive numbers causing employees to lose money and did not give raises if they didn’t like you. The benefits were also cut taking away one of the few good things about this job
good,"This company takes 10 steps back for every step forward. The management is clueless, openly lies to employees and generally does not have a high opinion of staff. There is absolutey no where to go with this company., a totally dead end job."
good,"The only good thing about this place is the pay. Their demands for productivity are a little bit too much. I was given my first warning within my 90 days ""probation"". The equipment is very old and some trucks are slower than others which makes harder for you to make the productivity standards. Management was poor,  even supervisor calls off every Sunday you barely see him. If you have no life and you don't care how they treat you as long as you get a decent pay this is the right place for you."
good,"I believe Amerisource Bergen is a good company to get your ""feet wet"" in the Healthcare field. There are multiple medications that you have your choice to work with."
good,"This review is for the consulting side of Amerisourcebergen also know as LashGroup. If you are looking for job security this is the place. They also great benefits like health, 401 K."
good,Was able to use my current skills / knowledge to train current personnell. Employees were not well managed. Management skills were low. Enjoyed the time spent with a select few employees.
good,Policies would change all the time without notice to benefit those who changed them. I would not recommend working here because the culture and moral here is almost non-existent.
good,I enjoy my co-workers; their the ones that make the job worth wide.  There could be a better New Employee Training program setup being they're a Billion Dollar Corporation.  The system is not a system that supports Reimbursement functions.  They should invest in a better corporate system.
good,"If you can get in good with management, or be a consistent top BVS, you might have a chance to keep your job. Training should be remodeled. There were many days we had nothing to do."
good,"The compnay has Good benefits. The health benfits are good. The vision benefits are good. The dental benfits are good. The FSA is terrible. If you live in Frisco, Mckinney or Prosper, this is a good place to work. The proximity to the office is great so you can enjoy a short drive to work."
good,"This company is fast paced. no time to do anything other than clock in get a unit go to work. they have a lobar management plan. Just the smallest pause will stop you form making the 95%, required daily."
good,"Amerisourcebergen is located in Valley forge. They have multiple business vertical with a focus on healthcare delivery. They are also located in California, Dallas , Ohio, etc..."
good,its a quick job to have as an in-between. I would not advise anyone to make a career out of the opportunity. I would advise one to use the experience for other similar opportunities.
good,"Amerisource Bergen have pretty good benefits however depending on what team you are on, Management can be very unprofessional and unfair. I feel they want you to meet unobtainable numbers which have caused many associates to work through lunch, come in early or even leave late just to try to meet their necessary target unobtainable goal."
good,"only problem i had with this job was my manager. Really high expectations of everyone but failed to hold up his end and never received any discipline for his inactions even when it was reported to hr they would do nothing, even when proof was brought to their attention in the form of email and pictures."
good,"I had heard such great things about the company so I was super excited to finally get in. My excitement quickly fell away. "
good,"Some overtime is nice for any paycheck, but if you desire a life outside of work than this is not for you.  The long hours were ridiculous.  The pay is nice so long as you work nights.  There was  a lot of drama among the employees.  Managers played favorites with departments."
good,putting orders on the line and picking the producted. putting items in the tote and sending to shipping to get shipped out for our custmers.
good,"The work was very easy and the benefits/pay were excellent, but almost the entire leadership staff couldn't proficiently perform their jobs, so the associates suffered."
good,"the company is ok, management and communication aren't good. To much finger pointing and not enough solutions. A lot of changes but that keeps you on you toes!"
good,Helpful management. Fair work environment. This was a temporary position for me so wasn't able to determine the quality of benefits or vacation time..
good,Ok company that needs more structure in management positions. Diversity needs to be improved in the leadership to reflect our country. The company needs to improve training programs that help employees succeed and have focused structure.
good,"When I started I was through the roof proud to be working for such a prestige company as such. I had always heard GREAT reviews & I found PROUD to be an employee. However, after working for about 3 years and learning the culture my outlook changed. "
good,This job is work to you are finished. We start early some days but always finish late. Sometimes 1 to 4 hours later than scheduled. You do not get a heads up.
good,"Did not tell me when the contract was getting over. They just told an hour before that today would be your last day. That was the worse part of AmeriSource Bergen, other than that it was good."
good,Supervisors treated you as if you were in school by mirco managing you.  They had no compassion for single parents.  The work we did was not compensated properly.  There are other companies in the area are paying at least 5 to 10 dollars more an hour.
good,Fast paced jobs requiring more work than time allows. Management lacks understanding of what is required to complete job tasks as most management has never had to complete the job tasks. Consider the nature of the environment very tempermental and would not rely on job security. 
good,This can be a cool company to work for when staffed up!! I've been working there a full year under staffed and constantly threaten of escalated write ups and termination if you call off. I just don't like a company that treats you like you're expendable.
good,"-Low morale"
good,"The night shift (5pm to 1:30am) is definitely not for everyone. You need to be a special kind of person with little to no personal life in order to make it work long term. Really messes with your sleep schedule and circadian rhythm. Managers at Valencia DC were all pretty good, did their best to balance needs of company with being an actual human being who tries to connect with you."
good,management not that good..everyone is for themselves.. enjoyable part management doesnt hassle you...leave when its time to go.. and flexibility of work schedule
good,"Culture if very different, not your typical work experience. Can be a great place to work, if you are motiviated and an open learner"
good,"I loved my job, but the work/ home balance was a nightmare. You never knew what time you would be getting off work. Overtime everyday and the pay was NOT worth the amount of labor I was doing. The benefits were decent all but the fact that you have no emergency time to take off. All off time had to be approved 24 hours in advance. So no calling in sick without being docked points. The management team did not communicate with the employees about anything and did not care about any emergencies in your home life and gave NO respect to the employees or the amount of sacrifice the employees gave to get the job done."
good,You never knew when you were going to lose your job which is exactly what happened to me. What I currently do is part of this job as well.
good,"i enjoy the work because it keep me busy all night fast past and a lot to do and learn .didnt know what u were doing until u clock in and get your work place i learn how to driver a cherry picker ,to restock shelf i learn security work under carmera ,orderfiller picking and shipping recieveing etc. i enjoy fast pace work"
good,The hours are good and the money is great. No room for advancement and Management is horrible. They cater to employee's instead of giving everyone a fair shot.
good,Company IT is going through a total re-organization.  It is chaotic right now.  They have acquired many companies over the years and it was going to happen eventually.
good,"Solid overall, but as with any company there is a high turnover rate due to the nature of the work. Call center atmosphere in which processes, work flows and even job functions/titles can change without warning. Good opportunity overall, but not something you may want to do long term."
good,"The hardest part is finding a manager that isn't set in their ways and will actually embrace change. I only worked for a sister company of theirs, ICS, so I can't speak for AmerisourceBergen as a whole."
good,"Patients appreciate you more than your managers do."
good,"If you are okay with droning along doing the same repetitive motions day in and out this may be the perfect fit for you. If you like to be challenged mentally and physically you may want to look elsewhere. I worked here since this location opened and i have to say I am not satisfied with what with the decisions made by the management here. This facility rewards brown noising and fails to conceal favoritism. They have a production based incentive program, but if you overachieve they feel you are cheating the system and you will receive a verbal warning, no question asked. They management teams make you rules as you go, and you have no say or form of recourse in the matter. This job as no Union or even a proper Human Resource for that matter. If you have a issue with a Supervisor or God forbid your shift manager, you might as well quit because there is typically no one there to help sort that matter. Holidays pay (Time and a half) is non-existent. They use the scumbag gray area where they will give you a day off around the holiday then force you to come in on the holiday and work for Straight pay. Even worse a lot of the time you will be stuck working 10 to 12 hours that day because the work will be twice as much."
good,AmerisourceBergen PMO is an interesting company that faced mass layoffs in 2018. The current direction of the company is currently in question. Job security along with advancements are very questionable.
good,Meet and made good friends. Not all coworkers carried their weight. This was a call center environment with distribution functions. You also received email and fax request. You also had to answer questions on billing and connect customers to their sales representatives.
good,Some employees didn't work to their potential and the management wasn't able to request them to do so.  Other employees had to pick up the slack.  Mandatory overtime of 2-4 hours a day around holidays. Provided good health insurance.  Earned 2 weeks vacation in 3 months which was good but had trouble scheduling it.
good,Typical day at Amerisource Bergen/Lash Group; Inbound call Quota started at 18 verifications per day while taking Inbound calls throughout the day; fax benefits to healthcare provider and answer all questions the HCP or patient may have regarding coverage.
good,"The company was great to work for at first, but we were lied to for months until we found out we were all getting laid off. By the time of our last week everyone was pretty much done with the place. Left a very bad taste in my mouth. Bitter and foul."
good,"Company was understaffed and mismanaged and as a result, employees were overworked. Mandatory overtime exceeding an hour was not uncommon more than once a week."
good,"Great company to work for with great benifits but lacks  tremendously in leadership and support. Leaders do not contribute on asisting in helping  employees improve and better themselves within the company unless you are favored by them. No equality or consistency from one employee to the other which is viewed as favoritism. This company is all about numbers you will not be bothered or talked to if you hit your production numbers. You will not even be appreciated or thanked for hard work, but if you arent hitting them they jump on you instantly. Basically they show no appreciation but are very quick to discipline for anything.  We have had 2 management changes and 1 happening soon . The 2 new managers are very knowledgeable and already have made changes and addressed issues that been concerns for many years in which previous managers knew but never took action. So this company might start taking a turn in right direction. To sum it up. Great company with amazing benifits but you deal with alot of negativity due to they way its ran and unfairness. The work is stresssful but hard. Its repetitive work. What makes it hard is they way its managed by higher ups."
good,Great company. Great benefits. Overall it is a great company to work for. Just make sure you get involved with the right management. Some managers need to get fired ASAP.
good,"Heavy workload with little appreciation by managers. Great benefits program with steady pay raise. "
good,"As a manager of a large team, I was often frustrated by the HR requirement to counsel employees on petty matters such as time clock punching, rigid arrival times, and monitoring break times.  Time spent on such matters caused moral issues for the team.  The team had a huge responsibility to collect customer accounts so an uplifting environment was important to keep a positive attitude.    The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the workload resulting from fast paced payment terms.  Although the culture was challenging, the team developed a strong bond that has lasted beyond the end of the work assignment.  The work was interesting and challenging but the work environment was lacking."
good,"Great place to work. Needs a little work with management. Equal opportunity is not always given. There seems to be some favoritism. As long as your on a team where everyone is on the same page and the management really and truly want you to progress within the company then I believe its well worth it. "
good,"*coordinate training with nurses and home health angencies"
good,"Typically I am do everything that a lead rep does but I don't officially have the title because the call center is new to the company. I started in the same training class with my supervisor and mangers , we have the most seniority here. The hardest part of the job is that everybody is new and there are no set process and procedures which leads to a lot of inconsistencies which can frustrated and overwhelming."
good,Flexible company with programs and incentives designed for operations users.
good,Good place to work but there were too much arguments between the employer and employees because the company was unionized.
good,"In the position there was responsibility but no authority or support to complete tasks. There wasn't a good work life balance, position required too many hours to complete. There were some nice people to work with."
good,"Ok company. Not much room for development. Recommend looking outside of AR season which is temporary. Parking is terrible.        "
good,"Benefits were good, but no pay raises for any employees in 18 months.  Pay was poor.  Training was exceptional.  nice break room.  cube office, too much noise."
good,"Not a very good job culture. Continues Improvement not supported by Director of Operations. Unfortunately, no matter how hard you work you are not appreciated."
good,"8-5 day assisting users at their desks or walk ups to the cafe (help desk) counter.  Doing a lot of multitasking with projects, last minute requests, and trying to meet deadlines."
good,Senior Nurse managers are terrible that manage the remote nurse. They change process each week. Mangers are changed on staff with no notice. Staff are required to get licensing on their own time and even is licensing is pending the manager the staff can be terminated with no warning. Makes for stressful environment. Lunch timeframes and breaks were reduced in time. No stable work environment at all.
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my time at ABC, but towards the end, I had a feeling that I was on my way out. The situation was unfortunate. I hope the company finds a direction soon."
good,"Typical day at work busy work independently."
good,"I really liked the people that I worked with and my manager was good. BUT THE HOURS!! You could be ""scheduled"" for 12-14+ hours and not really know if you were going to work them or not till half way through the shift. Or they would come up and tell us during our shift that we were working overtime that night. It would be extremely difficult to be a working parent with this job."
good,It's not a bad place to work if you work anywhere but in aps. You need to have no life to work at this place. They work night shift so hard. Night shift would work almost 12 to 14 hour night while day shift 8 hours. Which is very unfair but they don't see amything wrong with it.
good,A typical day at work is mostly administrative and training.  I would also say it seems like an adult daycare.  The hardest part of the job is keeping newly trained associates motivated and prepared for the job
good,"Doing email in between answering calls.take 50 + calls per day plus send and manage email to the plant and or other vendors.  Call customers back, but you are not given time to do that."
good,this company was a staffed with nice people but it was only a temp job. it is good to have a temp job while you search for a full time job. this job was only for a few months which I knew and gave me time to search for other employment.
good,Great working environment; however due to working with a temp agency got let go without fulfilling my contract fully which left me unemployed for months at a time.
good,"I enjoyed the six years that I worked for AmerisourceBergen in their Bellco Generics division.  My direct supervisor had complete confidence in my ability to perform a good job and, therefore, I worked under little supervision. Our sales team was appreciative of the support I gave them and I got along well with everyone."
good,"Enjoying the job/company has a lot to do with the management your under and the department/company you work for. I may not be the best person to write about the company, at this time..."
good,"Hourly is decent for what you do as far as Insurance Verification."
good,"The job isn't bad and the benefits are amazing but management is all over the place and very shady. They often have unrealistic goals of perfection that they, themselves, don't meet. Also, it always bothered me that they don't have an actual training program. You can't be in healthcare and not have an established training program with established trainers. Honestly the job would be perfect if management was completely reformatted"
good,Overall work goal is great.  Pennsylvania location treated as secondary to others with limited mobility and lowered position scale.
good,"A typical day is very busy, we hold over no product what comes in must go out the same day. management is nice and mostly understanding, hardest part of the job is the hours and the best is the pay"
good,This is a good company. I have learned a great deal about pharmacies and the way medications are distributed to customers and patients.
good,"Was not a place that I would of stayed a long time"
good,"Fast paced environment, fully automated , unionized but managed to a high degree of productivity. People / co-workers /culture was the best part of the job."
good,"Good place to work, if you don't mind relocating"
good,a typical day at work what you learned the most enjoyable part of the job
good,high turn over. call center if you like being on phones great. if you never worked in a call center really think about.
good,"Out of 100% part timers, 90% of part timers are very slow in working and they don't want to come to work on busy days. Some employees including full timers & part timers keep on talking in there working hours and they are not consentrating on the production and quality of work. Management is ignoring all these things and they are not taking any action."
good,Stretching - meeting to start the day and then pick up RF units and move to your designated Department to fill orders .
good,The company helped me in grow as an auditor and gave me the ability to succeed in Compliance.
good,It is a good company but unfortunately there is little opportunity for advancement.  Some managers are very supportive but not enough support on the floor
good,They only take care of people who they know and allow employees to put you in a position to be in trouble just because they want you to be. They will punish you for hearsay and will fire you for absolutely nothing due to management teaming up with their employee friends. Don't talk to nobody about anything in this company because it will be used against you without a proper investigation.
good,Work very hard but the job is never good enough because of the low staffing issue.  There were very knowledgeable people there working yet being abused with The work load and it not being good enough.
good,"Good compensation and benefits, great office, challenging work. But if your over 40 and in a click, you will be laid off. Most humiliating experience ever - being let go the day before a dream vacation to get engaged and my “boss” knew that. You’re just a number and all the talk from senior management about family is opposite from how you kicked to curb one day."
good,"I verified medical benefits for all payers for cancer patients. Updated database with research results. Provided accurate information related to coverage, coding and payment. Interacted daily with third party customer service representatives."
good,"On the phones all day. Patients not always informed about our program prior to the intake call which can cause confusion and upset. I have no idea the purpose of management... they don't do the training, they don't know the job their team does, they aren't helpful or useful 'go to' people. I was blatantly finger pointed for a big error by another department trying to cover their mistake. Even though I had documented proof (recorded calls, emails, time and dates)  I didn't make the mistake AND who DID make the mistake  ....no one seemed to care.  The error wasn't rectified and my name had already been dragged through the mud - the reason I left.  High turn over rate."
good,Excellent place to work and grow skills.  Be careful of constant restructures which is how my position was eliminated after 18 years in the industry and excellent reviews.
good,Place is good wish there was opportunity for full time. Pay is low considering the work. The inventive pay does help out the part timers sometimes but not always. You have to work your schedule around this place even if your part time which sucks.
good,Good Company.  Difference of opinions which potential could affect growth.  Tenure and knowledge doesn't matter any longer. Perception is the key. No longer a relaxed company.
good,"The company is fine, the IT most senior leadship is very weak.  Reorgs are announced but decisons take months to be determined and implemented, cause good preople to leave."
good,"It is not perfect but overall, this is a good company to work for. The benefits are good. Job stability is ok and there have been some layoffs on and off. Digital transformation is shaking things and creating uncertainty."
good,"I loved my co-workers and customers.It was more so the management style in our department and the occurence policies.The job/home life was not balanced. There was no leniency even if you had paperwork on a chronic illness. I did enjoy the workplace culture of spreads, ice cream trucks, toy drives and giving back. I believe the room to grow from ICS was difficult to get away from. I was a top performer and wrote a training manual for a top client and there was no appreciation or acknowledgement. I was promised an advancement in the next promotion and went out for it and was declined again. It was time to look outside the company especially after all of the OT, meetings, covering for other people, training of new hires and new team leads. My work was not being appreciated, and I had done more than expected even by taking classes. i decided to leave for a company paying 20K more."
good,"Amerisource Bergen is a good place to work. There is room for growth and professional as well as personal growth. The last couple of years saw a decline in overall office culture as time and work demands increased. Emphasis on quantity over quality in terms of production negatively affected the company's reputation. The quality of training also suffered, causing an increase in the number of inadequately prepared associates being forced to work excessive hours under near constant threats of disciplinary actions and termination. Overall, however, if you are willing to work hard and steer clear of the office politics, I think you can do well at Amerisource."
good,Management not always forthcoming. When the decision was made to close an office one manager made sure she had a job none of her direct reports. Could have allowed employees to work from home and keep their jobs
good,The job here wasn't bad but it is very boring and repetitive. I feel like a robot and I prefer something that is a little more fast paced and more socialization
good,A typical day at work consists of working with manufacture to provide shipment of drugs to clients. Also working with clients to schedule and place order for the drugs.
good,"This a great company. This company is going through a lot of changes and makes quick rash decisions. Not all new processes are reviewed and rolled out with management making the associates confused and frustrated. Management has an open door policy but often times those doors are shut or can't be found. Communication at the management level is failing with only talk and no follow through to fix it. Management is often trying to throw the other shift or department under the bus. Company is spending way too much time and money on fancy signs then actually working through the problems at hand that directly effect the production. I love working for this company who puts patient needs first and is striving to do good in the community. This company shows it appreciation to the associates in many ways, true blue points, safety rewards, benefits, ect. But working at this division they will work you till you can't any more and won't communicate."
good,"The company is a good place to work for as far as entry level is concerned. A place to get started in your career or a place for you get experience to see if its what you want to do career wise. There are a lot of stressful moments, so if you don't handle stress well then its not a place for you. Its a very diverse environment and a chance to meet a lot of great people."
good,"I had a major issue with management, I felt like they could have been more involved and better training. for the most part co workers were more helpful. there was a lack of proper training."
good,Amerisource recently closes out a few facilities like San Franscio and Rockville. Management team hires a consultant firm to continue evaluating the overall organization.
good,If you love constant challenges this is the place to work. This company is constantly growing and will have to mature in leadership vision if it wants to compete with the industry.
good,This position should be posted as a 50 hour a week position. Mandatory overtime is required every week for at least 7-8 months out of the year. If you don't meet quota for the day for whatever reason...guess what...you're staying until you do or you'll be getting a write up.
good,"The company as a whole isn't bad.  The paid benefits are good but the pay rates are not.  The Associates that work there are good and get along with each other well.  However the management looks out for themselves 1st and the employees 2nd.  Working there, you earn your pay-check.  High turn-over and little room for advancement unless you kiss butts."
good,Its a great place to work. I would recommend the company to family and friends.  They care about the associates.  I love me job and the team that I work on
good,"I am not sure what to say. I felt I gave a lot to the company. Yet, in the end, it didn't matter to management. I know they were forced to do what they had to do, but left me puzzled."
good,"AmerisourceBergen will pay your bills for as long as you wish to work for them. The company is stable, so the length of your employment is based solely on your willingness to show up to work and perform the bare minimums of what is required. There is incentive pay on top of hourly pay which gives you the opportunity to make well above what you are supposed to make, but only if you can maintain an elevated pace. After a few years an elevated pace wears on your joints. If you aspire to move up through the ranks from the entry level warehouse positions, your best bet is to be a friendly employee and an average performer. If you are a top performing warehouse associate, at every opportunity for advancement you will be overlooked almost as if you're too valuable at the entry level task for management to allow you to do anything else. As I previously stated, if all you want is a job that pays a decent wage that rewards you for high performance it is not a bad place to work. On the other hand if you wish to be in a supervisory or higher position within a reasonable amount of time, your best bet is to gain some experience elsewhere and if a position becomes available to apply externally if that is where you want to be.."
good,"Great money"
good,Overall working at ABC was an acceptable environment.  Depending on who was in executive or management position created the culture for the environments.
good,Working at Amerisourcebergen was tough and challenging. There wasn't career advancement. It was a rough working environment. there wasn't  any kind of motivation for employees.
good,"Too many rules, I mean too many! Very unreasonable ( dumb)ones. They do NOT have experienced trainers that can train new people properly. Training is horrible. They do make part time workers work overtime which is not right at all.  This company treats part time worker unfairly."
good,It use to be a wonderful place to work prior to becoming a large corp. Great place to start with reimbursement but the advancement opportunity is limited.
good,"While I enjoyed working here, do not expect to get promoted above mid-entry level unless you are related to someone higher in the company, dating someone in management, or part of a clique which includes management."
good,The work schedule is ideal if you are single and don't have kids or much of a personal life. You don't know when you are going home most of the time and they will add an hour or more on to your shift 30 mins before your are suppose to leave.
good,"Always growing, which is a good thing, however growth means change. They lack clear direction and a strong vision of where the company is going. Too many changes without thinking them through. Lot's of A type personalities that want to make decisions without listening to feedback. I would not recommend for this reason."
good,I enjoy working there. Great atmosphere but not alot of opportunity for advancement. I just need to relocate and there's no hr dept where I need to relocate.
good,Major changes over the last 2 years.  Company has primarily outsourced IT to offshore companies.  Focus once was innovation and striving for improvements. Focus is now making the job as simple as possible so under-qualified resources can perform tasks meant for far more skilled and experienced resources.
good,"a typical day at work is like 10 or 12hr shifts, waking up at 4am to be there at 5am, and have no outside life with my family, management will only act like they care if your kissing butt to get where you want to be, same boring task day in day out. coworkers seem like they have an attitude everyday. day shift sucks, but night shift is better, as i have worked both.. i would prefer night shift!"
good,"Recent layoffs has put my job I jeopardy.  The new model within my department is a questionable strategy, which limits my ability to advance,"
good,The job is a great place to work and management on certain teams is okay but on some they take things personal. It's wonderful place outside of that.
good,"I was being trained by a technician, but when the pharmacists found out I did not attend college, she stated I could not be a tech. I enjoyed working with the patients, and learned medication terminology, how to order products, and organizing the pharmacy to provide the most efficient service."
good,"Very busy days, time goes quickly. I question the training of the Supervisors. I don't know if the Supervisors should be supervisors or not."
good,management holds people they feel are good in their positions for advancing to a better position. Overall Amerisource is a good company to work for and has excellent benefits
good,"AmerisourceBergen is an outstanding company, since the Acquisition there has been great strides as well as shortcomings that render my verdict neutral. Talent Acquisition has made great strides in acquiring new staff however existing staff are stagnant in current positions. Most of the senior staff in South America has been replaced.  This does not inspire confidence; as a result the turnover rate has grown almost out of control. At the same time improvements in HR, SOP’s and Employee benefits have improved. Combine all the changes whether they are negative or positive leaves me undecided on the future. Peace of mind as intangible as it maybe can sometimes be more important than financial gain with that said I believe moving to a more stable workplace is the right move."
good,I would clock in and we would talk about the following night then get straight to work assisting our patients.I would talk to my patients and ask them questions about there illnesses while trying to better assist them in finding the right medications.We would try to get them approved for funding on there medications
good,"The day is ever changing, nothing there ever stays the same, not the people or the job.  Just come in every day and do what it is you do."
good,"load palates to be shipped non-stop all shift."
good,This company is great for the person who wants to remain in customer service and climb the ladder in order to serve in different facets of the company.
good,AmerisourceBergen provided a very good compensation package.  The hours of work were 55-60 hours per week and opportunity for growth were minimal.  The most enjoyable facet of the job was development of a great shift with the aptitude of the employees to understand the requirement and the determination to meet those requirements.  I enjoy  working on the development of employees and working together to meet the company objectives. We worked in a fast paced environment that required coordination between all departments to meet the daily goals set forth by orders received from our customers.  All orders received on a daily basis were next day delivered to the retail outlets and hospitals.
good,Manage a large territory of retail and specialty pharmacies. Cultavating long lasting relationships with customers while providing market industry information to help improve profitability.
good,The company is great but I would suggest reorganizing the management team.
good,"Typical day was fast paced and dealing with numbers in great detail. Hardest part of job was locating missing documents from other locations, and the most enjoyable part of the job was my duties. I really enjoyed the position."
good,It wasnt the best experience i had. Maybe because of the it being new when i first got there. The manager at the time didnt know how to run a team in my opinion.
good,I enjoyed my time here. If your a person who likes physical labor this job definitely puts you to work. The time frames may not be the best but there ok.
good,"I thought the job was great until I was let go on Friday afternoon because I failed too many training tests that I was never properly trained on. The people in charge of training would rather just do the work than let you do it so, you can actually learn. The company will wait until your 90 day probationary period is up, then fire you. My manager called me Monday after the weekend to say he was going to bring me back, however when I went in Tuesday, he said that HR shot it down, so I didn't have my job back back"
good,Typically the day is filled with many tasks to assist with getting medications to patients. Completing insurance and a number of other duties was important. I learned how to manage my time and complete most important task first. Employees were friendly and helpful with each other. Most enjoyable part was helping the patients with getting their very important medications to them.
good,"Flexible Hours"
good,Has the best PTO policy for experienced hire.  Open and fun culture. Fast paced environment. I have learned new tools to enhance my skills in this company.
good,"I work day shift and come in at 5 am Monday thur Friday and work until the work is done, typically 9-10 hours per day. We stock medications using a RF scanners and do Quality control."
good,I was only there for a short period for a specific task and did not get a chance to really sink my teeth into the culture.  I was essentially a hired gun to do a job and move on.
good,"I have worked for two pharmaceutical distributors, one small the other AmerisourceBergen.  AmerisourceBergen is a decent place to work.  You are reasonably compensated for your work, there is an incentive program and a rewards program.  Benefits are good, as they are at distribution centers.  Management is good.  The downside of working for AmerisourceBergen, as with other distributors, is the potential length of shifts, the never ending turnover of employees and employees calling out.  Additionally, AmerisourceBergen tracks your productivity and error rate relentlessly.  I feel, as an older employee, AmerisourceBergen, like other employers is way too tolerant of employee callouts.  AmerisourceBergen is a huge employer, so employees are numbers, this is unlike the small privately owned pharmaceutical distributor I worked for.  We were treated like family there."
good,"AmerisourceBergen was a good company to work for. I worked there over 5 years ago and are still in contact with several people.  Unfortunately, I ran into a bug saw as a supervisor, so it became time to move on.  The raises were far and few between for me. However, incentive pay was offered so I was able to make a moderate living."
good,Amerisource Bergen is a good place to work but the problem is theres to much favoritism at work when it become to the manager and the supervisor they always gonna come up with a nonsence rule everyday to make yout job difficult even tho is not
good,"Slave mentality. People of color on the floor, and white being the oversees. Management is poor and liars. Tell you what you want to hear. Say they will help you grow, but No men of color in big positions. Huge company but don't believe they will let people of color go but so far."
good,"Amerisource in Brooks Ky was an okay place to work. The turnover rate is high. Most of the supervisors and some of the managers did not have prior experience in a supervisor position and have no idea how to interact with associates in a professional manner. Leads are relatively new and were not chosen for skill. They do not have the knowledge to troubleshoot problems and must rely on associates that do. The hours can be horrendous, especially during flu season. If you are a picker on second shift, expect to spend 8 -13 hours in a refrigerator. If you QC, expect to work 8 - 13 hours on a second floor mezz with no air flow and no fans. This company is no different than any other corporation that thinks they can make Fridays Hawaiian shirt day, throw you a chicken bone and some sides and expect you to be grateful that they are so generous, so hip, so cool instead of working on the integrity of the company. Yes, it's one of those bonehead concepts that associates need a spirit committee when all they really want is to be treated with respect. So, if you are looking for an extremely conservative work place with no vision (oh, they will give you a lame vision card to recite for auditors) and a mediocre job with a lot of overtime then this is the company for you."
good,This company is a good company if the management team would work together along side there employees and provide them with feedback on how they can do better.
good,"good work enviroment,good benefits,good pay.good managment.they are very generous with paid time off and the work enviroment and benefits are good.and true blues are something to look for!"
good,The company is growing and adding new vendors to their line up. The work is constant and there's always something to do. The management is something to be desired. The job can be physically challenging but it's not very difficult. Most positions are easy to learn and if you're willing to learn more than just your role you can do a lot and be useful very easily.
good,"So far so good with the company very beneficial with opportunity to advance in the company, vacation time health benefits wages work well. Diversified ."
good,Great pay overall. Management can be unorganized and not on the same page. Help is not accessible at times. Work environment is okay. Alot of different posisitions
good,Great Company- good company yo work for high turn over rate. Wok hard and learn the pharmaceutical industry you will succeed. They do great work for people/
good,three month contract position - sent home and contract terminated the MINUTE the project was complete. Lots of overtime. very small work area. free parking. mon- fri hours
good,I was a great place to work for me.  I really enjoyed except that promotion was almost next to impossible to obtain though that may now be different.  Good relationships between employees.  Management at times could appear to be distant from employees.
good,"good company to work for , located in Suwanee for a good commute,"
good,"Really good job, but the hours where crazy you had no time out you worked until you finish and after you finish you clean so you get out pretty late I have a 4 year old that also needs his mother so i could’nt do for the hours"
good,"AmerisourceBergen provided a fast-paced, challenging work environment. Well structured policies to monitor performance and order accuracy. Good group of people on the floor."
good,Good job but bad job security. the job was a great job but poor job security. programs were getting shut down left and right. however i was a great place to work for the mean time
good,This company had great benefits and average pay Expectations were high and work life balance could hsve been better. The hardest part of the job was keeping up wth almost daily changes to processes and quotas Also the attendance policy and audits were unforgiving The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people who really needed help.
good,"A market leader in pharmaceutical distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes, distribute a line of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter health care products, and home health care supplies and equipment to a wide variety of health care providers located throughout the United States"
good,fast pace. d work environment.stressful at times. management pay was good. time off vacation/holidays were good.company has since moved its opperations out of the Paducah area.
good,face pace had about four leads when i was there never really had one jobs you where alot of hats there and theres alot of confused about what they need from you day to day
good,"There have been a great many changes for the better at AmerisourceBergen and it is a great place to work. It does take some time to learn what is actually required to do the job, but if you can do that you are good. The people are great and the customers are even better."
good,"I haven’t worked here so I can’t leave a review on what it’s like to work here but I have applied here a few times in the past. A few months ago, they replied and asked me to send my email and availability for an interview, I replied giving them all of my info then I never heard back from them. Fast forward to this week, I decided to apply again and again I received an email stating they would like to interview me so I replied giving my availability for an interview (which is FULL availability) and AGAIN they have not replied after sending the email several days ago. I think it’s so unprofessional that they tell me they want to set up an interview with me then just leave me hanging with no reply."
good,"Fine  I have no major issues with the work at Amerisource Bergen. The people are nice, work is fine. =They allow you to be self directed . However loss of contract leads to layoffs."
good,"they have favoritism, they love to say that ""i have to be fair"" just to sound reasonable. they tell you false information. and if you get on one of the supervisor's bad side, she would do anything to get you fired."
good,"Busy phones, approval of pending orders, collections calls and emails, Works spread sheets from management with deadlines , Back up employees that are off, Not enjoyable , but very stressful environment. Worked with cash posting department and customer service"
good,No longer work here effective today. I decided to leave the company.... I have nothing I would like to say.  I left the company to move on to something else.
good,"Good salary. Not a lot of training.5+ years’ experience in customer service, call center, data entry, and clerical/administrative support"
good,"Just ok. too compartmentalized with little chance for advancement. Does not seem to matter how well you excel or how well customers view you, you seem to be on an island."
good,"If they were to put the manager and some supervisors in check it'd be a great work environment. Some days might be longer due to the production, but again very simple job."
good,"clock into computer, clock into phone, open up various databases, pull patients information, review record information perform necessary action to patients record."
good,"The nature of the workplace can be unstable and subject to change.   Programs can be downsized and upsized according to necessity so one day stable and the next downsized where the people can be phased into a new program or let go.    Every new drug program starts from scratch.  The program launches can be stressful because the payer formulary information has to be gathered instead of basic information about formulary exceptions maintained and used between all programs.  Management style is more reactive to issues than proactive at times and is not consistent from program to program.   "
good,"As long as you have a good manager, this is a great company to work for. Benefits are great but salary/pay didn't change much unless you were in sales"
good,"Nice place to work, very fast paced.  Great benefits and nice people to be around.  The management was fair and working from home was an option which is a great benefit."
good,"Nice place to work. Lots of team and management changes often, scheduled are pretty much set. No flexibility in earlier hours. Otherwise good benefits, and PTO time"
good,"Quality control job through a temp agency. It was a good job that transitioned from warehouse to chargeback clerk. Because it was through the temp agency, I can't give an accurate description of the company pros and cons."
good,"New location that is still developing with a lot of potential. Fast paced, with an increasing workload that demonstrates the need in the area and the demand from customers"
good,"Lash Group is a good place to work. It's like any organization, not perfect and working on it's challenges. This company strives every year to work on it imperfections while involving the employees for a solution."
good,Not enough oppurtunities to move up the ladder. I learned little of technology. management is fair. Culture is great. For me No hardest part about my job. I enjoyed my co-worker's company.
good,"Amerisourcebergen is a great place to work to get experience to move onto to better positions. The work is fast paced with heavy volume and you learn a lot. I learned a lot about time management, communication and responsibility in the work place. The hardest part of the job at times is keeping up with the volume of work and trying to resolve issues since my department depends on other departments to fix problems. You do learn teamwork having to work with different departments and also collaboration skills. Lower management is pretty easy work with and they are a big help when you need them. The most enjoyable part of my job are my coworkers. I've made life long friends and we are like a family."
good,"Evening shift, with several departments to work in. Shift ends when all orders are completed. Overtime opportunities. Decent pay and benefits. Long hours."
good,"ABSG (Amerisource Bergen) was a great company to work for. I would work for them again. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience working with the company and I would recommend them to anyone. I started with the company in January 2010, and they believe in promoting from within when there is good talent. I excelled and was given the opportunity to move up in the company. Unfortunately my last position ended as the department was closed, however if given the chance I would work for them again."
good,Great place to work / and well work life balance and room for Advancement if you work directly for the company i was a temp. i worked threw a temp service so i only had the change  to experience only what the temp company allow me to for the time. I did work there i learned it was a good company to work for and for the most part most of the manger are pretty good
good,"They did a great job training me to do the job that I was hired to do. Also, give me the opportunities to learn other tasks as well. After learning my job, daily task was relaxed."
good,"Pros"
good,"The days could get extremely fast paced"
good,The calls are extremely easy to handle and are generally get the same calls over and over but advancement is not easy and the culture changes and not in a good way
good,Assisted customer's with their Insurance and Medications' informed the customer's if they where in the donut hole. Also informed customers about their medications and billing status with Humana .Took payments as well.
good,"see resume please, as all the detailed information on my role is completely outlined."
good,"My experience with Amerisource was a different one. I had never worked in a warehouse environment before and parts of it were very positive. The management did a great job teaching me things and I improved a lot because of their direction and leadership. The upper management didn’t seem to be overly appreciative of the hardwork of the warehouse associates. This caused low demeanor among the employees.  "
good,I worked in the customer service field for a medical eye drug called Eylea. I would call insurance agencies and see what insurance the patient had to see if their insurance would cover the medical bill for the drug. Another way to check that they had a co-pay that could enter all the patient data in the system.
good,Good Environment to work and good benefits but underpaid compared to similar companies.The workload is tolerable but buy some confortable shoes because you will be on your feet all day.
good,"Very very very very fast paced warehouse environment. But the management was never on your back watching you, which made work comfortable."
good,It is a warehouse job basically like any other place. Work was not hard but sometimes boring. The location I worked at closed down to due to cutting costs even though the location was very busy. Typical of any industry that cut costs.
good,"ABC is a good company but resorting to layoffs when the company is not operating at a loss does not sit well with most.  "
good,Its really challenging and requires great attention to detail.  The atmosphere is great and its secure. The hardest part of the job is handling more than one room with multiple problems but with great relationships with co-workers it makes the bad days great
good,Senior management vision for patient-centered service and spirit of innovation resonates throughout the company. Work-life balance depends on your manager.
good,This company has a lot to offer but has been through a lot of changes in management.  It has very good growth and it was a pleasure working in the Health Care industry.
good,The management can be better. Everyone is not on the same page. Currently laying off due to being over staffed. Attendance policy is ok. Great benefits
good,"Your typical day can range anywhere from boredom to overwhelming and everything in between, you just never know what the day will bring. Co-workers are friendly and easy to work with."
good,Overall a good place to work for. One of a few companies that do not mind employees putting in overtime. Individuals can expect to work anywhere between 8 to 13 hours daily.
good,"A typical work day is extremely busy.  I learned a great deal about pharmaceuticals distribution."
good,"Long hours!!! Mandatory!!! Must arrive early and stay late until everything is put away (usually 6am-6pm).  Though the holidays were fun when we had the company party, family welcome, lots of cool stuff raffled off (TVS, bikes, gaming systems, ipads, gift cards, etc.)."
good,Enjoyed working for the company. Company needs measures in place to help employee's deal with with family and personal problems.
good,i liked the warehouse but not the management.It seemed like no one wanted you to move up .This facility was not a place for me. I like to work. not try to get through the day.This company trains you but doesnt show you anything. Management here at the corona facility are uncooth and untrained for todays workforce.
good,"Managed ticket queue generated from ~300 corporate clients concerning product software, hardware, and server issues for up to 500+ end users.  Supported a Citrix server farm to ensure 24/7/365 operation."
good,"good productive job, lots of work and management is very poor, management does not care about employees. some of co workers are hard workers and some are very lazy"
good,Not enough time to balance out family. Management needs work. Great benefits for family. A lot of hours because staff shortness.
good,"I worked here as a Customer Care Rep, and it was alright."
good,The company has many different teams. The team I am on answers phones primarily and processes applications. I have learned how to work in a cooperate setting. The opinions of the managers will change with what team you are dealing with.
good,"Strong communication with management, an associates. Continual training for all. Ideas interchanged with other departments, for advancing toward a common goal."
good,"This company is a good company to work for, good pay and hrs. A great opportunity to advance after 6 mths"
good,Advancing from within is difficult. Outside experience is not evaluated when trying to advance within the company.
good,Very busy and customer focused place to work. I enjoy helping the patient's and building excellent rapport with our clients.
good,I have met many new friends and learned many new things that I hope to further my career.
good,I really liked this job but I was there was no place for advancement
good,"Met great people there, although I developed Carpe Tunnel Syndrome through repetitive motion doing double check in the Vault, filed a Workman's Comp claim and was DENIED because their Concentra Dr. Said it wasn't work related, when this is the first job I've had since 2009. He even diagnosed with CTS but said it wasn't job related... Go figure. So I resigned. I guess Big Government Corporations such as these challenge EVERY WC claim that is filed. Even when it's the truth. I can't work for a company that treats employees badly after a WC claim is filed. Too shady... Breaks were on time. The night managers are really good at that, and when it's time to leave they make sure to announce that too. My two bosses were great :) Lunch would be provided sometimes and even the Part timers got to share it too :)  lots of micromanagement though, with fellow employees."
good,"Every morning we have a meeting with supervisor and they give our assignment and what are we are doing a inventory cycle count or expiry check in the rx  area or fridge area or bulk area, after 3hours you should be stop your doing and you going to lunch. After your lunch you going to picking area .I'm going to fridge are for picking, invoicing and packing.Specially quality control, always check the product you got packed and going to right costumer."
good,A very results driven corporation. I'd like to see more emphasis on innovation and creativity among employees.
good,"post pymnt from that lockbox, file completed batches, process refund to patient or insurance company answer call from patient."
good,"Average hours worked 10 to 12 hours per day. Multi-tasking of product knowledge, customer service, benefit investigation interpretation. Quality review and Client call counseling."
good,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. was fun, learned a lot to take with me to future employments. You learned something new everyday about the job.  The enjoyable part of the job was actually working with good people.  The hardest part was trying to make the goal of 11 records a day."
good,"Everyone there is very professional and friendly.  The work day consists of cleaning up the work area, organize and supply the products to the drivers, and receiving products so we can put them on the shelves. Each person has there own job to do but it typically requires teamwork.  I learned  how to scan and ship products.  The hardest part of the job is spending long periods of time in the fridge.  The most enjoyable part of the job is putting away the products onto the shelves."
good,"Always challenging, no 2 days are the same. Great teamwork and collaboration."
good,Its a good place to start out at. It okay for younger people or a person that likes to dress casual everyday. I learned a lot about healthcare and insurance benefits. Good place if want to work where theres change and growth. 
good,ABC is a great place to work and offers decent job security.  My main gripe is that the salary being offered for most positions is not realistic for advancing through life after college.
good,processing payments from a lockbox and from invoices sent the previous days deposit. Co-workers were friendly. Loved learning things othr workers did.
good,"Typical day is taking about 400-500 calls from pharmacies, doctors offices, hospitals looking for drugs for patients. Receiving, invoicing, returns, order management are all the tasks that we dealt with on a day to day basis."
good,"This job was okay. The compensation was not great for how much time and energy was devoted to doing the job. The job itself was not fulfilling to me and something that I found myself dreading on a daily basis. I was called a patient case coordinator but felt more like a telemarketer. I found that the majority of the time, people did not want me calling or realize why I was calling them. It was good healthcare experience but I don't think I would do it again. I felt like I worked in a glamorized call center."
good,Good Company. The people are caring and try to give their best every day.
good,Could balance work and personal a bit better but overall a decent place to work
good,I worked for this company for 24 years. I had worked in the Computer room where we were in charge of printing out all reports for everyone in their offices so that they could do their job. We printed out invoices and price stickers for the orders being delivered to all the hospitals and pharmacys. We also helped all the departments if they had problems with their printers or the warehouse. If our system went down we had to tell everyone over the PA on what was happening. If we had programmer issues our main office in Columbus is where we received our help. I loved this job but things changed and they merged with another company and decided to close the Toledo office.
good,This company was a hectic place to work at times but pretty good company to work for I was able to learn the job fast my co workers were a pleasure to work with we made it like a family. I liked my job because I did several different things so I did not become bored
good,As alluded to above the fact that it was incentive based fit my own personal goals personally. It really separates the people who want more from those who simply want a job.
good,"Most associates are not held accountable for their actions. Only thing mgt really cares about and will hold accountable is attendance. Staffing is always an issue, due to the fact that there are so many other options around it and such a low unemployment rate."
good,Overall Amerisource is great company to work for. They have great place for lunch and also the mangers are very welcoming. Open door policy is always good and they do listen to their employees/
good,"The main issues with Amerisourcebergen is they do not value longivity and years of service when the client wants to change the terms of the contract to include eliminating positions. And if you try to tell a manager what's going on say poor morale, they don't want to hear why."
good,"Working here was a great opportunity , the workers were very influential but the management could be more better . Overall great place to work in the future."
good,Great place to work. The culture there is the best i've ever been around. They pay well. The benefits are okay. The turn over rate can be high do to non renewed contracts which leaves 100's without employment.
good,"Working in Maintenance is a fast paced high level of responsibility.  Politics does not effect the hourly people.  Benefits are great  401K and PTO"
good,"Amazing working environment, but workers always leave so it gets overwhelming. Management would only care about production not their workers, they only care for themselves. I was there for two years and a couple months an have had 6 different crews. Other than that Amerisource is a great company."
good,"was on there for such a short time, it was challenging for the product that we were for, Prolia.  I really don't have much to say, I thought the workplace was a little crowded."
good,Responsible for front line communication. Provide overview and outline specifics to all that inquire. As with every job there are negatives and positives here.
good,This job is very fast paced and productive. As soon as you clock in you work work work and there is always something to do. The hardest part of the job is have to come in to work on a holiday.
good,I was contracted for only a few months. It seems to be a good place to work.  I believe they could improve their training program. The training program consists of training 250+ people at one time on specialty medications. I feel the groups should have been smaller. Other than that I believe it is a good place to work.
good,"Most teams are unorganized and could be managed better. Great benefits. Some of the employees are unprofessional. Overall, it was a decent place to work."
good,A typical day at ABC was like any other 9-5 I worked in the GSK department and it was a nightmare to someone who has never worked in a high call volume call center.
good,"Started as a temp and became a permanent employee. Worked om multiple teams for different drugs. Very fast paced and stressful environment. Enjoyed the job and work but management needed improvement. Due to business conflict between company and the client, the client withdrew their products from the company."
good,My employment allowed the use of my skills and great opportunity for growth and advancement. I was able to move upward and learn multiple duties and tasks within the company on several programs.
good,"The most enjoyable part of what I do is that I get to do a little bit of everything. I am able to work alongside the HR department, accounting, inventory, operations, and compliance. It's a great place to fine tune various skills."
good,I worked for ABC for almost 9 years. The company restructured and I got a boss who became discriminate towards me and I was the only male on our team.
good,"While working here i often felt i had no life outside work, working second shift i started work when most people got off work and often worked overtime, not getting home until 2-4AM, where i hardly have enough time to wind down and sleep before i had to start work again, during weekends i felt like i was forced to catch up on my sleep and had little time for a social life."
good,"You do the most work, but receive the lesser pay of all positions. The audit system they have is unfair. i worked 5 months temporary and got the job only to get a 50 cent increase in pay. They have a high turn over. They are very strict, but the benefits are good though."
good,"My co-workers were very enjoyable and pleasant to work with.  The environment was relaxing, but at times could be stressful.  Overall, it was a good place to work."
good,"ABC constantly preaches development for their employees, however in my experience I have not seen a lot of opportunity for advancement. Certain management hires have been questionable, leaving the people who work hard and have a vast knowledge of the company and its product, to teach those above them."
good,"Started in the mail room working part time, in a few months I was able to move to a IT Support position, this was very helpful with dealing with client support."
good,I learned a lot about the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare policies and procedures. I enjoy the members of my work team. The hardest part of my job is not finding alternate assistance for patients who cant get approved or don't have insurance.
good,"Challenging, fast paced, must be detail oriented and able to handle stressful situations. Great benefits. Should be prepared for conversions, relocations and lay offs. Company is still reorganizing and centralizing some positions. Quotas must be met in warehouse positions. Company encourages input from employees."
good,"Time goes by, incentive pay helped a lot, good exercise. Learned how to used the RF scanner. Your on foot all day, you can listen to music on one side of the ear."
good,I enjoyed the variety of duties that were assigned to me.  A typical day always started with monitoring the non-exempt employee timekeeping system.  I learned different software for HR.  Management was fair and communicated effectively with their employees.
good,Am currently doing consulting at Amerisource. This assignment will end 9/25/15. Enjoy the work and the people there. It is difficult that the assignment is ending.
good,"Typical day for me is to receive about 4000 items and put them away. I have learned how to use a RF, drive an order picker, electronic pallet jack, and a dock truck. The lead is an amazing and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the day is the long hours."
good,The company has gained a lot of business in the last two years and has been trying to figure out what to do with it. There were several weeks where I had worked 80 hours. I enjoyed the challenge but was getting burnt out with the hours and some health issues. My manager was really good at trying to help alleviate some of the burden but with the business growing as quickly as it did there was a lot of people that were overwhelmed. I am hopeful that there is some stability heading their way as I know there are many that were feeling the pressure and were near the breaking point. The people I worked with cared about the company and I enjoyed working with everyone there.
good,"I love coming to work every morning , we're like a family. We handle medical products that we ship to customer everyday."
good,"My manager is one in a million at amerisource.  Smart, hardworking and trusting; a combination that will be hard to match."
good,"I worked for the company for almost 5 years. I enjoyed what I did helping sick patients seek free or low cost treatment was a joy! If you are lucky enough to get a good manager they will help you advance to achieve your career goals. If you are a parent this job does not have a good work life balance at all. I do not understand how a pharmaceutical company does not have sick time or excused absences. 21 days per yearo divide amongst appointments, kids, sick days, ect. All while receiving an occurrence."
good,"Training is stressful, typical day you have to complete as many records as you could. The payers that you would call either would have you on hold for a long periods of time to gather information. When creating the summary of benefits, you had to identify which blurb to use, not very effective."
good,"Team work was very important to get our job done in a timely manner daily . Employee appreciation luncheon and gifts that were given were very nice. Paid time off,"
good,"Great Company to start, but the last two years  become very complex, due to constant changes.  Very micromanaged. New employees made more than I did in the 6 years I worked there. "
good,"We were doing pick and pack shipments for the company, so they could ship next day service. every thing was boxed and labeled,"
good,"Typical corporate environment, excellent benefits, competitive salary."
good,"Very unorganized,  no job security . Poor training.  No holiday pay.. Hard to get hired on. Hours were ok but no benefits.  Overtime is limited and management staffing isnt so good."
good,"Excellent benefits:"
good,Great place to work. There are several different clients in the same building which gives you the opportunity to in several different areas . The location and the campus is nice! The culture of the company is open and inclusive
good,"Amerisource Bergen Inc. is just an ""okay"" place to work. Most of the people work there because they need a job. The upper management doe not treat their employees very well. The pay is average to below average. The benefits are good."
good,"Your fist year you get 4 weeks off..paid........"
good,"Really liked working for the company.   When i started the company i worked for was IVESCO, then was bought by MWI.  Not long after that it was bought by ABC."
good,Great work/life balance. Excellent benefits and perks. Open atmosphere and work environment. Busy work schedule on a daily basis. Dynamic and diverse environment.
good,Friendly staff. Hours are kinda unpredictable. Excellent benefits. Supervisors and leads very kind. The hours could be better. Everyone contributes to teamwork.
good,"People are energetic and caring; if industry was not experiencing troubles, I would consider staying. Great work/life balance.  Competitive salary and benefits"
good,I feel that Las Group is a great company to work for. The last 3 years has been good to me and the experience knowledge that I have gained have been amazing. The people are friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. Management is very understanding and they have an open door policy. The hardest part of the job is hearing the pain that the patients that we deal with go through. I feel great when I know that the drug that we work for gives them the opportunity to enjoy their everyday life.
good,"They set high expectations for a productivity; ""not quality"". Management focus on the employees who are on the top of the charts and unfortunately don't give credit to those who are trying to succeed. Needs to improvement addressing concerns or issues. The atmosphere is nice, cheerful, and caring. If your permanent with the company, they provide great benefits."
good,It's a job where you work 10-12 hours a day in a warehouse setting. You are on your feet the entire day doing your daily job function until you leave. You are constantly busy so you must focus on your job duties so that the customers can receive their products accurately and efficiently.
good,"Easy day to day.  Salary is below market.  Not much room for advancement.  Not a bad career choice if your content with your salary.  Employee appreciation days, free food, etc."
good,A typical day includes doing whatever assignments you have on hand. That's pretty standard. The unique thing about this place is the almost total lack of communication. It's a very quiet place to work.
good,"A good job with great health benefits but has several areas that need improvement starting with management. The employees are under paid and should be getting paid a greater pay rate than what they are, especially being in the health care business."
good,It was ok. The job was not stressful. Learned how to multi task. Management needs improving. Too much much of micro management and petty issues
good,speak no evil.........Management promise full time position after blizzard project ended.   When blizzard assignment ended no one was offer a full time position
good,"Lots of hours, if the pay was a little better, this would be a great place."
good,"Fast-paced work, has to immediately receive deliveries and post on the inventory system."
good,Nurses work for various manufactures' drug programs. Roles have frequent changes with little to no time to adjust. Very detailed call requirements without a provided sample script. Rigid interpretation of guidelines. New staff always starts on later shift. High turn over. No over nights or weekends. Generous pay and PTO.
good,"the company has high standards for its employees and also remain the highest ethical standards in its business practice. Work environment is professional and equal opportunity exists for anyone regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, age, religion, marital status, sexual orientation. "
good,Good benefits and time off. There is days where you can work a long day and on most days ending time can fluctuate depending on time of year and where your working. There is opportunities to work your way up but i have noticed some times there is a bit of favoritism in choices of people getting higher jobs. Co-workers are hit or miss on how they are and have real hard workers that don't get the recognition they deserve and the ones that slack off that don't get in trouble
good,"AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC), in a leader in the pharmaceutical wholesaler industry and a great, secure company to work for."
good,"Overall a good job, typical days start at 6AM sharp, work must be completes before employees can leave. Fast-paced, well organized.  Supervisors were poor"
good,"I enjoyed my co workers,  and the pay.  Training just was not up to par.  I did like it. Wasn't hard work.  Just stay focused and do your job. And enjoy the free drinks."
good,"Work life balance was good.  Benefits were pretty good.  Very demanding job and at times but it was the nature of the business.  Overall, I loved working with the people."
good,"While this job was physically demanding, I always felt when I worked as hard as I could, it was appreciated."
good,It's a decent place to work at just some of the people who work with and for are so caring so it can make things much harder to do. Amerisourcebergen also has great benefits.
good,"Co-workers are good; did not like that you was judged by your other co-workers regarding your error rate; I feel two people may do the job different that doesn't make yours wrong...due to their scores that affected your work reviews, compensation etc...the location is to remote unless you have reliable transportation and they have no type of assistance in case your care breaks down or your ride doesn't show up ( shuttle service should be provided to the nearest mall nearby where bus service is available)"
good,"Promote from within, a lot opportunity for growth, great people and company culture, but very results driven, quantity over quality seems to be managements goal"
good,Good company but the pay is not even close for the work that is required and expected as an employee. Seems like they like to run their people into the ground.
good,This company is very interactve and provides room for growth.This company also provides a safe and state of the art office facility. However pay is low and they have hig expectations as it relates to results.
good,Overall the job seems to be interesting. I don't think that the company's compensations are up to par though. The Management team is AWESOME. The job is relatively new and the facility has not opened yet but I see lots of opportunities for the new staff.
good,"A typical day at work is on the cherry pick fork lift "
good,"AmerisourceBergen is a great place to work. They have great benefits including dental, life insurance, 401K match, any benefit you name it they give you. You just work a lot of hours here so if you love overtime this is the place for you. AmerisourceBergen has staff that actually care their employees the best they can without if affecting business. It is a very fast pace, high reward job the faster you work the more money you make but it can be tiring sometimes."
good,the was ok but very hard to work for.do not intend to work there again.
good,"To much segregation among the two shifts. Don't pull their wait. One shift covers to much for the other."
good,This is a great company to work and grow with. You have a work-life balance but the work is demanding when you're working. Depending which department you work for there is room for improvement in that area.
good,a typical day at work was laid back /i mean you had available resources to assist you and trainng was good. I did the AR contract account. They treated you right and there were free coffee and drinks all day and it was a well organize company.
good,Provided work at home telephonic case management for a large pharmaceutical company. The job did not provide any clinical nursing skill and was based mostly on obtain product for the client.
good,"This company is a great place to work for, the culture provided by employees is what makes you want to come back.  In my experience, being in this environment teaches you a lot about how well a team can work together to accomplish a goal.  The work can be strenuous but all in all you benefit from good work habits and a will to advance."
good,"Great company to work for knowing you are assisting patients that require drug copay assistance. Working with pharmacies, providers and patients that are very knowledgeable about how the company operates,"
good,This organization is a great place to work. However advancement is rather slow.
good,If you are okay with working on a open dock during exposure to extreme heat and or cold then you will do great here. the staff was fantastic and the management was incredibly nice and welcoming. They offered competitive pay for hitting goals and going over your quota. It just wasn't the right fit for me as it was a secondary job that gave me almost no time off. only negative is that the schedule was always shifting and was never set. You just had to be available when ever at any time.
good,I made a lot of friends at ABC. All of the employees were very welcoming and patient with me as I learned my duties. I felt like I was part of a team and that my job meant something.
good,"Typical day at work is when you have a lot of drop ship orders that are not being shipped out on time with several angry customers. But the key is to never take it personal put yourself in their shoes and be able to resolve the issue for the customer."
good,"Typical day consist of speaking with patients, providers, reps and insurance carriers. the hard part of the job is "
good,this company is dirty dont work here they play favoritism and limit ur incentive money that they talk highly about but wont let u deviate from sop to beat the system they lie and change ur times in the computer so ur scores dont reflect the work u did just to make the vp happy cause of budget cutbacks
good,"If you are fortunate enough to be hired by a team with good management, you'll love the company. The pay is not equal across the board for similar positions, and its too low."
good,Its an ok place to work.  Typically there is little chance for advancement. The Fort Mill location is going through a transition so hopefully once complete it will be a better place to work.
good,"Due to exceptional growth, every 12-18 months, the company changes direction and organizational structure. While this makes for a challenging work environment, the business growth and solution expansion is exciting."
good,Good place to work.  Like coming to work every day.  Commute is tough because of the location right outside of the philadelphia area in or near conshy.
good,Very political.  Lack of development and growth opportunities.  Managers need more training and grooming before being put in position to lead people.   Company needs alignment and buy in at all levels.
good,"Recent restructuring has limited the amount of management support, that coupled with external hiring has left programs understaffed and under experienced"
good,Great job just got hired for reverification season wonderful work environment. Managers will help always regardless of situation. Team atmosphere and great managers and supervisers
good,This temporary employment opportunity was useful to acquire the needed skill to take to another position. Though it was not a place to grow for your own career.
good,"The work culture, mission, values is good.  However, management improvement is needed.  The pay scale is too low.  The organization mission is great and an employee will feel a strong sense of contributing to helping others."
good,"I was with the company through a few acquisitions and of course some things changed.  During my matriculation, I had the opportunity to take several business/management courses and learned that at while at times I may not have been the best employee I wasn't equipped with management that were involved in any continuing education to utilize employees strengths.  More and more companies are turning away from authoritative managing and creating a more relational atmosphere.  I would have loved to been a part of that."
good,"Amerisource is a very large organization with several divisions for growth and movement. I have obtained and learned a great deal within the pharmaceutical industry working closely with manufacturing, medical distribution and hemophiliac drugs."
good,"Very great place to work, but can easily get penalized for minor things like tardiness; however the majority of employees work from far distances."
good,"A good place to work, but there are a number of things that could make it better.  One being true and sincere leadership where they inspire and encourage employee advancement and growth.  Therefore employees don't always have a ""It's a paycheck"" mentality, but a true since of worth and accomplishment at the end of the day.  It can be a chaotic atmosphere at times, but that adds to the fun as you work with others to complete projects and task.  On the other side of the coin, the chaos can also make one's position challenging at times as some tend to be uncertain of their responsibilities and the information they should have access to or share."
good,As customer service manager I felt that I would have the ability to make changes that would help the team provide better service to the customers but my manager would never approve my changes so it was hard to move forward.
good,I was with the company before it went live so hopefully there has been some improvement with how management is and how smoothly things are ran. The pay is good and there is always room for overtime. I signed up to work 8 hour shift but spent no less than mandatory 10 hours in there. So it’s good for people who don’t have immediate obligations after work.
good,"Never bored.  However constant change was somewhat chaotic and not always productive.  Company as a whole made an employee feel valued.  Raises were very small and did not correlate to individual performance.  Example - 2% across the board is common regardless of annual review, with the exception of those needing development and improvement.  Hours are long, but depending on management, work/life balance still possible.  Guaranteed, you will learn and be stretched to grow."
good,Management doesn't know their own departments. There is a lack of knowledge from the superiors. They go back on their word. There is a lot of potential but very clicky.
good,"I rather not provide opinion. It's a relaxed place to work. Just not so secure in a position. I really rather not share my opinions of the job, I thank them for the opportunity."
good,"Good place to work, no balance between home and work"
good,"I worked in the call centre environnement. i Hardly saw my manager. She was taking care of 7 projects and hardly any time for me. "
good,The company is in constant change and is very fasted paced. The employees are very friendly and are will to assist. Unfortunately growth is limited in the Naperville office.
good,"Money was not great and very few opportunities for advancement."
good,"Kind of sucks doesnt leave much time for anything else, pay is decent, there is a pretty large night premium of 1.25 an hour. Overall easy job, the people can be pretty grumpy though."
good,"This is a great company to work for, they really appreciate their employee and they show you that on a daily. They put safety first and the establishment is very nice."
good,Job entailed speaking to insurance companies regarding a drug called Remade and if the insured was eligible to receive this drug.  Good leadership made the boredom of telephone work tolerable
good,It is a nice place to work. People were friendly.  Not much room for advancement.  They hire outside more than promoting from within from what I could see during my tenure there.
good,"I like working at this company because of the good benefits such as a lot of PTO."
good,"However, they consistently bring in outside talent and overlook the talent in-house.  Unwilling to promote from within.  Morale is affected when you are acknowledged and given a chance to move up."
good,For the play at this job is great. The job is not hard what so ever. But it do get boring at times. The managers are great and they actually care about there people.
good,It's a fast paced environment and they're strict on wearing your PPE Equipment and practicing safety is a must . You have to pay attention and beware of your surroundings walking in and outside of the plant through various climate weather.
good,Completed verifications based on patient specific benefits for Insurance plans including patient coverage and access options according to Program’s standard operation procedures
good,A typical day for me at AmerisourceBergen was providing technical  support for pharmaceutical software via the phone. I averaged about 10 to 15 calls a day. The work environment was nice and peaceful.
good,I feel that the home work balance was very poor. They also have a production rate per hour which I and alot of people that have worked there is very high. It is I believe not possible on certain positions there. And they should lower so your not trying to kill yourself.
good,Great atmosphere in beautiful building.  I am a temporary seasonal worker but am not treated as such.  Management is knowledgeable and easy to work for.
good,"fun yet fast workplace. relaxed and clean environment. pick, stage, compound, label, pack, ship. repetitive and tidiest workflow but yet easy as you get use to you."
good,"Decent place but lacked training and overall team work.  New Operation and working out the kinks. Shipping only happens on 2nd shift and the hours are ""until done"""
good,The company as a whole is really fun and high energy place to work. There are associates that have worked with the company for years. It provides a valuable service to the surrounding community.
good,Worked a lot of hours which was a good thing for me as I needed the money.  Shortly after my leaving this facility was closed and business was absorbed into other warehouses in the country.
good,It's amazing how long bad management is able to get away with their company-destructive policies. Benefits are good but lack of leadership is disconcerting.
good,"Lots of details.  management is good, great training department, pay is reasonable.  Good annual bonus structure. Tine off is reasonable, and breaks are not an issue."
good,Upper management was not involved with the night shift operations at all. Would've been nice to see them on the shift if for not other reason than showing support.
good,Overall this is a great company. The President  and COO are supportive and respectfully friendly. 
good,I have been here many years because it is a good company. they offer good benefits. the shifts are not all great even though the late shift gets paid a differential

good,ABC is a big organization with many moving parts.  The company has good leadership in place and communicates well with the employees regularly about new ideas and progress on others.
good,Great place to work. Large corporation. Did not get 5 stars due to too many regulations which is normal for a large corporation. Great group of people.
good,A very diverse company with lots of opportunities for personal and business growth. Busy work environment that requires focused and attentive employees.
good,"This company has a great workplace balance and very flexible. The hardest part is advancement within as it relates to compensation. Often times, there is a short threshold for compensation when advancing within."
good,Good benefits and okay salary. Company culture needs to develop better ways to define clear paths for advancement and be more aggressive in rewarding great employees.
good,ABC has been fair and a great place to work.  The culture I have seen get more corporate which is not bad just not for me.  I am looking for a smaller company.
good,"My typical day in the office consists of working with insurance companies and Health Car provider to find the treatment for the patient. Not only the best treatment, but assisting the patient when they are in need of financial help."

good,"Pros"
good,"A typical day at work was usually 10 to 12 hours. I did receiving of product and picked orders for shipments to customers. I learned how to use RF receiving devise. I enjoyed the co-employees that I worked with, we had a good repore and usually got on well with each other. The hardest part of the job was working to meet their production requirements which found the dismissal of many employees, through the RF tracking production was tracked down to partial seconds of time. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenge that the job offered."
good,"Its a nice place to wok , enjoyed my term working here, as i have some other constraints so need to leave this company, else its the best company in the market"
good,I like my Job and the people I work with. I Have to lift heavy boxes that are full of medical supplies. I also enjoy the atmosphere that I work in. The only thing I dislike is the pay.
good,FileNet is now part of IBM.  The culture and the people at the original FileNet was the best.  Great teamwork and recognition of accomplishments and contributions.
good,"I had a great experience when I first started at the company. The training was thorough which allowed me to become the lead trainer two months later. I learned a lot about how insurances and pharmacies work together to make sure a patient received their medication on time. My Co-workers were friendly and gave critical feed back which I truly appreciated. Management was fair. The hardest part was while I was training, making sure all the weekly reports were done but also making sure the trainee received enough information to be able to work on their own. The most enjoyable part was when I could help out anyone with a certain task and make sure everything was correct. Unfortunately there was no room for growth which is one of the reasons why I ended up leaving this company along with some personal reasons."
good,"Good company but very corporate America with strict rules and procedures"
good,"Strong company with very rapid growth and change, experienced multiple department reorganizations within very short time span."
good,Supervisor was high and some employees came in drunk and didn't want to do their job so I did their job to keep line moving iI would jump from one track to another to keep line moving
good,"I am part of a team that is dedicated to getting the right product to the right customer in the most timely manner. I have learned the importance of caring for someone I don't even know. With the job I do every day, it is crucial that I stock every product without damage, make sure it is not expired, and goes to the proper location for order filling. All these steps are critical for the customer/patient who may be depending on this product to help or possibly even save them."
good,"Very structured environment to work directly with patients. Helping to activate trial offers and savings card for patient that can't afford the medications.  Very busy office filled with multitasking orders. Nice relationship with co-workers on breaks or lunches. The hardest part of the job was to make sure all task are done in timely manner and finished on the end of the day. The best part was to satisfy patients and helping them with their needs, receiving appreciation from them and be recognized with the department and immediate supervisors."
good,"The day began with taking inventory of the warehouse of specialty drugs using the unique inventory system. Working with two directors to not only keep track of inventory, but also track all returns which had to be kept under unique conditions due to the fragility of the drug. The hardest part of the job was managing the returns which was run through multiple couriers to ensure that each one had the correct instructions on how to handle the package."
good,Great place to work with lots of interesting people from all over the world.  Very busy but a great challenge and rewarding

good,Amerisource Bergen is a nice place to work for. The work Is not very hard and everyone is friendly. A typical day for me is verifying pharmacy coverage for members.
good,AmerisourceBergen provides many avenues to allow employees to participate in company improvement. Bonuses are given based on overall company success. Some managers are willing to share knowledge with those who display willingness to learn more.
good,Atypical day is high paced filled with many customer requests that challenge and satisfy me to  find cost effective ways to meet my client needs.  Over the years I have learned many technical aspects of my job but none as important as collaboration and teamwork.  The hardest part of my job is the most rewarding by constantly look to find ways to drive continuous improvement.  I do this my managing a flat and nimble organization.
good,"Enjoyable, political (more so than most), but overall decent."
good,"A typical day was hectic. Busy busy and very productive."
good,"Most days at work are great, days go by fast, money is made, and new things are learned every day. I like working in groups & alone in my everyday work. I have learned a lot throughout the many years that I have been working in warehouse positions! To learn & provide materials in everyday life is something special & I take great pride in learning about. Managers & co-workers come and go, good and bad, everybody is still learning there positions in their job, better reorganization of employees would be great! the hardest part about work is knowing what you are doing, having people take the time to teach you & knowing what to do. I love making new friends & building into families with the people I work with."
good,I loved working at Amerisourcebergen. I learned so much at this company. I acquired a lot of skills with this company and was able to apply those same skills at other jobs.

good,"Reviewing KPI's, matrix's or dashboards.  Checking on the shifts daily nights and days.  Handling associates issues."
good,"Nice place to work, but company is closing.Very friendly environment. Good management."
good,It is a good company to work for.Plenty of work not enough money.
good,"Learned about working as a team. Good, hardworking people, enjoy going to work. Hardest part of job is working 10 or more hours back to back. A few challenges with new tasks learned while growing within company, but need something with more flexible hours for family and school. Overall, great place, recommended to lots of family and friends."
good,AmersourceBergen is a outbound call center that sometimes deals with various insurance companies for certain medications. Good environment around the job itself.
good,Dont have anything negative to say about the establishment. Outside of the third shift hours I'd still be working there great benefits good people short handed sometimes
good,"I love working for the Company, it was a great experience, I didn't know what I would be doing, but threw the hard work, and example, I really successful at that Company, I explore different areas"
good,"a typical day was not knowing what time shift ended"
good,Most managers lack knowledge of their team because they are only in it for the money and title. Others just don;t care. There are some great managers at AmerisourceBergen. They encourage their employees to learn other skills to help them advance.
good,Fast paced environment. Learned to work under pressure. There was a lot of employee turnover. The hardest part of the job was meeting the time requirements.
good,Generally a comfortable atmosphere . Not too loud or too quiet . Nice sized cubicle with two monitors . Friendly peers who would help when asked via Skype or in person .
good,"Difficult to add in clinical knowledge when restricted due to scripting and guidelines that have to be followed.  Easy job, just not rewarding professionally."
good,i do not have a review to provide for this employer. they did some things great and other things not so great. overall they were pretty middle of the road and not willing to fight for employees that work the hardest yet instead worshiped mediocre talent and praised people for only doing half their job.
good,"the work environment is great and they truly care and value their employees. The benefits are excellent,and  the hours worked out well for me. they make you feel appreciated."
good,"Overall this job is good for a person if they live to work. There is mandatory overtime that is given which helps with money, but does not allow for much of a life outside of work. The positive of this company is the benefits package and training on equi[pment that is given."
good,"Its a good job for individuals with either no children or grown children. "
good,Lash is a great place to work with top notch amenities for it's employees. However it is definitely customer focused. So the strongly encourage you to perform above average.
good,"I applied to the high security medical warehouse because my brother worked here. It was great. At first, I loved it but they trained me for accuracy and cleanliness. Not speed. So they had me rush and get my speed up in hopes of getting a big fat bonus check for themselves by the end of the year. I understand the want but to push someone and multiple others that hard isn't necessary."
good,"A typical day is never the same.  You start at different times and you never know when you get out.  The bad thing I can say is they do not let you have a school/life balance.  I am in school and it's very hard to do that, study and make it to TMCC with the amount of hours you are required to put in.  My boss is probably the best you can have but it doesn't help with my school hours and study.  The hardest part of the job is the repetitive things you have to do. Even if you ask to learn something else, chances are if you are too good at what you do, it won't happen."
good,"Fun Days/Celebration of co-workers"
good,This was very relaxed & team environment to work in.  everyone helped to build each other up & work together to make things happen.  I hated leaving this position but the work was being out sourced
good,"A typical day at work is work and work, but there is abusive management who do not really care about the welfare of the associates. Very tense all the time at the work place, associates cannot express themselves or speak their mind. The work is not that hard nor is it stressful. there is this community outreach program where associates give back to less privileged people in the shelters"
good,"Overall the company is a great company. It really depend on your manager and team. Overall my experience has been positive. Lash Group, a part of AmerisourceBergen, is a patient support services company. At Lash Group, we work with purpose. As a member of our team, you’ll have an opportunity to learn, work and grow alongside highly motivated associates who genuinely want to make a difference and put patients at the center of everything they do."
good,If you work hard and enjoy a steady paycheck this is the place for you.  The hardest part of the job is the required overtime on many of the shifts.
good,"My job started out by printing my customers sales history, up to date from last year in comparison. Visiting 8-10 customers daily and reviewing their account, going over new item coming to market, price increases and industry news. I learned when was a good time for my customer to review this and his/her expectations. Management was there if you needed them. My co-workers were like family and very helpful."
good,Once great company that seems mired in greed and executive compensation. Emphasis on raising stock price at expense of losing best employees. Formerly this was a sales driven organization that celebrated individual and team contribution.
good,"A lot of room for advancement. It will challenge your thinking process, and your attention to be more focused on details."
good,"Great work/life balance and benefit packages.  "
good,"nice place to work. liked the atmosphere very rewarding. Management was good, but new director destroyed the company."
good,Not a place with drama. I enjoyed the team work and management trying to make the hectic work a little fun. Would definitely work there again on a permanent situation and not just for a blizzard.
good,"Strong, financially sound company with a moderate amount of room for growth. Work/ life balance is a priority, however the work load is heavy. Inability to complete entire daily work assignments is not always possible and is addressed on a weekly evaluation. Orientation leaves much to be desired. Policies on important issues are vaguely worded so evaluation of policy adherence is very subjective and frequently unbalanced. "
good,"Place was great and challenging."
good,"Amerisource Bergen is a good company to work for. I would love to be a permanent employee but due to the conditions of my contract with the staffing agency which placed me here, I'm not eligible until June of 2017. I'm looking to work with a company as great as Amerisource Bergen but as a permanent employee with full benefits. "
good,"Used RF scanners to get product and place in totes. Multiple 15 min paid breaks every 2 hours, shift was avg at about 10 hrs a day. Clean environment and kept at room temperature"
good,"My time working at AmerisourceBergen has taught me a great deal about strategizing and developing relationships with business owners. I have partnered with some of the best salespeople in the industry, learning how to approach professionals in different areas of the industry with a dedicated focus to their needs. I have established a true excitement for the development of sales and marketing leads, and found I have a natural ability for it. ,I took full advantage of the resources and training available from such a large institution."
good,"My day is pretty much set on a schedule, Everything is timed and the people i work have their positions and routines. I deal with bulk orders and refills. Assists where I am needed and over all I enjoy my job and the people I work with.  The Hardest part of my job is not keeping up with the flow of work or making my set numbers. It is not the forced over time and Holiday work. It is that there is no room to improve, learn other positions and grow we the needs of the company. Over all your job with this company is just that and there is no where to go."
good,"This was a seasonal position for me, so was never sure of the advancement. Managers are famous for favoritism. This position however was fairly easy, due to the fact that I had medical administration knowledge"
good,"A company worth considering.  Long hours with overtime.  I work at the pharmacy technician end with the aid of Manual pick program.  I also package sort, distribute prescription.  The management needs to be assertive as to what they want from workers, what the goal for workers is.  The co-workers are nice."
good,"This was a position that I learned alot about on door locks and keypads, great opportunity and culture in this company."
good,"1. Good Environment for work."
good,Great company to work for! I love the culture and values. Not so much a fan of some of those in upper management positions.
good,"Went into work started your job ,you knew what you were to do to get the job done."
good,"Great company good benefits"
good,"Was able to visit a customer in Arizona, had a great time working there the company moved their accounting department to Florida."
good,"AmerisourceBergen is moving full speed ahead to be the "
good,"Enjoyed working here. Only left because I moved out of state. If you show potential, you can move up within company. Employees were all great to work with. Wasn't to big of company, where you would feel like just a number, but was big enough so you can get good benefits."
good,"Good company to work with , good people with good atmosphere , good supervisors and nice place to work. What i learned is hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Hardest part was to work long hours and enjoyable part was people and supervisor were very friendly and workplace felt like home"
good,Good company with good benefits and great co-workers. But management was going through changes and it poured onto the floor with some problems. Managers changed out twice in my short time there.
good,"Good company to work with, A lot more to as you work with the company, Good Management, good people to work and easy job no stress."
good,Management and co-workers are friendly and helpful. A calm environment with a constant work flow to keep you busy all day.
good,Typical warehouse job with long hours but good pay. Management was helpful and relax as long as you did your job.
good,"Advancement opportunities are available. Long days most days, comes with the positions. Great opportunities to learn providing upward mobility. Company promotes remote if the employee wants."
good,Being part of ABSG or in a business unit was an amazing experience - very fun and entrepreneurial.  ABC is now a big company with more of that kind of culture.
good,The job its self is good . just don't feel that everyone gets a fair shot at advancement in the company. But I think it has a lot of growth.  Just need to look at changing pay scale
good,"Nice people. Seem to care about what they do. Like to hire people from all backgrounds, ages and demographics. Good culture. Would be a good place to work for someone who wants consistency, monotonous work-life balance.  Infused with long time employees.  Keep your head down, show up everyday and you'll be fine."
good,". Typical day. We worked remotely, came in about 1/2 hour before starting calls or meetings.  I would check emails, and review scheduled meetings and trainings. Reviewed calls for the day and would organize the most urgent and call those pts first. Stayed in contact with team member such as the Site Coordinator for  important information needed especially ones starting treatment I learned how to work independently, pace my day, reach out to team member for  needed clarification. My manager was very helpful and was available for concerns, easy to approach. The executive managers were more difficult to communicate with. My team was very helpful and would help others with programs or calls"
good,go in at 4 p.m. hour before the other start.start pulling cases to be shipped label them as being pulled. pulling wave for other dept. that is pulling stock that is need at that time for orders. do this all night.after you pulled the patch of labels take to dock for shipping to the assigned lane. when labels done we pull lean time. that stock for for pick fingers and auto pick machine.when done. move stock to auto pick platform and people move to assigned area.
good,"I loved working in my last dept. Verifying benefits. The management was horrible, there was a lot of favoritism between reps. The benefits were great."
good,"AmeriSource was the third company to acquire our business. They did a wonderful job turning the business around with strategic initiatives. Unfortunately, the culture became toxic and leadership (in my business unit) was unhealthy. "
good,Amerisource bergen use to be a great place to work until it was bought by a larger company and it went for a company that was geared towards bettering it's employees to a company that only thought about it's bottom line.
good,"You learn about different medications and many chronic diseases. You get to interact with many providers and patients, and you are able to help people in need which is very special."
good,It is a busy job that rarely leaves you standing around.  There is options for overtime if you wish to work it.  The managers are easy to get along with and will allow you to make suggestions to help better the company.  Though the pay may be slightly lower than that of similar businesses in the area the benefits and incentive programs can make up for that.
good,"On call required, OT not required. Management and other staff available via IM and email, could call if needed immediately.  Required to have multiple licenses from across the US, company paid for them and tracked them for RNs."
good,This company prides themselves on no room for errors and held every associates to that standard. Fast paced environment with procedures and policy changes frequently.
good,Career advancement opportunities were usually lateral.  The pay was average.  Good bonus opportunities.  They do respect work-life balance.  Mostly a collaborative environment.  Constantly reorganizing departments.
good,Overall Amerisource Bergen is a decent place to work. The only con to me is that they say that there is room for advancement but there is limited advancement positions open which leave you stuck in entry level positions. It doesn't matter how qualified you are.
good,its ok nice workplacbuildinge to work at nice atmosphere nice employees nice management nice compensation nice benefits nice days off nice respect nice
good,Very repetitive work but coworkers are all pretty nice.  The workplace culture is good for the most part but if you are younger it might be off-putting because most of the people that work here are over the age of 35.
good,Great place to work if you're a hard worker. I have seen people move into positions in every area of the warehouse. The opportunities are available if you ever get bored.
good,"Nice for warehouse work, air conditioned building, just sucked on 2nd shift having to stay till all orders were done and OT called just before shift ends."
good,A good place to work but there slow the job and cut the hours. I need  some extra money. The place is great. Supervisor and manager are great too. But working 6 hour every day is not enough
good,I really enjoyed working for ICS. I gained a lot of great experiences and additional knowledge. I was given suitable training as well. The management team is medium at best. But all in all its a great company.
good,"Great company to work for. One of the industry leaders and always looking for ways to get better. Fast paced environment and can be physical demanding. On the management side decent pay, for the associates it they seem to be a little underpaid for the amount of work they do on a daily basis. They do look for ways to reward the associates and was one of the best teams I had the privilege to be a part of."
good,"All my duties are send by email. Following company policies we contact providers, to obtain the requested information. All jobs must be completed on a daily basis. Co workers are discipline and team oriented."
good,AmerisouceBergen is a very large corporation that offers many opportunities for growth. The pharmaceutical industry is very complex and ever changing. ABC has invested and continues to invest in its infrastructure and in its customers.
good,"It was a fun place to work, fun people there, but also the bad thing was a lot of people would quit because of  the late hours we worked and sometimes long shift of often 10 or 11 hours so we were often under staffed."
good,"The benefits are very good.  "
good,"A typical day consists of Working directly with internal and external client to report adverse events in accordance as per appropriate standard operating procedure and client needs. Extensive work with Microsoft Office programs as well as a variety of office equipment such as photocopier, fax, and scanner."
good,Great business opportunities and  prefer to keep it brief;  Enjoyable place to work and average amount of politics as with any job. Most enjoyable is working with the clients and providing solutions.
good,"Great place to work, management eager to listen as well as promote from within.  My team transferred to a new state to due restructuring."
good,"Follow up on medical claims"
good,"Everyone is very friendly and social.  Typically when I arrive at work I come a few minutes early to say hello and interact with fellow employees.  We rely heavily on teamwork to solve questions during our shift.  Management is very involved in our daily activities and have open door policies.  We are required to attend meetings frequently to discuss new techniques and changes within the company.  We are always expanding and taking on new jobs.  The hardest part of the job is constantly meeting production requirements when we have no say in what work we will receive for the day.  It's completely random so you might get stuck with nothing but difficult cases for the entire day making it extremely hard to meet production requirements.  However, it's averaged every month so typically it balances out because you will also have easy days that you can exceed production requirements.  The most enjoyable part of the job is challenging myself to produce as much as I can as well as helping our patients get the help that they need.  It's extremely satisfying to know you're helping someone as well as doing a great job.  Overall it's a good company to work for and I have spread the word and brought in several friends as current employees in which everyone thrives in the position."
good,"It is a fun place to work on a short term basis, with a lot of potential for growth."
good,"> Managememnt had couple of blunders."
good,"I started this job when business was really picking up so I started out working a normal 8 hr shift but by the time I left a normal shift was 10 hrs. The work is very repetitive and you are on your feet the entire time. Not really bad if you want to stay in good shape. I lost 20 lbs in two months. Eventually the job gets a little boring and the schedule takes a toll on your body because you are expecting to work at a very fast pace for 8-12 hrs daily. On the other hand the benefits are great and they take pretty good care of their employees. At least once a month, they provide food or snacks for everyone. The hardest part for me was the scheduling. I have a 6 yr old and neither one of us was happy about not being able to spend time with each other everyday. Also the pay is decent, plus you get an incentive for making over production. but they make billions of dollars on the backs of warehouse employees who only make $12 no bonus at all. They are a 24/7 operation so they rarely get holdidays off. Vacation hrs build up pretty quickly but usually holidays are blacked out so you can't use them for that. On the other hand, holiday pay is like double time and a half....I guess you gotta take the good with the bad."
good,It was a nice place to work.  There really wasn't room for advancement and my department got laid off.  I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,As an Operations Manager I work with pharmaceutical companies and physician offices to find medical reimbursement for products and services.
good,"  A typical day at work would be taking care of customers needs. It could range from placing an order to an issue with the courier service.   "
good,working in the call center dept is a challenge. need to have patience. 
good,Maintain data integrity daily
good,"Nice people, fun atmosphere, little chance for upward mobility."
good,I was in charge of preparing the federal pro-forma and multi state/local income tax returns for assigned corporations from reception of the trial balance to processing in OneSource tax system. I learned what is involved in the processing of Form 1099-MISC. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the entire process from beginning to end. The hardest part was the inability to adjust any schedules/workpapers for greater efficiency because they were linked. Management valued professional education for all employees and included seminar on a regular basis. I formed strong bonds with my co-workers.
good,ABC is very good company to work in due to vast opportunity & diverse culture & nature of work. Here employee are very friendly & Co-operative. You will feel like in family.
good,Good company but the schedule wasn't working for my family  and the drive was too long from where I stay.Management are nice to work with and has good benefits too
good,A great place to work for acknowledgment of insurance portfolios. management was okay always moving around and not providing updates to changes made. good place to work and grow
good,"Athough I was the oldest team player, I enjoyed working with my team members, I met all types of ethnic, and people who came from different backgrounds. I would work there again if I had the choice to go back."
good,I loved working at AmerisourceBergen company. The culture tries to involve employees in the running of the company from bottom to top.................
good,"Come in each day and do your work. You are able to learn what you need to complete work and then you are free to work on your own work. Once you are done, you are able to leave for the day."
good,"Constantly growing through acquisition, while maintaining a good work/life balance in most areas. The company operates all across the planet, and physical location is not a barrier to engagement in many projects."
good,Great company but had realignment and let everyone go.  Top leadership in question but direct manager was excellent to work for.  Good work life balance
good,"For a distribution center of health care and medical supplies, this is the top of all in this industry. A very fast paced work environment and well maintained building."
good,Worked at this company but was never promised a permanent position after each round of pre elimination during testing. This felt like a medical school more than a job to work.
good,"Overall, AmerisourceBergen is a good place to work. There was some job turnover when I was there, but I liked the position I had and the customer base was good, as well. The pay was decent but could have been better. The opportunities to advance is pretty slim; they make it hard to advance."
good,AmerisourceBergen is a large company and there is opportunity for career growth if that's what you desire. Because it is so large there are many different departments with their own goals so sometimes it makes working together a little harder than it should be as you're all working toward the same common goal.
good,"This is a fantastic company with high potential for very long tenures. The benefits are amazing. If you join the right team or group you can grow in your career path. However, if you join the wrong team lead by shortsighted leaders you will stagnate until you decide to leave."
good,I loved working at Amerisource as it was a great experience talking to  the Member and being able to help them in getting their circumstances. To be able to help others when they are in dire need was just an amazing thing.
good,"This was a good place to work.   I enjoyed advancing continually there.  It was hard work but the time went fast and I like staying busy.   "
good,I had the opportunity  to perform better by taking different curses available online which allowed me to be part in a different pilot projects. A typical day is being on the phone from the beginning to the end of the shift which makes the job stressful. Unfortunately advancement is not available and once you start a new position you are not allowed to apply for another one for 11 months including changing shifts.
good,AmerisourceBergen is a great place to gain experience/knowledge to prepare for future advancements. Everyday brings an opportunity for learning and growth.
good,"Amerisource Bergen is a great company with lots of unique opporunties. There is are lots of promotional opportunities at all levels of employment. They offer lots of after work activities for all associates to participate in. There headquarters is located in Fort Mill, South Carolina.The Fort Mill campus and office space is beautiful!"
good,"Constant Organization Change"
good,it was a contract position this shouldnt be a requirement this job was goood the people were nice and the work was easy. The hours were ok this was a good company.
good,"A typical day at work at Amerisouce was a very challenging, a lot of learning to do and very stressfull one but if you enjoy being on these kind of environment then your good,"
good,"this was a fast paced environment. Biggest issue is the pressure coming from the upper management, always reducing the number of employees while increasing your workload."
good,Good place to work and great co-workers. Don't leverage experience of employees to improve overall company goals. Management changes often so makes job more difficult.
good,"AmerisourceBergen is a great place to work. However, the pay is quite low in comparison to other companies. It is nearly impossible to afford the living costs in the area."
good,A growing company that are willing to achieve there goals.i think the company need one on one with the management team more to bring a better understanding with the associated.
good,"AmerisourceBergen is a great place to work.  Within my department, you knew your responsibilities and was expected to get things done without any micro-management."
good,"nice people...don't approve of the ""Comp Time"" rather then OT. Feel that if you work over 40 hours you should be paid and not have that taken away.  Lost money doing that, because was not properly compensated."
good,"A typical day at work varies based upon your job title. The range of it would entail collecting patient insurance information to compile a benefit profile for the many different drugs we work with. I have learned a vast amount of medical terminology, medical coding, insurance benefits, and developed relationships with the clientele that I could not have done anywhere else. The management is just as varied. There are some hard working and honest people, and then there are some who aren't. There is a vast amount of nepotism in the office which is chalked up to ""it's just who you know"". The workplace culture is touted as a family, a team, and all for one. But what is preached is not always practiced. Within the company there are different teams for different drugs, some are better at cultivating a healthy team mentality, while others are not. And while the name of the game is quantity over quality, using morally grey options to get the job done, there are some who still stand against that in management. The hardest part of the job comes when you begin to express interest in moving up. They will add as much as they can to your current role expressing the need to build your skill set, but far too many have been giving a work load that they do not get adequately compensated for. Many of our employees have moved to other companies because of this. The most enjoyable part of the job comes from the satisfaction that we provide services that really help the patients. Knowing that someone's health is dependent on the accuracy and readiness of our services is something to be proud of. And"
good,"The average day was fast paced and if you worked in another department besides picking or shipping towards the end of your shift you would be called to help those departments. You always had to work over time its mandatory, but after awhile you'll now what days and seasons for over time and kind of know when you'll get off. Of course there will be days that you don't expect the overtime. All the benefits they had were excellent health, 401k, vision, life insurance, and stock options. Pay wasn't on par to like johnson&johnson but it isn't a company owned distribution center like they are. Management was always helpful when needed along with the coworkers."
good,Low salaries for employees.  There is opportunity for growth and they tent to hire within the company.  Management and leadership is good and the company seems to be going in the right direction.
good,it was the first company to get me haired i learned alot with them and thats how i liked working and be better everyday as warehouse worker and operator.
good,For the most part the position was fine but it was some cases where they could of been more productive and organized. Everyone on the same page and with the same knowledge to teach.
good,Nice place to work great group of people. Friendly environment with great hot chocolate. Loved the free giveaways and the consideration of days off during the holidays.
good,A typical day of work consist of my 8 hours of non micromanaged employent; I love the work environment and the benefits. I just want to work in my degree field at this time.
good,"Good place to work. My boss was great. Pay was OK Benefits good, Good work balance. Ample amount of time off. There was pressure but little stress. I left because another company was offering more $$"
good,"Walk in, clock in suit up for your daily work. Since the beginning, there's no teamwork, it's like every man for themselves. Sometimes, you will have your days and sometimes you won't because the co-workers are sneaky and only care about themselves."
good,"You are able to work from home but, unless you live in Dallas, there is no room for advancement."
good,Not a bad place to work. Focused on culture and there appears to be many advancement opportunities. Management is working through a re-org right now and could be problematic.
good,"I worked in various groups within the organization during my tenure there and rarely met a person I didn't like.  Most were very easygoing, fun, hardworking and a pleasure to be around.  We worked hard but had fun doing it.  Management has changed over the years and the fun level has dropped dramatically; some very good people have left, voluntarily or not, and morale has gone down.  Hopefully that will pick up someday and be the enjoyable company it used to be."
good,This is a nice place to work depending on the department you work in. Overall I enjoyed my position while I was there and had the opportunity to learn a lot.
good,"Number driven, some departments have the greatest experience. Rewarding place to work for but there is room for improvement. High stress environment in collections department depending on business unit."
good,There are some great divisions at AmerisourceBergen Specialty group with some very great leaders.  The location is not the best because of the increasing traffic though.
good,Great company for advancement and takes care of employees and provides great benefits. The down fall is the pay increase when being promoted HR policy only allows for 10% increase at the max will not provide more once you full time with the company and will pay outside people more money than the employee who have longevity with the company due to this policy.. Been with the company for 4 years and only received 10% pay increase when promoted.
good,"Good opportunities for growth in this company. Culture is very corporate. Salaries are very conservative for non-management positions. Always changing and growing, never boring"
good,"There is usually a good amount of overtime offered, but I wish the hours were better. Basically every shift is a third shift position. Also they tend to not promote from within. I believe their inside employees would be a better fit for positions such as a lead. How do they expect someone to lead a team when the team is having to train and lead them every day. The work is very easy, the hardest part of your day is learning to navigate the RF system when you first start out."
good,"Overall a great place to work. The people are top notch, although the operation have been through many changes. Potential to be a top notch organization in 3-5 years."
good,I am seeking other career opportunities in the Mortgage Industry because that is where my skills are. AmerisourceBergen is in the health industry and I want a change.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to service clients through customer service.  While in this position I no longer have direct contact with patients, just knowing I play a role behind the scene is so rewarding."
good,"Pros: AmerisourceBergen has great growth opportunity. The company recognizes employees and hires a lot internally. The company also has a great retirement package and health benefits. Company bonuses are given quarterly."
good,Great place to work and grow but unless you want to relocate not much advancement. Had a great boss and the PTO time was a plus.
good,"Great people and good work life balance"
good,"The company is a great company to work for. The benefits are really good and the environment is a great one to work in. However, getting promoted isn't as promising as one would like to think."
good,"Amerisource Bergen Specialty Group (aka Lash Group) was a great place to work. During my tenure there, the environment was professional and it was obvious the CEO (at the time) cared about the employees. The company has experience tremendous growth over the years and with that comes growing pains. Many of the perks and positive attributes that made the company so desirable (applicants were trying to get in by the truckload) started to change and so did the morale. It was a fun place to work and at the day's end, you felt like your efforts actually helped someone. You were expected to get your work completed...but you didn't mind doing it even if it meant stretching yourself a little more than usual."
good,Fast paced work environment where the patients needs are the priority.  I worked primarily with French speaking patients ensuring the highest level of confidentiality and care.
good,Your never standing around always something to do . I don't think they appreciate their employees as much as they should.
good,"AmerisourceBergan was certainly one of, if not, the best companies I have worked for. The management in the Calgary office were among the most professional and friendliest that I have had to opportunity to work for. In fact the management to employee relationship felt more like a friendship."
good,Every day was different and always a learning experience. Management was supportive and great to work with.
good,"A typical day would be appointing trucks for bulk incoming inventory. Trouble shooting inbound issues. I enjoyed the job very much, I enjoy working with people and the hardest part of my job was not having enough time to complete all work. It's a 24 hour 7 day a week job that never stops."
good,"There was almost always enough work to do.  My coworkers were nice, competent, and hardworking.  My trainer was thorough and communicated what I needed to learn clearly. My boss was intelligent, communicated well and was understanding and worked with me when I needed to leave work early to take care of personal business, as well as letting me make up the time."
good,AmerisourceBergen is a great place to work while on my apprenticeship I learned alot about project managent.
good,Good Company but focused on American expansion. Pulling out of Canada.
good,"I have the pleasure working in Amerisourcebergen i enjoyed working with very professional environment aswell as vendors, customers, professional peers and upper management."
good,"Good management and people, but compensation is not the greatest."
good,I enjoy my job and the people that i work with on a daily basis. I have made lifelong friends also with this company. I am looking forward to the opportunities that will come with this position.
good,Amerisourcebergen was the job with benefits I had always wanted. I truly enjoyed working for them in the beginning. I would still be there today if management would not have lost focused on what was importnat in a valued employee
good,i enjoyed my time working at AmerisourceBergen. It provided some opportunity for advancement. Due to the economy there have been multitple layoffs.
good,My time with the company was really well spent. The opportunity to grow is all there and in case you are looking to move they have locations all throughout the U.S.
good,Opportunity to grow. Been with the company 15 years looking for new opportunities in consulting. Relocating is an option and company has multiple locations.
good,"This was a great place to work for many years.  After many rounds of lay-offs, the culture and morale has declined quite a bit.  It's still a great industry with great people, but job security is suspect these days."
good,Come to work to work and stay positive. Be respectful to others mind your business and carry on with your day. Go home and prepare for another day. Staying positive will help always with anything in life.
good,"AmerisourceBergen is a great company and has good benefits, incentive pay and over time, but relocation in Corona is not the greatest. A typical day at AmerisourceBergen is a lot of walking and scanning medicine with with a RF gun. It is indeed great to make a difference in a patients life."
good,Depending on the position difficulty can vary. I started as a Patient Case Coordinator which wasn't to difficult to master but when I was promoted to a Reimbursement Counselor that's a different story. The plus is the training and trainers work diligently to help you master your position. There's plenty of growth potential within this company. Their benefits packages are TOP!
good,"Working with AmerisourceBergen was very productive to my career, and skill set. In addition, the company is very focused on collaboration and employee engagement."
good,The type of place where you remain productive all day long. Employees are enjoyable people. Occasional free lunches for meeting certain goals. Fun place to be but there are times when we work excessive amounts of overtime. The downside is the obligatory overtime.
good,I have been with three different groups throughout my time here. Each group I worked with was an overall good experience regarding the job responsibilities and co-workers. My biggest issue comes to promotions. Mainly you have to be in certain groups or willing to jump around to move up. The groups I have been apart of the leadership did not push hard enough for the team members to receive promotions or even put forth a plan to do so.
good,"The team here is so young, and loved to work with each and everyone here. Employees here give you a lot of freedom and are open to suggestions and criticize when necessary."
good,"A great company with outstanding benefits. A positive work invironment with an emphasis on team work. The salaries are vey competitive. However, management tends to micro-manage employees."
good,"Its not so good when you're temporary because you don't know if you're going to be hired permanently or let go, but overall its a really good place to work."
good,Management is super nice and helpful. There is definitely room to grown into higher positions. Employees are considered first for positions within the company.
good,"I loved working here! I got to do pretty much everything from network, security, phones, wan, lan. I learned a lot about mpls here. The management was great,  the people where great. The hardest part was leaving when we got outsourced. And some long nights doing datacenter moves and recabling."
good,I have learned many new skills in this fast paced environment.  I have enjoyed working with my immediate supervisor.  Conditions are clean and climate controlled.  Team atmosphere
good,"Great job to work at. Also great benefits. Management was very fair. If you need any help with solving any cases, it will be plenty of support from the floor to help you."
good,"you will be rewarded for your hard work and management will treat you with respect. be prepared for overtime although it is rarely mandatory. should be familiar with basic receiving procedures to be successful, i would not recommend this job for those without prior warehouse experience."
good,I worked in the Dropship Department and did a specific job took a lower pay cut to be in that position. But then after a few months they started adding on new tasks and additional work and we never got paid for the extra work.
good,"Not a bad job, i just did transfer and i lost my current salary back to were i started 4 years ago and they doesnt seems to care."
good,"Great place to work for benefits, salary and job security. Communication is a problem as the middle management gets put under lots of stress with upper management and clients. Information doesn't always get conveyed to the associates they manage."
good,This company is a bit fast paced but it also provides challenge. There is room to grow and learn. They have so many programs in order for you to climb the ladder in your career.
good,"AmerisourceBergen's HR team was made up of wonderful, friendly & talented individuals. My team was led by a veteran of 30+ years, and she wasn't comfortable delegating or empowering her staff - everything went through her. My experience might differ from what it's like now or what it's like on other teams, but I struggled with staying challenged in a slow & laid back environment."
good,"No job security, you can be laid- off at any given time. And the company does not let you move to open positions within.  You have to apply for open jobs like a new employee."
good,"Overall a great place to work.  A team atmosphere.  Benefits, peers and associates are definitely a plus.  Look forward to going to work each day.  Low stress most of the time."
good,Hard working  daily. ...a lot  of stuff received and putting away. We do those received items picking and shipping  for customers. According to this daily job I give 145 characters.
good,"In the years that I worked with the company, I was able to enjoy my interaction with the patients.  It is a rewarding job, however it is very fast paced and repetitive."
good,"interesting work, the training could have been more extensive to make the associates more valuable to the company or future employers. more computer based training would have been great."
good,worked 7-3:30 M-F Worked with Customer files ( keeping them Current) Making sure our building is in Compliance.  Speaking with customer when needed and satisfying what they needed to know. Working with others in my department and when needed in the warehouse.  Work place is good and everyone seems to get along with others. Management very helpful when needed.
good,"*job security"
good,"AmerisourceBergen rewards associates that want to work with an incentive program. The harder you work, the more you can be  paid at the end of a work week."
good,Was a great place to work for.  Management and co-workers are good supporters witting your area of responsibility. Highly Recommend this company. Would love to work for them again.
good,"Worked here for a few years, the team you are on will determine your experience.  I had the pleasure of being on some good teams with great management.  HR is very slow and the overall culture could use some improvement."
good,Great company and benefits. The workplace culture is positive and mature. One of the cons is that their doesn't seem to be any consistency in operations with how things are managed. What is said to be wrong today is ok to do tomorrow.
good,"Company was bought out. When Amerisource owned what is now Arxium, things were much better. You had the backing of a multi-billion dollar company. So things were not always focused on revenue. Plus job security was always there."
good,Great place to learn drug distribution management.  US and Canada focused--very little international opportunity.  Strong operations and growth model.
good,"This company is growing, the medical benefits are awesome and the environment is currently being diversified. Company offers a lot of perks. I love that they promote from within and constantly assign other job duties; they won't compensate you for it, but it makes you more marketable and it's great exposure. It's easy to advance if you network with the correct coworkers."
good,Collaborative and very team focused.  Highly recommend as a place to work.  Always looking for innovative approaches and advances to improve revenue and deliverables.
good,"Potentially long hours depending on worker attendance, turnover, and work pace."
good,Great job to work for as long as you do not fall victim to office politics.  Awesome mentoring program and great opportunity for advancement.  Workplace can be stressful at times.
good,"I only worked for ABC for 6 weeks on a contract, but would definitely like to work there permanently. Great management, very personable. Great location, new building. Soda, coffee, Ice/water machine. Lots of break rooms and nice lunch room with over 20 microwaves. Restrooms have seat covers and are cleaned throughout the day."
good,"Call center so often busy environment,good location.The department I'm in is a charitable organization where we provide assistance to patient to help with medication payment so the hardest part is if there is no funds and you have to tell a patients you can not assist him/her."
good,"The company has below average compensation but it gives great benefits. Management is good and there are many opportunities to move up or make some OT. The only downsize for me was the culture.  I could not seems to fit in with the rest though I got along with them just fine. The coworkers are nice and helpful but they  are very close minded and afraid to try new things, they lived in a bubble and I do not ""believe"" I am that type of person."
good,"A very professional environment to work in. However, the strict timelines the employees work with do force one to feel the stress once in a while"
good,Amerisourcebergen is good place to work . Good professional environment is maintained at this place. Learning and sharing is the feature of this company .
good,There were lots of opportunities for growth at Amerisource Bergen but as the company changed executive persons it was apparent that this was not where I would be able to retire from.  Co-workers helped where they could but the expectation of job completion is not something that can be accomplished.  I wish luck to all that work for this company.  I was happy at the beginning but later it showed a different side to the story.
good,"Amerisource bergen has some of the best people to work with. People mostly just want to be able to finish their work. You don't have a lot of people who are a pain to work with when you need something done. In addition, the people here are not difficult to have a conversation with. The upper management also  does a good job at ensuring that the office has what it needs to thrive. Overall good place to work."
good,Amerisource is a rapidly growing company full of promise that offers competitive pay and a great benefits package.  With expansions in the global market it is a company to watch for years to come.
good,Very fast paced and lots of over time.  Receive incentive for my job performance on each pay check.  Lots of walking on each shift.
good,"The best part about AmerisourceBergen is the insurance. They have an amazing health/vision/dental plan, 401k is great, and we have 20 vacation days a year. I have learned what it is like to be a member of a winning team. We rank best in our division basically every year. The management is pretty good here. They come by and ask how you are doing every day and seem to be pretty knowledgeable. My co-workers are kinda a mixed bag since we have a lot of people and that means a lot of mixed personalities. I get along with all of them but I could see how some of them could make things difficult at times. The hardest part of the job for me is the hours. I go into work at 5pm and don't know when I will get off. The most enjoyable part is the week seems to fly by because I am so busy when I am there. I pretty well run through my week."
good,"It was a good place to live but I hated flu season. benefits were good and it paid well. It was a decent work environment, but I didn't like not knowing when I was going home."
good,"AmerisourceBergen is a home felt company, everything and everybody is pretty much laid back. Everyone's #1 goal is to be productive."
good,I think this is a wonderful company to work for. The pay is great. Location is great. And the company is still growing! All of the managers and supervisors are awesome
good,A typical day for me is very busy. I love being productive and staying busy.  This is probably the most challenging part of my job as well. I have to be very organized and detail oriented so that I am sure not to miss anything.  I love helping people and this job entails helping people start a new career. That is the most enjoyable part for me!
good,"I loved working for this company as a Part time saesonal agent. I became full time and it seems like the dynamic changed, The company has great benfits and employee to emploee culture is great."
good,"Very fast paced work environment, the day flies by. Good group of co-workers and management."
good,Great benefits and bonus payouts. Flexible work schedule. Unlimited overtime if you like to work alot of overtime. Secure workplace.
good,AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services is a good entry level position.
good,"I spent the day on the phone handling various pharmacy issues such as claim rejections and reimbursement issues just to name a few."
good,ever changing company with great benefits. Great education reimbursements.  Clean safe work environment.
good,"I work with an excellent team of pharmacy technicians; for a small team we are able to process with speed and accuracy our patient, doctor, hospital, and specialty program referrals for all national locations. I learned to lead a team and become more ""politically correct"" when I became lead. I learned to conduct meetings and work with a wide range of personalities. I know how to conduct myself in any setting with the appropriate amount of diplomacy and tact. Management is the only issue I highly question. As a team of licensed and registered pharmacy technicians our manager has no pharmacy experience only secretarial experience from the information I received but has been with the company for an extended amount of time. It is my observation that this is what causes tension among the team especially for highly questionable processes, some instances these issues do need to be handled immediately but orders are to wait. This causes more problems down the line and becomes our responsibility. The sporadic consequences to random issues causes confusion among the team. I have appealed this issue to upper management but in response I received subtle constant pressure on my role. I concluded to resign and spend my time completing my higher education. I would still go back and work for the company. "
good,This company has proven stable through the economy with little to no lay offs or cut backs. 
good,"Although we work and 12 hrs a day,but it does full fill your need and clear weekends off for your life."
good,Working here is fine. I do not wish to dispell company information right now.
good,"Positive moral, productive environment, fun relaxed people and warm easy going people. Work is tytpical, stay focused, get your assignments done and be serious and have a smile. The hardest part of the job is that it's corporate and it's a 9-5 desk job.The most enjoyable part of the job is that people have a postive attitude and mind their own business. You will get what you can from what you put in."
good,A typical day at work is reviewing customer invoices to make sure the customers received the correct pricing and to correct any errors. Address vendor email inquiries and phone calls.
good,"Overall great company; I am looking to further my career. I enjoy the daily interaction with co-workers and the ability to think ""outside the box."""
good,Good place to work with caring supervisors. Helpful in many aspects and a nice place to work everyday
good,"A typical day at work consist of me coming me completing my work and requesting more. At this current job I learn about benefits and different diseases. Management can be better by focusing on more important issues. My co workers are good people for the most part, very caring, sincere and smart. The hardest part of the job is the down time, it can become very boring and irritating. The most enjoyable part of the Job is hearing the patients joy and satisfaction."
good,The job place can be very clicky the good we all worked together as a team. When someone fell behind in there job the team would come together and help one another
good,Great place to work.  Great advancement Opportunities. Rapidly growing company. Lots to learn and know.  Fast paced environment.  Many different positions available.
good,"The job was rewarding. Having the ability to assist patients that have illnesses and needs certain meds. The job of verifying benefits becomes more intense. Knowing that one med can cost 10k or more for one dosage seems extreme, but necessary. I enjoyed going to work..."
good,"I would come in to work and do my job everyday, if my manager needed me he would send and email. I loved the size of the desk space too. enough for people to leave you alone."
good,"Great place to start career. Turnover rate entirely too high.  I was unexpectedly laid off after three years working there.  Just walked in, and out of a job, just like that."
good,"AmerisourceBergen, has a very beautiful facility and they allow you to be a part of their beautiful garden and area outdoors to grow beautiful flowers and walking in this nice atmosphere."
good,great place to work.  Offered great pay and very well put together.  They always took care of staff temp and permanent.  During peak season they always feed the staff member to not worry about lunch.
good,"I worked with a fun group of guys which  made the nights go by quickly.  The benefits offered had exceeded my expectations.  They offered, health, dental, life insurances, retirement plan and even insurance coverage for your pet.  They give you ample time off right after completing your 90 days.  I was impressed with the  multiple locations through out the  county and I felt that they would work with me if I wanted to relocate.  I resigned from my position due to my wife relocating to VA for her job.  Unfortunately, there was not a distribution center close to our home where I could transfer.  I would recommend this company as a great place to work."
good,It was a great company to work for! Great pay and fair work ethics! Everything was pretty simple and very professional. I would recommend working there
good,"In my time at Amerisource I have done just about every task and have worked in two different locations. The benefits are great, the pay is about average until you start earning incentive which is easy if you are a motivated individual."
good,I have nothing but great things to say about my bosses! My coworkers were fantastic and the overall environment was the best I have worked at. You were allowed to bring your dogs to work
good,"outbiund calls to verify insurance, easy work. Gained skill in specialty pharmacy medication. Offered catered lunch 3 times a week. If you are a stellar employee it is easy to grow within the company,"
good,Loved working this job. I have a great deal of responsabilitty and managed many good assosciates. I did so many new and intresting job task while here.
good,"You have to be able to keep up with your metrics, but you also have to strive for accuracy. Otherwise, you will be let go! I had 100% accuracy every month I was there, but my metrics weren't high enough and I was let go at Christmas."
good,Nice place to work. management was fair. Worked in CSS department and operated like a call center. Great benefit. career opportunities available. overall great experience.
good,Overall the position was fundamental and professionally operated. The hours and pay were exceptional well. The position was very tedious but it was a stepping stone to advancing my experience.
good,"•	Unload merchandise from warehouse truck."
good,Daily production environment was very busy with some access only areas for security reasons. Enjoyed the positions held starting as a night team member for picking orders then moved on to returns and excess inventory control team then finally in the data processing room. Best part of job was the size of work force with everyone knowing each other. It was very high paced and the shifts went fast with always having something to do.
good,"They were going through leadership changes which made for uncertainties with job security, but overall its a great company. Had awesome employee benefits."
good,the job was easy and laid back you were just constantly busy. hours sucked at times due to there being a lot of overtime and we had to stay extra hours during the week.
good,AmerisoureBergen is a great place to work. They are no longer in our area but besides that a position with them offers plenty of room for advancement if the opportunity arises.
good,"This was only a temp job, my opinion is not really applicable.  From what I saw the full time employees were happy there, but they were not hiring any full time employees at that time only temporary staff that did not receive benefits of any kind."
good,Some work days were long and hard.Orders must be completed before the shift is deemed done. It was a  wholesale distribution center. It was always busy
good,"A typical day at work for me. I clock in and I try to get right to work always working safe and fast . I learned to try to be patient with people.Workplace culture is usually strong, fun,positive and well communicated. Good Management respects there employees and good communication. The headrest part of a job for me is forget to take breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with good people."
good,Working here at Amerisource Bergen has taught me a lot about the Pharmaceutical Industry and how. Important it is for patients to. Receive their medication In A timely manner and at a reasonable price.
good,"Overall, I found AmerisourceBergen to be a business of high integrity and quite forward in thinking, although with some limitations. A typical day includes reaching out to contacts or receiving incoming calls primarily from patients/caregivers, physicians or pharmacists.

In 3 months i've seen about 8 promotions amongst my co workers."
good,"Set schedule, Easy job. More physical as in standing and moving. Not many changes besides moving areas of work. they also certify on power equipment. Variety of people and races.

If there were any problems or we did not understand something everyone there is really helpful and i loved it.

These days were nice because it was running ad hoc aging from Crystal Reports minimum of twice per week, however, I ran more to see what cash posted to perform offsets and work new deductions.  These positions gave me my foundation in finance and allowed my career to grow. We were divided into teams by Team Leader and Supervisors.  The camaraderie between all of us was truly remarkable.  We enjoyed not only the professional workplace and the results proved this to our clients, and we enjoyed personal relationships and celebrated each other.  The hardest part of my job was assisting in writing a training manual for our department from scratch because one never existed.  It allowed for me to realize how meticulous our daily functions are, especially ensuring all regulations were being followed properly for federal and auditing purposes.  I enjoyed receiving letters of praise for the work performed and being rewarded for such efforts.  I would go above and beyond for my clients and to have them show their appreciation was just a humbling experience."

good,I love working for the company! There is so much room for growth. I am just on a terrible team with a terrible manager that acts like she is afraid to stand up and defend me when it comes to these women picking and bullying me.

good,"AmerisourceBergen (they also call themselves ""ABC"") is pretty strict about workers gossiping or speaking among themselves. They promote isolation and solo work by assigning/separating pharmacy technicians to their own ""stations"" (each station is specific to a specific popular drug). What I would love about this work place is that I didn't have to engage in toxic work drama and I would work by myself. They allow you to listen to music, but one ear only because  of safety issues. "

Further, I answer the Sales Rep Hotline addressing any issues and escalating any problems to upper management. I also assist in completing cases when my team is in a back log. There is a 4 h turn round time to complete each case, so meeting our metrics is vital. I lead by example when it comes to customer service; I believe it’s the most important quality that keeps an organization in business. Equally important I have passion for my job knowing I help a patient maintain and sustain his or her health. The only caveat is there is no room for growth in terms of management which is what I would love to do in the near future."

good,Good company
good,"Fast paced job that required close attention to detail. Very satisfying when job is finished. I learned about packing products for best shipping overall. Also learned about what pharmaceuticals were used for what. Supervisors were usually promoted from within giving them advanced knowledge of polices and procedures . New upper management brought with them an educated attitude about keeping the bottom line at eye level, an over enthusiastic need for the less opinionated more youthful employee . Hardest part was definitely working long hours, third shift. The best part was having the chance to walk all night ,staying busy, making the time fly."

This was a demanding job and the urgency in finding product provided a daily challenge, which I loved. Being the main contact for the bigger hospitals due to my customer service skills and follow through for our most demanding requests, this was by far my most rewarding job. I tend to take more difficult customers under my wing, at any job, and find a way to relate to them and cater to their requests if need be.  Amerisource merged with Bergen and moved to Chicago, so they no longer exist in Mishawaka. However, I am still friends with a lot of my co-workers, as we were a close knit ""family""."
