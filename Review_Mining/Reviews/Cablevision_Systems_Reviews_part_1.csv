bad,"This piece of garbage job transferred from Cablevision/Optimum, wtvr to Altice they LITERALLY used dozens of not maybe hundreds of people (including myself) who are just looking to just support their family by hiring younger workforce (temporarily) while they make the work excruciating for the people with seniority and force them to leave or retire then they lay you off but before that they do everything in their power to make you so angry and miserable you will end up quitting so they do not have to pay you a severance package which wouldn’t be much of anything anyway since you just started. If you want to waste a year or more of your life and be used, make nothing, deal with meetings about why you spent 5 minutes in the bathroom during the span of a 10+ Hr day when it takes almost 2 minutes just to walk to the bathroom if this is what you want apply here, be lied to, messed with, picked on, harassed, used, and tossed out the door like a piece of thrash that they consider you anyway."
bad,was not a fit for someone who was trying to take care of a family. pay was not up to par on what the company expected of you and the mental and physical stress you went through on a daily basis.
bad,"They are not the worst out there but they are not the best either. "
bad,"I do not recommend this corporation . I do suggest that you apply to a company that does appreciate you , that does treat you fairly and with respect .  That does treat you like you are a human being and not a number .    I found that through all my years at CV I was held back and never taken seriously .  Does not matter how many hours you give them , they are a machine that keeps draining you . There is no reward in the end ."
bad,This job culture was stressful and cut-throat.  Management staff does not mentor nor promote fairly. Management impedes outward growth and retards inward growth to other departments
bad,I discussed it prior.  I do not have any positive things to say about this slave driving company.  They lack compassion for employees.  FAVORITISM FAVORITISM FAVORITISM.
bad,"There's a reason it's called CablePrison. ""Senior"" reps refuse to take escalated calls, reps drink on the job, and spend their measly 30 minute lunch break getting high.  I suppose you'd have to be stoned to get through a shift here, though."
bad,"Plain and simple, i was a door to door salesperson, or “professional door knocker”, not what i envisioned when i got my 4 year degree! Ugh! "
bad,"Job wasn't horrible, you went from customers home to home fixing or installing their cable. Very physically demanding, long hours, and were often made to work overtime without choice."
good,"Only interested in the bottom-line. During severe storm, I was asked to stay out longer by supervisor and get more sales. Numbers more important than employee's safety."
good,"For my position you are expected to do customer support. You will come across many rude customers. If you can handle that, you will be fine."
good,Customer service primary job is on the phone. people argue with you when they do not pay the bill and can not watch tv Very irate at times. But you have to deal with it
good,A typical day at work was sooth I got along with all the customers and my co-workers. I learned how to use a new system and my manager was very patient with me. The hardest part of the job was getting along with certain management when they weren't being fair. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people i love that it really made my day.
good,"Customer Service department was full of amazing people with a lot of energy, however fast paced environment with statistics involved med accomplishing tasks difficult."
good,"i worked as an inbound sales rep, selling cable tv/internet/phone. the company had great benefits, but i felt towards the end of my time there, you were set up for failure"
good,"Pay was more than competitive however some micro-management was forced down from the top level. Stressful environment, but if you're okay with customers complaining in your ear for 40+ hours a week you should be fine!"
good,"Not a bad place to work. But no where near great. Free cable if you live in a Cablevision area. Free Benefits. That was great. But with a very low wage for the work you are doing and the lack of overtime to make up for the low hourly wage, it puts it towards the bottom of the pile as far as jobs go."
good,i wanted to advance in the company after being a temp under winston staffing for over a year but its difficult to get picked up as an employee i was not making enough money for the time spent
good,Warnaco was a great company to work for. The only reason I left was because they filed for bankruptcy. The best part of the job was the opportunity foradvancement.
good,"You spend a couple hours in the office and the remainder of time is spent in the field. The Training is continuous so you lean a lot. Management is very structured. Professional, respectful, and fun workplace culture .Meeting quota is the hardest part of the job and exceeding quota is the most enjoyable."
good,Typical day included scheduling crew and handling any customer complaints that may come in.  Responsible for quality control and worked with upper management to ensure that all customers were satisfied.
good,The environment was nice and competitive in a good way. There were always incentives for your hard & encouragement of you weren't doing well. All upper management made you feel that you were more than just a worker.
good,"Cablevision Systems was acquired by Altice in 2015. Prior to the acquisition it was a great company. As a large company it was run like a family business, great culture, and a great environment to work. I never worked for Altice so I couldn’t say how it is today."
good,Love my job but due to overall union activities and lack of my progression I feel stuck... Other than that I loved interacting with customers and resolving all their issues. Working in extreme cold or heat conditions were tough but still got around to getting work done. My team was tight for the most part and management always gave techs a voice for the most part.
good,"A typical day at work was time management between customer's phone calls/complaints. Resolving issues of billing, Services, coordinating between different departments to resolve issues to customers satisfaction. In Spanish/English."
good,"I love their benefits and pay."
good,"Coaching and mentoring team members along with quality monitoring to meet KPI performance goals.  "
good,"Great company to work for.  I enjoyed the people and the opportunities I had there.  I learned a great del including email marking, website design, cross channel TV spots, radio, social media, tactical reporting and more."
good,"I worked in the NOC at a high level and with many other teams, so my experience is going to be very different from a field installer, an ISP/OSP technician or someone in the ROC."
good,No longer work there since 2013. It has change since I left and has a different working process. It is no longer a family company since it was sold to another business owner.
good,"A typical day at work was very fulfilling. I learned a lot about the phone, internet and cable business. Coworkers were the absolute best. I miss working for this company."
good,"Great training program. 3 weeks in class environment. Excellent products and support. Always moving forward with cutting edge technology. Typical work week. Report to office for Sales meetings or product knowledge training. Assigned quarterly territory (Rotated). Usually out and cold calling on business's by 9.30 / 10am on customers with competitive service(s). All orders were processed through Ipad (on the spot). Superb technology that allowed the Sales rep to see all businesses, products they already had or if they did not have service. Could enter order, update notes etc directly on Ipad. Rep had all the tools necessary to be effective in the field including tech support and order entry departments."
good,"Cablevision is a great company to work for in many ways. The compensation, benefits, and management make it a pleasure to work for. While I am currently no longer with them, I am seriously considering coming back."
good,"Good Family Company, great co-workers, great management team."
good,"Competitive, and fast paced. Room for improvement is always available. Chances for advancement as well. A lot of stress due to no flexible time off when needed randomly. Time is chosen through a database and is first come first serve."
good,"Great working environment, coworkers, training, benefits and pay. Enjoyed working and helping a diverse group of people. Flexible hours and great discounts on third party vendors."
good,"I enjoyed working for Cablevision very much. I was taught how large operating systems worked, how to operate a forklift and supervise  shipping and receiving of equipment and how health care/401k can benefit employees."
good,"Was great while the Dolan's owned it, it sucks under Altice. I meet a lot of wonder people and was compensated well. I loved that I had free cable, phone and internet."

good,"work with cablevision 15 years and I love working there we all had our good time and bad but we all work together as a team and help each other out specially the sales reps we all they them out as much as we could and our manager and boss was there to help our the sales coordinator I learn a lot and got to meet new  people that came to talk to us on the meetings that they would have with the sales reps the only hard part of the jobs was went the boss or manager ask to run a report before he would come in to the office  I love went at the end of the week the boss and manager would take us out to"
good,"A typical day would require checking in and out equipment, vehicle maintenance, and installing or repairing home cable systems. The hardest part of the job is keeping a timely schedule as unexpected and often difficult technical situations arise, which could potentially push a pre-existing schedule further than the day. Depending on the outlook, this could be beneficial for one who likes over time while at the same time could be negative for those who prefer to clock out on a timely schedule."
good,"Good Company. You can build a life on that career. Excellent compensation, great benefits. But the only added stress is you have to meet your metrics EVERY MONTH."
good,"handle Outages as they come in ,that may Consist of RF,AC short or main Power related ,work on NID [NOISE] on node"

good,Cablevision was a respectful and productive environment with many talented leaders and innovators. The products were cutting edge and the implementation was exciting and rewarding.
good,I worked for Cablevision  for 13 years it was the most rewarding experience I have encountered. Had I not been layer off I would have continued to work their. This company supports employees who want to self promote and you where always rewarded  and recognized  for a job well done or new idea. I would defiantly work for the Dolan family again should an opportunity arise.

good,"Being a people person, I enjoyed the constant interaction with customers via phone. Every incoming call came with another unique personality and another chance to provide an excellent customer experience. I learned to empathize with others working here. Management was always accessible during most of the day. My co-workers were amazing. I developed lifelong friendships and these friendships made it easier to show up everyday and give it my all. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer no."

good,Really enjoyed working for the company. The people that worked there made it a great place to learn and grow with. I would still be working there if they did not downsize.
