rating,review
bad,"I hated having to follow the same script every day, when I knew what the answer was, it was boring. "
bad,"It was a great place to work while the call center was open.  Great employee retention and work environment.  I would go back in a minute if they ever opened it again,"
bad,"AOL was a great company to work for, until people left dial up for broadband in droves. AOL really tried to make broadband available but, the DSL and Cable companies would not share the pipeline. They were sneaky about closing us down."
bad,There is no opportunity for advancement only if you know somebody important in the company. No rules for dress code so environment became very distracting.
bad,"BPO 1st company."
bad,You can be doing your work exactly how they asked you to do so but if they change their minds on how to do it one day then they don’t need you and fire you.
bad,"The company policies do not reflect any interest in genuinely serving its customers.  The company will do anything to retain a customer including lying to them, but never actually providing good service.  There were banners and posters everywhere promoting the views and quotes of the CEO.  There were pep rallies.  In all it felt like brain washing such as one would expect in a cult.  The employees dedicated to retaining customers were well paid, all they had to do was lie enough to the customer to keep them from cancelling their service.  The technical support technicians were poorly paid and discouraged from actually taking sufficient time to resolve customer's issues.  The tech's who were viewed as the best performers were ones who had almost no technical knowledge but followed scripts and got customers off the phone the most quickly by any means necessary.  Some of the management would escalate calls from being a customer with minor problem to a level of hostility on both ends that was shocking to say the least."
bad,How would you like customers yelling at you every day while your supervisor laughs?!
bad,"AOL closed its US based call centers to only keep its foreign based call centers to save overall money. Many customers constantly complained about the call center employees that did not speak English clearly. AOL bases its decisions on not how well a person does, but how well they meet their statistical results of the calls taken in a given day."
bad,"Too much politics - extremely poor leadership."
bad,"Extremely disorganized and poorly managed company. Consistently reprimanded due to serious lack of communication. The pay is fantastic, but the office culture and the way you feel at the end of what can be a VERY long day (I once worked 6 a.m - 9 p.m) is just not worth it."
bad,The amount of overtime and perks you get for working for this company was the best. The hardest part of the job was they did care about fixing the customer issue but the numbers of calls I take in a hour. Maybe that is why they are no longer relevant.
bad,Worked at this job a long time ago and cannot recall to much about it to write this critique.
bad,"Faults are too numerous for the space allowed, but here goes:"
bad,"When I was first hired, they told me there's tons of room to advance and that there's lots of creative freedom. Neither are true. They don't pay well, they know you're expendable, and they're not at all organized. I've completely stopped putting effort into my work with this company because there's no reward or motivation."
bad,"No job security, they lied to customers  and departments close down every week."
bad,i don't remember much it was along time ago . I used to take incoming calls for aol tech support i would basically enter info into computer and it would give me trouble shooting techniques
bad,Manager not open nor friendly. Very stand-offish. Focused on the work on the managers plate and not worried about helping employees to get information or help. Did not care for the consultants on the team.
bad,"Take calls."
bad,"Politics, bad management, not so good pay."
bad,"AOL was losing 10,000 customers a month.  We were contracted to help retain customers and build relationships.  I would not recommend working for this company if it is still around."
bad,"I was a sales rep working in an office in Gainesville, FL at the the time.  We sold magazines or renewed subscriptions to a targeted clientele.  These magazines ranged from Sports Illustrated, TIME and cook books.  The more you sold or the more renewals you got.  The more bonuses you hit.  It felt like a NYSE in their.  Just loud and annoying.  It was easy money for a college student at the time."
bad,"A typical work day for me started in the implementation of integrated marketing acquisition and retention plans. "
bad,this was my first call center experience.  Taking inbound retention calls for a Canadian ISP
bad,Too stressful.  Most people didn't last longer than six months. Unfair metrics impossible to achieve without cheating.  Business practices seemed a bit sketchy at times.
bad,"At that time, the company was a bit of a mess.  They were trying to manage the west coast resources.  It was a bit of  a struggle to incorporate with headquarters.  It didn't work out."
bad,AOL has some of the best minds in the business focused on delivering relevant content to it's mass audience.  Finding the right part of the business for you can be a challenge.
bad,"AOL is a great place to work if you love cliques and gossiping amongst teams. If you don't fit in with your coworkers be prepared to be casted as an outsider."
bad,"preferred time warner before aol bought them out. time warner was about the customer, aol was about the gadgets"
bad,Operating within this company structure was challenging. Teams competed for agendas and individuals competed for recognition and promotions. The mission was not clear but the work was fun.
bad,I worked for AOL during a positive yet challenging transition period during which it became clear the company had lost its focus. Since then it has been merged into Verizon.
bad,"Grosse journée dans ce grand domaine. Beaucoup d'enfants à gérer, et beaucoup d'animateurs pour cette structure. "
bad,"I left a stable job to work with AOL because they were hot, had great people and a great culture.  Two months later I was told my position was eliminated.  Thanks for hiring me to begin with..."
bad,"Contituous reorganizations, extended work hours, great cooworkers and team work however,"
bad,Everything you feared was true but worse. An ad agency masquerading as a product company.
bad,"I was a HIgh Speed Retention Specialist at AOL and was one of the top 50 in the world.  In it's time, AOL was a great thing to have, however, the company for the most part is now gone, no longer in Tucson. Other companies such as COX, Comcast, etc... offered a better High Speed Product."
good,"Great people to be with targets set can be a little ambitious "
good,Not one of my favorite employers. Hard-working low-level employees but top level managers are disconnected with staff.
good,AOL (now part of Oath) has many products in their profile.  Oath is a fast paced environment trying to bring the best user experience to their customers.
good,AOL was at it's heyday the amazing place to work however I came in at a time of the slow death spiral. They have a chance to stay afloat but it is not going to be easy.
good,My time at AOL is not complete. Not much was going on. Most of the day was  talking on the phone about internet accounts and billing. Most days was short because of lack of work
good,"I worked there during the dot com boom.  "
good,Culture was formal and stuffy.  Executive HR Leadership was way too controlling.  Micromanagement comes to mind. Great benefits and great prices.  Salary was very low.
good,Be prepared to fight for your job. Unhappy co-workers. New hires on-boarding daily. Valuable employees leave for better opportunities. Company is relocating in the near future.
good,The was ok - very dynamic and the direction changes quite a bit.   Hard to make progress.
good,"Very big company which makes it hard to advance in some positions. Best part of the job is the people, which makes being at work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was not getting more resources when needed, even when over performing."
good,AOL has a culture of blame. They have lots of meeting to point out failures. Layoffs are alive and well at this company. Turn over is constant. I would not work there again.
good,Focus of company at this time is to cut cost by whatever means necessary.  There is little to no room for advancement even when someone at a higher level leaves.  Normally if someone leaves at a higher level their role will either get absorbed by another team or they will be replaced by a lower level employee.  Expectations are very high and the hours are very long.  Management - it depends on who your work and would recommend you interview both your supervisor and peers.
good,"- 12 hour work days"
good,"I have been employed on internship basis within a Goviral for 3 months. It was during Christmas period when the company was busy and needed an extra help with no possibility to extend the contract. "
good,"mise en place du service ,service des repas aux enfants,plonge et nettoyage du réfectoire!"
good,"AOL als Arbeitgeber war klasse, leider wurden wir 4 x verkauft und somit ist die Situation nicht mehr angenehm."
good,Accent mis sur l'autonomie et la prise de décision
good,AOL employees always treated Ricoh staff as family. Everyone was always happy and helpful.The AOL employee culture was my favorite part of the job. AOL allows their employees to have a free spirit and be themselves.
good,"Job was ok, but too much pressure to send callers to third party vendors to try to sell them products.  More emphasis was on this than on actual customer service."
good,"AOL is a interesting place to work. In my organization, people are more technical including managers.  We used to have a lot of learning opportunities and fun activities.   But it is very hard, close to zero to advance career."
good,I worked as Tech Support on the phones.  I assisted customers in repairing their software to be able to utilize the internet.  I enjoyed helping the customers very much and gave excellent customer service each and every call.
good,I loved helping customers but did not like all the stress that was placed on us. I do however feel it gave me the opportunity to learn many new skills.
good,Might have been a good company before but was already on a downslide when I worked there in 2005
good,"Great culture and people, but management runs the ISO team like a chop-shop. The product is way too over-priced and under-performing for small businesses."
good,"Iam too fast and concentrate much on Accuracy as well. Interested to meet new people, thus mingles with them easily. Grasp the situation very fast"
good,"I've been gone from AOL for far to long to know how things are there now, it used to be a very driven company, oncall time was always difficult and everyone was always under the gun for a project, an outage or both."
good,"All companies go through change, and many like to rally around it as a battle cry. AOL takes change to the next level, in that the next change comes about before the org has finished absorbing the last one. To succeed here, you must be extremely flexible in your expectations and tolerance for change, being willing to change course rapidly without getting too hung up on the former direction. You may have one manager in three years, or three managers in one year. The org is constantly flexing, as are key initiatives and job descriptions. It's quite possible to be successful, as long as you are extremely flexible and resiliant."
good,"It is AOL. Are you surprised it still exists? Well, it does and it has a controlling interest in many of the web pubs you digest daily, including HuffPo, Engadget and more."
good,Each different department that I worked in was very different and provided different experiences. Some of them were absolutely terrible but others were amazing jobs I loved.
good,Try to be positive as much as you can.  Be alert of any questions as to issues with systems will have your bonuses taken away so all work you have done can be taken
good,"Really depends on your manager.  Each department head has a lot of autonomy and some jobs overlap.  HR doesn't seem to make any effort to make sure this doesn't happen.  In some teams the work is up for grabs and the person that volunteers the most is the star.  Some teams are run very well by great managers.  Lots of nice social events, casual and free beverages/snacks depending on the location."
good,Verizon bought AOL and then Yahoo. Most of AOL has been let-go or left voluntarily. The culture has changed for the worse and there is no stability. Layoffs every 3-4 months.
good,fast paced work environment 1hour lunch breaks average pay all of the workers got along very well. sort of off busline so maybe a ten minute walk to work if you dont drive
good,"Acquisitions usually end in layoffs of acquired companies, this is what happened with our entire org and many other companies. There is very little consistency with all the changes."
good,"I was employeed in this company when there was call center in existence.  Since I left, this call center shut down as the company was losing its market due to high speed competition."
good,"Nothing special anymore, I was there during the good times, they need to innovate and attract good, talented people to move forward.  Hope they can manage it."
good,"A job, when computers were the king of electronics, everyone had to have one, then they needed to get online. Working with technical support the software of AOL needed to be understood as much as the system of communication. The system was one of, listen, ask, provide answers in the form of technical support, and of course be polite, Understanding the customer, technical knowledge, and provide timely service was required."
good,"I learnt so many things in Aol, I am from commerce background and did not know about the technical knowledge. While working in AOL Igot the opportunity to learn the first level support."
good,Working daily with my team to help them better serve their clients and help them grow and develop their professional skills.  Continually working with the client management team to always improve and refine the services we provide and uncover opportunities for us to provide additional services.
good,"fast paced busy environment to work in with free drinks. celebrities usually come in the office, friendly staff, long days and nights."
good,"offers a good help desk roll"
good,"Working at this place was fun. "
good,They had a ping pong table outside for employees to use during breaks.
good,Top notch sales and customer service training. Although I didn't love my job at the time I look back on this place and appreciate how much the company invested in the employees. Aol tried to help balance work and family life with very flexible schedule and vacation times. They also provided some of the best customer service and sales training in the Industry. I still you use these techniques almost 10 years later great fundamentals.
good,Pay was lower than other positions in the call center. Had to worry about managment having it out for you.
good,This is your normal day to day call center. Great training. Lots of room to move up.
good,AOL was a great company during its time.  Broadband changed the scope of this company.
good,"A typical day at AOL does not exist, there is a sense of the start-up in the organisation which leads to an excellent sense of expectation and sense of freedom but also failure due to its size, poor management (in the UK) and politics.  My co-workers however at the mid and lower levels of the company are talented, tenacious, patient and above all excellent up stream managers, it is thanks to them that there continues to be such great partnerships across the business.  The hardest part of the job is to remain motivated and focused whilst strategy is changed relentlessly and restructuring is undertaken every 6 months at least.  The most enjoyable aspect is the freedom that is granted, and if used wisely can under wraps, yield excellent results."
good,Inbound call center provding customer service to aol members.  Became employee of the month.
good,AOL offered abundant opportunities via ever-changing roles and internal organizational structures that allowed for greater learning and diversified skillsets
good,a typical day at work would be dealing with customers handling billing . I learn that having a good attitude and being patient is the key. management was ok they were there if you needed them. my co workers were happy had great energy. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer. the most enjoying part was helping the customer and making them happy
good,I would answer calls from America Online customers who were having problems with the AOL software. I would troubleshoot their issues and get them up and running again
good,Overall good place to work for. The benefits package was outstanding.
good,Working with a 3rd party on AOL client was very nice.
good,The best thing about AOL/Patch is the people. They only hire the best of the best and the energy is incredibly motivating.
good,"The commissions were excellent, staff was great - the job was grueling though. This place got shut down after the project was outsourced to India. Not much else to say."
good,"Overall a fun environment to work for. The company always had promotions, sweepstakes and challenges for it's employees to try and achieve by meeting and exceeding goals."
good,"Enjoyed working for Patch.com very much, the work was right up my ally."
good,Loved working at AOL - was a great first job out of college. I learned a ton about marketing there from great people. The issue with working at AOL during the time I did was the company was rapidly losing steam. Layoffs happened every six months and you were always afraid the next time would be your time.
good,"Overall, the work here was incredibly stimulating and satisfying.  There was great variety and a lot of support for various initiatives.  Pay and benefits were excellent, and the people at the company were professional, experienced, and excited about the projects that were being worked on.  Upper management was erratic, and there was considerable turnover at the top, which resulted in sudden cancellations of projects and layoffs of personnel."
good,"Enjoyed my brief time at AOL. Taking call after call can get stressful after awhile so i was eager to find a job off the phones, and eventually left for something else. Although someone that enjoys the call center job would probably thrive there."
good,"Too slow to integrate acquired companies."
good,Its a great work life balance for working Mom's ! Been with AOL through multiple changes in Management over the last 6 years. AOL search team has largely gone unaffected as we are small but extremely efficient group. since its a small group there is not too much opportunity for advancement. Overall my experience has been wonderful and rewarding !
good,"I worked at the call center in Maitland at the time. It went out of business, but was a good place to work.  It was semiprofessional and relaxed environment.  The pay was competitive."
good,"- Work environment was great and fun "
good,"I had a great time working at AOL Inc. More than anything else, it taught me how to enjoy what you do and instilled that passion needed to excel.It was a privilege working with awesome colleagues who were encouraging and gave you the opportunity to do your best."
good,People are dedicated and energetic. It's a fun place to work.
good,"The role varies depending on the time of month. I go from performing balance sheet reconciliations, to performing revenue share reporting for our partners, to posting journals into the accounts and reviewing the journals of others, reviewing cost centres and researching any new products and how we are going to integrate them into the financial systems."
good,"I knew the manager there and loved working for her, she offered lots of flexibility. AOL is pretty much now a start-up. The people there are AWESOME...however, not sure if the company will survive, tough place to recruit for considering so many cool companies in the Valley to compete with. They're focusing on mobile and from an engineering perspective I think it's a great place to work, your voice will be heard, you can help innovate and be part of the team to try and turn the company around. The diggs and people are awesome which makes it a fun place to work..."
good,AOL has a great culture and work/life balance. But there is always the threat of lay-offs at the first sign of revenue drop. Would recommend but keep your linked account up to date.
good,The AOL office in San Francisco was a productive place to work at. But the office was at the brink of full capacity. Definitely needed a bigger space.
good,I worked at AOL when the company seemed to have no idea what  direction it wanted to go in. The transition was painful for everyone.
good,"If you find yourself on a good team with a good manager, and there are many good managers at AOL, doing the job you want to do, AOL can be a fun place to work. AOL has video conferencing and VPN such that you can easily work from nearly anywhere in the world using a broadband connection. This is very handy for dealing with Work-Life balance."
good,Great work life balance but no clear direction from management
good,One of the best VP's I have ever worked for- great co-workers
good,Many skilled employees and many varied opportunities nationally
good,"Good pay and great company, too bad it had to end. We received in coming calls and if they where retained as a customer we received a bonus % per customer."
good,AOL is a compelling place to work with smart and capable employees. Expect to learn a lot about working with different teams and businesses in the media space.
good,"Inside Sales, Phone calls all day, I leaned a lot about digital/online advertising.  Great helpful co-workers"
good,Great opportunity was presented at AOL but the funding for my department was eliminated and my department was desolved after less than 1 year of employment.
good,"During company's spectacular rise, which brought the internet into homes for the first time, the work was exciting and historic. Intense competition and a poor fit of corporate cultures in a merger with Time Warner led to the company's loss of its premier position on the internet and consequent shedding of payroll and shrinkage of corporate campus. Huffington Post, however, is a successful acquisition. Company struggles to find its way with a mix of web properties and online advertising businesses."
good,"AOL outsourced support to Stream, whose goal was to answer as many calls as possible rather than resolve customer issues.  The obvious result of this disparity was poor customer service and dissatisfied customers."
good,"Was able to meet all the deadlines.Not able to spend time with the family much , have to spend extra hours."
good,"The idea was great -- real grassroots hyperlocal journalism, active in the community with a volunteer spirit."
good,"The company no longer exists. it was bought by verizon business. But the company put some thoughts into work-life balance, which was good. For example, it encouraged employees to exercise more via  a reward program."
good,I worked for this company in onsite and off shore. Work environment was good. Management is good and onsite team co-operation was excellent. Increment was good.
good,"being my first desk job it was hard to adapt at least for the first month but apparently i have a natural talent of talking to people ( and not to brag) ."
good,Can be stressful due to continual layoffs.  Excellent perks besides benefits.  Expected to be checking and responding to emails on weekends. Job satisfaction is very tied to manager.
good,"Great work balance."
good,Very good management of day to day activities.  Poor compensation for workload.  Very good with updating technical needs for the department.
good,"fun environment"
good,"•	Ensured the development of retention consultants through Interactive Parallel Sessions, Skills transfers and Remote feedback."
good,"The India Tax Group here handled both Direct and Indirect Taxes. "
good,everyone works really hard. there is lots of encouragement to innovate and try new things.
good,I like working in this company a lot. A lot of positive people that make job enjoyable every day.
good,"AOL had an employee culture that was top-notch.  Management was cooperative and extremely flexible.  Employees were engaged across functional units, which fostered a sense of togetherness.  Overall, it was a great place to work."
good,I sold America Online yellow pages for business'.  It was a little stressful cold calling but the owners always did what they could to calm us down.  They allowed as many breaks as possible. The company soon went out of business.
good,"Learn a lot about the internet industry."
good,Fast paced and dynamic environment.  Independent management style prevails.  Matrixed environment requiring collaboration and impact/influencing skills. 
good,"StudioNow calls me on a ""as needed"" basis to shoot and edit short web videos for local businesses. For them I am required to make contact with the customer, shoot an interview and b-roll in 1.5 hours and then I have 48 hours to edit and upload the final product."
good,"Hard place to get recognition but a big name to carry around, at that time. Based in NYC so very exciting and very fast paced. Great management and training."
good,"I acquired a strong background in quantitative analysis from my time in investment banking at a top tier investment bank, will be completing a certificate in Project Management, and currently demonstrating strong operations results at AOL. For example, I worked with cross functional groups to redesign the customer payment workflow leading to a 60% reduction in billing errors. Additionally, I presented a strategy that incorporated strategic partnerships to make our sales organization 30% more productive when launching campaigns. These were major wins in the operations team and our organization."
good,"Teamwork is a vital part of this company. It is an ""all hands on deck"" environment which gives employees a broader knowledge of the company as a whole. It's great to know how all departments contribute to the success of our company and my position gives me the opportunity to use this information on a day to day basis. The atmosphere of our office is a fun yet professional setting."
good,The company culture used to be amazing. It was a company that had massive chemistry in it's teams. A company that had a decade of continuous record breaking growth. Then Verizon happened. That all was destroyed. I'd be very suspect of working there now.
good,"I worked at AOL for about a year after it acquired a start-up company that I was working for. It offered a lot of great benefits such as volunteering, gym classes and reimbursement, traveling every quarter and really nice events and conferences. AOL by far had the nicest conferences and events out of any company that I have worked for, which is cool. The most difficult part of working at AOL is that they are continuing to grow quickly which has led to high attrition in some groups, mass and frequent layoffs, and limited to no job security."
good,"super travail en lien avec les enfants."
good,Great Company to work for. Excellent Management team. Good work culture . Decent benefits. Stable company to work for but odd timings of work. Lot of learning with an MNC
good,"Was a great job, but they laid off thousands of employees every six months or so. The company wouldn't finish a test project before they would decide to implement it."
good,"Excellent coworkers good work life balance."
good,"I got into work around 9:00."
good,"This is a cutting edge company that does important and emerging work, We gave flexibility about where we can work from, and my boss is a wonderful person who is brilliant.  But, I am ready for a new challenge ."
good,"I participated in the explosive growth of AOL and the online experience. Helped staff and manage their largest call center."
good,"Very Customer oriented process"
good,started my career as a fresher with aol and learnt a lot..groomed me to get ready for a professional career
good,"a long time ago when AOL first came out, a lot of people went and bought computers who never have used one before. they would get AOL disks in the mail and call tech support for help installing the disk  and  learn how to do things with their computer."
good,The task of assisting a client to maintain relations with a company after they have lost all original attraction is no light task. This company gave you the tools and skills to meet such a feat and exceed it. The compensation was well worth the efforts needed to do the work and advancement was regular for those who wanted it.
good,"Good for a starter "
good,"Roaring tiger rewards."
good,This customer service facility and organization were fantastic.  It is too bad not too long after moving to a brand new building location that these jobs were moved overseas.
good,"The employees werent the easiest to get along with and the managers werent very understanding but when it came down to actual customer satisfaction it was a main priority, there demands for overtime where very extensive but the pay was decent"
good,"50-70 phone calls a day, very upset customer. Stay calm, stay focused"
good,Only Help Desk tech for 100 user development site. Also maintained Novell network.
good,Help customers over the phone with technical issues.  Dealt with irate as well as nice customers most of the time.
good,Great overall experience requiring excellent customer service skills and technical knowledge
good,"- tyipcal work day consist of checking all systems and making sure that installs, daily processes, and different web portals and email accounts were working properly"
good,AOL was the best company that I have worked for. I enjoyed my job every day I was there. I wish it had been easier to move up the corporate ladder there but it was well worth my time.
good,"A typical day at work consist of receiving incoming calls from existing customers that have questions about billing, reactivating, activating and cancelling accounts. This is my first experience working in a call center and I am learning many things about being in that type of environment. One of the things that I have learned is sometimes there is nothing that can be done for the customer and a difficult message has to be given to them. This is something that I honestly struggle with. My customer service background believes that something can be done and an unhappy customer is not a returning customer. Delivering the difficult message is the hardest part for me. Management is very well trained and great at coaching the team at how to save customers on their accounts. I enjoy coming to work everyday because of my co workers. We all work well together and have similar things common. The most enjoyable part of my day is spending time with my team and discussing the different technics we used with customers."
good,"Great company to work for but no job security, jobs went overseas after I was hired withing a period of 10 months. Overall good company, great people."
good,AOL was a great place to work and a good team to work with. The only down fall was they decided to outsource to another country and shut down the Tucson plants.
good,I have a tourI have a Inventory they receive it and pick itFast-paced working job girl version this day to you did retire play to work a lot of hours.
good,Very exciting time in the beginning launching many new types of selling opportunities for the market.  Was one of the first online retails and developed industries first pop-up selling offers.
good,"my time at aol was very satisfying, the company's culture was one that stressed the importance of work/life balance. My coworkers made work a second home for me and quickly became like family. Although,there was a lot of restructuring and it felt like with every change at the executive level there wasn't much continuity in vision and execution. We found our selves going back and forth between previous business models and new business models."
good,"AOL has been degrading for the past 10 years.  With the ongoing layoffs every year (sometimes twice a year), puts a ton of pressure and responsibility on the Engineers."
good,"Good to place to work and environment.  The multiple changes in leadership and property additions is very stressful.  Within the last few years, we have been acquired and also have acquired mulitple companies which has cause a lot of stress on the operations team.  With new properties come new process and colleagues which can challenging."
good,The people that work at AOL are great. Very high paced though and things are constantly changing. Work life balance can be difficult depending on your role.
good,"great learning experience"
good,"AOL was a fun place to work however couldn't cope with the night shift and had to move "
good,Great place to work if you are willing to put in extra hours and learn new technology. Management does not provide any direction and does not have a long term goal in mind. Better planning could make the company a better place.
good,Great work culture. Good work/life balance. Days can be long but never overwhelming. Very fast paced. Everyday is happy hour.
good,"AOL's call center was an amazing array of very talented and eclectic individuals working together to provide technical support for the AOL customers.  Most days were spent on the phone, in a headset, talking with customers and leading them through the process resolve a problem.  While that happened, support technicians were free to do whatever they pleased, within some reason, while participating in calls.  Yoyo's, Koosh balls, and even frisbees were not strangers to the call center floor.  People also performed myriad types of crafts, from coloring to wood carving!  And everyone, at one time or another, paced relentlessly as far as their headset chord would allow."
good,"Projects , Tickets ..."
good,Handled cancelation calls for the AOL retention department. Retained customers through the use of
good,Fun place to work and nice people to work with. They had a pool table in the break room that I took advantage of whenever possible.
good,Responsible for reviewing and scheduling quality assurance releases.
good,"I've always felt that AOL treated me right. I appreciated the hard work and dedication that so many of my fellow employees embraced. The only challenging aspect of the job, was that I was employed during a change in the way people used the internet and AOL suffered from a lack of vision at the top levels to properly embrace these changes. This resulted in a continuous downsizing."
good,"was there the night the went 24hrs. it was crazy, highly charged place to work. learned a lot. dealing with customers was challenging but was supported."
good,"The majority of my career growth was during my tenure at AOL. It was a fantastic company.  Everyday provided new and exciting challenges. You always felt like you were a part of the bigger picture and what you did each day contributed to the companies success. My direct line of management was supportive, gave me challenges that provided me with stretch goals, and also, provided me with opportunities to grow within the company. This was achieved through projects/program/products assigned and coaching/mentoring. "
good,great team atmosphere with support at the team level from upper management until the last six months; always looked forward to going to work though the work was fast paced and could be stressful at times; the most stress was outside of work for me at the time; felt valued by the customers i served and that i was doing a good thing; the worst part was being pushed to sell products as part of technical support.

good,"Working in Call Center Industry is one of the most challenging jobs in the Philippines considering all aspects of the work, the working time, working environment, ethics and culture, goals/targets, customers you deal with, managing team and most especially my co-workers. Despite all the challenges, is the advantage that you would learn from all the struggles that you have encountered. I have learned to be more patient and get along with different types of people. To deal with customers of differing attitudes and wants specifically Americans, I would consider an advantage skill. Knowledge-wise, the training that were imparted to us during my stay in the company was very much helpful and useful in the sense that, until now, I am gaining from it and enjoying its benefits. The hardest part of the job is the fact that you could not satisfy all customers which would have a great impact on our performance which is the basis of our targets, salary benefits and ranking which will all be considered on our evaluation that would be reviewed and will be used during site re-alignment. The most enjoyable part of job is that you would enjoy all the benefits that you deserve based on your performance"

good,"Students submit requests for assistance with homework or problem-solving."
good,"system moving slow"
good,"AOL was a good employer.  Unfortunately, they no longer operate in the area where I lived.  I was a Billing consultant.  Because of my extensive customer service, accounting, and administrative experience prior to joining AOL, I was a very effective team member consulting with clients over the phone because they provided an excellent on the job training.  I loved earning points as a side bonus for doing our job anyway.  They provided a lot of incentives that made work fun.  I enjoyed helping customers, even though I was limited to the area where I can move around (being on the headset to take incoming calls.)  My co workers were a bunch of young energetic people, they made work fun.  But, at the end of the day, I felt good thinking of how many people I was able to change their impression (bad) of AOL and made them happy about their service.  :-))"

good,"AOL was a fantastic place to work. The job its self was extremely easy and the bonuses were great! There was no job security because every other week they were discussing closing down, which eventually happened"
good,"As the title suggests the most enjoyable part of the job would be at early morning 3-4, where all the floor walkers will wear a cap and come into the floor with a big bottle of chocolates. After every call we take, we will have to raise our hands which will yield us a chocolate. After an one hour, by 4 am, the floor walker will come around and check who has got the maximum number of chocolate wrappers will get an on the spot goodie. This use make all of us long for the calls during last one hour of our shift. Especially in US shift when everybody would be tired with low energy will be motivated to take more calls with high enthusiasm."
good,I have to say that this was my favorite job. I believe that I would still be working for them if I did not relocate.
good,"Fun, layed back environment to work at almost like the google environment."

Advancement was based on merit. Training was ongoing and I learned skills like public speaking and training that can be used in future jobs."
good,AOL is not here anymore having been broken into pieces. That said if you are able to find a company that contains one or more of the old AOL employees I would highly recommend working with them
good,"I worked in a call center.  Be at your desk and answer calls. I learned everything there. Patience, computers, everything wrong with the computer was NOT because of AOL.  Management was friendly and open door policy. Great workplace environment.  I was an unemployed stay at home mom for 10 years.  They weren't sure but they gave me training and a chance.  The hardest parts of the job was trying to give a possible solution and get frustrated customers off the call and trying to up-sell afterwards.  The people were usually on hold for 30-45 minutes sometimes longer and didn't want to be told try this and call us back.  I worked the late shift so sometimes they were even more frustrated because they'd already been told that and ended up on the phone for hours.  But I loved it when they were elated at finally getting things to work again."
good,"amazing work life balance, team oriented environment, leader on the IT industry, customer oriented company, great compensation and benefits but no job security at all"

good,"Always changing, too many layoffs but offered strong benefits and compensation plus a solid work/life balance and culture. I loved working with my team across the world but having to say goodbye to a lot of them through the years by way of voluntary or involuntary attrition begins to weigh heavily on you."

good,"This was my favorite job. I learned more about the technologies I supported initially than at any other employer. I worked with a great group of individuals, several who I consider my friends, even though we have all gone our separate ways. One thing I didn't realize during my time, is that the technology I supported was limited to a small subset of the vast pool of technologies in the industry. While I learned and grew every year, I could have been more proactive in learning about the various network and telecommunications technologies used in contact center environments. This would have benefited me in my current role. Still, I wouldn't trade my experience at AOL for anything else. The travel, the genuinely great people at the company and the product were all experiences I cherish, even as I am nearly a decade removed from my time with the company."
good,"My typical day started the moment I woke up, I would check a number of sites and Twitter to be sure we had the most relevant information on the site. I would then begin vetting pitch lists from a wide swath of content verticals, determining which stories had the most relevance to the aol.com audience, both in terms of how current they were and engagement. "

good,"I was an employee with AOL from 1997 up until he Jacksonville call-center closed in 2006. During my nine years working there, I held a diverse series of customer support roles due to the rapidly changing online world. The work was challenging, but the company environment felt like family."
good,One of the best places to work at. Only thing would be that more fun and less work needs to be balanced. Awesome staff and facilities. Care about there employees.
good,Challenging industry but a fun environment.   The people are passionate about the work.   Politics and focus are a challenge to success.   Too many priorities.
good,At times we would get tech calls and if we could fix any internet problems we were encouraged to and by was it fun. My co-workers were the best we would always try to help each other. We were pushed to be are own boss to think out side of the box.

good,Great place to work. Educational and productive. I enjoyed working there. It was intense and satisfying. I felt rewarded and compensated appropriately.
good,"I enjoyed their worklife balance, fun atmosphere, and benefits, but they don't focus on my field as a company. They also focus a lot on sales and developing their sales talent as opposed to their marketing talent."
good,"AOL will always be my favorite company I ever worked with. Amazing work culture,"
good,With AOL you have to learn the packages the company sells in order to provide the customer with the best fit to their needs. AOL only allows the best in customer service to work for them.

good,"AOL is one of my favorite companies. It has a special place in my heart because it was headquartered in the town where I was raised. I have visited its campus many times and worked with many of its employees. There is a culture there that respects and encourages its employees to always do their best, which leads to a greater product overall. AOL is primed to be even better in the future and it will be exciting to watch as their new media efforts unfold."
good,"Awesome management, fun friendly coworkers, rewarded short term, mid term, and long term, consistent awards.  Adhere to strict time management but fun dealing with people.  Communication skills were fabulously grown and trained upon."

I was fortunate to work with some of the best management teams in my career as I was promoted and worked on two different teams while I was there. In a new role as a new mom with new life experiences, AOL provided the flexibility and support I needed to be successful at work and at home. I wish there were more companies like AOL."

The work/life balance was second to none, I always felt supported if I had a professional/personal thing to take care of."

good,"Unfortunately both were sinking (our customer base was shrinking) the last decade I was there (98 to 10). Before that, and during that time, we were professional and tried to produce and deliver a product that was worth what the customer paid for it. Each employee was held accountable for their area and was compensated for making their area work well. Management was cognizant of the problems involved and did their best to help each employee."

A typical day at work was the customers on the phone they were so funny learning how to use the software program.  I learned so much about the computers and software program. My co workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job for me was been flexible schedule always changed.

good,"AOL is a truly wonderful place to work. The people there are professional and fun to work with. It is a very collaborative place (at least in the accounting field). You're encouraged to ask questions and try to improve the current processes. You have the option to work with a mentor through the company (someone who isn't already your manager). There is a keg on every floor and numerous happy hour events during the month. I am not leaving voluntarily--the accounting department is moving to Omaha, Nebraska and I don't want to follow the job (VERY different work environment).

(1) How a computer really worked and why it worked. (2) How to break the software and then fix the computers software. What to do with software to fix or tweak. To make work on the application. more of your co-workers were like family and treated you like family. Even today still keep in touch with many of the ex-workers. Most problematic part of the job is when new spyware came to light and finding ways to fix the problem. The best part was the people you worked with and how we took care of each other. If you had a bad day you could say this is just my day and was accepted for that. This company was all about team work. "

good,"I loved my internship with AOL. My day started off kind of slow being as though we had to be up so early and travel so far. But it was definitely worth every moment of travel. I learned how to run meetings effectively, how to conduct wiki pages, how to process tickets, and so many other project management skills. Management was awesome, always had something for us to do to research. My co-workers were very helpful in every way possible and that made the entire experience enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do something I wasn't use to doing such as creating wiki pages and working in Omniture Site Catalyst, but once I got the hang of it, it became fun to do. The most enjoyable part was the whole experience from beginning to end."
