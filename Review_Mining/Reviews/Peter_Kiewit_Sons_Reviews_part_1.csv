rating,review
bad,Very poor management and admin staff and get the run around when confronted with their mistakes. Make sure to check your ROE before leaving if they lay you off. They will state you quit and causes issues for EI.
bad,"Clicques, suckups, and take advantage of workers  "
bad,"What this company lack in competitive pay makes up for in benefits. However if you are a minority or a female do not expect to stay long. They may have had some requirement they may need to reach yearly for hires but they will not keep you. "
bad,"They tell you that they believe in work life balance, and thats as far as it goes.  Where I was working the work week was Monday-Saturday.  You were expected to work a minimum  of 63.5 hrs a week.   Instead of hiring more people they just work you more. It was not uncommon to have to work Sundays too."
bad,Surprised they are not bankrupt. Just one big dog and pony show for management. They have completely lost sight of the work. Do not waste your time with this conpany.
bad,the only way to get moved in this company is if you are a drinking buddy with the supervisor and just do what they say no matter if they are right or wrong......... will just leave it at that.
bad,they want you to work weekends but they keep changing your hours and your pay rate every week and they are completely incapable of providing pay stubs or tools to there workers. they cant get enough iron workers to work for them so they put there carpenters and laborers through a 2 day iron worker training program. its only a mater of time before some poor person slips through the cracks of there safety system and gets hurt or dies
bad,"Used me for 3 months while the Creative Director was on maternity leave. Once she came back I was abruptly swept out the back door with a box full of belongings. Take this as a disgruntled employee mad because he was fired, but that is far from the truth. The marketing department at the Woodlands, Texas location is a country club run department."
bad,"Kiewit is a company where the culture is stuck in the past...all the managers are older men that came up in the rough construction industry of the 80s and 90s and have expectations of others similar to what their antiquated expectations were. If you don't meet these expectations you are looked down on and not looked at for advancement opportunities, even if you perform well."
bad,Everyone here seems to have a lack of training including the engineers and managers. This place is full of micromanagers who take the credit for your hard work.
bad,I believe the people are good but the environment of people you must fit in as far as your role if you expand people will fill like your trying to take their job.
bad,"I would never recommend working for this company unless you have no life.  No work / home balance.  Worked 6 and sometimes 7 days a week.  Had to walk almost a mile to get to the site regardless of weather, restrooms are skid-o-cans, work conditions are horrible."
bad,"The training style of the various departments I have worked in/had experience with has a lot to be desired. It's very much so a ""Sink or Swim"" mentality, unless you get ""buddied"" up with someone, who is willing to go above and beyond. When it comes to being a part of the support staff (non-engineering, design, or work in the field), career advancement is difficult. Also, if you do change departments/get promoted, don't expect to get a raise right away. They only give out raises annually and even though you are promoted they are ""performance based."" which means you still might only get a 3-5% increase from what you are currently making."
bad,looking after 8 chargehands and crews making sure you had work to keep everyone busy. Attending production meeting and safety meeting. This was one of the safety jobs I work on. The hardest part of this job was getting journypersons to come to the area to work with other jobs to go to at the time.
bad,No me gusta kiewit creo que no respetan los derechos de una persona y solo piensan en produccion y no valoran la capacidad de un ser humano
bad,You are just a number to your managers and many of them do not tolerate anything short of absolute compliance to what they want you to do. People above you will dangle the private stock incentives over your nose but they cannot be reached unless you are in the construction group. Engineers are treated poorly.
bad,"Safety, Safety, Safety when you deal with Kiewit. Every day morning exercise, morning Foremen meetings. Always Teamwork!!"
bad,"This was a miserable place to be, and I don't know any engineers that are still there that worked there when I started. They do not value or respect their people."
bad,"Worked for several company's thru out my 18 years union, made up my mind to retire after working for kewit you have to brown nose to get anywhere not me  will never work there again."
bad,"very racist!!!,, take advantage of workers.. they do not like Indians,,, and or anyone whom is not French,,,or can speak French!!!!"
bad,"KOS isn't a terrible place to work for a craftsman. For engineers and other salary positions it is. If your a young ambitious problem solver KOS is not for you. Plan on working 60-70 hours a week and never get a lick of overtime. Most of the work will be ordering materials, counting work completed and other task requiring minimal critical thinking.  Its a massive company with little room to move up. To much bureaucracy for a young professional to thrive. "
bad,"Company that expects their employees to give everything to the company but will give nothing in return. Working for a company in fort mcmurray, away from family is hard enough but being away to work for a company that doesn't care about their employees is very sad."
bad,"a typical day of work is 12 hours per day and only getting paid for 8 hours per day. the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing,"
bad,A bunch of idoits. A kid on his first year out of collage will know more than your 20 years of experience.
bad,"dont pay good, work you as a slave, even when working hard and in sun, supervisors still down your throat, company tends to run people off for the littlest things.. the authority their is not put down right. everyone is always trying to fire someone"
bad,"Never ever ever EVER!!!! Work for this hack company. The so called ""foreman"" and ""general foreman"" were brutal!! I have more knowledge in my pinky finger then these clowns had. Poor management. Poor planners the WORST quality control personal I have ever encountered. There wasn't one good thing about the job I worked. I'll give you a good piece of advice. If you want to work with real professionals join a REAL union. NOT CLAC!! There a joke. I can't believe these donkeys get work? It's mind boggling. Like I said if you want to be treated with respect and work with the pros GO UNION!! And this so called ""63 union"". ITS NOT A FLIPPING UNION it's a highway!! They gave me a hoodie with there name splattered all over it. Needless to say it went directly into the garbage cause that's where it belonged. Would be embarrassed to walk around and admitting that I worked for them lol."
bad,I worked at k2 mining at kearl lake and it was the wort camp job I had ever worked at. The management is horrible and they will work you as much as they can and won't compensate!
bad,"Wow is all I can say really about this company. Everyone, ALL CRAFTS are under paid by more than 30% below the national average. The turnover rate is so high that they don’t care about any set individual worker and yet only give management any perks. The insurance is ridiculous and they will work you to death before they give a raise. The safety record is fabricated and they sweep injuries and major incidents under the rug. Worst company I’ve ever worked for."
bad,"As a female, it's hard to find advancement in a company that is mainly male-dominated.  Management's expectations include doing their work more than yours.  Surrounding job sites pay double the pay at this place."
bad,Expected to work long hours for very little pay. Does not pay experienced people what their worth and ends up paying them less than new hires. Expectation to work nightshift with no pay benefits. Management is willing to throw lower employees under the bus to protect themselves. Management will also tell it's employees what they want to hear rather than the truth. Management ignores the ideas and thoughts of its employees.
bad,I have an oustanding resume and was unfairly judged by a “ peer advisor.”  Happy to move on to a better position with an even better salary!  Kiewit’s loss. Very unprofessional treatment.  I am a Kansas native and would NOT recommend Kiewit to anyone as a potential employer. Beware!!!
bad,"Employees are run into the ground and laid off with no notice."
bad,"Old Boys Club,"
bad,"If you want your PE license I would look at a different company.  Information from interview is completely different then the office you will work in.  You have no direction for the job you work in or the direction your career will take.  They have you fill out paperwork about your interests but every ""opportunity"" present was the complete opposite.  If you have a working spouse, they expect you to leave them or have them quit becuase you will move on average once a year, and be expected to move in one day.   Health care cost affordable but in the end doesn't cover anything.  You get a lot of PTO days but you are expected to not use them. I went to the ER one morning and was asked to be in the office in an hour."
bad,"At first the company seemed to be interested in growing individuals and supporting a work/life balance, but the culture changed in the last 3 years or so to one of stress, intimidation and back-stabbing."
bad,Hired me as a temporary worker and I was supposed to get a review 3 months in to determine if I would stay they told me there's not set time for an evaluation. They never gave me benefits and just worked me to the bone until I started asking HR about my benefits and evaluation they talked about when I got the job. Then they laid me off. No job security and I felt taken advantage of. Fussy managers with crazy expectations.Just work you crazy hours and hope you don't start asking about benefits. The environment was toxic- just walking down the hall trying to say hello to someone is impossible. They just walk right passed you. Bad attitudes and super unfriendly.
bad,Not a good place to work! The managers are only in this for themselves. Constant politics and internal fighting. This company is so top heavy the overheads lead to the highest prices in the industry. Not good for customers and not good for employees!
bad,Horrible working environment. Training is pretty much non-existent and yet you are expected to figure it out by yourself and know it.  If you don't know it and can't figure it out your very limited on where you can go to get help because you simply don't know. There is absolutely no new job orientation to familiarize or introduce you to their intranet system
bad,Very stressful job.  There was no life in work/life balance.  Management did not communicate very well with younger employees.  The culture was work hard and then work even harder.
bad,"They thrive on causing chaos..taking away things you need to get the job done, complain you have to wear gloves, but wont buy them. Bad experience all the way around."
bad,I would not suggest anyone to work for this company unless you really need a job this company does not care about their employees and they're very unprofessional I suggest stay away
bad,I was excited to start this job but it didn't take long to see leadership is terrible and the pay is worse. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,Managment has no idea what there doing more equipment sits than works have there plans arnt correct. Hire a bunch of operators and stick them in equipment they ither wernt hired to run or equipment labouors normally run. Have nice new equipment and gps equipment but cant use it cuz that requires prep and actual plans calgary ring road project is a joke seen more ppl quit than stay. Been on one crew with 5 different formans in the last 3 weeks. They should wake up before they lose tgis whole project at this rate they wount make it for 2020
bad,"Kiewit Offshore Services is one of the most fast paced working environment like slave work, they are the one branch that makes the most money and pays the least amount to their workers. it is extremely hard to move up in pay and career and there is a lot of hatred and jealously in the company which makes great workers lose their jobs fast and for no reason at all."
bad,"A typical day is at lease 10 hours, 12+ is not abnormal at all. Working late nights and weekends is often and raises are minimal. The business group is not appreciated and career opportunities and training are very limited."
bad,"Alot of nepotism at this place. wives, children, husbands, fiances. "
bad,Hired for a 3 month project that was really only 2x14 day shifts. They knew this as soon as I showed up on site. Quite another job to take this one. Not impressed.
bad,"Mean,angry self serving people. Leadership was terrible. Kiewit is full of goons and thugs. Become a slave if you want but there are better ways to make a living"
bad,"Engineers are overworked. Very high turnover ratio, engineers get burned out and don't last more than two or three years. They advertise ""Be part of the Kiewit family"". There is no loyalty at the Kiewit Yard in Ingleside. Poor management, favoritism and way too much office drama. No room for advancement unless you kiss up or are in ""The Click"". Pay raises are nonexistent. It doesn't matter how much you learn or how much responsibility you take on, hourly staff personnel get a whole 25 cent raise each year and that's if your lucky to get that."
bad,"Not much opportunity for training. If you want to be a manager and work 5 to 6 days per week and travel for business on the weekends, this might be the place for you. I was very dissatisfied with this company, you can do much better so don't settle."
bad,"I've learned a lot, but I had no life in this company.  I worked almost 7 days a week.  One day I worked 16 hours, showed up late on the next day about 15 minutes, and my supervisor wrote me up.  great experience but you will not have a life."
bad,Phasing out as many Canadians as they can. Hiring all american management who like to treat workers like garbage and hiring as many TFW's as the government will allow.
bad,"If you are single like long hours this is the place for you. When I first started it was horrible, these people treat you like a dog. Everyone is from different districts and could care less about helping each other out. There mentality is workers,crane operators, and any one else are replaceable at the drop of a hat. If there's nothing to do in your craft you go home. They could care less about your hours or well being. Now I did meet some awesome people but they had nothing to do with my craft. If your coming to Texas to work for them you've been warned!!"
bad,"The purchasing agent position is a glorified data entry. The team leaders are in adequate but that is too be expected cause management believes in “YES MEN.” The moment you have your own opinion and/or provide feedback you are put on a list. This position doesn’t provide growth of any kind. This position lacks diversity. In addition, Kiewit doesn’t acknowledge Martin Luther King’s day. That tell you a little about the company culture. It is not inclusive! Management has away of diminishing employees talent and making them feel less than. All of them need to attend a diversity boot camp. For future interest with Kiewit apply at your own risk!"
bad,This company expects employees to drop your life with little to no notice to relocate or begin working at a work site. Senior employees are laid off to make way for numerous interns who have no work experience.
bad,"a typical day at work: repetitive which isn't really bad but gets boring"
bad,"Superintendants and chargehands are mostly apprentices who talked their way to the top.  "
bad,No communication what so ever employees do not know English worst company i have ever work for. Stay away from this outfit they are trouble!
bad,Multiple accidents occurred while I was employed there. When you try to report an incident the safety team ignores you. If you get injury compensation you will lose your job.
bad,"Kiewit was not a good fit for me. I was hired to perform certain tasks but the department was not advanced enough to incorporate the job responsibilities that were outlined in my interview. I had no idea or what I was supposed to be doing on a daily basis. My supervisor also did not have any idea on how to utilize me and he was the one that wrote the job description. My supervisor was very good at brushing me off when I would ask what I should be doing or if anyone needed help. Other departments may be better but this department was very unorganized and it was left to the employees to figure out what/how to do. "
bad,"Backstabbing coworkers hand off all blame to the last person to touch a project. Any reasons at all given to cut raises, including lies. Men consistently put in advanced roles as part of their regular duties with an assigned coach, but women must prove themselves before promotion by acing “side” projects they must do in addition to their full time duties, and no coach or one who never shows up or answers calls. Blatant EEOC violations and abuse explained by HR lawyers as perfectly legal and justifiably within the right of an employer, with no responsibility for reasonable accommodation. Will gladly work you to death & then deny you any credit for success."
bad,Poor management. Lack of value and respect. A team came over from a smaller company and there was no value in the experience or knowledge. We were skyways undermined.
bad,Not a good place to work. management is more worried about how they look on paper rather than keep a good employee. You  go to work scared that you will be fired at the end of the day. Its not a good place to work.
bad,"Nobody knows heavy civil construction like Kiewit, but that comes at a major price to your well being.  As an engineer they will WORK YOU TO DEATH.  They expect everything from you and give practically nothing in return.  They are famous for treating their employees like trash.  Expect to work a MINIMUM of 12-14 hr/day plus 6+ hours on Saturday regardless if crews are working or not, and even Sundays depending on the project."
bad,same as my other review not a nice place to work they preach safety then don't enforce or ensure people have the safety gear they need. they tell you this equipment is a must to work then don't provide you with any of it and tell you well just get it done without.
bad,"The worst work experience of my life. It was/is a revolving door. They are very quick to fire for petty reasons. I was fired for cutting my finger while closing the door on my yard dog. If I had not asked for a band-aid, there would not have been a safety report done and I would still have a job! My Co-workers witnessed witnessed my firing for a simple cut and band-aid. They all said they would not report anything to Safety or management for fear of losing their jobs etc... Retaliation and Threats are their management style. Horrible enviroment to work in. One is set up for failure, the moment they step foot through the door. Unless you are ""buddies"" with somebody high up the food chain."
bad,"Kiewit is a very political company. Unless you are related to someone in upper management, you will never get promoted."
bad,"No training, no core values. The management were terrible."
bad,"They want you to work days, evenings, and weekends. Additionally they develop a culture of competition for your job retention, and potential advancement. That makes it a cut throat environment. Also they move you around the country on a whim."
bad,"Not the best place to work , not safe workplace. With stressful environment ."
bad,"The job posting is a lie. You will be hired as an operator, but will do nothing but labourer work. Supervisors can't agree what takes priority. You will move job focus 8-10 times per shift and accomplish little to nothing  No wonder the ring rd is so far behind schedule. This company is a total farce and disorganized cluster fk. from the the top down and should be reported to whomever is paying for the project. The only good thing about working here is the people you work with."
bad,"Worked the first 5 weeks with a broken calculator and keyboard. Trained by a person who had never trained before, and had zero patience! Office personnel  all unhappy, nobody talked to each other, collaborated, did not feel welcome in the least!"
bad,The shareholders doesn’t mean good project managers. She/he has no idea how to lead the group members and how to shape the team. Senior manager just doesn’t care and do what project managers suggests.
bad,"If you enjoy constant relocation, stressful demanding work, no work/life balance, long hours, and mediocre pay then Kiewit is for you.  On the plus side, you will get a masters degree in ""sink or swim"" and when you leave, you'll get all the PTO you could never afford to use cashed out in a lump sum."
bad,"If this thing gets built it will be some sort of miracle!! people hate to work there, management is clueless, unresponsive, irrelevant,and they are all at the mercy of METRO who does not want to build anything they just want people to stop complaining. prediction is over budget and over schedule, and cheaply built."
bad,"I believe that everyone has one nightmare job they measure all others against, Kiewit is mine. "
bad,If you are not into politics this isn't the place for you. It's all in who you know not how hard and good you work. Managers are home on the weekends and the workers are working 7 days a week 10 to 12 hours a day.
bad,"Supervision use and sells meth."
bad,"Camp based work 14 on 7 off. Pour management scheduling, Great safety program and excellent safe working record for this site. Good pay and the best part was fly day."
bad,"They have the lowest salaries, never make plans for work and all the time they are pressing you to work harder."
bad,"Teamwork  is best, management is very supportive.  Great Benefits "
bad,Very little time off and long work hours also there is only one main entrance to the yard for over 2000 workers the traffic gets really bad
bad,You sign a work contract to work 60 hours a week and end up having to work 80 and 90 hours because they have a shortage of experience people to cover the work needs .There is a atmosphere of anger projected to the younger employees to toughen them  up. I feel this is not necessary
bad,No advancement opportunities for staff and poor pay for amount of work given.  People are hired on at wages comparable to a fast food chain.  Benefits are horrible as well
bad,This company operates as though it is back in 1980.  Management is poor communication is poor and Most decisions that are made are very reactionary. The benefits are very expensive and the time off Has to be accrued. Not good for today’s market.
bad,"I was a welder-4 and some days i wouldnt even weld. They dont let you advance your craft, they have a school where they send you after 3 months you worked with then  but some workers i talked to had 6 months and never got sent to the school to perfect their craft."
bad,"I had a poor experience with Kiewit.  I do not believe it is a reflection of the company but rather the individual leadership I was hired under.  I was not allowed to communicate with the end users of what I was developing, but expected to perform based off missing information without the opportunity to be creative or sway.  It was not a good experience for me; I would work for Kiewit again, just not for that particular department."
bad,"The only people who get ahead are the ones that are willing to work around the clock without time for anything else. If someone has an issue with you it isn't very long before you are pulled in to a room and written up because of some small infraction and the next minute you are out. I watched one manager literally get rid of her whole department one at a time because she didn't hire them. She would purposefully reprimand you in front of everyone to embarrass you to get you to leave. That is the type of manager they promoted. "
bad,"Training and team participation is key to Kiewit,  Its like a family. they have numerous projects but there is an economic slowdown. oil prices are low"
bad,"kiewit is a great compagny but mildred lake project was a bit messed up because the super intendent scaffolders was an iron worker and a concrete finisher , and most of the managers there was concrete workers and stuff so it was a bit miss organize and they where pushing alot and taking unsafe decision most of the time .. But except that project Kiewit is a really good compagnie and well organize , Kearl Lake Kiewit project there is one of the best compagnie to work for with great team and personal and im pretty sure the rest of the project out there must be good as kearl lake with kiewit"
bad,"Policies indicate company is supportive of employees, but actual practice differs. Appears that management has so much leeway in applying policies that some employees and departments are treated very well with honesty and integrity. Others are singled out and blocked from opportunities supposedly offered, such as training, promotion within, conference attendance, etc."
bad,"There are many reasons 60% of employees leave in the first 5 years."
bad,"Kiewit speaks for itself, but the poor management in place, here in the Colorado area is lacking in a BIG way! The lack of diversity and opportunities to move up in the company can use improvements. The moral of the craft can be assisted better, if upper management gets out of the corporate office and checks on some projects and people. A typical day of work for operations is at the job site, or overseeing several job sites and checking on the schedule and margins for each project. The hardest part of being a General Superintendent was working with estimators in the corporate office who had no idea of how to do the work in the field, and they would estimate the project wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see nothing, turn into a huge building or apartment or hotel. It was also amazing to work with hard working craft and just good people. I enjoy dealing with the owners and talking with them and reviewing detailed drawings, so we provide an outstanding product and the owner gets exactly what they paid for."
bad,"Pays good but very long hours with little to no recognition. The department I worked in was extremely mis-managed and due to this moral was very poor, environment negative. Made going to work an unpleasant daily experience unfortunately. Not good."
bad,"If you are interested in joining a company where you will be working all the time and not being paid for it, then this is just the company for you.  I was told I would be working a 40 hour work week.  Upon joining I noticed everyone works 50 hours a week.  Add to that unpaid overtime and a compliance policy that it soaked in fear that few people in supervisory positions adhere to and you will be looking for different work just after you start.  The ""Christian"" ""union"" although it looks like it supports the workers, it actually works for Kiewit.  They are the same entity and work together to protect themselves, not you.  Add to that extra unpaid meetings in the morning in exchange for coffee and donuts.  It is what it is.  They get away with it because it's an American company operating in Canada.  Their response to not paying overtime was to pay it, but reduce wages.  Win/Win for them and the ""union"", not for you.  Lots of promises, hardly ever keeping to them.   "
bad,This company uses its employees as footstools the fieldworkers are told not to share their salaries because pay scale depends on likability.  Whites are operators and minorities are ditch diggers.. keep your mouth shut and stay in your place.
bad,"A job where you rudely get laid off isn’ta safe place to work at. Horrible people, horrible culture. It’s also not fun to waddle through mud, even in buildings."
bad,"I'm the employee your company needs ..I'm extremely punctual , as well as assertive . I consider myself an asset to any company. At the present time I'm working in a very unstable environment."
bad,"Extremely long hours and zero work-life balance, terrible management and no care for employee learning. They'd send you to trainings a year after you've been doing the work that you're being trained for. It's backwards. And no one cares if you don't understand something and need training, they think you're weak."
bad,"Start of at 6 in the morning have 30 min meeting on safety and go over what we are doing to day. At 7 we have stretch and flex with the craft gets there I go over what we are doing today and if we need anything that we don't currently have to complete the tasks that we are doing today such as  gaskets parts and pieces. Then its planning for the next day on what we need to do."
bad,Management positions were filled with relatively young people that did not leave much space for other people to move up. Stuck in a entry level position doing mindless tasks all day. Benefits were were good at first with rrsp but got reduced at the later part of the project. Raises we very little even with the best performing people. Company spends on district meetings and training rather than increasing their salaries.
bad,Management has a long way to go. Day to day is still managed by untrained managers who use fear instead of finesse. Very stressful.
bad,Kiewit is prone to put young college grads in management positions that really don't know how to build.  It makes it very difficult for those of us with many years of experience and lots of pride in our building skills to work for them regardless of the compensation.
bad,An exciting place to work for engineers and degreed professionals. Employees are great and do a great job proving a valuable service to their clients.
bad,"If you like to work and continue to work on your days off, this is your work place.  You get to work on interesting projects and your given lots of responsibility.  Unfortunately when you go home, work doesn't stay at your desk.  "
bad,"If you have a family, or a girl/boyfriend, or any friends, or a dog, or a hamster, or anything that requires your time and attention away from work, then this job is not for you. "
bad,Very poor management. No leadership or sense of direction. Employees sacrifice a lot with little or no appreciation. My co workers were great. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with different crafts to get a task or job done. Most enjoyable part of my job was getting set up with a full days worth of work.
bad,I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Started out as a good company and when things started to go down hill it went rather quickly. They do not have a back log of work. Employees were left to sit in the office with little to work on for several months plus.
bad,"Safety on the job sites were a joke, didn't address safety until there was an incident or near miss. It was very cut throat environment for employees, clicks got moved up and on. Typical paid salary for 40 hours a week and worked 60-75."
bad,"Management was a joke, my direct supervisor was great, other than that they're a joke. The employees would stab you in the back to get ahead, and it's encouraged by management. Hourly people were crapped on daily. The ""safety"" program is a laughing stock, ""safety"" related paperwork takes more time than actually doing the task safely. Skilled labor and operators are paid the same, based on how long they've been there. Their 401k match is based off 2000 hours a year and they stop matching after that so if you work a lot of overtime (which is most regularly only available for the pit) and get your 2000 hours in August, Kiewit will stop matching your contributions for the rest of the year. It takes for ever to build up enough vacation time to take a full rotation off. The health insurance (for the hourly people) is a joke. High deductible, high out-of-pocket junk. Anything they give you gets taxed at the gift tax rate (about 48%)"
bad,Guys from all over the USA that don't have area knowledge. Too many young guys fresh out of college with no experience. Old slave drivers that are curse you one minute then praise you the next.
bad,"na"
bad,One thing I love about my job is being pro active to the health and well being of others.
bad,Construction running the quality department. Travel arrangements were horrible at best.
bad,"My day begins at 7:15 every day Monday through Friday.  I answer phones, open and sort mail when it arrives, prepare packages and labels for FedEx, other duties as assigned.  The hardest part of the job is sitting for 8 hours a day and not having enough work to get me through a full 8 hours.  The most enjoyable part are some of my co-workers.  I am a very hard working positive person who enjoys staying busy, being challenged and appreciated for hard work."
bad,Most of the high up kiewit employees are coke heads or drunks they show up on site hungover or with drawl from drugs.I couldn't believe the amount of favortism among long time buddy's or employees you could get your foot in the door unless you deal drugs or party hard with them therefore it's hard to get in with this company
bad,"Management lacks experience, long hours as staff."
bad,"New foreman are promoted or hired without any prior experience. Then they don't get any training. Older foreman tend to have worked their way up and are good. Kiewit is only concerned about the bottom line, they could care less about the employee and will lay a person off without a second thought.  The pay is good, but that is only because of the unions.  Safety is a high priority there."
bad,Kiewit is fast paced with lots of work and different projects being worked on. Safety is priority and they take that very serious which means a better and safer work environment for employees.
bad,"Minimum 50 hour week with a lot of hands on experience. Some will like it and tolerate it while others loath it. The hands on experience is good for those coming out of college, but the long hours can make the job brutal to deal with. In the heat of a project expect 70+ hour weeks working Saturday and sometimes Sunday. No overtime pay."
bad,"Kiewit is a great company if you want to put work first."
bad,Company culture is acceptable; and is OK to work for.
bad,"Safety was talked about in the meetings but then on the job sites the leaders would try to do what ever it took to get the jobs done putting employees  in danger to complete task. Never had the right ppe for the jobs examples (concrete gloves, correct dusk mask, shields for the concrete saw."
bad,"Although Kiewit does have great benefits and use to be a great place to work, the new executive management changes have made it a difficult company to want to work for in certain areas,  The moral has really gone down but there are some really great people that work there and still some great management as well.  The two locations in Omaha are completely different cultures so make sure if you apply that it really fits what you are looking for and not what you hear from others.  They may not be talking about the location you are planning to work at."
bad,"A lot of pressure with little to no guidance. The moment you make a mistake someone is at your throat. People walk around with their heads too big to fit through doors, no communication between management."
bad,Kiewit tends to take advantage of the employees.  Management is unprofessional and not trained in proper management techniques.  No one at Kiewit is irreplaceable. Fair wage for the job title may be correct but one will be expected to do continuously more for the same pay.  The culture is one of favoritism and elitism in favor of the Engineers and Project Managers. Everyone else is expendable and will be gotten for the least pay possible. The values expressed by management do not reflect their actions.
bad,Lots of favoritism . My way or the highway environment from upper management. Lots of cover up there. Most employees are amazing guys . Upper management needs a face lift
bad,"I was there for a short period. They haul 450 excavators at night without permits. You work 6 days a week and only get 45-48 hours a week. It's my cdl, and I won't get points for a company that wants to cut corners for cost."
bad,"Not the best place to work for employees, no career advancement and business policies are made to keep upper management in place. Feedback is not wanted."
bad,Working after hours is expected without any extra compensation. There are an excess of office workers lined up to take field positions once someone is let go.
bad,Mundane culture that is very male egotistical with a very lazy work ethic or micromanaged ethic. Typically spend the day hearing people complain about one thing or another while trying to dish out own work.
bad,Kiewit had a problem with playing the blame game. company could have had better management and could have used more zoom booms for the delivery of steel. pay was good but the mod yard was a mess and a lot of injury in a month. Kiewit didn't offer job stability as one minute they hire a bunch of people and in a week lay 15 others off. the co workers were good people and had no issues with any. just letting everyone know if you go to this company you make an error your terminated and come up with a bull excuses is to why your terminated
bad,Mush mules mush! Knowledgeable people and of course there are some good ones there. I quit after 5 years to work somewhere which allowed for a better quality of life. Very glad I did!
bad,"I worked for Kiewit as a design contractor for 7 months in their Lenexa, KS office. I won't get too specific here, but they had a lot of difficulty keeping people around because  the office culture was so insufferable. Due to previous failures on the part of mgmt to hire and retain quality ppl, I spent my entire time cleaning up a lot of garbage-work left behind by disgruntled former employees. The whole time I was there, I was treated with extreme distrust. One day I was called away from my desk and into a Super's office, and was flatly accused of insubordination. That's when I had been there only 2 or 3 months, and I had been busting tail to give them everything they asked for. In my career of more than 15 years of related experience, that was the first time anything like that had happened to me. All of their projects are way over budget & past schedule, which in my opinion is due to a continuing  cycle of mismanagement followed with feverish micromanagement. When I finally left, they were in a hiring frenzy - while in the middle of losing all of their active projects. In my opinion, all of their problems go back to not respecting their employees as they should. In addition to all of this, the Lenexa office is located in the middle of nowhere, which makes it almost impossible for employees to grab lunch or breakfast nearby. Epic fail!"
bad,Work required constructing a fiber optics network in the streets of San Francisco without proper preplanning of buildings to connect or locations of clients
bad,Very pushy management/supervision
bad,"Kiewit is starting to become an entrenched bureaucracy. It's great if you don't mind long hours and mindlessly doing what you're told, you'll rise to the top. If you want to try to improve or want a life outside of work, I would not recommend."
bad,I enjoy working with the field contacts that I support. It's all who you know and who you kiss up to for a promotion.  Those who work harder dont get appreciated enough.
bad,This job did not give hands on training.  The project is poorly managed and privacy was an issue.  They did not show respect or work as a team.  I felt I was treated unfairly.
bad,Going to work everyday was a struggle being looked down on by my peers and always being shamed. Timelines were almost impossible and nothing was ever organized. Lack of proper training to be able to my job efficiently.
bad,"The managers had a very twisted way of  dealing with administrative team.  They believed  the admin staff were replaceable and nothing but overhead.  If you didn't like the work environment - you were easily replaceable. They have a very ""churn & burn"" mentality."
bad,"Stressful days, always being watched and pushed. never have time for family your always at work or traveling. very lonely life, not for everybody. going from days to night often."
bad,"I worked for Kiewit for 5 years and participated in a lot of very neat projects. I even got the chance to travel which was great. "
bad,Expect long hours and no pay raises. Suck up to management or don't plan on moving up.
bad,"lot of work for little reward, no work life balance. chances are you'll be in a position you did not end up applying for."
bad,"Although Western Summit is one of the leading water and wastewater construction companies in the business, their internal operations is not well managed."
bad,"Hired me for dayshift, then put me on night shift during orientation. Nightshift all foreign workers cant speak english. They couldnt care less that I have a family and my 74 yr old mother living with us. Ended up finding a different job on dayshift somewhere else"
bad,"Expect long hard hours, travel, and compensation less than average."
bad,"Pros: Have great benefits. Cons: Management lacks leadership. Lack of training for employees new to construction industry, which is very stressful. Workplace culture is individualized and one is expected to learn on their own. Only values the engineers, do not engage or value non-engineers."
bad,"Spread really thin within the department for Structural Engineers. Too few engineers per projects which resulted with overtime and burnout. The co-workers were great and the compensation was great, but if you don't love what you do, you're going to be miserable spending 8-12 hours a day. I ended up working 70+hrs/wk for over 8 months."
bad,its a good company for hrs and benefits but not so much good on the pay also school is free so that's a plus its slow paced behind on projects they'll hire their kin before they hire a random
bad,The work-life balance on site was severely off. No one enjoyed themselves and were worked to the bone. People in the office clocked their 9-5 while sometimes people on site were working 60-70 hours and often on weekends.
bad,"The first 4 years I was working there everything was great, but then the upper management in my department was all changed out, the new management was never in touch with their employees. contract personal was brought in and work was taken from direct hires."
bad,Good starting job for only a year. Advancement only happens after 2-3 years... Lots of responsibility put on entry level guys
bad,"Working for Kiewit, they do not expect you to maintain a work life balance.  The success of the job should come before family, healthy habits, adequate sleep, good nutrition, and overall happiness.  As this does not align with how I would like to spend my life, nor with any goals I would like to achieve outside of work, I am unhappy with the company.  Management is also disorganized and filled with poor communicators.  In a typical day I will be given 5 or 6 different tasks from my 6 supervisors and expected to treat all of them as top priority.  This only leads to stress on the part of the employee and disappoint on the part of the management.  With this style of leadership, nobody wins."
bad,"I would help my fitter set up and i would start working when he just relaxed off the side. He wouldn't teach me alot of stuff so i found alot of my other co-workers who were around and taught me some skills that i now know. At the end of the day the hardest thing was putting all of my tools away, rolling up the leads and hoses, and cleaning up all by myself."
bad,"I worked for this company for 20 months. The office people are great, HR is fantastic, and the company sounds great to work for from what they tell you. I bought into their whole training and mentoring philosophy at the office. When i was sent out in the field it was a complete different train of thought. There idea of scheduling isn't using Primavera but rather a make shift schedule on an entire wall of a trailer with a whiteboard. They work you 12-16 hours a day once in the field and you oversee 2-4 people being a superintendent. What they don't tell you is that you will have to answer to a lead superintendent, construction superintendent and a general superintendent and the there is the construction mamager, lead construction manager and head construction manager the the site construction manager. The superintendent is just a step up from worker in their ladder."
bad,"The new Head of Kiewit Technology Group (KTG) is the worst boss I've ever worked under.  He was the biggest micro manger I've ever met."
bad,"Working for Kiewit means you are working 10-14 hour days, plus weekends. No work life balance and it is frowned upon to take days off at the peak of a job. People you work with are great because everyone has to deal with the same stuff."
bad,"No work life balance."
bad,"Although the company boasts of retention bonuses and premiums for first aid certifications, and 3 years worth of work, you most likely never last longer than 2 weeks. And if you do, don't expect to see any extra money."
bad,"Long hours (minimum 60 hours per week, stretched up to 75 hours a week regularly) with no additional compensation for salaried employees after 40 (you work for free from Thursday at noon on through the rest of the week usually), Work can be fast paced and engaging/fulfilling but always comes at the price of excessively long work hours and minimum six day weeks, tons of PTO but not enough staff support individuals taking, Field engineers coming in and out like a revolving door - most do not make it more than a year. Great company if your craft, especially if you are working a union job, new tools, constant support for safety equipment, etc. Unless your high management or an hourly employee it's difficult to talk yourself into getting crushed on work hours."
bad,"Kiewit is a thriving company that has a lot of employees, but lacks diversity. If you look to challenge things, they push back and won’t allow for course to teach diversity to others."
bad,"I did not like middle management, overall company was good and tried very hard to develop employees.  Relationships depended deeply on what location you worked out of."
bad,Good group of guys to work with. all pros. There work hard and get the job done. Learnt that i didn't want to be apart of the politics there tho.
bad,"Gezellige werkomgeving met fijne mensen, Ze helpen elkaar als sommigen niet gedaan hebben met werk."
bad,"The company was nice but just as any job, it has its ups and downs. The hours were good. The pay was good. Management was okay, some guys were better than others."
good,"Its a great start to begin in the PC Sales and Service, and working with users and their issues."
good,"Prepare to work easily 50- 60 hours a week. Never be able to settle down in one location, because “go where the work is.” However, there is tons of employee social events after you get done spending all day with the same people instead of your family."
good,"You are a number and if you don;t ""play the game"", you won't succeed. Typical for many large companies, yet deviates from their people focused organization.  As with many large companies, they will select to token YES men/women to promote.  Long hours, rarely compensated and ""bonuses"" should be called tips.  The bonuses, six figure and up, are given to the executives.  The majority of those doing the work will receive several thousand before taxes, usually 30-40%."
good,"In the beginning I truly enjoyed the job and the team whom I was working with.  Initially, I had one good trainer, but following, I received very vague instructions the majority of the time.   "
good,"Kiewit Western trained well their people, I learned estimating, team work, organization how important is record keeping and cost tracking. I did not envy the very long hours which included weekends."
good,"Was moved around multiple times within 4 months of being there, Management at different locations was very rude and worked you 100+ hours a week.  As well as said things without being educated to the matter which were beyond crossing lines and borders of professionalism.  Co-workers depending on the job could be nice or completely rude.  Hardest part of the job the hours and lack of encouragement or support to get things done.  Most enjoyable part, well there wasn't one."
good,They try to manage with an iron fist and promote people before they are close to being ready. They have a good game plan at the beginning of the job but everything soon falls apart and the blame game begins.
good,"Bused in and out of site, you would think that it is good , but in reality its not. You don't get home until 630pm after working since 7 am and being on t bus for 40 min before that. Weekly pay was nice. Typcial Industrial Job, lot of brown nosing and  ego fuel ed managers. The head of the electrical department is run by a mechanical engineer that likes to bully people"
good,"They treat their employees OK"
good,Management is poor and won't even care about you as long as you are giving them what they want. Moving up the latter is almost impossible since people keep leaving the company. The more experience guys have been in the same position for 5+ years.
good,"Fast paced work environment. interesting work everywhere, opportunity to transfer between districts. competitive pay. Always something going on and something to do. Easy to network throughout the company and between districts"
good,"If your not from Nebraska, you get nowhere.  They like recruiting from their home base in Omaha.  People from there, get promoted fast."
good,Strong work ethic but comes at a steep price. Long hours and no reward. Career advancement is very hard unless your buddy buddy with one of the managers. A lot of micro management. Feels like your just another number in the equation.
good,"Locations are mostly remote construction sites.  Training and safety are top priority.  Work starts at 6 am mostly, ends around 6 pm mostly.  Good people to work with, management is somewhat distant.  Good place to learn the construction trade as training is continuous."
good,Not paid enough and lack of confidence with management. Its hard to watch a company dump thousands of dollars down the drain because of egos and not will to take advise. Not sure if all projects are like this.
good,"Not enough Indians.  Good ol boy club. Want you to do unsafe things and when you decline you are given laborer type jobs, and they set you up to get rid of you. Not even 40 hours."
good,Management has a lot of favoritism in it's decision making and promotion decision making. Very safety centered. Supply all of the proper PPE that is required for the job
good,"Working at Kiewit was very stressful if u have a family. "
good,The expectation is to go above and beyond but there is little appreciation when you do. Poor systems to manage your work. Management would rather lie to you than tell you the truth about the companies future work potential. They are very reluctant to give you the bad news.
good,Kiewit was a very hard job at times but paid ok. Management was not compassionate to workers. I was thankful for having a job but could not wait to find a better one. Once we all found out they were relocating the yard to California we all were happy to with having to find a new job.
good,Hourly wages are low for the industry. There is a noticeable division between Craft and Staff employees. Very production driven with no work life balance.
good,poor management and poor communication . if you are not local worker you will treated poorly. i worked there and got deduction for benefit on my paycheck and received nothing for it. union is a joke there if you are not from Newfoundland.
good,"My experience was negative for the most part as I had one of the most Senior positions on my project. The company had really just began to take its first steps to implement a quality program so the program, and acceptance of the realities of having a quality program were still not fully accepted, respected or integrated."
good,The culture has work to do to keep up with the age of the workforce and expectations of the younger workers.  I don't feel comfortable stating any more than this.
good,The company as a whole is a great place to work. Upper management is generally supportive. Career development is encouraged. Benefits are fairly typical.
good,"This company is a very big company and I suppose each branch would be different to some extent from the other, but I wasn't really happy with the Calgary branch as they were not what they said would be."
good,"This is a very high demand company with little support for training or direction. The management is cliquish and quite unprofessional, overall. I would not recommend working for this company."
good,Decent place to work. long hours are expected and travel. Tons of bosses and poor communication between them. notice to relocate is normally less then 5 days..
good,Management fails to provide proper training even when asked for the training. Inconstant in what each manager wants even though the end result is the same.
good,"I have given a rating for this company, and feel it to be inappropriate to discuss why I actually feel that way . Its a great spot to if you can devote all of your time to it."
good,"Worked as an intern for KOS in 2018. The salary they offered the interns, post internship, compared to the typical work week of a Field Engineer I (60+ hrs) was a major deciding factor, personally."
good,"Kiewit isnt a bad company to work for, but the planning and design of some of the projects are rushed or inadequately designed. They preach safety as their number one priority but fail to follow up on a lot of their policies. i.e. employees are told to avoid distractions at all costs, yet you are not allowed a lunch break, so you are forced to operate equipment while eating.  No down time allowed.  More time needs to be spent on supervisor communications between crews. This is a constant problem out there there is so little pass on communication between the supervisors that many projects don’t get completed  correctly or are done wrong."
good,"low pay everyday, typical day very stressful, hardest part of the job was to keep my crew looking busy when there was work was completed and no work while waiting"
good,Drive Haul Truck for 12 hrs. 30 min lunch break. Lack of communication with other employees. Lots of favoritism. People complain about you to management about job performance instead of trying to correct the problem.
good,"If you want to move up in the company you need to move to Omaha, NE."
good,Only way to get ahead is kiss a$& in office. They didn't like when people spoke up and spoke there mind. Management would say one thing do another. Throw you under the bus any chance they got! Was a good place to work at first and went to complete sh.t past 6 months
good,I am retiring from the job at San Miguel mine in July of 2014 after 34.5 years. It has been a good place to work.
good,Requied to spend to much time away from home
good,"At Kiewit you will be on some of the biggest and most complex projects. It's hard to get promotions as the company is so large every employee is tracked by irrelevant numbering. Management is weak and constantly changing. Starting salary is good out of college, but don't expect big raises. Expect 80 HR's a week including weekends."
good,We were on the night shift for most of the schedule although we did work days a few times. The gang was pretty amiable and someone was always cracking jokes. Kiewit is a large world wide conglomerate and has projects around the world. It was winter in Canada at the time so the nights were especially cold. Met some nice guys while there. I thought the management could have been better.
good,"Working for Kiewit can be stressful and all consuming. Although the people are great, management can be overbearing at times. The turnover and relocation of employees makes this a hard place to work and feel secure in your position."
good,"It was fast paced, and learned a lot of things, and new skills working for the company. Management not very good at last job too many bosses and not enough workers and made up positions for younger people that had little no experience."
good,"This company expects a lot of their employees.  Long Hours, regular moves, etc."
good,"Low level of technical knowledge in design department increases work load for the few very experienced folks. Management is also young and some direction and decisions are questionable. Since Kiewit is a construction based company, office language can be a bit harsh. The company is continually updates schedule, budget and design tools making it difficult to ever gain a comfort level. Change is great but constant change creates ineffiencies."
good,"overall pretty safe site.  Lunchrooms were clean and well appointed.  lack of tools and required material.  Tight time frame, if planning was better less rewrk would have occurred."
good,"The company is a good company but they are after the young people. If you want to advance and you are older it is a lot harder."
good,Worked from 7:30 am to 7:00 pm or 8:00 pm. Safety always comes first.  Learned that hourly workers made more than salary employees with BS degrees.  Management was very friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was how all the different departments helped each other to help the company succeed.
good,"In my opinion, Kiewit Engineering and Design has grown too fast, too quickly.  Their management does not have a vision for the company and do not know how to grow the work load to match the staff that they have put into place.  Also, the org chart is ""management heavy"" and there are many unnecessary positions."
good,I was just a number and did not feel like career advancement was very possible.  It was a lot of repetitive work and I was not given much opportunity to be creative and put some serious thought into my work.  They had set systems in place which were hard to get used to and the systems were complex and endless.
good,"• Prepared Federal partnership returns."
good,"I worked here for over a year, the upper management would preach down rules and promises that were never backed up. They had great intentions that would be out weighed by a schedule of pushing out mods quicker.  Several employees were asked to join a ""core group"" by John Macpherson the manager, but this wasnt backed up and 90% of those asked to join were laid off with no transfers. Lots of talk of core values and what really matters but not a lot of action to back it up"
good,"Very Long Days"
good,"Avery good company to gain alot of knowledge, but not a long term employer"
good,"You better learn Spanish, because no one in the area while work for them because if you don't have a family member that's a leadman or better you will never move up.. There is a lot of nepotism here. I wish they would do that undercover boss there. work 6-7 days a week  they can't plan work .the top pay  is $20.45 the lowest in the area and if you ask for a day off a month ahead of time they say we'll see .. They need someone to come in and clean house from the leadman to upper management"
good,Kiewit is a great company unless you value family time or a good work life balance. Spending many hours at the office and at home working with no overtime or extra time off is taking its toll.
good,"decent salary, free insurance. large, ever changing yard. long hours working in the dirt (yard is limestone base)"
good,"Typical engineering firm culture - when there are projects you are treated well.  Other times, it is hard to retain people at higher levels and may be forced to leave."
good,Management was crippled by personal considerations.  Nepotism and inappropriate relationships were the order of the day. Lost the next phase of the contract because management was in such chaos and let fickle matters derail any real progress. Otherwise it was a good job.
good,Projects are almost always on a fast track schedule with 10% fewer hours than the last similar project.  Work-life balance is given lip service.  Copy/paste preferred over thinking.
good,"Extended hours, 50-60 hours/week, no OT, stock options provided to a select few, mediocre management, little career advancement, numerous skills and exposure provided"
good,"Typically design combustion turbine foundations, steel. "
good,The hours and shifts were good.  Could get overtime.  Wages were good.  Had good employee medical program.  Could go home every evening.  People were good to work with.
good,"Hardest part is balancing life and work. But if you are ok travelling, there is no problem! Project work is actually the best part. So, it is up to you to determine how you want to balance it all."
good,Worked for them as an intern. Weren't clear on communication and clear that there isn't a work life balance. Stable company with great benefits. Long term job placement if worked hard.
good,"Same construction industry mindset where the filed workers are dispensable, regardless of how long they've been with the company or their work ethic.  No benefits for field workers;  minimal pay;  no advancement for guys from the field."
good,It was dirty and dusty.  I enjoyed working there.  People were great to work with but the turn over was great.  I did not know things that they thought they told me.  I wrote things down and did what they said but sometime it was not right to them but it is what I wrote down as she told it to me and she agreed to it.  She had been doing it for so long she forgot some steps.
good,This company is for those interested in construction career long-term.  The work-life balance is not there. It can be a difficult place to advance if in the corporate office without jobsite knowledge.
good,"Offers excellent benefits and competitive salaries. Extraordinary commitment to safety and quality. An extreme culture focused on rewarding engineers and managers and bringing in new talent. Very process driven. Afforded opportunities for furthering educational development during employment. Old, extremely conservative mindsets prevail and are resistant to change. Expects you to give over 40 hours/week, so take note when negotiating salary. Managers are promoted too early without understanding work they are managing. Weak business development structure/strategy and very weak on client intelligence. Data management is behind competitors, but is in works. Hosts annual district meetings for networking and educational purposes. Company has good reputation throughout industry. Competitive environment. They are behind their competitors in many ways and lead the industry in others. Financially sound and weathers storms well. They want and reward followers. They are more focused on managers rather than leaders. They are slow to move forward except in safety and quality arenas."
good,"At Kiewit, turnover is very high. They say 3 out of 5 people leave within 5 years."
good,"Hit the ground running.  Keep running all day.  Run all the way home."
good,"You can get stuck with several small jobs, traveling the nation living out of hotels or you can hit the jackpot and be in an awesome city for 10 years... It is luck of the draw. "
good,"Always a busy day at work. I've learned how to be very patients with others, co- workers and vendors etc. "
good,"Top heavy restricted advancement, very good people to work with at the coal face that understood the environment of the workplace. A culture had developed where a  split of groups into there place of origin, this was not helpful when allocating work."
good,"Depending on if you are working at the home office or on a project could decided your work hours."
good,The district I was with has changed a lot to where the transparency and open door policy changed to where people in the company are afraid to speak to management.
good,They expect you to perform many tasks in your job and do not compensate for market conditions. Their accounting system has way too many issues and you spend each day fixing them which delays work being completed in a timely fashion. Our office culture is filled with constant tension and you wish you didn't come to work. Their all about the numbers and not the employees. I would NOT recommend anyone work for them.
good,is a company with great opportunity for growth you will get a job that is worth it and they give you lots of responsibility however the lack of respect and the long hours make this company hard to work for
good,"As an entry level engineer, I came into an environment with not a lot of training available, but a huge amount of responsibility. I quickly learned everything relies on planning. The most difficult part of the job was communication between different levels of on the job. Management had one schedule, while us engineers went off their schedule, then the whole thing changed the next day, and what you spent hours working on doesn't mean anything until 3 weeks down the road. I did enjoy connecting with the craft, actually checking all the work, and getting to use a builder's level everyday."
good,I caught a vp stealing from a client. The company responded by firing me to prevent the truth from surfacing. After all they have their reputation as being ethical on the line
good,"Peter Kiewit is a great school to learn heavy construction, coordination and discipline. It is a tough place starting to work very early and finishing very late but the tasks were undoubtedly carried out. PKS nurtures the philosophy of working in a team. "
good,If your long term goal is to be a construction manager this is a good place. If you are an engineer looking to make a career as an engineer do not work here! The good side of this company is it will expose you to all elements of construction within 3-5 years. A few years here easily leads to higher pay and a position at a better balanced company. Engineer's better not sign on here because it will ruin the start of a promising engineering career.
good,Construction sites and Districts are where the action is while home office employees are treated poorly. They hire for a career and not a job but you and your family must be open to travel for any chance of advancement. A type personalities all over the place and best if you have or can make a friend in a management position. The company is amazing but they tend to treat employees poorly unless you have or can make a connection with leadership.
good,"I had little to no training. I was put on the phone with employees looking for me to answer questions on my second day. Which I had a better training program. This would have ensured success, which did not happen"
good,It's a stable environment but not a fun comfortable one if you're on the lower levels. Upper management in my area don't know how to communicate and work together so we get 10 ideas of how things should get done. Naturally they tell you to just follow your Kiewit superiors direction but it's not the simple. It creates resentments and issues within the group due to poor management and poor communication skills. Very political and it's hard to trust anyone you work with cause everyone is willing to climb someone's back to get where they're going.  Alot of management is given by the good ole boy network rather than by skill level
good,"Work/Life balance is nonexistent. Opportunities for promotion are limited. Management is lax. Good position right out of school, but do not stay longer than three years or you will fall behind competition."
good,"Kiewit Offshore Services is a very demanding place to work. The company pushes work life balance, but has not delivered on this statement. They are slowly getting more understanding and accepting of this term."
good,Employees that have been loyal to the company should be offered a G-40. So when the weather is bad that they will have at least 40 hours to pay their bills. People are not able to [pay their bills on 20 to 30 hrs pay peroids
good,"A very fast paced, fun environment to work in when you are young. However, you quickly learn that the amount of work and personal sacrifice expected of you is not worth the compensation. Raises are rare and are really just for inflation. You will be pushed to the breaking point before any real compensation is given. There are a lot of really great people that work there though. It's unfortunate that most of them end up quitting. As far as management goes, very knowledgeable and good at managing the work. Most of them don't know how to manage people though."
good,"Decent company to work for. You don't have to worry about being laid off. That is probably the only plus for this company. Good company for Engineers, any other discipline need not apply."
good,great place to work if you work for the right project manager.
good,Has potential to move around to different locations in the US and Canada. Good work culture with collaboration between Management and the skilled workforce.
good,"Once there was a management change in 2016 the office culture and moral decreased significantly. I learned a lot from the company, but that is due to me being great at self-learning and not from training from others."
good,Things will go smoothly as long as you plan your work activities out and have a contingency plan in case operation changes short notice. Be ready to answer questions regarding your individual operational cost.
good,it wouldnt be to bad a position if everybody did there job. most people dont turn in there paperwork and that reflects the warehouse cause i have to do spot inventory constantly.
good,"Management treated workers well, salary was competitive, conditions were good. Safety standards changed from one day to the next, which made for a confusing work day."
good,"Great place for mechanical engineers to work.  Can work as much as you want, 10 hour days, and come in on weekends and holidays.  Good career path for recent mechanical engineer graduates.  2012 was like working at Facebook / Google."
good,A good company to get your feet wet in the construction industry however mid career employees may struggle to advance their career forward in a timely manner.
good,"Work on site is about 60 hours a week, but it is more enjoyable than the office. Work in the office is slow and leaves little room for advancement. Compensation is great and days are easy in the office if that's what you're looking for."
good,"When I was there, Management was very disorganized & discouraging. No support from Upper Management to Middle Management. Verbally abusive. Tough to be positive in this environment,"
good,"typical day starts at 5:30am going to the trailer to get my paperwork ready to present to my crews for the work we will perform for that day"
good,Not so good as a subcontractor pay is low for the work being done.. Agrium decides what the pay scale is and it's too low to make a descent living if you have bills before moving there
good,"Good, friendly work environment. However, job security and advancement is unstable and uncertain due to dynamic and evolving support to the construction and engineering business. There is little appreciation for information security in IT development, maintenance or overall business strategy. Career development and advancement opportunities in the Information Security business at Kiewit are very limited."
good,Good company with great working environment. Employees enjoy great camaraderie with each other. Days are long and often you are required to work weekends.
good,"In a very short nutshell..."
good,"JSA`s meetings, safety walk through, production meetings "
good,"La compagnie offre d'excellent avantages sociaux mais il est difficile de concilier vie professionnelle et personnelle étant donné que nous sommes appelés à voyager aux États-Unis et que nous devons produire des propositions pour une date/heure butoir non flexible."
good,my day was fitting stuctual material on offshore oil rigs management was ok at times just got moved around to much and had too many different bosses the best part of the job was the benifits
good,"Some areas of the company have amazing communication and commitment to success.  Others need a major overhaul.  Unfortunately, I am in one of the divisions that needs an overhaul.  People are not always utilized according to their strengths.  Communication for new employees needs to be refined."
good,"Management is unorganized, left hand doesn`t know what the right hand is doing. If better organized and managed better would be the best place i have ever worked."
good,Not a fun place to work. No team work. Managers are job scared and employees are also.
good,"-Compensation is not parallel to work hours"
good,"Typical work hours are at a minimum of 10-12 hours usually 6 days per week.  salary does not meet what it should be for the work you put in.  short notice of relocations, management tends to look down on you if you don't want to relocate, and management expects you to do the work of multiple people to keep costs low.  Most enjoyable part of the job though is seeing jobs that you have built on the news, discovery channel, and the people you meet."
good,"I am always learning as much as I can everyday at work. I learn the site, the job, about other coworkers jobs and about my coworkers. I have a great group of coworkers. I enjoy learning new things."
good,"Most of my time is spent generating staff utilization reports, budget reports for multiple departments, training staff, and conducting meetings at various levels of management to report financial results."
good,working at kiewit I started as a rigger for a boom truck and various cranes and then moved to a labourer crew working on different odds and ends for the various trades around the site.My co-workers were very easy going and made the days go by faster. The hardest part about the job was the weather.
good,-Plan the days work
good,"worked night shifts, never got to see the family,"
good,Very busy environment but fun at the same time.
good,"As a Sr. estimator, my duties were to assist with estimating issues for projects. I was never trained in the process that Kiewit used for thier estimating and had to learn everything on my own. They used methods that were no longer used in most industries. They used Excel spreadsheets for data collection only and but expected all estimators to hand total all items. I was told when I went to work for them that there were 3 ways to estimate, the right way, the wrong way and the Kiewit way. No change was accepted with this company."
good,I learned alot of new things like manlift and equipment operating pay loved the pay although i might have been too young at the time of employment i still enjoyed my time there  job finished
good,Trabalhei canada edmonton em pre fabrico na  altura todas as condicoes eram custiadas por nos dai que o salario nao era muito vantajoso o melhor em relacao ao mesmo e mais gratificante seria trabalhar em montagem
good,They don’t care about there employees. Safety yes but personally no.  My vehicle was stolen and I missed three days of work and they let me go bc of it. I have all the paperwork and proof and they didn’t let me come in and explain once I had my vehicle returned to me that same Friday
good,Working for Kiewit you will learn a ton about construction and construction. Also more importantly you will learn how to be organized and how to plan your way to finishing projects.
good,"While working at Kiewit, I was given continuous opportunities to learn outside of my job description. If you enjoy staying busy and learning new things, this is the place for you."
good,"I’ve worked here in the recent years, great people good management but no job security, and a bad joke for a union. Basically they get a project about every 4 years, wish they could hook more work here to keep the locals on the Burin Peninsula employed most off the time, the union that they have there is a disaster they do nothing for you but take your dues, the union president is a charge hand over the labor’s and takes the companies side in a dispute every time, if we could over throw the union and that joke off a president then I think that place would be a much more better place to work."
good,good place to learn how to weld they teach you and you get pay while your learning alot of work they hire alot of subcontractor from mexico its not a bad place insurance its great
good,For a state job this did not meet my expectations. Pay raises were few and most only came when insurance went up. Yearly evaluations did not gain you anything. Working hard didn't either. Most people were pleasant to work with.
good,Kiewit expects way too much out of their employees and it takes a toll at home. You have to sacrifice up to weeks away from home and often have to work 12+ hour days and every weekend.
good,"Kiewit exposes it's employees to a lot of good opportunities that advance their careers, however it comes at a personal cost. They expect a lot of hours, weekends, and in some cases for employees to work away from home for weeks at a time."
good,The company is a good company to work for but they have picks and chooses on a personal level and not on a professional level. The supervisors are put in positions not because they are suited for the job but because they know people.
good,"The hours are long and the challenges seem to be never ending when assigned to a project. The reward of seeing your hardwork pay off keeps people going. The pay is good but you work for every penny. My first few years, I felt like a number but with more responsibility, managers started to notice and care about my career development and preferences.  Great company if you would like to center your life around work."
good,Need more raises. More employee care. Corporate structure is not very solid. Ways to improve are vague. Good benefits. Good rrsp. Good experience and exposure.
good,"Sucks!  No one communicates with anyone and no one takes responsibility for anything, always blaming someone else.  Cut-throat, joke.  Terribly unorganized!"
good,"Good place to start your career with interesting work. Position was temporary contract as accounting analyst, no benefits or perks. Good work atmosphere as well."
good,Kiewit is the same as other big companies. they want the work done in a timely manner and good quality work in as little time as possible..the same as other companies
good,good company to work for if only the pay was better I believe they would have an excellent turn over rate and of retention of employees should pay better
good,"In the home office, opportunities for advancement are hard to obtain in administrative career paths.  Management changes often, and organizational paths are sometimes unclear."
good,"Very good Although some management seems to prefer a specific personality, the company strives for diversity and very much cares about their people. I worked at the Austin office where there was free food and drinks. The salary is lower than other top companies, but the benefits and culture are amazing."
good,Very low pay extremely long work week. Work you till you croak. Leadmans and formans are under standing. Always work 6 days a week. Skidocans as restroom.
good,"1. long hours but pay is fair and often you get an increase from your base salary when working on an active job"
good,They had high expectations but lacked the tools to train employees to perform to  there best abilities. There always seem to be a lack of communication.
good,"There are a lot of opportunities to travel for work or relocation, but difficult work environment to balance life and work. Can be expected to work long work days and at remote sites away from family."
good,another job in fort Murray where i was very busy none stop jumping from machine to machine even picking up rakes and shovels to get where the machine couldn't go was fun hard but all worth it
good,Good safety program. Good scheduling. Fair pay . Coworkers were knowledgeable and good to work with. Managers were easy to get along with and took your concerns into consideration and gave you fair and knowledgeable answers.
good,Great learning experience. Many opportunities to switch to different positions.had fun great location cant wait to have another opportunity with Kiewit.
good,"Good ol' fashioned hard work.  Sometimes tough, but most of the time just needed to use some elbow grease to finish your tasks.  Mostly concrete and form work."
good,"great company to work for, safety is there top priority. always learned something new every day. enjoyed going out to the yard to see the projects that were being worked on"
good,Kiewit will relocate you upon hiring with them. Be prepared for 50 hour weeks minimum with some weeks hitting 60 and 70 hours. Fast paced job and is stressful.
good,"Kiewit is more of a stepping stone, it isnt a job to always have. Kiewit is more used for experience and learning new skills and building a resume. That is all."
good,fast advancement for motivated individuals willing to work many hours. poor work life balance. one of the best construction companies to work for. great benefits.
good,"Overall, good company to work for.  Can be difficult to manage work/life balance with demands on employees. The people I have worked with have been very enjoyable and have the company's best interests as a focus in their day to day activities."
good,"typical chained to your desk work mentality. weird psychological bullying happening. though they tend to hire pretty awesome people, just the culture was not conducive to growth/happiness"
good,A great place to learn project management.A challenging location that will expose you to the many aspects of building Offshore Oil and Gas projects. Many good people to work with.
good,"Kiewit is a large company."
good,"Tough job with a high demand on the employees, but lots of opportunists to advance and move to different positions (about once a year it seems at lower levels). Field staff work long hours and most Saturdays."
good,Working for Kiewit is very opening and you must be very mindful and you learn a lot there are very friendly people and co workers that make you feel like you are in a safe work environment but the upper management abuse there power
good,"I was stuck in the middle of nowhere working 70hrs a week to make schedule. It is nonstop go from 6am to 6pm daily. You also have to work most weekends as well. The relocating and travel did pay well but wears you out overtime. If you have a family you might qualify for TDY which would be a big help, but I wouldn't count on it. Seeing loved ones once every couple months is a tough way to live."
good,"Working with Kiewit on the highway1/port mann bridge improvement project was great. I was hired right out of school and the training they provided me really helped me considering I did not have any really previous work experience as a Surveyor. I was on night shift for the majority of the project because the road work couldn't be done during the day. I was put in charge of the major road milling and paving projects using specialized survey techniques such as the first 3D milling machine using total stations and DTM files. On our off days we would do a lot of layout and monitoring. I also completed the majority of the projects lazer scanning of highway elevations and overpasses. The management was often very disorganized but it worked to my advantage because it forced me to make my own decisions and learn new things on my own.  The hardest part of my job was the hours. I love night shift, that was not the problem. The problem was we were having to do 6 and 7 day weeks almost all the time, especially during the nicer months for weather for paving. But, it also was an advantage because of the hours we were able to bank. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was my first surveying job and once I broke through the learning curve it made work a lot more fun knowing exactly what I was doing. I felt accomplished."
good,The only problem I didn't really like is the long one hour drive to work everyday back and forth to camp. It just seems very unnessacary.
good,hard work learned a lot ok people to work with not enough training did not explain about important stuff. needs better communication
good,"Was a labor hand, received good benefits after 30 days of work. My co-workers were a good bunch of people that became friends. Would go back to work with company, if asked."
good,there are good facilities at camp and i enjoyed the work. Company lost the contract and was only employed for one month. good safety and work ethics.
good,"Day of Work: In the field average 12 Hrs per day"
good,In my opinion Kiewit need better Management skills.  Lack of training. The co-workers on my team need inter personal skills.  The hardest part of job was the communication between team members.  I enjoyed building work packs for the field engineers.
good,"I learned a lot about large scale concrete construction. Unfortunately, most of the employees were very stressed out and didn't have a healthy work-life balance."
good,"typical workday with my receiving from like 40 receivers on material we have received for our current projects /overhead. In between researching any invoices waiting to be received to be paid, or researching lost material.  I also have to research unpaid invoices as to whether or not material was received and who signed"
good,"There are some definite perks to working here, including competitive compensation, annual pay increases and paid time off, but  there is very poor work/life balance."
good,"Good place with a strong safety culture."
good,Good management and I have learned how to operate heavy equipment.  The hardest part of the job is to stay awake at night and driving on a long dark road.
good,"Enter information into spreadsheet and update information"
good,"My typical day at work involves supervising construction activities. More detail regarding construction activities are listed in my resume."
good,"Liked working for Keiwit had personal differences once facility senior management changed. There were a great group of hard working individuals. The team of individuals I personally worked with were hard working, dedicated and conscientious."
good,The best thing about Kiewit is the employees everyone there is very friendly.  Sometimes they are too focused on getting the job done and not their employees though.  You can be working 12 to 14 hour days regularly at times.
good,sucks that you have to depend on the weather. operations are poorly ran
good,Payed well but had to work long 12 hour shifts. Having satellite radio in all the trucks made it much more bearable.
good,"good schedule, dirty work, decent pay, very diverse group of individuals"
good,"got to travel to Canada"
good,If you're not a golden child you won't get very far...they definitely play the political favorites.  If you're not that AGGRESSIVE person...but a person who comes to work everyday and does their job..you won't get very far.  That doesn't go very far with this company.
good,"Administrative is highly depended upon, but not compensated equally."
good,work life balance and good training is imparted. This is a good experience for any professional.
good,Good people to work with but so many hours; you barely have time for family
good,"I worked on the border fence project in El Paso, TX. In a typical day I would help with the orientation of new employees by assisting with the drug test. I would also create files for new drivers, screen safety videos, go over safety procedures with new hires and research driving records. Weekly I would go over environmental compliance issues and Department of Transportation compliance records and identify employees that were due to become non-compliant in the near term and notify them."
good,"busy days , u have to ask lots of questions to learn anything ,management r there to run a business and they do exactly that , co worrkers r good hardest part of job is seeing good employees being let go for bad mistakes and not givin them a second chance ,enjoy running all equipment"
good,My co-workers are great. The food is good and the accommodations are clean.
good,"Co-workers and projects make this an enjoyable work-place. Management is accessible, but rarely acts on problems unless the decisions come from higher up."
good,"I learned many new terms regarding to the oil sands.  "
good,I had to leave the company for lack of work. Apart from that it was a good company
good,"Huge company, lots of opportunity to move up if not lost in the crowd"
good,Real flexible with hours. Family horiented.  Have learned to work in different department to be able to be busy at all times.
good,experience was good. learned how to file maps. there was little direction but I managed to catch the hang of things quickly. 
good,"Good place to work, flexible time.  Earn vacation quickly.  Great 401k program."
good,this was a good company to work for big on safety and extras for the employees
good,10 hr shifts
good,"Its ok,,,,, good for advancement"
good,"Reasonable work load. Work issues handled in a timely manner. Was promised a job for life when hired. When the last recession happened the company was forced to cut back the work force. No problem with that except I (along with several other people ) was promised a return to work when things picked back up. Never happened. Phone calls, e-mail etc. to the company were never answered."
good,"challenging environment, ability to work with a diverse group of people"
good,"Overall it is a good place to work. Employees are required to put in long hours, but have great benefits in return."
good,"If this is your first job out of college, and you are willing to travel/relocate, you are in luck.  This is a prime job for someone willing to put in 100% and learn different aspects of a job."
good,"The quality of work I was doing was great, management was not. Did not care for your needs just your expectations. Felt pressured into moving around the country regularly, passive aggressiveness was seen daily through the manager."
good,Steady work pace without being overwhelmed. strong safety driving culture but not very forgiving. They do show appreciation to their worker in the form of give aways and bbq.
good,"I enjoyed getting to know the comapny, large organization globally. Many gents drag up often chasing higher pay hourly or per diem, So constant openings in some areas,"
good,"Worked with a lot of great people in El Segundo, CA. The only downfalls is you put in long hours and have to travel constantly around the world. A good job to get right out of college."
good,"Problems outside work can bring your career with Kiewit to a close with no chance of return. Managers support other managers, not the workers reporting to them. Promises are made to clients with no regard to the people doing the work to keep the promises. There's a sad divide between management and their staff. Human Resources treat you like the title of their department; a resource. If you are struggling outside of work and communicate that they will still dismiss you if you cannot continue giving 100% while dealing with life."
good,Kiewit is a great company with great opportunity but you must be willing to work 60-80 hrs per wk and not receive overtime pay if youre salary. The benefits are great but you will always be asked to relocate for your entire career. If family life is not important to you and you would like to travel from city to city throughout your career then Kiewit is for you.
good,Kiewit provides tons of experience in many fields. Being in contracts initially opened my eyes as to how contract management works and the many different types. Structures is a fun experience because nothing is the same ever. There is always something different going on and problems to solve in the field.
good,It was a good company great job and breat people to work with management could have been better but wasn't that bad just a lot of uncertainty came with it
good,"Great colleagues, able to work with great people. Was able to learn more about procurement from the perspective of a construction/engineering company versus a utility company."
good,A good place to work if you live close by.sometimes safety gets to the point of being ridiculous but overall they are looking out for everyone's best interests
good,I learned several things about industrial construction at my work.The work volume is very high and stressful so you will learn several of skills needed in the construction industry. If you are looking for a place to soak up knowledge about all sides of construction this company will provide that.
good,"working in the mod yard in Edmonton was great and the guys running it did a great job. Working out of town for them though was a lot different, the organization was terrible and the would layoff people and then tell the they screwed up and hire them back on in the same day"
good,"It is difficult to get the training you need to do your job effectively. You will be overworked and will have to work 45-60 hours consistently to get the job done, with no overtime pay if you are salaried. Benefits are great."
good,"average company at many levels"
good,It was a good place to work with high job satisfaction.  The work was outside in South Texas which means high temperature and even higher humidity.  The area I worked we were required you to work six days a week and nine hours a day.  The people were nice and professional.
good,"7a.m. to 6 p.m. job, 8 days on and 6 days off. "
good,Success at Kiewit is based primarily on latching onto the right managers. Their promotion is your promotion.
good,Good Job for someone getting out of shop work or right out of school 2 experience how it is 2 work in the field low pay at $20.45 it's low for the work you Put in the pipe welder have a really good leadmans best out of all the other crafts with a good management for the welders if the top pay for the welders went up this would be a good job over all
good,I enjoyed working here and gained more experience in construction engineering. Drawback is that company needs to improve in their culture at the work place and allow more diversity and inclusion. Estimated percent of minorities working here is just about 5-7%.
good,Kiewit has great workplace culture and takes care of its employees. It is a company that invests in training and furthering employee learning. There is also a program in place for career advancement.
good,"The people are great and want to do something great, but management doesn't know where to get answers for people to do their job efficiently.   becomes frustrating because you are guessing 80% of the time.  They desperately need Training and Procedures in place."
good,"The benefits fall with the ""family"" mentality, you receive a lot of responsibility very quickly, but that comes with the cost of long hours and stressful work"
good,Started out as a great place to work and then our home office started taking a lot of the tasks away from us.  Asked to be moved to different job within group and I was always over looked.
good,Liked working here because it set me and my family up for a while. Camp was great and it was probably the best camp I have stayed in
good,"Kiewit is a very diverse company and has a lot of great places to work in and out of the country, but its not conducive to sustaining a family of your own. Advancement opportunities are there but in my experiences they were just titles without being compensated. I completely moved 9 times in my four years and not knowing how long I would be somewhere was troubling, for a single person with no responsibilities this could be your type of adventure but keep in mind this company keeps its well paying salaries for the internal ""family"" members."
good,"Excellent leadership and development in project management field. Fortune 500 Company for several years now. Excellent job security for sustained employment. However it's best for entry level employees or senior level employees. There is a bit of a gap between new-hire and advanced experience where personal needs (IE settling down, and building a family) tend to be hindered due to the constant moving and relocating between projects."
good,"This place was full of experience, Fast pace. employer friendly. Great learning experience for new welders. Season welders developed their skills and was an enjoyable place to work"
good,"This company went from success to mess.The management was in constant change. The managers had no clue what they were doing. "
good,"Kiewit is constantly bidding work all over the US. So, working for Kiewit means a strong commitment to the company. Family second."
good,"its was a good place to work, but something of the things that went on didn't make sense.. they would get rid of anyone having an opinion. they got rid of good hard workers.. formans that had the highest numbers at the end of the day.. it was f'd.. Lots of paper work JHAs and such I did a lot of welding.. but if there wasn't any welding to do I was doing any kind of work electoral, pulling cable and such.. kinda odd but its was work."
good,Kiewit is a to place to learn multiple skills and develop your career by advancing through the ranks. The hours are demanding which may hinder the work life balance.
good,"Kiewit is a great place for new engineers to ""get their feet wet"" within the industry but maybe not the best place for more experienced individuals to work as their salary level are subpar when compared to the competition."
good,"Kiewit has definitely been a place that has put all my skills to use! Be sharp and ready to work. Do that and you'll go far in this company. Due to the wide range of industries Kiewit is a part, you'll get to meet a wide, wide variety people from every corner of the world."
good,My position at Kiewit was both difficult and beneficial. You have to put in the time to make the most of your carrer.
good,"This is a great company, but it is not for everybody. If you are looking for a place to settle down and give everything to one company, then this is the place for you. "
good,"Kiewit is a great place to work because you learn to be the best in the business, compensation and benefits are great, the jobs are among the largest engineering and construction efforts in the country, you get to travel a lot, work with like-minded people, you're given great responsibility, you get to do really cool stuff. The downfalls are the type-A personalities make it a cold work environment, you'll never feel as though the company cares about you, long hours and at least some weekends are always required, the company moves forward like the huge machine that it is, you can't go very far in the company unless you're single or you have a spouse that can easily uproot and find a job in a different state at a moment's notice. The saying is ""we go where the work is."""
good,They took good care of me while working for them. Camp job but the hours were reasonable with a fly in fly out rotation. Learned a lot and was given chances to expand my skill set
good,"While working at Kiewit Ingleside, TX, in the maintenance department, seems to me that the responsibility for keeping all welding machines and incoming power online by the maintenance electricians should warrant better pay."
good,Typically required 10+ hours of work a day to maintain construction schedule. Management styles can vary widely depending on age and education level and job satisfaction is highly dependent on management.
good,Kiewit was a good place to work.  I learned more about teamwork and working independantly.  Management was  very good and helpful and the workplace was great.  It was a high paced position during the recruiting seasons.
good,Learned something new each and every day.
good,"Felt there was jealousy when coming into the company as I had strong procurement background. "
good,The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines which are not reasonable. Management style varies wildly from district to district. Benefits are alright though.
good,"Great work not enough pay, good hours, time off. Would be a excellent job if the pay was more. Workers are very fun to be around. Easy to get along with."
good,"Kiewit is a good company, their EIT program is very good."
good,"Typical day was greeting incoming guest and staff.  What I learned was prioritizing my work schedule for the day to better the company and my work ethics.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people daily and working alongside some of my colleagues and learning from them.  "
good,"The environment was great. Planning was good, and the amount of help was ample"
good,Great insurance offered. Under paid employees who are overly certified.  
good,Safety management is best where I have ever known. Salary and benefits are very good and with good life balance. Quality control is so so.
good,"Detail oriented work environment "
good,"A typical day at Kiewit at the Module Yard in Sherwood Park was an adventure from Day one. As an electrician I was given duties that I was able to accomplish as well as challenges. You usually get split up into groups and you may put heat trace on the module or do grounding chores or put in cable tray as needed. It is an Industrial Environment so you have to be ready for anything. The safety culture is good and so is the management team. The hardest part of the job is your going to get dirty sometimes you have to be a welder's helper and even layout part of the Module so the Welder can  "
good,bad management. management won't listen to employees. they don't show appreciation to employees. their benefits are expensive and aren't very good for the size of the company
good,"Teach you the things you need to know to get the job done.."
good,"Shareholders typically control everything, and it takes 10 plus years to become one. A lot of clicks within different districts, and if you like focusing just on work and not socializing this is not the job for you."
good,"Kiewit as a whole is a great company, unfortunately the Executive and Director level Leadership within the Technology Group can hardly be called Leaders. It's still very much a good ol' boy place to work, with people mostly being rewarded for previously working at West Corp. The VP of IT seems to have a good idea of where he wants to take the org, but he clearly hasn't figured out how to get his direct reports on the same page. The company boasts all of its efforts in investing in their people, but the technology group doesn't really have a good grasp of how to do that effectively. "
good,"Kiewit is a good place to get a start. There are however limited opportunities for advancement. Benefits are great, pay is horrible. You get to work with lots of great people, but management is completely clueless as to the needs of their employees as well as where the company is even heading. They claim we are not in the oil and gas industry yet we are always affected by the sudden downturns."
good,"days are never the same, co workers are what helps get through the 4/1 swing, most enjoyable part of the job was the job scope itself"
good,Good place to start for getting experience with heavy equipment parts.It helped you learn how to deal with the public.
good,"Everyday was nonstop from start to finish. Everyday presented opportunity to overcome challenges and problem solve. It was uncommon not to learn something new everyday. There was a fantastic group of co-workers who were more like friends and many family. Work days always passed quickly due to being busy. The hardest part was not being able to settle down, establish roots,  and become a part of a community."
good,"Minimum training given, with that if a mistake was made, no work was given after that.  Was not able to redeem self to show that you could do the job."
good,"This is a great company if you are single. They preach ""work/life balance"" but don't practice it. This company has one of the highest divorce rates amongst construction companies. Aside from that, the pay is great as are the benefits."
good,They are a really great company to work for if your just starting out in the industry and dont want to feel too encompassed by the grand scheme of things. The work is pretty steady but does fluctuate from 48 to upwards of 70 hours towards project completion. Expect to either work four ten's and an eight hour shift or 13 days with one day off. There isnt really any in between.
good,Kiewit is a good place to work very safe but also kind of under paid for Kos workers there's a big problem with language barrier with the language barrier being the way it is it does kind of make it a little unsafe
good,"Just like any other EPC engineering firm."
good,"Work life balance is severely suffering. Long hours with minimal recognition for most people. Industry leading experience however."
good,I loved working with kiewit so many expirences good vacation days so many benefits and all the leadmens doing it their job every time it's a great company thank you kiewit
good,"Kiewit offers great salaries and benefits, but the culture is either a hit or miss. There is an elite group that runs the entire company that you either are or are not a part of. This causes tension on the ""lower tiers"" of the company. Some mid-level managers fight desperately to rise in ranks and thus treat their co-workers terribly- using any and all tactics to rise. Some people plain do not care about the hierarchy (""its just a job"" attitude), and the others just quit. There is little to no socializing at work. If you want to catch up with a coworker, you've got 5 minutes at the coffee machine in the morning or very few minutes at the tail end of a meeting, then it's off to the cubicle for you! (Intimidation is a very common tactic for keeping employees quiet and in line).  "
good,project management was horrible. not  enough tools for the job horrible welders lots of repairs. management is horrible to deal with
good,good company overall but calgary branch need to clean office first.management bad very bad .job site not as safe as have to be they ask to much from people fr not reasonable money .
good,"Good safety culture"
good,"you work probably 3000 work-hours a year compared to a normal 2000 work-hour per year job. the compensation is not that great, you pick up and move quite often with no real heads up."
good,"Good safety culture. No security unless your staff. Lots of work opportunities, but are trying to cut cost by hiring local. Cutting out flights. All new equipment"
good,"Overall, Kiewit can be a great company to work for; but be prepared to move and play the politics it you want to advance. Not a great company to work for if you have a spouse with an established career as Kiewit expects employees to go where the work is at the drop of a dime. As with any large company, there are a lot of politics and promotions can be largely based on who you know rather than what you do. The company really does strive to train its employees; however, it is a sink or swim company. You're expected to be a rock star and won't get any special accolades for it but will be reprimanded if you're less than a rock star."
good,"Responsible to show up in time to work. Communicate with team of assignment and make a game plan. Proactive and engaged to work assignments, energetic to complete task, lay out construction assignment read and understand plans and surveying hubs, offsets and benchmarks, worked around heavy equipment, power tools and surveying tools. Communicate with employees, engineer and keep a daily report . Interpret plans and specifications. work with inspector to make sure construction is done accordance to plans, accustomed in working flexible and long working shifts and performed work safely. Workplace culture is a very professional and strict. The hardest part of the job Is probably is to keep up with the project schedule. The most enjoyable is when project is completed."
good,"a typical day at work consisted over general electrical duties followed after a morning PTI, i learned most of my experience in industrial electrical from the company. met some great upper management to look up to and learn from, worked with various people all over the world. the hardest part was communication the most enjoyable part was on spot problem solving"
good,"A typical day is busy, but you learn a lot. It was never-ending learning and change, but if you are the type of person who likes that, it was fun!"
good,"Safety culture was great. Any and all training was paid for and provided by the company. lots of job perks, like travel, lunches and staff functions"
good,"I was hot in the face by high pressured liquid it burned me and I was denied it had happened but was sent to the hospital, Renfrow brothers was brought in to help clean up but   they did nothing to see."
good,Company focuses on large scale construction projects in all sectors.  If you like travel and would like work on unique projects this may be the place for you.
good,Its actually a great place to work. Company really cares about its people when it comes to safety. The only downside would be the time spent away from the family.
good,At the Metropolitan Water District I worked for Kiewit for two years
good,"Relaxed, Very OH & S complient. Management seemed to be knowledgeable. Great team to work for in KEARL Lake at Imperial Oil Project. Weekly rewards for Safety."
good,Need more money and there no hrs in KOS its a great company i get to learn a lot of stuff and get the job done by good communication it has very good employees that know how to make the project on time and with quality
good,"unlimited work opportunities"
good,"Learnt some stuff and got to do hands on......"
good,Kiewit is a good start to a craft career they don’t pay very well compared to other companies but they train you in your craft from the ground up and provide you all your tools and PPE plus they have good benefits and a lot of paid holidays. 4 10s and 2 8s so you really only had Sunday’s off which makes planning for things difficult it’s good to start your craft till you’re experienced enough to go somewhere with better oay
good,"Not the worst place to work, but having started at 18yrs old I can’t complain. There are only a handful of very good supervisors, and superintendents I won’t lie, there are also a lot of some who could care less and some in between. There is a severe lack of managerial communication, as well as lack of work planning."
good,Kiewit is a good place to work. I feel they care about their employees and and are flexible to work around non-work appointments.  I feel Kiewit is an ethical company and has never asked me to record any transaction as something they were not.
good,Really enjoyed working at Cherne/Kiewit.  The only problem was that the work was not not always fully coordinated between the admins.  Many of the wrong admins received recognition for what someone else did.
good,"Lay offs are inevitable. If you are looking for consistent work, look else where. Good benefits. They promote from within. Union is the best perk!!!!!!"
good,"Good place to start your career, demanding hours and sometimes stressful. Position was temporary contract as Engineering Clerk, no benefits or perks. Demanding deadlines"
good,KOS is a great place to get into the construction industry and to learn a craft. They have a great benefits package. But as you advance in experience the pay rate is very poor.
good,Kiewit is a good place to start your career.  After a few years the low pay raises and unlikely promotions make you unlikely to stay.  Depending upon your manager work can be 60 hours a week or 40.
good,Kiewit is a great employer with fantastic benefits. The company will want employees to move frequently as it is a construction company.  Work hard and play hard type atmosphere.
good,"Kiewit has high demands on its employees, as does any construction company, so you have to really enjoy the work there and it has to fit with you. If you don't love the work, it will weed you out eventually, but if you enjoy the work them you'll fit right in and feel at home."
good,I had a good experience working there at the Lenexa offices. The staff is smart and most of the people wanted to be there. This is the end of this review
good,I loved my job. I loved outreach recruiting to provide the best talent and give opportunity to those that did not ever think they could get a job and career in the industrial construction field.
good,"you will learn a lot working here. teams usually are very balanced and capable to take and complete any job. company not only encourage innovation but it try to provide the means."
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to discuss technical situations to managers with no prior technical experience.  The benefits are great but the compensation is way to low for the amount of work required.  Great use of PTO which allows for a great work/life balance
good,"Work hard and care about what you do, and you will be well taken care of. Expect some long days and weeks, and expect equal compensation with free things, plenty of paid time off, and promotions."
good,"Kiewit is a great company to work for, the work itself is good, people are great, atmosphere is relaxing which allows you to focus on your work. Flexible company."
good,"You learn a great deal, but the work life balance is brutal. You some times have to work 13 days straight. It takes a long time to see the good compensation for your worl"
good,"I like working as a team"
good,"I feel it is rather unusual for a temporary full time position to grow from 18-months to almost 5-years, but it was definitely a unique journey!  "
good,Serious about Safety. The Engineers seem to burn out quickly due to work load/ quality of life ratio. Craft are unionized. Over all good people and good work environment.
good,A great place to work with a good bunch of guys. Varied work with sometimes pressing deadlines but plenty of support to ensure targets were met.
good,Good people to work with. Fun to see the day to day changes to the projects. Need for accurate reports. Very big on safety and quality
good,Kiewit is a good company to work for.  They are very much into continuous learning and provide training often. Kiewit offers great benefits packages and competitive salaries.
good,"Low pay, great benefits, decent work life balance, management is ok not great though. Good place to start your career and get a big player in the construction world on your resume."
good,"A constantly changing work environment, usually went to busy part of bridge where work needed to be completed to in a timely/workmanlike manner very challenging and physical at times but overall loved the job,definitely learned how to organize tasks from most important to least loved watching the bridge grow over a 2 year period and enjoyed teaching apprentices and under skilled tradesman the skills i have picked up over the years"
good,"Enjoyed working here while the job lasted."
good,"Kiewit is a great company to work at, I was hired to help transfer information from old accounting system to new software.  We are almost complete and now only need one reconciler for a couple more months and old software will not be used."
good,Not bad if you're right out of college without any experience. Which Kiewit prefers so they can send you traveling 90% of the time without notice.
good,"Very good - I would highly recommend.   I would also think that the feelings are mutual."
good,Safety is foremost.  They take pride in there safe work practices.  Salary and benefits are also very good.  Good company to work for.
good,Had a chance to help with the fabrication of the KFTT project at Kearl Lake and learned a lot of nessecary skills to help me in advancing in the electrical trade.
good,"Kiewit is a great construction company, one of the best in the United States. If you are interested in working on large complex projects, this is the company for you. They have a great benefits program and  really vast network of people you can reach out to for help/support. I've truly enjoyed the networking and ability to travel and see the country, I've met so many wonderful people."
good,"i liked worked there, but i had to leave because i was returning to school, they dont have part time jobs. a side from that i really like working as a piping technician, i learned new things, that i might not ever use becuase im gonna be a nurse, but, yet it is really fun & the people is always willing to help you learning new stuff"
good,"work life balance is so so"
good,"Kiewit does quality work at reasonable cost. It's too bad they don't take a stance on environmental/sustainability issues, instead deferring to meeting the market and complying with existing regulations. They would rather spend money on Republican political contributions than pushing the industry forward."
good,"Joint venture project with Kiewit and TIC (The Industrial Company) building an innovative CCR (Coal Combustion Residual) project. "
good,"Get your work assignment, get your tools, and have a fun time."
good,"Day starts early, meeting to plan job, meet with superintendents and project managers to line out weekly progress."
good,"Peter Kiewit Infrastructure PMH1 Upgrade Project:"
good,The work place was good. The people were good to work with.The experience of travelling to the north was a learning tool. working with different cultures was very good.
good,"i have learner alot in this position as a timekeeer, the project is coming to end. Looking for something where i can be able to advance."
good,"Great pay, hard work but well worth it. Safety is #1. Management is very disorganized and needs work."
good,"As the Office Engineer I was responsible for developing submittals, managing traffic control (Setups, Maintanence, and Traffic Control Plans), overseeing our survey sub contractor, overseeing the quality control sub contractor, and was the job closeout coordinator. About 60% of my day would be spent outdoors while the rest was spent indoors."
good,"Looking back on my experience building estimate schedules, I cant help but think about the things I would change now. Then, I was an extremely green scheduler who was thrown into the fire mainly because I had worked with primavera before. After being exposed to more practices, methodology, and tools I feel that we can get away from just jamming the cost and man power required into a schedule and build a plan supported by the production rates needed and the cost to support it."
good,"Challenging work, good pay and excellent benefits, many opportunities to learn various aspects of the business.  Management is good, makes noticeable effort to take care of employees, at times it can feel like a person has to many bosses.  Coworkers come from all sorts of backgrounds, for the most part easy to work with, team oriented. "
good,"Twice a year we had a safety rodeo meeting which thought us about safety at work place and also played games like at the end and BBQ."
good,"Not the best place for a person with a family.  Very long work week. "
good,"Digging 75 ft. tunnel down to old sewer pipeline.Rebuilding of old sewer pipeline,lagging and housekeeping."
good,As is true with most construction jobs you can expect to be relocated.  Great company for engineers.  Opportunities are endless.
good,"build and set forms"
good,Every workers communicate to each other very well and always secure safety measures before performing their job assignments.
good,"Large company with lots of work available.  Great crew, not a lot of advancement opportunities"
good,"Each day at Kiewit brings something different. Hours are long when working on a project leaving little work life balance. Most co-workers are good people and fun to work with, but like most companies, some can be dull and difficult to deal with. Hardest part of the job is adapting to constanly changing management. "
good,Good place to work!! Has many benefits but the hardest part is being away from family for extended periods of time since its a camp job.
good,"safety is #1 priority. overall good company to work for. benifits kicked in within first month, union is easy to deal with and access."
good,"Opperating heavy equipment. Open pit mining. Long days, long nights,"
good,Doing estimation on a large scale project like Hydro project and Highway project. Also I was superintendent for a Highway project and a Hydro project.
good,Up and coming company with management not thinking about each individual account and client. This is the only thing I saw lacking in this outstanding company.
good,I enjoyed this project not only because of the grand prize of flying out to see the live project but also the real world applications of my field of study.
good,I woke up every morning happy to go to work. I learned so such about the oil & gas industry. I learned that no matter the lack of experience I have I can learn what I need to know and more. My co-workers were the best we helped each other. They answered every question I had there even came a time that I was able to help them.
good,"good company, lots of opportunity. Held many positions and felt like a part of a larger team."
good,Good company with opportunities to learn and develop.
good,"nice to worked with this company, gained experience. sufficient salary, benefits are good. Safety first all the time, they care with the employees well being during work and at home."
good,"Kiewit's employee owned culture is great and is well known throughout the Midwest and throughout the U.S. and Canada."
good,"Great company to work for, but be prepared to work A LOT. Working a lot has its pros if you are hourly, but as a salary employee it can be hard to want to do. The company provides you with everything you need and will assist in a lot of your development as well."
good,I didn't have a lot of work to do. Spent a lot of time waiting for project to award. The employees were nice and I enjoyed my work but I needed more work.
good,Overall great company with outstanding benefits. The work to life balance ratio could be improved as its expected you work 50 hours minimum per week..
good,"great pay checks great learning experience opportunity to manage the night shift lots of experienced intelligent people, worked 12 hours a day seven days a week so not much time with my family"
good,"i have been working here for about a year , was promised a evaluation every 3 mounts , i had one and later got a pay raise ,but not since there 5 mounts later have been moved around from lead man to lead man but as a whole crew never at a place for more then 3 mounts for the lead man  to give me a positive evaluation. never missed but a few times and had a doctor excuse never late always early, complete everything handed to me or told to do if not completed i picked off where i left off and was ready for next task."
good,Good people to work with. Upper management would take the time to listen. The hardest part was getting the subcontractor to conform to our policies and procedures.
good,Good team participation and support on projects. Demanding work schedule and extended travel. Can be tough on family life if you have wife/husband and kids.
good,I would work there again in marystown had good times and memories friendly people bus rides to and from work stopped at sobeys everynight for the people that had no vehicle there. Decent apartment with laundry facilitys offerd a gym to exercise at the old shipyard and if you wanted to go shop after work a cab was only 7 bucks cant complain one bit bosses and chargehands were good too cheers!!
good,"I wasn't there that long, but I can say that everyone I worked with was frustrated with the long hours (60+/week) and they seemed to encourage travel away from family a lot.   That said, they only hire the best and seek Type A persons for their employment, which can be a very good thing."
good,"Kiewit is a really good company to work for with good benefits and opportunity to grow; however, that all depends on which district you work for. If you're just starting out this company could be a great option for either growth or long term."
good,Learned a lot about the construction business.  Met some great people.  Had an awesome time during team building events.  Puts safety first. Very dedicated to doing an awesome job.
good,"Kiewit is one of the best companies to work for, but they will demand your soul. You will work more hours than you thought imaginable, but you will learn so much and make a lot of great friends and colleagues along the way. If you love construction and spending your days building things, or want to learn, this is where to do it."
good,Good company but your manager makes or breaks you. Benefits costs have increased dramatically and budgets are tightened. Job security is nonexistent. Internal advancement/compensation policies need updated to retain talent.
good,"Overall, Kiewit is a good company to work for but hard if you have a family. You will work close to 70hrs a week and always traveling to new jobsites."
good,"I will like to work with one of the bigest company.  Where my skils and experience can be usefull...it was gratefull working with them the people was carefull in the working procedures, the foremans are good working partners."
good,"It's a great place to make money and getting in differents projects but depending on your life goals, it gets tougher and tougher with time to have a job work/ life balance."
good,"I was headhunted by a corporate recruiter, and upon interviewing and being hired in, was told I'd retire from this place. They weren't forthright about the financial troubles, and hired me without disclosing their troubles.  I do value the relationships I've developed and hope to be considered for future possibilities should the company survive and thrive."
good,"Spotting for excavators, paper work and safety toolbox, ensuring tasks are met and save for the task and general labouring."
good,"If you work for Kiewit, you must be somewhat willing to sacrifice personal time as the hours can be quite long. This would be one of the hardest parts of the job. You will however, learn that hardwork, dedication and your skills will be tested and honed so that you can move forward with confidence. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some amazing people on projects. In my position, advancement was tough as it was kind of an old boys' club. Management and the corporate structure of the company changed quite a bit during this time with Kiewit and this proved to be difficult for the employees as each new arrival wanted information in a different format and therefore broke the cohesion and flow of departments and reduced communication sometimes to the detriment of a project. However I must point out that I had worked for Kiewit in the 90's for 5 years and the management was a pleasure to work for."
good,"Good place to work if you like traveling.  Pay and benefits were good, 401k was awesome!  Would go back if they had steady work in town"
good,"-Good 1st job experience"
good,Excellent place to work when looking for learning new skill sets. You have to be able to move on a moments notice. If you stick with it you will be rewarded with early retirement. Most will not make that far do to demands placed on family.
good,"solid company,Upper management professional."
good,"Office/Project Control Engineer Technologist"
good,"Was responsible for 15 cranes and 5 zoom booms. Performed daily safety meeting, dispatched operators, coordinated with management about job tasks and maintenance with equipment repair. Performed critical lifts & completed daily time cards."
good,Company does do a great job on informing empoyees on whats going on and whats new in the company
good,"-The work day was normal, you were asigned your duties for the day."
good,"kiewit is a good company to work for. they offer good pay, 401k and good health benifits. the only problem is that if you are not a permenant employee, then your job there is done when the job is done without even a thank you"
good,"Work 60 hours a week typically in a remote location. No women, minorities, or obese people last to long. Great place to learn alot about the industry, different skills, and anything else in construction"
good,"Coming out of college, they are a great company to start your career for. They will always challenge you to take on more responsibility and give you good on the job & within the compnay training to help make you successful."
good,"Great company flexible"
good,"People were courteous and very loyal. Even though I described as a traveling circus, it is not meant as a negative.  They were very well organized coming into the area, cleaned up well prior to leaving the area and pumped a ton of money into the local economy while there."
good,"Decent company, good pay. Hard on family life working away and living in a camp. Lots of bonuses for staying and returning after turnarounds. Lots of oppurinty for training."
good,Enjoyed Kiewit and my co-workers. Unfortunately the pay wasn't able to keep me there. I did enjoy watching the rigs being built. It's a fascinating business.  Benefits were good.
good,"Great employer to work for in all aspects except for having to relocate frequently.  The benefits were very helpful and useful. "
good,"A typical day starts with a safety meeting that is structured for the day . At this time SIMOPS are discussed and the plan for the day is confirmed. From here it is usually a site tour to monitor progress from the night shift and see how the people are moving, while looking for bottlenecks to eliminate. After the tour there is usually a meeting to go to and plan work ahead of the people. Around this time we meet with the engineers to discuss upcoming work and progress. Schedule and budget talks are typically during this time. Lunch. Then another tour of the work and start the plan for night shift. Then another meeting or two and its time for night shift turnover."
good,I really enjoy working for Kiewit and it is my first experience working in a construction environment.  The project is interesting and the people have met are great.  The ending of the project means moving or finding another job.
good,"Aprendizaje constante."
good,Kiewit is a good company to work for if you're a single male. It is hard if you have a family because you have to travel and away from your family months at a time. You learn a lot and they pay well. You also have opportunities to move up with the company.
good,Very open and can do company with a good management. Focused on job completion and reporting. Work life balance needed improvement. Not afraid to train people.
good,Expected to always put work first and involves working long hours for low compensation when out on projects away from home. When working locally in the office the pay is fair and hours are acceptable. Good RRSP matching and benefits.
good,I was working as contractor. Lots of overtime. The leads know there stuff. I recommend this place. I would definitely work there again. Work with some  Norwegian for the 1st time and they are very competent. Good sense of humor.
good,was an eye-opener. They had a very safety orientated work site including the craft voice in safety (C.V.I.S) program which was well rounded and useful.
good,Company is very good to employees and the fact that it is close to home makes it an ideal place to work. wages and benefits are comparable with todays standards.
good,"Kiewit used to be better and more of a family atmosphere with employees. now everyone is just more like a number. I have bad taste about human resources and a lady that works there. still a great company, but it seems like Lenexa wastes a lot of talent and money."
good,Nice place to work with fun people and minimum stress but compensation is less than ideal and doesn't change with promotions. Management is accessible and benefits are very competitive
good,I really enjoy working for Kiewit. They provide the best training for your employees and career advancement is rapid provided you put in the work. You get to build challenging projects with great co-workers.
good,I enjoyed working with this company. They do there best to give you a good safe working environment. I would work for them again without a second thought about it.
good,"I managed a varitey of technical and occupational trades including welders, fitters, boilermakers, engineers, and machinist."
good,"The training style of the various departments I have worked in/had experience with has a lot to be desired. It's very much so a ""Sink or Swim"" mentality, unless you get ""buddied"" up with someone, who is willing to go above and beyond. When it comes to being a part of the support staff (non-engineering, design, or work in the field), career advancement is difficult. Also, if you do change departments/get promoted, don't expect to get a raise right away. They only give out raises annually and even though you are promoted they are ""performance based."" which means you still might only get a 3-5% increase from what you are currently making."
good,10 Scaffolders in all worked here. We would start with our tool box meeting and from there we would either split in half or stay as one depending on the jobs we had for the day. Everyone worked well together here and we were very productive.
good,"Great learning opportunity, you are immerse in every aspect of running a project, successful or not and you see what works and what does not. The learning program is excellent,"
good,Gave my hometown a great source of jobs and large income. Only wish it could've lasted longer. Work conditions were normal.
good,This company is a good company to work for. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers. The safety program was great.They were well organized company. I completed my job with them and moved on to another only because that is how Colorado union works.
good,"Work was merited with advancement in foreman position. Bonus features for advanced productivity. Good working functional machines. All in all ,  it was a good company to work for."
good,"Working in the various Engineering Firms across the USA has been very rewarding. Being accountable for me is the act of seeing it, owning it, solving it and doing it. I just love the work and thought processes of design. I have enjoyed meeting new people and learning various design techniques."
good,"Kiewit is always looking to make the work environment safer, the benefits and 401k are great!!!! The work life balance could be better but i love my co-workers must of them are great people and are fun to work with."
good,"You can work as hard as you want but if mid-upper management does not like you, you will not advance. A lot of favoritism. Entry level coworkers are fun to work with. 5-10 employees walk around as if they are on eggshells. 15+ do not take the time to foster the younger engineers thus leading to a high turnover rate for the Southern California district"
good,As an equipment operator i was alway bust throughout the day. working with every trade on site as well as snow clearing in the winter .
good,I learned many parts of working with different trades being an equipment operator. Kiewit is a very safety based company which made it nice to come to work knowing you could stay safe.
good,"If you like working hard, you will be rewarded nicely if you commit to working for Kiewit.  Their employee ownership plan is real and rewards nicely if you are willing to commit to the company by working hard and long hours, and moving for the job.  It is not for everyone."
good,"report to work check all floors, doors, and windows to make sure of a safe work place for staff, and safe living for residents that live at the facility. l"
good,Employees and people I work with are great. The work to life balance is a little unbalanced. Lots of hours and a heavy work load.
good,"Had a hand in most of the administration on site,  interacting with management from different countries in a team environment. Awesome company to work for"
good,An uncommon company. Kiewit is a giant and the only thing that lacks is better compensation and more international presence. The company is highly base on production and mobility. so if you're not willingly to move around it may not be the best place for you.
good,"Typical day at work would be roughly 6 am to anywhere from 5 pm to 8pm daily, Mon-Sat.  Some nights as well."
good,"I enjoyed working at this company while I was able to. Due to the oil industry right now, lay offs came out. I like my job specifically because it was not repetitive. Everyone there is very friendly for the most part and as long as you do your job, you don't catch much grief. The insurance is great, even though you have to participate in a wellness program in order to get the good rate. Overall, if offered to go back and work for Kiewit, I would probably consider it."
good,Over all the company was awesome. But there were to much politics. Pay and benefits were great. Would have Been nice is they help with out of town expenses.
good,"*Meeting at 8:15AM"
good,"Kiewit will work you long hours at a lower wage.  It offers good chances at advancement, and a great retirement plan.  It's generally a love it or hate it environment."
good,"if you show potential there is a lot of room for advancement"
good,"The safety culture here was second to none, hazard controls such as ( j.h.a,s, staart cards, and permits ) were are part of a typical day.The nature of Kiewits package meant my roles varied from week to week which I found suited me. The personel I worked with were competent and qualified which made for seamless efficient work environment."
good,I operated everything from a shovel to a Kamatsu PC 600 escavator. had multiple certifications regarding from Saws-forklifts etc. D.O.T. certified.
good,Great experience working in the mod yard for the very first time along with being around all the trades
good,"Great spot overall, job culture is great. Offers lots of challenges , and get to learn a great deal from other millwrights and other trades."
good,There was always fun to be had at work with the crew I was on. Even after I was laid off there was continued contact with the guys on the crew.  I really miss working with them. Hope one day we are all back on the same crew on another project
good,"The key to becoming the best is always being open to learn something new and never thinking that you know it all."
good,Everyday was filled with hope and excitement. I loved the fact that the company had a weekly meeting that took in concideration the well being of its employees by having a moment of stretching and excersieing.
good,"Union Enviroment, clean work. Good morale for workers. Lots of tools to complete tasks properly."
good,"Working for Kiewit was challenging but rewarding work. Very fast paced, ever changing work. Every team member was helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend working for Kiewit."
good,Long day of work but fun. Was in the middle of Texas which wasn't the best but still had good people to work with. The company valued my time and looked to invest in my future.
good,"The compensation is very good at Kiewit and the benefits offered are above average.  You must have the ability to multi-task and available to work overtime when needed,  Overall a good company to work for"
good,"Large Company so the Management forgets about the little guy  Benefits and paid time off are great.  The company has doubled in size in the Omaha over the past 8 years and a lot of the personal touches like Christmas Parties, Tickets to Events at the Qwest Center and the little things that employee appreciate have been eliminated."
good,"Employees at Kiewit are intelligent, focused, and passionate about following the company's mission and doing their jobs with accuracy and integrity. People genuinely care about the quality of the work they perform and their fellow co-workers."
good,I worked at Kiewit for over 36 years all across Canada and in New York City. The hardest part of the job was to be away from the family most of the time as most projects were remote job site with a rotation schedule (ex: 3 weeks on site and 1 week off).
good,"Good safe work culture, nice work/life balance. They have all the tolls that are required to complete a task. Kiewit offers their employees opportunity's to grow within the company."
good,Good for advancement fast paced fulfilling grate way to see the country but tough line of work long hours and quite often your working in some small to

good,Working for Kiewit was a very enjoyable experience.  I got to learn a lot about large scale construction that i hadn't seen working residential work.  A typical day lasted about 10-11 hours.  I spent the majority of my time planning work and doing QA.
good,"Kiewit as a whole is a great company.  "
good,"Great environment but less pay than what i'd like. I'm on my feet for most of the day, I do mostly dirt work and check grade. Have to work in the hottest days and even coldest days and go in earlier when it snows to do snow removal, I have learned a lot from being on this job I have been there for almost a year now. I love they have family days and your family can come see what all your spouse does at work while having activities for the kids and food to serve to all the people."
good,"Overall, a positive working environment. There is good comrodery among team members, co-workers and initiave leads. The compensation and benefits were also very fair. Expectations for qulality and timeliness of work completion are high."
good,My experience with management was exceptional. This company is full of talented hard working professionals. Expect long hours and many challenges as this company has no trouble giving opportunities to go-getters and can-do people.
good,"my job was to pour and place concrete and to patch any deficiencies at the dam."
good,Sometimes profits get in the way of safety but all in all a good company to work for. A majority of the time they promote the wrong people for the position and they end up paying for it in the end.
good,"Great time working there, too bad it was a short term contract. Learned a lot but on my own, no training provided. Great co-workers."
good,"We have a very strategic inspection duties , Working here you learn allot about Team work and allot of challenges ."
good,was there for short job it was good and I would work there again. Flights where paid for and safety was good.bus ride to site was long and came was ok.
good,"Fun place to work with great people. Offers great opportunity and excellent experience for new hires. Quite a big company, but still has that family feel."
good,"lots of room to advance and apply your potential"
good,"I work in a smaller division of the company that has not been around as long, so has a lot of growing pains.  But the company itself, is one of the best companies to work for.  The benefits are great and they really encourage health and wellness."
good,"met with Quality Team to review the day's upcoming  activities"
good,Great company to begin my career with to gain experience. With how big the company is there are things I like and do not like.
good,"Kiewit is a great place to work. Everyday you experience new and exciting challenges. Unfortunately the lifestyle can be the most difficult part of the job. If you are not willing to travel then expect to be away from your family for long periods of time. Otherwise you get to work in some of the neatest places, with some of the best people, and for one of the premier contractors in the world. The projects you will encounter and build will be innovative, exciting, challenging, and rewarding and leave you with a great sense of pride for your project and teammates."
good,"Kiewit was nice cause we were given all the materials and tools we needed. This separated them from other companies. Usually good crew to work with, for a decent atmosphere."
good,"Bosses and co-workers are great to work with."
good,Installing formwork according to blueprints and job requirements.  Installing/assembling handrail and other safety devices as required.
good,Great company with amazing benefits and culture. Only down side is that they are not extremely competitive with salary for purchasing agents.
good,"Typical day consists of Audit reviews of projects of a various nature.  The job consists of periodic travel to projects.  I review areas from financial, internal controls, to compliance standards.  "
good,"was a good company to work for ,although for unforeseen circumstances layed off ,"
good,"good company to work for ,safety is priority,accomadatioins and flights were provided"
good,"My day started at 6:30 spending 1/2 hour over job incidents that took place over the last 24 hours on the job site. we have are stretch and flex routine. calibrate the survey gear and off to our job tasks. I have learned about taking the time out to go over our safety plans which showed that the company cared about their employees to allow the time to do this.i have met many people across the country which I considered to be life time friends. the hardest part of the job was the travel from atlantic region to alberta,makes for a long day,getting there and back. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the opportunity to work for great pay,and also to work on a oil fields project,the experience was rewarding and a eye opener to how vast of a project they are."
good,I worked as an engineering intern in the office preparing bids for construction projects. I was impressed by the team effort in the Elgin office that I worked in and the staff diversity. It was a great group of people to work with.
good,Hours 7-7
good,"Learned a lot, was well paid.  The safety culture and training at Kiewit is second to none, they provide all training to complete any job safely.  They provided interesting opportunities and ranges of jobs."
good,Great company to work for if you like moving around and seeing the country. I worked there for 3 years and worked in 5 different states. They offer great pay and awesome benefits if you worked hard and consistent for them they will treat you right with pto and tdy  so you can go home every month
good,"Same deal as any camp job. I loved it from beginning to start. I didn't mind the 2 weeks in 1 week off rotation. It helped me save my money. "
good,"I started seven months ago, it has been different kind of place to work. Never worked for a company that has safety first and go home safe. It's been difficult at time and fun place to work."
good,12 hr rotation shifts. Long hours but stay busy so they pass by quickly. The sechdual is set up where you only work 14 days a month with 7 days in a row off each month. You will still recovering a pay check on your week that you are off
good,I was responsible for building up and breaking down temporary scaffold structures and responsible for assembling and dismantling scaffolding structures that allow workers to access specific portions of a building to perform needed work. I gained valuable experience and it was a great learning opportunity for me. I just felt compelled to seek a new challenge.
good,"12 hour shifts, quick paced enviroment. great work envioment and coworkers. must be able to multi task and work well with others. must be able to communicate"
good,"Kiewit is a great place to work, especially if you have interest in seeing power plants go through their entire construction cycle, and like collaborating with different disciplines to solve problems."
good,"Great company to work for, always takes care of there employees! Great benefits and very competitive wages. lots of overtime."
good,I like the work place but i am looking for something medical related so that i can get the 3 mounts internship to complete my associates. Plus they are runing out of things for me to do.
good,"Awesome team, exciting projects, I recommend it to anyone who wants a real challenge and a lot of opportunities for promotions. The culture is one of camaraderie, team work and safety."
good,"Things happen at lightning speed and adaptability is a must. Sometimes the pace impacts the strategy of work, which can lead to mistakes. A true meritocracy where good work and drive is rewarded. This drives the culture and takes away from creating supportive working relationships. The bottom line drives everything."
good,Good job and for a good cause. Water desalinisation is a good way to help with water shotages and also for drought stricken areas. even though expensive it is a great and enginuitive idea
good,Excellent team mates and fun workplace. My immediate boss is one of the best people I have ever worked with. The overall project management was extremely poor to the point it was nearly impossible to produce what I considered a job well designed.
good,Kiewit is really oriented on culture and developement of their employees.
good,i got hired as a welders helper but not once did i help any welder. i did however learn rigging and pipe fitting. with only one day off a week the overtime adds up nicely.
good,Productive and challenging with management and engineering support. A safe working environment. A place to advance in welding and fabrication skills. Job training is also provided.
good,The expectation was long hours and hard work.  Company compensated well.  Be willing to work in various conditions and ready to relocate on short notice.
good,A good company to work for and good benefits offered. This is a stable company with room to grow.  Must be open to relocate sometime during your career at Kiewit.
good,was all ok and welding alt nights and days takes time to get used to but all an all ok company they train you and show how to do your job good comapny
good,Kiewit has been a great first company for me to work for.  I have learned so much about the construction and power generation industry as well as just general professional working experience. Kiewit also gave me my first taste in managing and developing people which is a true passion of mine.
good,"Experienced building the rail, and challenged me to learn new techniques on how to operate the Gradall telescope fork lift.  What I like about the company is that Safety was number 1."
good,Overall it's been a great experience working for Kiewit over the past 5 years. I have learned a lot about the construction industry and how to participate in day to day busy activities
good,"Never a dull moment working on the gulf  in a fast paced oil feild enviroment. The daily loading and off loading of ships,  helping in the building of offshore rigs and interaction with fellow workers."

good,"Didnt mind working for kiewit, just have to know kiewit culture. Very safe environment, if you needed gear example ppe they had it for you. Good managment"
good,"every day was a little different with some thing new, we were always learning and trying to make our department better. The hardest part of the job is the time frame to get everything completed in and when ever an employee was injured. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a project was completed or when some one pointed out others that were working safely and looking out for one another."
good,Civil Technology is an excellent company to work for.. they care about their employees and are there for you whenever needed. They offer a great health insurance package.
good,This is one of the few companies that offers you on the job training and is concerned with your career.  They will place you in schools so that you can achieve your goals
good,"Kiewit is a very good company but the pay is not great.  The health benefits are very good though.  I haven't been there long enough to have an opinion on advancement opportunities but I know the culture emphasizes safety highly.  They do not tolerate unsafe activities which is a very good company trait.  They have morning stretching exercises and safety meetings.  They push productivity constantly but that is understandable because of cost issues.  Most of the managers seem to be pretty good but sometimes do not speak very respectfully to subordinates.  It is sometimes a ""rough on the edges"" culture but it doesn't take much to adjust to."
good,Great benefits and 401K. Definite room to grow and potential to work in different departments. This company is committed to excellence and quality and really commends their people for their work.
good,"Gives me lots of opportunities to learn on different methods of construction, autocad drawings, precast construction and other road works construction."
good,"i learned so much and over come some challenges  that i thought was not possible and i also made alot of friends , and got touse my people skills and work with alot of cultures it was great."
good,"If you work here be ready to be on call, even when you're not. Pay is great and health benefit's are second to none. Also employee retirement plan is great, providing you can make it to 5 years to be fully vested. Employment longevity is not so good with 75 percent of the people I have worked with in the last three years either being laid off or quit."
good,The hardest part of the job was that our department did not have any department standards which made it hard to complete jobs consistently. Everyone was really friendly and made it fun to go to work each day.
good,"The ability to work on nearly any kind of project imaginable is incredibly rewarding. You can head to a hydro dam retrofit or a nuclear power plant, a co-gen power plant, an LRT line, or the building of a new hospital, or countless other projects. The amount you can learn is endless."
good,"It was a productive place to work, i really learn a lot from every position and i had a great experience working there, they only need more management and less i am the ""friend"" of the boss and that's why i got promoted to X position"
good,"Plan for upcoming work"
good,Kiewit has always been an exciting company to work for because no day is ever the same and the bonds that are built here last a life time.
good,"High Turnover rate, otherwise great company to work for."
good,Perform job that was given to you in the morning. i did my apprenticeship here so i learned pretty much everything here. Its as good lots of people to help with daily tasks and you were given tasks to do on your own also which helped in learning. Management was good they treated their employees with respect and awarded then for jobs well done or for saving the company money.
good,"Seemed to be a bit of butting heads between Kiewit and Kvaerner, but a lot of good people on both sides of the table. The disastrous drop in oil prices created an unstable work environment, but in the 3 years I worked here I was always treated fair."
good,"- A typical day at work is managing subcontractors to meet schedule."
good,"good place to work , a stress less work enviorment, good office personnel, never missed a paycheck, great bunch of guys, would work here again"
good,I can't say anything bad about the company. Its project related so the project came to an end and there was no where to place me. I learned how to work productively with managers. I started off working there solely as time card entry. I entered timecards for the craft employees and at its perk it was about 800 plus employees. I moved up to payroll and was responsible to see that all those 800 employees were paid on time and accurately. I then was moved to the Safety Team and worked along side the safety manager who I learned was a great mentor.
good,"- I learned Kiewits system in calculating performance on an everyday basis for individual crews."
good,There was always a new challenge day in a day out while working with Kieiwt.  With something new learned every day I was always kept on my toes.  A company that preaches safety and practices what they preach.  Management has an open door policy and always makes time to listen.
good,"I enjoyed my internship with Kiewit, however I didn't do tasks that were in my job description."
good,great experience! worked in many different cities throughout USA and Canada and managed different size projects from cable stay bridges to road expansion projects.
good,This job was mainly manned by electricians from other locals (cities) it was difficult for that alone but the guys made it fun and very interesting we learned to do things in many ways since everyone did things different where they come from but yet we all got along some better then others. Management was good they were very concerned about safety.
good,"Safety is a never ending topic at Kiewit. They care about their people and invest in you. About 66% of your life is lived surrounded by people from your company, as you live at a camp for some remote work. Everyone is driven to excel in their job, enforcing a positive working environment. Management is more secluded from their people, as the opportunities in Kiewit tend to be larger scale projects."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Kiewit, worked hard and managed to move around the yard in many different aspects of work."
good,Kiewits wages are low and staff dont make decent pay unless they are voted share holders which you are not elegable for till 5 yrs but still dont hold your breath
good,"Every morning the site services team assembled to discuss the work scope for the day followed by a team stretch and flex to avoid physical injury.

good,"Typical day was preparing request for quotes on various electrical products and equipment,negotiation of contracts for electrical equipment, contract execution, vendor relations, managing preferred suppliers, and estimating support. I worked with a great group of individuals, Management support was some of the best i have ever experienced. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the unknown as to when our office was going to be closed and where you were going to be assigned. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people and clients that I worked with."
good,A typical work day is preparing and serving meal plans provided by the nutritionist for the residents according to their diets.

good,Was a good company. All about safety. Good team work and on site learning. Real hands on. Would recomend this company. It was a local 1075 labor union job so it didnt last long. Lots of lay offs.
good,"Doesn't listen to the needs of the employee, leads to good workers quitting for other jobs. Cares more about getting workers who will do anything Kiewit asks than getting actually skilled employees"
good,"The work is great at kiewit, youre supplied with all the tools that you need to get the job done. safety is their number one priority. Lack of leadership skills withe the foremans."
good,"Sink or swim environment. Those who are cut out for the industry are rewarded well and those who are not, realize it quickly. In such a large organization people can fall through the cracks so it is up to you to make yourself useful."
good,Kiewit is a solid company with a great history.  The work was challenging and offered opportunities for success.  Safety is a  cornerstone of the company.  Work life balance made for a very flexible environment.

good,I was really impressed by the safety first attitude of the top management. it wasnt just lip service it was actively promoted and enforced from CEO to Laborer
good,"I worked with Kiewit for 8 months as a co-op student and it was great other than flying in and out. I loved the work and the location but it put strain on personal relationships.

good,Kiewit had a great work culture. They had programs to make sure employees felt welcomed and free to ask questions. They also pushed the work/life balance to make sure that no one burned out.

The other sites were out of state and did not pay as much for the same position, nor did they offer per diem to make up the difference."

The work was enjoyable, challenging, a little stressful, management was awesome, fellow carpenters were even more awesome, everyone there worked hard and enjoyed the suck together so it built comraderie and  love/hate relationships. Still, I would trust each and every one to have my back, and vice versa. I wish I didn’t have to leave."

Worked heavily with concrete reinforcement design by making reinforcement keys to show the intensity of rebar required. Worked with a large team of management and staff from all over the world that came together to complete the design phase of the project.
good,"Kiewit Infrastructure Northwest has taken care of me. As long as a man or woman is willing to work hard, follow safety protocol and willing to learn the sky is the limit. A person can grow with this company. On the flip side As a superintendent you know longer receive bonuses, and as a salaried person you must be willing and able to relocate or travel with the company. This can be hard on families with school age children as you may be requested to relocate twice in a year or at least every other year. I have worked for many companies and enjoyed the challenges with this one the most. Always something different. Thanks Kiewit. It was a great run."

I was given the opportunity to work on some of the largest equipment with the best of mitigation tools, in an environment based on safety and doing the right thing at all times. I look forward to getting back with Kiewit once again. My division of Kiewit, K2 Mining, was a wonderful place to work, the shop is neat, we have every shop tool necessary to perform every task without cutting corners. The comradery amongst the men was very strong, letting you know you were part of a team. As for the hardest part of my job, I would have to say knowing when I should or should not step in to stop an unsafe act when I witnessed seasoned co-workers.doing things they shouldn't. This can always be viewed two different ways. Our motto was ""never walk past an unsafe act"" , however, the seasoned technician will be quick to tell you to mind your own business, or not to be a proverbial ""rat"". There is uncertainty in how this is viewed by your co-workers, even when diplomacy in your intervention is used to the utmost extent. However when I witness a green hat performing an unsafe act, there is no aprehension in my intervening at all, using diplomacy of course. I always appreciate any constructive criticism that comes my way, especially when I am new to a site and under new management."
good,"Kiewit is both a construction and engineering firm. This promotes diversity in their markets. Overall, very pleased with culture and treatment. Great respect and decency is shown to employees. Lots of opportunity for growth and advancement."
good,"Great company with great benefits. The benefits are incredible including the PTO, 6% 401K match, health insurance, training, and advancement opportunities. The current area I’m in does not pay what it should be compared to the cost of living. There is a lot of room for advancement and stock options after ~ 5 years. Unfortunately, you have to purchase the stock. It’s also rewarding to work on large mega projects."

It can be long hours, but for me was worth it for the time off. Pay was decent, was worth it for the experience i could put on a future resume. A lot of micromanaging, but culture and moral were high. They plan a lot of outings and lunches for employees."
good,"A typical day of work consists of a balance of production/safety/laughter"
good,Very good work enviroment but too much travel away from home. Needs more perdem for hotel and gas as well as travel. I would recommend this job if you like to travel alot but it is time consuming for your family
good,"basically do our stretches, safety meeting in the morning and write our jha for the day then receive work from our foreman for the day then we would walk down the job and gather tools and information for the task then complete the task. we would record all material used for the day then give it to our foreman at the end of the day. sometimes i would learn stuff sometimes i would not. hardest part of my work days are probally working after breaks or when i got to walk around look for my foreman because im confused or dont know what to do."
