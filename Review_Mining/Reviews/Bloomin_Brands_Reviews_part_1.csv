rating,review
bad,"Managers don't care about their employees. They take money from them, they don't pay them well. Managers can be verbally abusive. Managers don't make it an easy or fun work experience for everyone. Sometimes people would leave in tears."
bad,"This place is a disaster. Management is a joke at this place. no structure and they play favorites. Management doesnt care about anything and if they dont like you for any reason they will fire you. "
bad,"They have a good mission statement in their principles and beliefs. Unfortunately its all for show. They say their most valuable asset is their people, but after 17 years of service I can tell you I don't feel valued nor have I ever.  Carrabbas takes more than it gives."
bad,"Worse place I've ever worked......kept it so cold I had to wear thermals in july.....one manager has no idea what she's doing.....anyone that don't respect their employee enough to give them a break don't deserve great employees.....one manager slung the mixing bowl across the floor because he was mad....damaged the bowl where it wasn't use able anymore.....one more step and I would have wendown like a bowling pin......40 years in restaurants and this was the worst year of my life, job wise...."
bad,"Worst management team every. Very much like high school gossip and hang out hour. Inattentive during training. High turn over rate , poor location. Too much maaterial not enough cooperation, poor ethics when selecting employees"
bad,Not enough people dining in and low tip out amounts. Management cares more about how they look to higer up management than their servers. Working 8+ hours a day with low pay and too much expected of servers because servers constantly leaving.
bad,"Wasted 18 years of my life that I wish I could get back. Operated two of the most productive kitchens in the state for them, only to be told after 17 of those, and quitting because of a known racist, bigot, verbally and mentally abusive GM, that there was no place for me to be put."
bad,"All about the profit instead of the customer. Culture is gone. I hope they figure this out soon, too many good people to lose."
bad,"I am a hard worker and able to get along with anyone. That environment truly made my depression worse, it got to the point where I dreaded getting up in the mornings. Extremely high turnover, awful management that played favorites and if they didn't like you or you made them mad for any reason they would fire you. Management would berate servers in the middle of the kitchen. Management and staff alike constantly gossiping, I felt like I was back in high school. I've been in the service industry for 15 years & this was the worst place that I have ever worked. Don't put yourself in that position. Quit before I lost my sanity. Oh, and you weren't allowed to request time off."
bad,Hired as a server. Took them about 4 weeks for training. I have served for over a decade and the training was very repetitive and not about the job I was hired for. Save yourself a month of your life and don't bother with these guys. Very arrogant managers and on the Boulevard large opiate issue. Not a good job for a parent or for anyone who has self dignity
bad,it used to be a fun place to work but a new CEO made it a living nightmare for those who still remain there.
bad,"To many layoff's, three of them in just two and a half years.  Management and workplace culture is completely out of touch with today's corporation's."
bad,"Horrible work environment, the management wants to work with the employees but the owner will not give them free reign to do so. Breaks were unheard of and I was laughed at for asking for one."
bad,"Will reel you in with decent money, but working conditions and morale are usually low. Depending on the location advancement is more often than not unlikely; also flexibility with schedules are poor. Loyalty is almost nonexistent."
bad,Come on folks its fast food easy job we have all had a job before. What made this job difficult was the attitudes of the overall staff. Management lackes any authority over staff and the staff came to hang. Raises don't get handed out and if they do watch your check might have to wait a month or two.
bad,"Horrible company to work for, I worked there for 6 years quality of life is horrible, always being micro managed. No teamwork what so ever, will do what ever they have to make themselves look better"
bad,"Honestly besides getting paid 2.13 per hour as a host, you barely get any hours as it is. Your pay depends solely on the amount of people that's in the restaurant. Also if your trying to become a server or advance within the company the owner will give you a ""pep talk"" of ""oh when we hire more people we will advance you"". You can honestly save your time in finding another place because the only thing this place is good for is wasting your time while unpaying you. The only good positions to work is either serving or in the back of the house."
bad,"i lost 3 years of my career growth by working here. some great people, but stuck in the stone ages. I was attracted to the company because of its Principles + Beliefs, and the belief that if we take care of our employees, the business will take care of itself. that never happened. very tough culture, not for me. took a huge step back."
bad,"Contract Job"
bad,"When I first started to work for this company I really enjoyed it. After about 10 months I got promoted to our carry out/ delivery trainer. This was great until I realized that no matter how I handled things, it was never right for the manager. I’d do exacty as she tells me, then she’d talk to me about not handling situations the correct way. Very poor management in the store I work at."
bad,I have only worked for a few weeks but I have worked maybe a max of 36 hours for the entire time I’ve been there. They also hire too many people so that is why you get no hours.
bad,The managers don’t communicate with eachother. I’ve been yelled at for stupid reasons and got fired for a reason that made no sense. Some of the managers are really good but there’s a couple that have not been so nice or reasonable. They are terrible with hours and schedule days that you tell them you can’t work and they say you have to work since no one else can come in or they don’t even try to get someone else to cover the shift
bad,"To much goofing round, not enough communication and the lack of respect for others,managers didn't have the same interests in mind when working as a group or a team"
bad,"this company doesn't care about you or anything, worked for them for quite some time and sad ill never get that time back in my life! Managers are awful and they advance the worst people possible! such a shame how ive been treated and witnessed others be treated!"
bad,Not enough employees to meet the expectations of the business.
bad,"Two of my managers were sexist pigs. One talked down to all of the female employees. Spoke to me like I couldn’t comprehend the words he was saying. The other gave better schedules to the female employees that looked a certain way. The Managing Partner is extremely rage full. I’ve seen him scream, curse at employees, and throw food and plates."
bad,"BBI was a fun place to work and the compensation and benefits were good, but the management seemed ill equipped to handle big projects and had little business sense. Lay offs were constant, even for long term employees, no one is safe. "
bad,Job security always up in the air because drugged out managers came into work with different attitudes and expectations everyday. Too many workers and managers had out side relationships that effected daily work.
bad,cant review something that is a literal hollow shell of no personality that spits out food to its guests. no creativity no passion. It would start a nuclear war if someone was asked to pick up trash off the ground.
bad,"They talk about 'full transparency', but they speak from both sides of their mouth. "
bad,"The San Marcos location has poor management and lacks professionalism. They will allow poorly made food to go out just to minimize loss of sale/profit. The managers do not know what they are doing and the lead manager is constantly behaving unprofessionally. The back of house is extremely dirty and we were expected to just scrape off residue on the plates. The managers are all on different pages."
bad,"Not a great place for promotion, if you are interested in getting ahead then you have to leave and come back.  This is also the only way to get a good raise."
bad,"I worked with Outback Steakhouse a little over six months and it was probably one of the worst jobs I ever worked, they give you very little hours and the pay is absolutely horrible they pretend to care about you until they don't need you and also they break the law they expect you to work without break's,it's easy work but still don't work with this company save you time. They fired me for being late because of car issues."
bad,"BBI is a very difficult place to navigate if you are new hire to the company.  Communication is poor, with a protectionist view of responsibilities.  Very high stress environment."
bad,It’s by far the worst resturant I ever worked in. The restaurant industry is going down hill and it shows because servers are not making the same kind of money they use to 10-15 years ago. This company doesn’t care about its people only the bottom dollar.
bad,"What should be a pretty good looking 2 year span of work for a resume, has been belittled and devalued. Hours cut from 48 a week to 30 if I struggle. Work pace and number of items to prep nearly doubled. They work 3 people on a station because they CANNOT find skilled workers! They would rather pay 2 dish per night, than pay one good dish overtime."
bad,Very stressful and high paced. Supporting restaurants is a challenge and there is a lot of non issues that become issues. I wouldn't recommend working here in IT.
bad,The culture at Lonestar Steakhouse needed help. The management was nice but they did not push the employees to do any work. The cooks did a great job but the front of the house servers were lazy and unexperienced.
bad,"Job tenure is never secure with this company, even when you are told you are doing an amazing job performance. Lack of communication from management leads to a stressful working environment"
bad,Its all about making money for the shareholders; to the point that customer satisfaction is no longer priority number one................................
bad,BBI was a great place to work when the Principals and Beliefs were being followed. New executives in place do not fully understand the restaurant industry nor its people. I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot and for that I will always be grateful.
bad,"Management Inexperienced & Lacking Leadership Skills"
bad,"- Good place to get exposure to Azure if you are in IT."
bad,After 18 years of service with the company and a three month notice of wanting to part on good terms; I wasn't even given a hand shake or even a thank you.  This company doesn't do a very good job of taking care of its people.  So sad to see how far this company has fallen.
bad,"Lots of drama, lots of talk between management and staff, unprofessional, never busy, tips low, fired if you call out even if two hours in advance.... a little bit ridiculous."
bad,"A typical day at work is long and very stressful a lot of times.I learned more about food cost and food waste.Management is a weakness in this company,Bloomin' Brands need to be more selective about who they presume as Managers and drug test their Managers randomly.The workplace culture here is not good and that's I'll say about it.The hardest part of this job is working with some of the management and team members,some Managers here engage with the team members off the clock.The most enjoyable part of this job was Guest satisfaction!!!"
bad,"Company lacks clear direction an focus.  Organizational changes are not thought through a span of several years, so we are in the habit of re-structuring every other year it seems.  Nice perks, but too many office politics to deal with.  They have great people, some of them overworked."
good,"Na empresa você é valorizado, dão sempre curso. Mas as refeições no local fica de manhã até a noite, você tem que atender ao máximo de número de mesas mesmo que isso possa fazer você perder a gorjeta. Tem alguns funcionários que sempre estão com as mesmas mesas que dão trabalho de dois ou mais funcionários e ganham quase nada por isso. Você bate o ponto a meia noite e se tiver que trabalhar, trabalhará de graça. Fica um tempão para se tornar um cargo acima que será para trabalhar mais. Por causa da política aderiram a baixos salários por hora o que é desnecessário. Falta muito para ter o atendimento que o cliente tem entre os funcionarios."
good,"I worked here when I was in college, I honestly do not remember much. I worked there for 3 years, had the same schedule and just waited tables. Not much to it. Did my job, went to college and went home. Simple. Learned a lot about wine and loved that!"
good,I have never worked at a place with such horrible management that couldn't even control a small restaurant on a wait. I never worked at a place where management talked to employees with no respect. Just because you are friends outside of work doesn't mean it is okay to call each other b****** at work in front of everyone and expect for anyone to respect you as a manager. I have never worked at a place where you have to drink outside of work with managers to get ahead.
good,"Amount of work required from hosts does not match pay. "
good,"If you enjoy a job that constantly has you going, any server position is the way to go. Obviously there will be some down time, but there is always something to restock or clean. You always have your regulars so it's important to remember the little things about your customers. Always smile and act like you have the confidence, even if you're unsure, there will always be someone on the staff to help you answer questions."
good,"I worked there as a contract to perm in their IT department. "
good,Long hours no upper management support. Pay scale is extremely outdated. Insurance is mediocre . Not a very good training systems in place.
good,"A typical day at Bloomin' Brands, Inc. is managing 70-90 plus locations with emphasis on details concerning the Balance Sheet and Income Statement accounts. I moved up internally 3 times and was exposed to many management styles. The co-workers are great and hard working. The hardest part of the job is managing the work flow given the volume of calls and emails you receive daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships you forge with your stores."
good,"Great benefits, meal comp card, and nice office.  I had the opportunity to work with some of the industries greatest people. It was a good experience."
good,"Overall, the employees are a great group of individuals, whow work well as a team to provide customer satisfaction. The restaurants were well supported by the team on the phones."
good,"It’s ok for a year or so but wouldn’t recommend for long term. Takes awhile to move up, and never really validation for you’re hard work. Overall better for younger people to get job experience."
good,"As a kitchen manager, the support system works well until the Proprietor is fired.  The delay to replace the head of the restaurant is overly impactful to the job and performance of the staff.  Corporate fails their employees regularly, lacking in proper guidance and clear direction.  Would've been a positively memorable experience but was tainted with failures in corporate staffing and inconsistent standards."
good,High turnover very high expectations. No quality of life always working to fix labor. Great training tools hard to implement with turnover imbalance. Company slowly downsizing.
good,"There was a lot of thought and care put into the initial concepts under this umbrella. As a customer you will most probably have an outstanding experience and the food quality is still superior to most competitors."
good,"A typical work day consisted of a vibe check. Which is checking in with each employee, both FOH and BOH making sure they understand the goals and expectations for the day. A line check to assess the product we'll be serving and the running of the daily operations."
good,A prgressive agile work environment with high expectations. Encourage working smarter. Provide acceptable compensation packages with employee comp to sites owned.
good,New people were always hired and promoted in the same month. Rarely were people trained properly. Great place to meet people and build networks. This job was very flexible with your schedule and willing to work with you.
good,"Fun place to work with dedicated people and great brands to work with.  There's a strong focus right now on innovation and the digital customer experience, which should work well for the company in the very near future."
good,"During my tenure as a consultant, teamwork was weak and there was a reorganization.  Development teams were just beginning to make a transition to agility, however only having daily stand-up meetings was immature.  My sense is that the company was moving in the right direction. The company was beginning to spend more money on I.T.   R&D after many of years of lagging behind with technology.  The reorg resulted in the separation of I.T. from under the CFO to its own separate vertical.  I would not view this review as current as much could have happened for the better in 4.5 years, and excellent changes in upper management were beginning to impact I.T. teams."
good,"Bloomin Brands is a great company, until the management begins to go downhill, which happens rather quickly. The company is a rather organized zoo, with a strict uniform policy."
good,"I did not much enjoy working for this company.  We were overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated.  There was no formal or informal training of any type."
good,Ambiente é agradável. A cultura ainda está sendo ajustada. A meritocracia não é seguida.
good,"We are supposed to be an agile company, but none of our meetings are ran in an agile format.  I am on-call 24/7 and discouraged to work from home.  No clear roadmap of the technology future.  Bad management decision making.  Total turnover in IT management."
good,Great place to work at. Great people snd good management as well. But as in any other restaurant the money comes out of the work you put in. Dedication only
good,When I started there I enjoyed the job. I worked there for 5 years but in the last year or so I didn't enjoy it as much. There were lots of layoffs at various points & the workload continued to increase for everyone despite there being so many layoffs.
good,have worked for 10+ years for blooming brands and over all thoughts are salaries are not reflective of skill levels senior management seem to have lost touch with field managers and managing partners. sometimes communication that is handed down is not communicated clear enough and can be confusing at times. when given tasks they expect you to follow through with no questions which is fine but when asked for support they seem to not really care what you have to say
good,"I honestly struggled for nine months to maintain my employment here, yet I'm pretty sure this is an incident based purely on the location of my particular restaurant, not a more widespread issue. to sum it up, the review summary."
good,Great company overall but a very competitive environment as related to casual dining industry.  Risky but pay is worth the career risk by moving to casual dining
good,"Great place for employees. People are willing to assist you when possible. Company is growing Internationally, potential opportunities with the International Group."
good,"not a bad place to work, but the manger was just complete trash, she would sit there in the back and talk to the dog groomer girls while barking orders at the store workers. talk about lazy"
good,"Took care of over 1500 restaurants needs over the phone and onsite with Positouch (Point of sale) problems.  Also resolved hardware problems and software problems including Laptop and WAN problems. Took care of all restaurants day to day operations from taking care of front of house cash handling issues all the way to down systems. Took care of uploading new menu changes for the front of the house for all concepts. All concepts include Lee Roy Selmon’s, Outback Steakhouse, Carrabbas, Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion, Bonefish Grill, Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse,  and Cheeseburger in Paradise. Dispatched IBM when restaurants were having terminal issues. Took care of all Active Directory issues. Also provided troubleshooting for all Share point issues, took care of inventory issues when their numbers did not match. Did a lot of terminal setups when they got a new terminal to replace a defective terminal. Used remotedc for ip printers as well as serial printers running off of serial ports. Took care of all Home office employees computer problems from  phone support to changing out bad hardware. Did hard drive images for restaurants when the back office computer hard drive died and made sure that all services were running and all other applications were there when the hard drive died. Put stores in redundancy when the main terminal died. When stores got there new hard drive took them out of redundancy and copied all files back to their original state so no information is lost. Also put stores on a virtual machine at corporate if the back office computer died to process credit cards and do nightly"
good,"They were usually short staffed and was hard to request days off. I worked there for almost a year and never had a review or rise but always had more work to do. That helped me to learn a lot of things about prepping food but had to look for different opportunities somewhere else."
good,"No advancement opportunities, unless you are willing to play the political games, regardless of quality of work.  Good work life balance and good benefits."
good,"It's your standard restaurant work experience. There isn't much room to advance other than possibly serving or doing togo, honestly though you'd have better luck just applying for your desired end position than trying to work your way up."
good,Good company to work for. Lots of initiatives for International with strong management profile and personnel. A normal day at work will be very dynamic and full of tasks. Travelling International was a most which to me it was a plus given my experience and background. I really enjoyed working here and would not hesitate to recommend BBI as a nice place to work.
good,"Great leadership, fun environment, great product, systems and standards. Great communication, support and compassion for people. Work/Life balance is very difficult for ones with children."
good,"Fun, Energetic staff. Tons of employee benefits.  Perks for full time employees.  Not so much for contractors.  All in All a decent company."
good,Not the kind of job that will pay the bills... but great if you don't have bills and need spending cash. greet and seat customers politely but mostly just stand and smile.
good,"I love the company itself have worked at several locations. The management team at the Birmingham location, just needs to treat their employees better. They have no concern for others and needs training in day to day interactions with being a decent person. To request the things this management team has of their employees, and then treat them in the manner that they have shows that they have little regard or respect that their employees have families."
good,"As a person that started working in this company with no experience has helped me so much not only outside of work but also in school. This restaurant has helped me communicate with guest in a well mannered way, learned how to multi-tasked, and many more."
good,"The food is great and you get a good discount, nice laid back atmosphere with calming music and they are lenient about tattoos/ piercings and nails. Overall a great experience"
good,"When I went to work for Bloomin Brands I was brought on to work specifically with one of the brands. Six months in they had their first ""reorganization"" letting 70+- people go including my manager. "
good,There are plenty of opportunities to improve yourself and move up in the company or to have as a spare job making extra money. Typically runs as a family with a never-ending feeling and understanding of 'teamwork makes the dream work'
good,"Although not as popular as it was in the 90s and early 2000s Outback is still a popular destination for many. As a college job, it is the perfect balance of low hours, good pay and the flexibility to dictate how many days you want to work."
good,"Working for Bloomin' Brands was always just a stepping stone for me. The management attitudes were bad, but the hours were better than my previous job."
good,It's a good company to work for. There's ton of potential working here and you will learn so much while doing so. Management could use some work. But the best part of the job is that it's not all stressful and you're surrounded by good energy of people.
good,For managers with no experience there is no better place to work and gain knowledge at your job. You will learn everything from the basics to what you need to be a managing partner.
good,"Technically good to be working and lot of scope and career growth."
good,Driving traffic and sales through breakthrough and collaborative marketing
good,"Pretty average restaurant experience, staff that worked there were all very nice, however business slowed down and I had gotten a better paying job. ,"
good,"Great environment to work in. 5 years in Human Resources and all my experience has been gained with the company, I am very grateful. Looking for a new organization with opportunity of advancement."
good,"Before being publicly traded the company was great to work for. Since then it has become very bureaucratic and given unrealistic goals. I can only speak of the HR management, most of the executive leadership that made that grew the company prior to going public are no longer with Bloomin Brands. That speaks volumes to the changes that occurred after going public."
good,Great company to work for but leadership is lacking. Compensation was below average but over time and yearly bonus made up for it. Blah blah blah blahhdbxh
good,It was due to job elimination that I had to leave. Worked at store level from 1991 to 2006. Went to corporate in 2006-2017 almost 27 years with same company.
good,"As a contracted employee, my views of Bloomin' are very different. In addition to the fact that I have an amazing manager. "
good,Your not here to be anyone's friend it's about getting the job done and going home peacefully There will be drama but that's at any job that's why it's best just to keep to yourself and make money.
good,"Lots of Responsibility put on a server. Good experience gained. Definitely learned how to manage time! After being denied the opportunity to further myself in the company (while watching others succeed who were not seniority or had the same experience), I moved on."
good,"•Typical work day: fast paced and challenging"
good,"Eu achei muito interessante essa empresa "
good,Great people and atmosphere. The first several years were highly productive and fun. Economic downturn began a high turnover rate and created a bit of chaos to an otherwise healthy workplace.
good,Great place that opens in afternoon and is good to employees.You are able to transfer from concept to concept and even state to state. Proprietors are the GM and have their own money invested in the store so they care more.
good,"BBI was a great place to work, with a relaxed culture and friendly people who were some of the best in their fields. I very much enjoyed my time there."
good,"Most enjoyable part of job are the people: very knowledgable, friendly and always willing to assist others.  The details of the job can be a little stressful, but quarterly meetings and quarterly department outings are informative, stress-relieving and energizing."
good,"I went table to table cleaning and removing all the dirty dishes and/or trash, cleaned dishes, rolled silverware. Bloomin Brands is a good company, unfortunately I just wasn't to interested in the restaurant business."
good,Great company with a great team of people to work for and with.  Excellent environment and great work life balance. Everyone on the team is more than helpful and willing to stop and answer any questions you may have.  Very knowledgeable team members and a great work environment.
good,"Good place to work.  Nice people, good benefits and performance-based compensation.  Offers large corporation job stability with warm people interactions."
good,Managers and co workers are eager to help train new employees. The training provided before coming in was very useful and informational. I felt prepared once I started on the job training.
good,"É uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, a gerencia perde um pouco."
good,The thing I enjoyed most about working for Blooming Brands is that the people that they hired actually wanted to be there. Therefore the restaurant operated much more efficiently because people were doing their jobs quickly and correctly. That definitely relates back to the great job management does during training.
good,"I have worked for this organization for more than an year or so and was good for me . Especially working in Florida was at another level to me, the friendly beaches and awesome drives and all. Coming to company, its a mid level company and honors their employees pretty well. I wish I would be an FTE there for my love towards the place."
good,"A typical day included team work at a fast pace and getting the job done. It is a great place to enhance teamwork, problem solving skills, and to learn new skills."
good,"-Day at work is managing the front and back of the house while also greeting table making sure their experience was memorable"
good,"Casual Dining Restaurant industry leader and innovator with great operations and outstanding marketing.  Committed to quality food, excellent hospitality and community involvement."
good,"Customer Service Skills"
good,"It is a good place to work. Most are team orientated, but with most companies this large not everyone is a 'team' player."
good,"There is always a new technology to learn, that's a great thing about BBI. Even if there is no room to grow within IT department, you will be constantly exposed to different technologies."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at BBI. There are many great people that work there and I made many wonderful friends. The culture has changed a bit over the last few years, however it is still a great place to work."
good,"Meet with team to discuss daily or weekly project at hand."
good,"O Mexcla, era um ótimo lugar para trabalhar, tinha um ótimo equilíbrio de equipes diurna e noturna, especialmente, entre as equipes de atendimento e da cozinha. Porém, não tinha plano de carreira nem de desenvolvimento na empresa. Lá, fazia de tudo: caixa, arendimento e principalmente a limpeza do restaurante inteiro todo final de turno. Sempre dávamos suporte a algum funcionário que precisava de ajuda, porém, sem comprometer o atendimento. O mais divertido do trabalho, era sempre aprender alguma coisa diferente toda semana, continuamente receber alguma dica pra melhorar sempre. E sempre tentar aprender alguma coisa nova em todas as oportunidades que eu tinha, era o que eu mais gostava."
good,Summer internship developing an understanding of corporate America and initially developing myself as a young professional.  The majority of my summer was spent doing legal research.
good,"I highly recommend this company to college students/part time workers. The schedule is extremely flexible, the money is decent, and depending on how well staffed the restaurant is, you can more or less make your own schedule. "
good,"Bloomin' Brands restaurants are good place to work for someone anywhere from high school to post-grad. The offer a flexible, fun environment, with a relatively flexible schedule. The management is normally great, and the atmosphere is fun and productive. They are a equal opportunity employer, and your coworkers bring a lot of diversity and culture to the workplace."
good,"Seating customers"
good,Bloomin brands is the company that I work for at Outback Steakhouse. It's an amazing company that usually moves up employees from within. It has been an amazing company to work for and I couldn't be the person that I am today without this experience.
good,Bloomin Brands Inc is a good company to work for. Good work life balance and good people to work with. The only slight I would give it is they have people that have worked there for a long period of time that have trouble necessary change.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. It was energizing working to deliver projects to support and transform iconic brands. The teams I worked with were talented and hard-working.
good,"Working here taught me to be quick paced, and come up with solutions quickly. Time spent here can be said was productive no matter if there was no customers walking in, the managers would find something for you to do."
good,"24 + years is testimony enough. I advanced as high as they would take me and now looking to expand on my multi unit experience."
good,"I loved my career at BLMN Brands.  They provided the tools, budget, resources and mentorship to accomplish the goals. "
good,"apply and learn for yourself I will not discuss any negative reviews."
good,"Great place to work, gained alot of experience and learned the culture of the food and different recipes i could take home and cook for myself. Good people great food."
good,Great company to work for and advance your career. Supervisors play a large part in your role with BLMN and care about your advancement within the company.
good,"Wonderful employees, co-workers, and management.  Very much a team environment where everyone has an interest to ensure the success of the organization."
good,Everything was going great until they promoted a developer to the department head.  It seemed as if he had a grudge against me and argued and complained constantly.  I would go back if I didnt have to work under him.
good,"I enjoyed working for both Outback Steak house and Bonefish Grill."
good,"Great management team, very invested in their workers. Great overall atmosphere from the minute you walk in they are warm friendly and inviting. Wonderful Company!"
good,it is made clear to us what our jobs are. We are trusted to do complete those tasks and able to have fun in the process. I feel empowered to make decisions without having to consult with anyone else.
good,"I enjoyed working for Bloomin' Brands during my tenure and planned to be there for the long-term. However, they tend to cut corners in critical areas such as Customer Care and FMLA. This became problematic for me after I'd become involved in a car accident and required intermittent leave to care for my medical condition. When BBI plans its RIFs, it trims the fat around these areas first as they create ""hardships for the company."" I lost my job very quickly."
good,"Agradável, tranquilo e divertido, dinâmico, galera boa de se trabalhar."
good,Not all departments are created equal but overall the culture at Bloomin' Brands is great.   It's a family atmosphere and they do a lot to keep their people in-the-know and engaged.
good,"Friendly staff, made a lot of friends at Carrabbas, the proprietor(Scott) was very nice too, rarely ever got mad or said anything negative, very fair as well. The other managers over the time i was there (Mike, Reko, Burnadette, and Christy) all had some quirks like everyone does, but I'd happily work with any of them again.
