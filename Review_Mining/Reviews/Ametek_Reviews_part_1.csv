rating,review
bad,This company cares more about the output of product over the happiness of the employees. people constantly come and go due to the harsh work environment.
bad,"FMH-Ametek is the worst, false promises, horrible management, takes away bonuses and will run it to the ground with impossible quotas, and they’ll just let you go when deemed appropriate for no reason and say your position is no longer necessary no matter how important you were to it. Management is friends with HR and will put friends in high places, cuss you out if you don’t obey and force you to work countless hours on demand if they feel so. Run away from them."
bad,Lack of direction. Reason why they still can do things right. Spying on their employees. Poor management. Employees very down by the lack of support from management. Always doing extra work due to not knowing how things should be done. Materials not being made good. Dies not working. Everyday for the past years. Place needs new supervision
bad,Most of the leaders there have a lack of leadership skills.  Some can't do the jobs required for the employees under them. Stressful work without much reward.
bad,"There losing jobs, there sending them all to Mexico. Ametek is the worst company anyone could ever work at. I feel bad for the employees. Managers are worthless"
bad,"Basically run like a prison Camp two misfits Lead rats act like guards on the electrical assembly floor  many grumpy people, really can't voice your opinion with is horrible. out someone out to get ya. Management"
bad,"Very poor management. I worked in the Largo facility as a welder, and there is no to grow at all, and I was actually told by my supervisor that a monkey can weld. The pay increases at 2 percent a year, no exceptions, everybody gets the same. I put in 10 Years there and wasent much further ahead than when I started. Stay away"
bad,"Current employee at Glasseal, Lakewood NJ. Horrible environment. Management has no idea what is what day to day.Some good people but for most part just drones."
bad,"Company lacking management structure, Low pay, and required to work over time every day plus weekends"
bad,leaving at the end of the day is the best part
bad,If you like non stop misery this is the place for you. Toxic environment with very poor management and supervision. I had never quit a job in my life but felt it necessary to get out from under this awful dismal company.
bad,"Not a great place to work for. Very clicky.The manager would not train the workers when defects were made, they would rely on us to fix their mistakes."
bad,Horrible place to work. Management only cares about themselves. Can’t or won’t make departments run properly. Workers work slowly until they can get lots of overtime.
bad,"There is really no management at this company.  People work where they please; accomplish what they please; come and go as they please. "
bad,Because Ametek is so large of a company your treated like a number. Upper management could care less about your hard work and long as they made their monthly income quota. There was a lot of back stabbing. Always felt insecure about your employment.
bad,Siloed and miserable work environment.  Many managers were demeaning and arrogant.  Little room for advancement.  Long hours expected and not appreciated.
bad,Un'azienda improntata sul lavoro in team a livello internazionale
bad,"Not a company you would like to work for."
bad,"They reorganize frequently. They did personality testing so they could use the results to trick me into accepting their offer. It’s full of amateurish Directors and VPs. Don’t walk, RUN away from this company. Or if you want to report to about 10 levels of VPs, by all means, be my guest!"
bad,"Cons"
bad,"It Pays well."
bad,"The management sucks. The employees are noisy! The leaders are not qualified to even be in charge of their own selves. Laziest leaders in the world and management knows. They harass the heck out of people. They are over paid pricks. One definitely stands out the most. I worked at the Peck, MI location for almost 2 years. KH harrassed me every day."
bad,"Entry level for life,if you dont like your job quit,supervision is un professional  ,my supervisor was like working for Rainman. No advancement, no concern to improve the company"
bad,"na"
bad,This place has a bad management for the actual workers. If you are not in the 'front office' they treat you like a second class person. I liked the work I did but was so underpaid that i found my self 'holding back'.
bad,When i was there i went to work sick and the floor manager told me that i was stealing from the company for being there. They dont like when you call in if your sick or when you come to work sick. Very hard to please or advance in company.
bad,"I've done assembly work at moen before and they have a person for each station 9/10... but here they have like 3 people for 10 different things. The pay is horrible. Very small company. Building things here is the stone ages, very little machines and basically a nail and hammer Type of assembly. Management and HR listen to the ""team leader"" and don't make their own decisions. Team leader is basically a worker."
bad,"The company is poorly managed. The managers deploy operational tactics from 50 years ago and are not open to newer tactics. Some employees were bullies and management allowed it to continue, in some cases, management participated in the bullying. The incidents were not at an Ohio facility, it was in Kansas."
bad,Many of the employees have been there for many years.  It is a good company that I used to enjoy working for.  I am only leaving because of my manager.
bad,"It used to be a great place to work, but the last couple years the morale has been run into the ground.. The pay has not kept up with the times, seniority means nothing.  The harder you work, the less you are appreciated."
bad,Was stuck in a stock room and was basically invisible to the rest of the company. My supervisor barley knew I was there. They also have a few employees who can do whatever they want and the managers let them.
bad,This company could be great if not for the poor management.  Benefits are top notch and pay was good but often had to work 7 days a week. 2 sets of rules. Floor workers have to follow them and office staff pretty much did whatever they wanted whenever they wanted
bad,The new management abuses their power. They lie to the workers and treat you badly. If they like you then you can do anything you want to do and they leave you alone. If they do not like you then they harass you and wait to you make a mistake and then they fire you. I know of several people that were fired for no cause and no proof
bad,"I worked hard for this company, for them to turn around and end second shift and fire the management.  They shot themselves in the foot doing that. I would never work for this company again."
bad,"I am A Director OF Engineering and make sure u do not forget that = I like to talk and find faults with every one.  Regardless of time and schedule , if you know how to talk to me and teach me and baby seat me then you are the best. Can you imagine using every resource u have to characterize design issues for a simple transceiver, 6 months latter you are exactly where you started may be worse off. Make sure you dot use the directors chair in the lab otherwise you will be asked not use any chair all week. Get back to earth and do your job or go milk some cows that way you do not cause any stress for hard working employees. May be you can provide the hard working employees with better cheaper milk."
bad,I received a phone call about a job. I mentioned I would like first shift. She tells me first shift is IMPOSSIBLE to get on. I say okay I can do the second shift then. THEN I am told I can't even work there unless I can work all three shifts and that after my training that I will probably be on seconds but if I can't work thirds too then I can't work there. OKAY THEN PUT IT ON YOUR POSTING THAT YOU MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR SECOND AND THIRD SHIFT AND THAT YOU CANNOT WORK FIRST SHIFT HERE. HOW HARD IS IT TO BE HONEST TO PEOPLE THAT YOU MAY BE EMPLOYING IN THE FUTURE.
bad,"Management is horrible and extremely rude and uneducated. Nobody at the company is happy under an extremely hostile work environment,"
bad,"Had to work with some toxic coworkers in the deburring department, but I didn't report it because I knew nothing much would be done about it and I was a temp so it would be a waste of my time"
bad,Senior company leadership unable to provide clear a clear vision for growth as manufacturing was being shifted to China from U.S. factory locations.  The decrease in control of product availability and quality lead to the loss of channel partners and customers while opening the door for significant competition.
bad,"Amtek has gone down hill with new management recently in place. Saturday’s are now manadatory after working 10 hour shifts all week, and tend to be. The only person that gets a benefit in meeting quota is management (who gets a bonus if we meet quota, although I’ve never seen him personally do the labor for it). Anything recognized by management is always negative towards employees. There is no room for advancement and most staff are not doing just their job, but somebody else’s throughout the day because we are always so short staffed and when we are full staffed they let people go. Would not recommend to anyone. The only benefit is with management not on our side we ban together as a team on the floor."
bad,"7 days a week  with a freeze on PTO    If you are looking for over time,   this is the company to work for. You won't be informed about mandatory overtime on weekends til late thursday or perhaps friday mornig.   there goes family plans."
bad,"Temp to hire position, they keep temps employees for years to avoid providing benefits, when trying to talk to.managemnt they avoid you at all cost, exesive employee rotation"
bad,Worked there on a short term job wiring and running conduit and terminating wires and trouble shooting circuits. This was for  Caterpillar Plant. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job was close to home.
bad,"Management shows too much favoritism. The HR woman in there does not try to help you with anything asked, she just hands you numbers to call. Don't really see what she is there for. A real HR would take the effort to find the solution you ask for. If a hot job comes up, usually on a Friday, management lays a guilt trip on you to work all week-end."
bad,"I know about Ametek P&I, very little innovation, mostly sustaining engineering work, everybody looks like the are busy wearing many hats but there are rarely new projects to work on. "
bad,"I worked here for years and did not receive a pay raise but did get more job responsibilities added with no extra compensation. If your looking for advancement and great pay, look elsewhere!!!"
bad,"Crescimento profissional, experiências na gestão controle dos processos que envolvem toda a cadeia de ""Suply Chan""."
bad,"One of several divisions of Ametek Inc, a Wall Street-driven $B conglomerate, who's stated primary goal is corporate takeover & acquisition in order to maximise bottom-line profits"
bad,"Loved the people I worked with,"
bad,This job is great your first few weeks. Then they have you training in multiple areas.  You think this is a good thing? No. You will be expected to go help lazy people that are actually dedicated to these areas when it is so busy you have to work 13 hours a day while the person you are helping goes home. You will do this for multiple jobs and get paid the bare minimum. You can make more money working at Panda Express.
bad,"Travel to 2-3 customers per week. Sometimes more to pick up the slack for lesser performing colleagues. The travel policy is horrible. Must show itemized receipts for every purchase no matter how small or trivial.CFO nit-picks at your expenses regardless of how many hours overtime you just put in, without being compensated for it, to get the jobs done.There will be three layers of management above you who each will let you know you messed up. Expect to be micromanaged by your supervisor. NOT a great place to work to say the least."
bad,I worked as a contract worker at Ametek through Modis. It was a fair experience. They are not clear how long your assignment will be until they hire you.
bad,Old school hierarchical structure. The company lacks effective leadership at the middle management level. They do not value ingenuity or out of the box thinking. Would not recommend.
bad,"Work here if you love working every weekend, being unappreciated, having zero communication and having your shift/ hours changed while they take away your shift differential pay. Oh, and if you have a hard time accommodating the new hours, they’ll just lay you off!  The management is a freaking joke!!"
bad,"Ambiente de trabajo nada amistoso. No hay un plan de desarrollo profesional, las personas que trabajan ahi desde hace muchos años no son accesibles."
bad,"The upper management would always change their minds.  They would always talked about people. But when you were in house you were their friend. Training was trouble, they just throw you in the field to figure  everything out"
bad,They sent all of our manufacturing jobs to Mexico. I had a 16 year career there. Hardly anyone works there (Grand Junction) anymore.
bad,"I thought I was going to be there ""forever""... I was on a track to be the next division president.  Corporate politics took over, I ended up being ""non-essential"" and was laid off.  If I ever come across the guy who laid me off I will.... well, I'm not sure what I will do, but he won't like it."
bad,"The people who work there get really threatened when someone who works harder is seen as competition."
bad,"As a primary part of the team, I work together with a unit of employees to manufacture world-wide retractable, electric, and digital reels with customer specifications as well as custom equipment/reels used in a wide variety of applications. etc."
bad,"Good money, but not enough for type of work. To many hours Sunday-Saturday and not a ton of job security, be certain that there will be times where you'll be laid off....I was terminated after being ordered to stay home by doctor for illness...They fire ppl left and right even ppl that have helped the company grow for years. There's pretty much no room for mistakes and there is a ton of favoritism. If you get the job kiss up as much as you can."
bad,"•	Managing all Service and Inventory processes for Ametek / Pulsar Repairs"
bad,"Management only cared about the bottom line,money. They treated you like a number,not a name. If you didn't work as fast as they saw fit, you were mistreated."
bad,"Working is not very satisfactory."
bad,"I enjoyed working on 1st shift.  The staff and supervisors were easy to get along with.  Once they changed me to 2nd shift, I started having issues with the supervisor on 2nd."
bad,Ametek is a very nice place to work. With a very dynamic team. I have developed many skills in business strategy and team management. The board is always open to receive any employee and hear new ideas.
bad,"Too many grumpy people, really can't voice your opinion without someone out to get ya. Management is horrible. Quick to fire you, but other than that there's room for advancement if you know the right people."
bad,"Ametek HSA is dedicated to giving the customers the best quality in their repair work. The technicians are trained for the job they maintain, and there is cross-training between departments for the mechanics to keep them knowledgable in a variety of skills. The office workers are often kept on temporary worker status, at least partly to keep payroll costs down. I was one such temporary worker. There is an attitude of professionalism at Ametek which is very good. It is hard not to learn this professionalism there."
bad,"assembled , instruments for the oil industry that would measure the moisture level in the pipelines... very boring. management was full of nepotisom , Only had a few good workers. Hardest part of the job was getting up and going to work.. Best part...it was 7 miles away, and i left"
bad,"Frametek tought me how to build frames for buildings, drive a fork lift."
bad,Lo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es que el tiempo se pasa de maciado rapido por que todo el dia estoy ocupado en lo que hago
bad,Working at ametek was a bad experience to say the least. They make promise of promoting and pay increases that never come through. Also the management there picks out their cliques of friends they’ve known for years to take any job you might be trying to advance in
bad,"Loved the work I was doing! Other Co-workers were great, very helpful and environment was wonderful. No job security though, after being assured it was not a temporary position and leaving my previous employer to accept job, I was laid off after my ninety day probationary period along with fourteen other short and long term employees. Happy New Year to me!"
bad,I had the opportunity to growth in the company from been an assembler to Human Resources and Payroll processor and 15 year as a production Manufacturing manager.
bad,Typical day at work was easy. I came to work and checked list where was what i have to do today. I chcecked where are rotors and I started scallop rotors.
good,"This company was a private owned shop and was poorly ran. The environment was hectic and the manager was not very professional. We did not receive much raises nor did we ever receive benefits working here. Since I have left this company, the previous owner has been bought out and no longer has any part with this location."
good,The place is good at first but once you're there for longer it gets worse the environment there is not good the people that work there are not friendly the management is trash job doesn't care about you your just another random person to them they work you like a dog and treat you like one too
good,Just okay. Many changes over the years. Don’t feel as appreciated as in past years.  Not really excited to go to work everyday. Concerned about the future of the facility.
good,Faltan cursos de capacitación para el personal antes de entrar al área de trabajo y mas promociones para el personal.
good,"Company has many long term employees that are union. These folks have no idea what real work is as they sit around most days at picnic tables while management allows this."
good,"A normal day at Ametek starts with an employee being on their assigned line or the labor pool in which you can be assigned to any of the other 7 lines depending on qualifications. Once assigned to a line the line is running or on clean up. "
good,"Independientemente de lo desagradable que es la comida que se sirve en cafetería y el servicio tan pobre del personal administrativo, resaltó mucho el nulo crecimiento que tienen todos los niveles dentro de la empresa, se trata de un lugar donde no puedes evitar sentirte estancado y terriblemente estresado."
good,"Uma empresa bastante poderosa em seu segmento, porém deixa a desejar no trato com seus colaboradores."
good,You. start making good money then they let you go .They let a lot of good dependable people in ametek New Bedford go.People that had 15yrs plus.No loyalty there.

good,"ho imparato a montare un motore in ogni singola parte,collaudarlo e ripararlo. Fare la capo catena e organizzare il lavoro"
good,"Management needed work. With the type of work to be done, managment was not very informative and lacked the ability to train new employees."
good,"You always learn something new every day, and the most enjoyable part of the job solving difficult problems and learning from the team members., and coaching your team to be the best."
good,"Ondanks de veel te hoge werkdruk, 60 - 70 uur per week, was het onderlinge contact op het kantoor Tilburg erg prettig. Dit kwam vooral door het mooie werk en de diversiteit ervan. Het management werd bestuurd vanuit het hoofd kantoor in Amerika, dit verliep niet volgens de europeesche richtlijnen."
good,"My typical day incudes; a smooth shift transition change with the previous shift line operator. Check all readings about the line, production and down time. package finished material and run lab checks and store good finished material in the warehouse, labelled correctly and stored away for shipment. The management job mostly was to fill lines and check paperwork. Non-direct management style. the people there were easy to work with and worked as a team with other co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting all information for running different orders on the lines. The most enjoyable part of the job was trouble shooting new trial orders and the challenge of running the usual customer orders at high efficiency."
good,"Drexelbrook Engineering was aquired by Ametek in 2005. Goals included streamlining the organization to maintain growth and profitability. Senior management attempted to embrace lean manufacturing principles, however they lacked a firm commitment and proper employee lean training enhancement programs necessary to make this transition successful. "
good,Got to be a kiss a%# didn't respect your decisions to make for the environment better and safe.  respect your opinion on anything you have to know someone there to get ahead they will fire you as fast as they can if they don't like you they will push for work work work work work and it's difficult if you have a family To raise to much horse play.
good,"The technicians were professional."
good,This job was more suited for someone in a mass production type environment.  I have always been more involved with research & development.  The pay was at a level of 2/3 the going rate.
good,Great place to work. The most enjoyable part about my job is the number of challenges that I must face and the obstacles I must hurdle. I get to express my creativity and motivate others.
good,"The company is in constant reduction mode, new acquisitions seems to be the only growth.  Even the new acquisitions are soon chipped away.  The fear of losing your job is the prime motivator."
good,"částečný rozklad společnosti, 1/2 přemístěna do Srbska, aktuálně téměř bez vedení nebo vedení je podřízeno Instrukcím z Itálie."
good,Stale job with no room for advancement. Don't want to pay employees what there worth. Management doesn't know how to mange correctly.
good,"As a current employee, let me start by saying I love my job."
good,Lacks leadership and vision. Has potential but is not a progressive company. The companies main function is acquisitions.
good,"Normalmente entro a las 6:30 y salgo a las 4:30, estamos en produccion y por lo regular siempre tenemos algo en que trabajar."
good,The management group was a detriment to real growth at Ametek. Magement was not accessible on a day to day basis. Very little supervision or support to the sales group. I really enjoyed my role in building relationships with existing and new customers.
good,"- Hours expected - 8AM - 7PM (later in busy season)"
good,"typical hurry up but don't get hurt production work. mandated overtime sometimes months on end so if you have children and a significant other, they have to take a backseat to Ametek. However, the pay and benefits are good."
good,"Great company with benefits but they lack good management. Expect to get additional job tasks that are not part of your job description, good luck getting a bonus for your hard work!"
good,"Good place to work, ok benefits, overtime available, awesome coworkers, poor communication between departments and out of vendors, poor management, hard to advance"
good,"Apesar de certa resistência por parte de funcionários mais antigos, foi possível desenvolver bons projetos na organização."
good,"A typical day was filled with plenty of work, less-than-average pay and little appreciation for your effort. I learned new CAD programs and how to better interface with vendors and clients. Management was not concerned about the employees...only the bottom line. My co-workers were all great...aces...the best at what they do. I got along with all of them."
good,"Mucho trabajo eso hace que como miembro de la empresa aprendas con actividades diferentes, los gerentes se involucran en los procesos, mis compañeros de trabajo en ocasiones son egoistas y envidiosos, la parte mas dificil a sido cuando mi jefe se va por cuestiones de trabajo me quede sola y actividades que los supervisores me asignaban."
good,Very restrictive management. Not much job security. Company constantly closes plants and eliminates jobs after acquisition of said company.
good,"Gerente despota sin trato humano hacia el personal a su cargo,solo el supervisor de piso o el taller muy accesibe y tratable conciente en cualquier duda respondia con amabilidad"
good,"I don’t mind learning new jobs but I’m a soldered and I thought I was hire for but they wanted me working at something that I had no experience in, I ‘ve been a solder for over 30 years I like what I was doing but they placed me in conformal coating"
good,When the oil and gas industry crashed they let go of everyone even people who had been there decades. They did not hire temps very often. The CEO was just the man in the corner.

good,"Manage 3-4 customer service employees who provide service and inventory management for $65M of medical device OEM business."
good,"When I first started there was a need for organization of equipment and repair units. The work area was not organized in a useable environment. Customer units were lost or misplaced and some had to be replaced at companies cost. I organized and moved several shelving units into place for storage and maintained and monitoring repaired units and their return to customers. "
good,"I enjoyed the work I did at Ametek Power Instruments, and but was let go due to budget cuts to make a couple points on their stock price. Loyalty only to shareholders seems rampant at the executive levels of both branches I observed. Don't plan on long term work here."
good,Chemical Products Division of AMETEK is just a small part of the AMETEK umbrella. It is a union shop with room to grow.
good,"A Hard working hot environment. nice regulated and steady  hours, and a comfortable living. plenty of overtime. Good knowledgeable people to work with."

good,"Pagan 20 pesos la hora a los practicantes  "
good,"As long as you fit in with the crowd, you're fine. But as soon as you get comfy, you gone. Too many nosey people who like to ""act like"" a supervisor. Loved the pay. Just don't work weekends."
good,"Started off as a great place to work, recent years, corporate IT is interfering with Local IT.  I took this job with the understanding that I would have full autonomy in making decisions about IT Issues.  I understood that there were existing corporate IT Requirements, but in the past year or so, Corporate IT has made working in this environment, more and more difficult."
good,"Like work life balance, pay wasn't bad, like the people and will recommend t to a friend. Very proffesional, talented people, flexible, geat products, like coworkers"
good,Not a very hard place to work. Way to much sitting for my liking. Management was decent. hours are nice. Pay could be more considering makeing medical parts.
good,I enjoyed it there. I really liked the people i worked with and management was fair to everyone. They took good care of the people who work there and it was a good environment.

good,"This company manufactures custom made fans for the aeronautics industry, covering all aspects from bar stock to the electronics they incorporate.  As such, there's a broad array of job openings and employees are typically exposed to a variety of learning and development opportunities.  It is a high paced and demanding workplace, but offers good learning, development and pay opportunities."
good,"Good company under the squeeze of corporate control.  "
good,"Most of the employees at higher positions do not deserve the job. They sustain in the company only because of goodwill. Your development is given least importance. They never consider what you want to do, it's always about what role the company wants you to take up."
good,government contact work it was put your time in and go home contract work overall nice place management needed help from time to time but overall good place
good,I have no opinion. They did'nt mind paying double time for work on Sunday's when they were behind on orders. They were generally laid back and there was alot of overtime.
good,"The people were amazing and the job wasnt all the difficult or boring."
good,"Prior to the purchase of the company by Ametek, we were more family orientated and provided extensive Quality.  Unfortunately, times hit hard and Ametek had to change our work culture to be more stressful and require money over quality.  I have no problem with AMETEK in general, just that they need to think about other ways to reduce costs without first just chopping away."
good,"Una empresa con un ambiente laboral muy activo, consolidando el trabajo en equipo entre los departamentos que interactuan entre si para la elaboracion de sus productos."

good,"El trabajo un poco complidado pero bueno."
good,Nothing to exciting it's your typical assembly environment. Benefits are okay. Some people are either really friendly and happy or really quiet and awkward. Most folks here are 40 and over. The managers are pretty flexible when it comes to doctor appointments or emergencies.
good,Good colleagues.  Demanding American parent company.  Need to be prepared to work under pressure and switch priorities on a daily if not hourly basis.
good,"Challenging"
good,its an ok place to be if you enjoy the manufacturing setting.
good,Challenging business with broad product line supplying into multiple markets
good,"a typical day at work would start by receiving stock from the receiving dock and checking stock by inspecting part numbers and counting quantities. afterwards I would make sure that stock would be placed in the correct locations to be picked and shipped to the companies clients. I started before any stock was receivede tin the building I assisted in the placement off shelving for stock by the use of high lo and other heavy equipment. I learned a lot about inspecting and shipping,"
good,"A great place to work,growing company. Plenty of opportunity for overtime."
good,"at ametek we would read blue prints and wire cabinets to specification, i had good co workers and menagment, the hardest part of the job was siting in a cabinet all day ."
good,"Good company to work for, very friendly and helpful. A very good working environment with understandable management. Room for improvement in certain areas but generally place to be at."
good,"Algo desorganizado la informacion, no hay SAP y los procesos son manuales."
good,"Overall good company to work with, learned quite of things while I worked their. I was lucky to have great colleagues with ametek. They helped me a lot and learned a lot from my colleagues in ametek/edax."
good,"A typical day would be going in to a assigned machine that is already running. You would then control screw speed and temperature on a control panel. Utility jobs are adding raw material, and mixed blends into hoppers. Management is fair and the job is union. The work culture is ok. Nobody seemed interested in there job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with various chemicals. As for the most enjoyable part of the job would be the laid back vibe. Do your work and go home."

good,"The company was easy to work for but way to much favortism between management and a few of the ""good old boy"" and the rules only applied to a select few."
good,Empresa que trabalha com motores de peças da linha branca.
good,The job was good but the pay was poor. Plus they made promises when i was was hired about raises which where not kept. They said it was due to company policy changes and since i didn't have it in writing i never received that particular raise. That was one of the main reasons i left the company.
good,Productivity was a constant battle. Making the numbers monthly stressed out all employees. The battle never ended. Corporate always wanted more. If you made your budget it was not good enough. Communication was poor from upper MGT and Corporate. The almighty dollar was main issue.
good,"Ametek has BU culture and its product company, Work we get here  in India is entirely based on BU which is situated some where in USA. Hence we will get small bit sand pieces of work which most of the time junk. Hence there is no career growth, but has some level job security as long as we satisfy the BU."
good,"Great group of people to work with. I was able to to be home for dinner every night with my family. I wish it paid more hourly because even though everything else was great, it was hard for me and my wife to pay our monthly bills."

good,"Great job, great people.  Leaving was difficult but business is business!  Company is constantly reorganizing.  The teamwork among the company staff is amazing.  Hard working people with the goal that the company succeeds.  Unfortunately, with such a small group a cut had to be made and I was it.  Hope the company gets back on its feet and prospers."
good,Ametek es una compañia en la cual brinda empleo a cientos de personas el ambiente es agradable para trabajar ahi se puede ver que existe una armonia entre los operadores.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo "
good,My position at Ametek changed over time as the sales force expended and contracted from direct sales to sales representatives back to direct sales.  The ability to manage a growing market for 7 years was the most rewarding time of my business career.  Having the ability to oversee the development of an entire product line and be involved with all aspects of the sales and marketing was a great learning experience for my business growth.
good,"In my position, there's not enough time in the day to truely do what's expected and have a good feeling at the end of the day that you've been successful in completing all your tasks. The days tend to mentally bleed over into the next and it's very easy to get overwhelmed."
good,"A typical day at Ametek is anything but typical. The jobs vary based on products being ran on lines. I learned how to operate many machines while working there such as a forklift, plastic extruder, pallet wrapper, mixer, and a bag sealer. The co-workers are fairly easy to get along with, but you must have a sense of humor. The hardest part of the job in my opinion would be that there is just alot of material to learn at Ametek. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job would be that after you meet some of the people they do not have any problems answering questions you may have."
good,"A typical day at work would include hand pasting or using a stencil, using a manual pick & place to put all smt parts, use a small oven to solder all parts to pcb. Some parts would need to hand solder on and, then check all solder joints with a microscope for imperfections using the j-standards."
good,"I was a long-term temp in an Oil & Gas Company hired for Accounts Payable.  I enjoyed working with Accounts Payable, Expense Reports, approving Freight Bills for Petrolab, and assisting Cost Accountant with Labor Spreadsheets. They had a large layoff related to the Oil & Gas industry in which I was one laid off."
good,"Empresa sólida com ampla visão de mercado e crescente expansão nos mais diversos segmentos em que atua com alto investimento sendo realizado no Brasil em suas novas instalações."
good,Decent pay. Nice bosses. Work got boring as I was only on a 5 month contract while still in college. I heard they fired everyone in tax though. I did learn a lot about international Tax.
good,Each day at work was a busy day. I learned and developed a new set of skills with Ametek. Management did not have easy task and the enviroment at times was not a comfortable one. The hardest part of this job was dealing with day to day issues amongst employees that would go unresolved. I enjoyed the time and most of the personel I worked with.
good,Wide range of tasks which I liked. My manager was very pleasant. Co-workers were hard working.
good,the hardest part about working there was watching everyone leave when production was sent to Mexico
good,"VTI/"
good,"provided you are in a good business unit, you can enjoy good work-life balance, and other benefits. Its a flat organization, but due to so many business units, it may look little unfocused at times. One must understand that at corporate level, it is a sales organization."
good,Top bosses are not very professional. They prefer employees to spend more time at work rather than the amount of work done. Ofcourse they pay very well.
good,In general the position was interesting and challenging. Perfect from that perspective. My primary issue with Ametek is specific to the culture and the fact that over time I believe there would be conflict with respect to conducting business and how employees are treated.
good,easy going environment to work for; fast paced and excellent job training; room for advancement in company
good,"1.A fun palce to work"
good,All the employees in Ametek have the customer oriented attitude. They truly care about customers' needs.
good,"Place has a great atmosphere to work in. Management is good for the most part. Mt department, used to be Final Gold Assembly. I used to do precision final assembly work. This work consisted of small parts in a metal package. Worked with a great crew of girls. Work also consisted of reading blue prints, using small tools for assembly, microscope. That is not the only thing I did. Used to work in the rest of the plant to, such as punch room, office work, wire racking, chemical packer, tool & dye, blank & draw, sanding room, floor girl, assembly floor, furnace unloader, packer."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,I loved the Hr department they were real genuine people and they naturally cared about their employees. On the warehouse floor I really didn't see as much profession as in the office. There is a lot of nagging and bickering and to be completely honest a whole lot of lies. There are improper managers in leader positions and they need to be moved due to lack of skills.
good,"We follow work life balance, which helps all the individuals to work from home, this is something great. where we can concentrate both at a time. Work culture is good & Our BU is Awesome."
good,"Good company to work for.  Good benefits package. Co-workers are knowledgeable and patient, easy to work with.  Team building is promoted throughout the company."
good,High volume work for a low salary. Work is very slow now. Talking about lay offs. Most people start at $10:00 per hour. Keep adding workload to your job.

good,"Was not a bad place to work, but i did not work in area of my experience. Would have lie to design power supplies but never got in the right group to do that job."
good,"I was kept extremely busy in my department almost to the point of exhaustion. I learned many new things working here, including the operation of the print pad machine and how to calibrate T-scales. I was just unable to keep the pace of trying to do the work of four positions and still make quota for the department I worked in. As there are several different departments and production lines at this location, I do not believe management was fully aware of how pressured the department I worked in was. The company, in general, was generous during the holidays and on certain occasions, but salary did not reflect worth for amount of work performed in some cases. As much as I enjoyed certain aspects of my employment there, it saddens me to admit toward the end of my employment the most enjoyable part of the job was punching out to go home."
good,I really liked it there I enjoyed the work. It was wiring UPS's buliding sub assemblies
good,"It's always a different assignment so you'll never get bored doing the same thing, every motor is a challenge. Good mind exercise."

good,"No Comment0 it could use better mgt proper cross training and no tell they show alot and they're quick to fire you, you've upper mgt that been there to long"
good,Ametek is a good company. The manufacturing arena is difficult to manage. Resources that are needed are not easily available due to tight budget constraints. Lack of resources can be frustrating when assigned a task that has a high cost.
good,"Relocated to cheaper state and foreign country. While in U. S. , they were continually in cost cutting mode which hurt product and longevity at customers."
good,"This job is for the self motivated. There are plenty of challenges, and it gives the employee a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. My position requires travel and great interpersonal skills."
good,Brookfield was bought out by ametek and everything change it wasn't like a family any longer lots of changes I went out for surgery and when my short term disability ran out I was out of a job
good,A lot of the work is done cheaper by this company. They are growing and increasing their sales by acquiring a lot of contracts. Difficult part of the job is the early first shift that starts at 6:00am. Technicians come in at 4:00am and the office workers come in at 8:00am to hold daily meetings on the production floor. Enjoyable part of work is connecting with people during breaks.

good,"40 hours per week"
good,"It was great to learn a lot about electronics manufacturing and surge protectors. My coworkers were all nice people and the culture was positive there. A lot of times however, I would ask for things to do and they would not get around to giving me projects so I spent more time surfing the internet then I would have liked. I kind of had to make things happen for myself at times. Good learning experience overall though."
good,Ametek is a fast paced company that is dedicated to quality products.This is a good company to work for and the pay is above the average pay rate and there is room for advancement
good,Ametek provides a Work Life Balance that I did not have in my last two jobs.  I enjoy being able to have a life outside of work.  I would expect to have this benefit on my next job also.

good,"Relax, comfortable working environment. However, work reduction and transferred to Mexico. Feeling sad for American workers."
good,"Good place to work, decent group of people, My pay was very good. But, was a temp for two years. Slightly out of touch management but good people, Management mainly consisted of people that had been promoted over time with the company. Lacking in proper management training. Company does have some issues with proper training for less skilled employee's. Overall it was a good experience and decent place to work."
good,I am working this company almost 10 years.Technical teams are really fantastic and effective.Flexible and cares about employees. Great people. Good collaboration among engineering and production teams.
good,"Good place to work.  The moved 90% of their manufacturing to Mexico for cheaper labor, so there are very few career opportunities at Ametek / Dixson inc."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, se trabaja muy bien en equipo, varias areas de oportunidad"
good,"working at reading alloys is hard work, alot of lifting, operating machinery, constantly moving around. It is a very challenging and demanding job, but since you are constantly engaged in work, the time seems to fly by and you go home tired, but with a sense of accomplishment. Safety is big at the company because if you are not careful you can lose a body part, or worse, your life."
good,"Ametek SCI is a very good place to work, the management is good and the product is excellent.  The pace is some what demanding with little at home time.

I really enjoyed my work there it was just that they had a down sizing before the end of the year."
good,"Very hot environment and monotonous, Management could be more relative that everyone has a family to go home to. high turnover rate, Long days sometimes mandatory 7 day work weeks."

good,Great team environment with consistent goals across the business.  Everyone was on the same page.  The only issue is the market served is very small and susceptible to major impacts due to economic environment.
good,Was a very relax work place.  I would start off the day being given my work assignment.  I never felt rushed to complete any assignment. Management would provide constructive advice if they felt they saw a mistake.
good,"Ametek is a good company but what makes it better are the employees. Very hard working and dedicated people, the average employee has worked here for more than 20 years. I wish it was not temporary but meeting all of the awesome employees made it all worth it."
good,"Rauland -Borg Corp. was acquired by Ametek Corp."

We support each other in everything and I think that the hardest part of the job is to always smile even though you get calls from upset customers.

good,Working for AMETEK was a challenge. Good environment to learn management skills. My direct supervisor was extremely knowledgeable. Upper management had a tendency to be overbearing.
good,"The work consisted of a range of tasks that were at times monotonous or interesting. My coworkers were the highlight of the working experience and made each day something to look forward to. Management wasn't afraid to climb into the trenches and provide a hand when the workload got heavy. The hardest part of the job would be working long stretches in the sun which is tiring but a required evil, however I was provided with beverages and allowed time to cool-down when needed."

good,"A typical day at work would be prospecting, following up on leads and update progress in Salesforce, quoting and forecasting. I learned new products and markets.  Ametek has a fairly top heavy management and is too light in engineering.  The hardest and most frustrating part of the job is expediting customer samples through the engineering department. I think, like most salespeople, the favorite part of my job is working with the customers to turn a new opportunity to a win (i.e. orders)."
good,"Like any publicly held corporation, there is s lot of red tape and demanding goals that is directed by the corporate office. This can make the job stressful at times, especially quarter ends. However, the environment of Ametek MRO Midwest is fairly laid back. The different departments work well as a team. Some employees lack communication skills and make it difficult to resolve conflict.

I enjoy having the variety of things to do as it keeps me constantly learning and busy."
good,"My day starts of at 6:00am. I review production from prior day and make sure goal were hit. Schedule work load for production to start promptly at 7:30. Review all new incoming orders, check bill of material for parts and schedule accordingly. Everyone here is like family, we all work as a team. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with my busy schedule. Because we are a lean manufacturing company, I sometimes have to get in the cells and build product, which causes me to sometimes fall a bit behind. I love what I do and love the family oriented co-workers I work with, specially management."

good,"Pultroppo, e solo con contratti con l'agenzia.. Peccato che sia così."
good,This is more like production work and my job isn't that hard. It's hot though and you wear a lot of PPE from the company. I get moved around when I ask which is good the supervisors care about being fair. I'm paid well and get every other weekend off but sometimes there's an extra mandatory weekend. It's like a family people get along and watch out for each other. like anyone knows you've got to be safe in this kind of work they don't play around with that stuff. They care about listening to what we say even though they can't always do some stuff but you can tell they're always trying to do better which some places just don't care. I don't know where all these other people worked but they just sound sour because they lost their job for being dumb.
