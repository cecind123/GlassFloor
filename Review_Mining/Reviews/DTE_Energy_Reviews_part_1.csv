rating,review
bad,If you're a call center professional look elsewhere. I cannot stress this enough. You will be overworked and underpaid and constantly blamed for things you aren't empowered to effect. This is only a good job for someone just starting out if they get out fast.
bad,"I have been working as a contractor for some time now and it is hard to be accepted here if your skin is not white. Full time employees have no liability and keep doing big blunders and there is no one to ask them but if you being a contractor do a tiny mistake such as putting up a meeting when the person is not fully available, you will get fired.   "
bad,"I would not recommend working with this company. There were so many changes even the supervisors couldn't not keep up with the pace. On top of that, there were errors to the customers statement due to new billing program roll-out and upper management did not believe the CSRs when told about the errors."
bad,mess with your pay and  hours if management did not favor a person. management would shorten your breaks and lunches also. they would even prohibit water from being brought in.
bad,Not for everyone if you dont like high call volumes and long days think twice before you decide to apply. hopefully they get better management because the call center sucks
bad,Very unlawful practices. No advancement. Management will prohibit if necessary. Beware! They are NOT who they portray themselves to be. Not a progressive company.
bad,It had nothing to offer me. I liked it at first and then I started to actually notice a lot of things that I did not like about the job so I decided to quit.
bad,"You get yelled at at least 30 times a day by customers, the management is unfair to employees and the system (SAP) to help the customers doesn't work! It has so many errors and the management doesn't know how to fix it. The training they gave us, good luck with the job after that training nothing they say helps. This place is a last resort job. Unemployed and just can't find work, trust me not long after I got hired in I was looking for another job. And I know about half the people there are searching as well."
bad,"Overall decent place to work, great place to start entry level."
bad,"Worked there for two years. Got a pay cut, paid vacations/holiday/sick days taken away and half the pay union members got. New hires were coming in at more than experienced reps."
bad,"Management is very rude"
bad,"DTE promotes a corporate culture of zero respect for contract employees. It expects the same frequently more productivity than from its own employee's but provides them little or no training on DTE processes or procedures so they can do their job. They got no paid days off or vacation because the contract vendor uses the steep hourly rate paid for the contractor for its profit and overhead.Thereis no overtime, you will end up working for freeto keep yourjob.Contractors get terminated on any whim of supervisor or manager. They are never considered for full time spots."
bad,"* 18 months probation- no raise, could be fired at anytime"
bad,"Once upon a time, this company managed to provide useful services to the communities which comprise its customer base while actually valuing its employees. Today, it is overburdened by multiple layers of management whose members perpetuate their own agendas and career paths by appropriating the contributions and accomplishments of lower level employees to buff up their own pedigrees. I had several managers and wannabe supervisors pilfer projects and ideas that resulted in millions of dollars in revenue while refusing to acknowledge the contributions of individuals. Engineers elect to pursue clerical work, finance people have job responsibilities that are not related to their backgrounds, and the marketing department in the gas division are staffed by people with no marketing expertise and are nothing more than glorified customer service reps. This skewed skill set / job positioning contributes to inefficiency and redundant work assignments; which in turn necessitates the subsidiaries' aggressive cost increases via annual rate hikes. Impossible to advance in the company using skill sets innovation or intellect; solely based on a archaic inbred corporate structure. Senior management's only means of showing company growth is to crawl to the Public Service Commission every year to self implement rate increases. Instead of rewarding ability, the company now elects to quantify key processes via one size fits all standard work instructions and process mappings to negate the need value employees appropriately. Engagement is frequently used by management as a catchphrase to stigmatize"
bad,"The management team was very unprofessional, they show favoritism, they wrote you up for any little thing. They expected you to be on the phones at all times. They didn't want you to go to the bathroom. That was the worst job I ever had.The pay was to low."
bad,"No clear focus "
bad,"Management didn't care about their employees, only about revenue. You are expected to be available 24/7 without compensation. All year long management dangled bonuses over the employees heads only to find loopholes to take them away."
bad,Difficult working conditions management does not care They do not support employees. Management does not listen to employees. Too concerned with profits
bad,"Mandatory Diversity, if your a white male stay home. The company has website pages dedicated to showing the % of diversity, those departments with an ""incorrect"" blend are mandated to hire enough ""diverse"" people to get % correct."
bad,"It wasn't the actual main headquarters of DTE, it was a third party program set up by the company. Unfortunately, the program is unprofessional and unorganized."
bad,When there power outages you can end up working 16 hour days for multiple days - did not like that at all. And they even required you to work on your days off.
bad,"The training overall is very poor, but after not working here for a while I did learn some things, but you mostly need to seek out training for yourself.  Most employees are not friendly, management was constantly changing.  I did have a couple of good bosses, but most were terrible.  Most love to set you up to fail.  DTE also has a history of certain undesired behaviors which still exist.  I never felt that I was compensated fairly and had to fight in order to get promotions whenever I was under a boss that was not very good.  Time off program was pretty good, benefits were decent.  If you can get into the right group you may have a chance to excel but of course as with any company a good group has very little turnover."
bad,"As a former employee it was a very challenging environment. I read all the reviews and my experience was not a pleasant one. I found both management and some of the employees extremely cut throat. There was a lot of yelling and disrespect and you are viewed as weak if you take the high ground. Hence, why I resigned could no longer subject my emotional well being to the abuse. "
bad,Workplace culture consists of who you know and friends and family plan in order to get ahead or considered for any good position within this company. Inept management.
bad,"No good. DTE made all kinds of mistakes when their new system went live. "
bad,staffed for DTE with dialog direct. Dialog was very unprofessional and should not have had the contract with DTE to begin. Leadership was very poor and did not have a direct narrative on success amongst their agents.
bad,"I was just a few weeks away from completing my first year when my attendance came under review due to some missed time. Within a five-month span of time, I, unfortunately, was in a car accident, had laryngitis, and then the flu. I submitted documentation to verify the circumstances but was fired anyway. No assistance from the union (even though they took union dues out of every paycheck), no opportunity to appeal, just thrown to the curb like a piece of garbage."
bad,"The management and culture is toxic. Management education and office politics are valued over experience."
bad,I enojoyed the job and the peole i work with but sometimes the stress of the job was more then I could handle.
bad,"I have been an employee at the company for 25 years and the culture hasn't changed. In fact there is nothing fun or exciting about working at the company. In fact, DTE should not be included on any list as being one of the best places to work. Management is horrible and when you report the offences to the ethics dept. nothing is resolved. The salary is good. However, when becoming a part of the culture your realize you just sold your soul to the devil. Meaning if you are mean and rude and believe in getting a head by any means necessary you will love working here. But if you are a sweet, kind hearted soul you'll need medication or therapy by the time you retire, if not sooner . I am considering changing careers because no one should have to go to work having to be so assertive, since kindness is viewed as weakness there. When I see the young co-op students I feel really sorry for them. Take it from me if you are ever out on the street and run across a DTE employee if they seem really hostile and rude to you, believe you me they have been damaged by the environment. The Executives care nothing about improving the environment. The company gives a really good performance by doing things for the community every now and then. All they really care about is making sure the shareholders earn a profit. Since I've been with the company I've only known 2 employees that retired having pleasant things to say. The other 98% were happy to leave and wanted nothing to do with any of the hard hearted individuals that worked there. If I had to do it all over I wouldn't have allowed the money to"
bad,The say that they do not discriminate based on gender identity but they do just that. They host fundraisers for Equality Michigan yet fire people that they claim to help and support.
bad,"Management not up to par they do not have a people orientation"
bad,no advancement for Administrative/Executive assistance. Old mentally. sexist and racist. They are just now trying to develop their Diversity platform. Behind the times in areas such as diversity and still practice unethical terminations.
bad,"Manager in charge of my group was more interested in moving his career than interested in his people. "
bad,"Poorly managed company. They hemorrhage money like no other. The IT department is awful, as is the HR department."
bad,Management fails to take accountability for their mistakes. They do not care about the well-being of their employees. The pay is far too low for the job requirements.
bad,loading a small car with materials into the car daily. going from house to house throughout michigan.
bad,If you contract here then you should be ready for different treatment from the management positions. They do not care about the contractors that work for them.
bad,"They want yes men/women! Do not have your own thoughts. Upper management is horrible, do not practice what they preach! They promote people to positions where they are completely not ready for the role!"
bad,"Working at DTE Energy was my first experience in inbound calls and seemed to be pretty exciting to begin with. I enjoyed most having my own cubicle and being able to decorate it."
bad,"If leaders aren't given autonomy to lead, why hire them? They're hired and then trained on what to say to their direct reports, like reading off a script.  A script that's to be read each and every day--which was redundant and mind-numbing."
bad,Not much to say. Depending on what department you get placed in determines how you will feel about the place. Not much room for growth as a co op or a contracted employee - they are very limited on their job openings here. One opening will come up and hundreds will apply - leaving one person to get the job and the millions of other hopeful interns / contractors scrambling to get a full time career before they graduate. Other companies have more structure with their intern / co op programs - you are almost guaranteed a full time job if you preform well at other companies. Here is a lot of you have to be in the right place at the right time. DO NOT put all your eggs in this one basket with this company.
bad,I really didn't enjoy working there.  I felt as a temp employee I was treated as a lower part of the company.  I learned how to deal with customer difficult customers.
bad,"High stress, tight schedules, several projects at one time and upper management was high."
bad,too much work too few people.  Downsizing really hit work force hard.
bad,The only way to advance is to be sleeping with management. They play favoritism and not enough assistance with hard cases. No empathy for the customers at all. The employees dred coming to work
bad,"an environment that could be hostile, and uncomfortable working place where it was to hot during the summer due to no air or windows and to cold during the winter."
bad,"Most of the things depend on your Manager/boss. I had a technical manager to report to, about my tasks and a senior manager to report to, regarding schedules, vacations, work from home options etcetera."
bad,"The student co-op program at DTE Energy is quite varied. While some students work in a desirable department relevant to their field, other students, such as myself work manual labor jobs. There is nothing wrong with manual labor and people who do it should be respected. However students apply to DTE to hone their skills in a specific field, not wash meters and mop floors."
bad,"The student co-op program at DTE Energy is quite varied. While some students work in a desirable department relevant to their field, other students, such as myself work manual labor jobs. There is nothing wrong with manual labor and people who do it should be respected. However students apply to DTE to hone their skills in a specific field, not wash meters and mop floors."
bad,"-Lack of Guidance/Training"
bad,Typical day of work consisted of counting our starting drawer. We posted payments to customer's utility accounts.
bad,"Balancing our cash drawer, processing customer's payment to their accounts"
bad,"Management promotes negative behavior, back-stabbing and flat out lying.  If you complain retaliation will start.  They talk a good talk about ""culture"" and ""employee engagement"" but management thinks its a joke and really does not promote it.  Team work is not a normal thing, it's more about making each other look bad in order to make yourself look good.  The atmosphere is horrible.  If you are seen smiling, you are immediately disliked and it is assumed you must not be doing your job.  Job growth or development does not happen, typically only people who fit the mold of being negative, back stabbing, talking bad about others or are cut throat get developed. Ethics reporting is a joke, if you do report something, they don't keep it confidential and the offender if management will be found that they did nothing wrong and retaliation will start.  One Manager has had so many complaints filed against them and still nothing has been done."
bad,"Management at DTE has a long way to go.  There are too many department managers who have poor leadership skills.  Employee engagement is low because of their lack of people skills.When you are away from your desk, managers in HR actually roam around and rummage through your desk or work space.  Too much emphasis on Continuous Improvement.  Employees feel pressed to give good ratings to management so they provide false information on Employee Engagement Surveys."
bad,"As my first internship, this did not meet my requirements since as I was expecting to use more of my engineering background to complete tasks. Instead, I was placed in a call center and learned the basics of how the distribution system work hoping to calm every angry customer through my basic understanding. No training was provided to learn more, it was more so on how to work the company programs. The manager did not have much interaction with the intern students."
bad,"Ask all the employees that have been there for less than 5 years as CSR's if they are living the dream?  There is nothing  like coming to work everyday to be verbally abused by our customers, for something we have never toughed or seen before."
bad,"Ghetto a** environment, unorganized, no opportunity for advancements, no raise, barely get a break because you have to return early just to clock in on time due to bad system and slow PC's. Mostly females, ghetto af. 7minute call handle is forced or they will eventually get rid of you."
bad,"While most of DTE is fun and changing rapidly, IT is stuck and needs huge changes. Leadership is poor at best in IT. If you're looking for a place to learn and grow this isn't it. If you want to create power points and attend meetings then DTE IT is for you!"
bad,"If you are in IT, this place will work you into the ground. The don't treat their employees good and no one feels appreciated."
good,"I've been working here for sometime, and it some managers and directors are great, while others are not so much. It's an okay environment, however, there are not many people within the 21-30 age range, making it less appealing to work, along with no pension or benefits. HR is an absolute nightmare"
good,This job is not for anyone with children. They lie to get you to work for them and then never do anything that was offered in your interview. They never gave me my raise.
good,if you're a co-op make sure you meet as many people as you want. this place is very political. So you better hope your manager likes your personality.
good,Place needs lots of improvement. Management needs to stop bandaiding everything and fix things. They don't care about anyone. There's no such a thing as leniency.
good,"I was a contract employee.  I was held to different standards.  No mistakes were allowed, No sick or vacation days.  The middle management was unappreciative and there was a high turnover."
good,"They use contractors in IT keys positions, however they don't last long due their 2 year rule. Which means, a major brain drain.  "
good,Had to work in extreme hot and cold conditions.  Had to work shift work which is very hard on your body.  Sometimes we would get stuck on doubles when are releaves would not come into work.
good,"The company has been around for years and some of the policies show just that. This is a very reputable company, lots of things to learn and policies to understand. The hardest part of the job is getting up everyday coming to a job where you feel unappreciated and get under paid."
good,"usually extremely busy and I took escalated calls all day. "
good,good place to work mangment needs to keep their promises. Some mangers only look out for themselves dont try to help a new engineer. Had a bad experiance there.
good,Company closed. Hard to review it but it was fun while it lasted. We worked hard to launch the company but 9/11 came along and kind of messed with what was going on.
good,Working for DTE energy it started off fun but going day after day my interest level started to decrease. A typical work day was the same everyday which was reading meters. I learned how to read meters and I learned how to increase my meter reading accuracy. The management in my humble opinion were not very understanding but tolerable. My co-workers were very helpful and patient with me. The hardest part of my job was reading meters and going to some strange places to do so. The most enjoyable part of this job was being employed by them.
good,Company has a good reputation as a place to work. But there are those Managers and Directors that will treat you badly. Unfortunately I had to work for that type.
good,"Very busy with incoming calls and handllng customer's concerns daily. Attendance is very strict, the work day can be stressful and also very relaxed at times"
good,A Pay Check! The pay for dealing with all that you deal with is definitely NOT compatible with a High Stress position! Management and the Pay structure need to be revised.
good,Not allowed to think outside the box; constricted to one role; lack of diversity within the corporation places limits on common mission; the company is doing better on working within the community.
good,"The work is repetitive and mundane. It can be very stressful at times."
good,They dont care about job performance they instead only care about their 2yr co-employment rule. I dont think I would return here.
good,"Typical work day is very demanding with VERY minimal pay (less than $11.00 an hour. I learned about DTE Energy and their software systems and operations.  I would rather not comment about management. I have a good relationship with my coworkers in my dept. and other departments as well.  The hardest part of the job is the over bearing micromanagement and constantly having to sit in your seat all day.  If you get up management is not very happy about it and most times are made to feel very uncomfortable.  There is no respect from management and sometime will talk to you very rudely.  The most enjoyable thing is that I have learned a lot of new skills and computer software systems. They have never given any one a raise, even the people who have been there over 10 years and when asked about raises they say they are working on it.  I ended up finding out that they will never be raising the pay rate and will never hire in for that department."
good,DTE is not a good company to advance and grow in unless you're an engineer or a manager.
good,It's a nice work place I learned lots of great things like how to read gas and light meters and how to disconnect meters .The management was ok the co-workers was to there was not a hard part of the job at all the enjoyable part is learning new stuff every day.
good,"DTE has what's called SOS (Start of Shift) mandatory overtime.  No matter what schedule you pick they reserve the right to schedule 2 hours at the start of the shift.  If call volume dictates it, there can be up to 4 hours added to the end of shift (EOS).  During a catastrophic storm DTE will require 12 hours everyday until the storm crisis is contained.   None of this was explained."
good,"No casual work "
good,Very stressful environment. Task were given without fully being explained. Management didn't always have the best interest of their subordinates. Workload was ridiculous at times.
good,DTE does not offer a lot of advancement for its contract workers. Contract workers are not well compensated and often ignored. The call volume in the call center is high and on occasion mandatory overtime is required.
good,"Unfortunately, DTE does not hire Contractors in IT.  They also have a maximum 2yr policy for employment.  I have seen many outstanding personal that had to leave due to contracts expiring."
good,"It’s like highschool all over again union does not do anything for you but take your money management goes off rumors can be stressful mandatory overtime is a plus but if you don’t want it it’s a hard process to get released from"
good,always had to work overtime and was 6 days a week.The coaches were some what mean and rude and wouldnt explain thing to you when you asked questions..
good,"DTE is a good company, however, the leadership in the Ann Arbor location is very lacking in their leadership skills, ability to create team environment, and make all feel important to work being done.  They over look the efforts of many on the team.  Lack appreciation of staff's efforts."
good,"Overall, I enjoy most of the people with whom I work with however, the particular department in which I work leaves much to be desired from a management level.  Leadership does not care about many things beyond fuel usage/contracts, FERC regulations, government regulations and the MPSC.  If your work does not fall DIRECTLY in line with the aforementioned then they overlook your efforts and have the nerve to say that it lack ""visibility.""  Also, leadership ""picks and chooses"" those who progress into higher positions but justify their decisions by following the HR process (ie, publishing job postings and holding interviews.  This allows them to cover their tracks and give the appearance that they are being unbiased.  "
good,Started work from home and worked in the field assisting customers troubleshooting electric service problems.
good,"Friendly co-workers & nice place to work, they do alot for the community in giving back and involves the whole staff and company with fun and rewarding interaction"
good,You start in customer service and there is no room for advancement unless you know someone. All promotions are temporary and the benefits can be better. There is no sympathy for life situations.
good,"Management level at DTE is not good.  Management lacks leadership, and tends to discriminate against certain employees.  The job has great benefits, with work life balance.  But certain management level personnel have an outdated thinking method on folks from different backgrounds."
good,DTE Does not understand family emergencies and does not balance well . There is not enough paid time off hours for a year. Compensation does not line up with workload.
good,"The job is very emotionally taxing, the customers and the management are very hard to deal with. The management is in shambles due to the system upgrade recently and the work morale is very poor."
good,Answer calls for customer set up service. Review and make payments on bills. was not there long plus it has been a few years so I do not have much of an opinon
good,I worked as a temp and was never on the permanent payroll.  I was not privy to any of the company benefits so I cannot comment on them.
good,"My day consists of word processing and an abundance of technical writing. I have little to no communication with other employees in any given day, and the work load is painfully monotonous."
good,"Excellent work environment."
good,I was a full time contractor in the communications department. The work was fun but not challenging. No room for growth. No real interaction with management.
good,"They work with certain employees when it comes to taking time off..  When employees are required to work over on any day of the week, and come in on weekends.  They do not get overtime if they are on management because supposedly they are salary employees. But if they do take time off their schedule to care for their children such as taking them to school before work and picking them up when no one else is available, they tell you that you are not salary."
good,I did not find my time at DTE Energy very useful. The days dragged on and I was not busy enough. My coworkers were great and my boss cared about helping me succeed but did not challenge me enough.
good,Good place to start your career out of school. Very corporate culture. Work life balance is not great. The departments are very micromanaged. Put your head down and do your job and don't question anything.
good,"The culture at DTE Energy has evolved over the years to focus on the engagement and development of younger employees in the work force.  Unfortunately, it also diminished its focus on older workers in favor of this new paradigm.  Over the last several years of my career there, I experienced multiple changes in leadership, with no real sense of consistency or engagement by the leaders.  My department was somewhat isolated and often we would have limited contact with leadership to discuss  and resolve issues.  Consequently morale suffered, and the work environment became somewhat toxic.  I am not implying that this type of situation was widespread through the company, that is just my personal experience.."
good,"Non-regulated parts were more interesting and stimulating"
good,"Often the days drag and work gets a tedious sometimes. However, the huge emphasis on safety is comforting. Employees are mostly respectful, but tend to blame co-ops for everything wrong."
good,"My experience probably doesn't apply generally because I was part of an internship program. I was part of a big internship program that had over 120 interns. Most interns started out doing grunt work e.g. scanning documents and are supposed to steadily move up a ladder of different tasks before starting to do actual engineering work. The workplace is alright and working with 120 other student interns is pretty fun, but I definitely recommend only taking an internship with them if you're legitimately interested in working in an energy company."
good,"This was my first job after finishing college.  It's a good job for gaining experience as an engineer in the nuclear power (or power generation) industry.  It's a good job if you like maintaining 50+ year old technology, or if you like doing the same thing over and over again.  The pay is decent.  However, as far as engineering goes, most of the engineers are glorified clerks that interface with vendor experts.  If you want to do real engineering work, then you must present a business case why you should learn/do something that would benefit the company."
good,"all though I received plenty of hours, the working conditions were very unsafe, they provide you with masks and ear plugs but they were very poor/satisfactory, and didn't make much of a difference, the heat was unbearable and it eventually drove me to resign."
good,Good Company to work for. Financially stable. Takes good care of their employees. Flexibility is provided during the work hours. Their recent outsourcing to Accenture has reduced the IT related jobs in the company.
good,The 3rd party company I worked for did some of DTE call center work. I believe it would have been better to work directly for DTE Energy. This job has been the most stressful job at a call center I have every worked.
good,It was a good place to develop skills that has helped me to advance at this stage in my career. It was a great learning experience. I met life long friends while there because we helped to inspire one another.
good,"Family company, very busy, helping one another daily, i have learned to not take things personal, try your best to assist the customer, relax, enjoy, and be open to learning."
good,This job showed very few opportunities for raises and advancements. I spent 18 months doing the same work over and over again with very few recognition for the work i did. Job itself is not bad but the management is terrible.
good,Few non-auto companies to work in Detroit.  DTE is one of them.  Not many opportunities for growth and somewhat of a secure job once you get in.  The culture will take time to adjust if you are from Michigan.
good,"The environment was clean. They have very nice employees, and is a great company to work for as a career. They have great benefits and pay. They train you to understand the product as well."
good,"Responsible for 3.5 million dollar catering and retail operation. Hire, lead, direct, coach, train, and develop catering and retail team."
good,A typical day as a meter reader was I did my routes and entered information into the CAP system. I learned how to complete routes. Management was o.k. . Hardest part was working in the snow.
good,Way to many people involved to make a simple decision! We had to have meetings about the previous meetings and to me it seemed nothing was accomplished by this as there were to many voices.
good,"Great benefits and pay salary is fair but lacks career development."
good,The work environment was very stressful and competitive. There was no chance of getting hired in and you were subject to random drug tests although you were just a temporary employee.
good,"give us an opinion about a typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,Bartech was a temporary job service I utilized while in between jobs. They sent me on an assignment very quickly and I remained at the job until a full-time position became available at another company.
good,It depends on who you are and what department you work in. That is all I have to say about this corporation. No more to be said at this point and time
good,"Lots of walking youre basically on your own as soon as you leave the office"
good,Long day.Learned how to read meters.Mangers and workplace culture was fair.The hard part was  outside in the weather.Fun  part of the day was customers
good,"Working at DTE gave me the opportunity to learn the IT field (Production Support). I was given the opportunity to Diagnose (Problem Solve - look through log files, code, database, etc.) to solve problems."
good,Large energy company with many different departments and career paths. Good benefits and mostly stable work environment. Tuition reimbursement was helpful.
good,dte is a good place to work they just need to offer more breaks with longer time and  let you be abled to pick a set shift other than that I have no complaints with this company also they will feed there employees and give incentives when you are doing a great job in  the work place .
good,"Was a nice place to work if you didn't mind the higher ups changing the rules on a daily basis, didn't inform you and you got penalized for it."
good,"This energy sector challenge had its rewards and disappointments. As will all large legacy organizations, inertia is usually the biggest obstacle one might face."
good,"A typical day includes taking incoming calls from customers who are calling to start service, stop or transfer to a different address, billing issues or to make payments. Co workers are friendly and fun to be around. Hardest part is working in storm situations when customers have been out for numerous days. Most enjoyable is having catered food when long hours are required."
good,DTE Energy is a stable company with good management. There is a good bunch of co-workers at this site which makes work more enjoyable. They have problems with high turnover among the staff which creates excessive amounts of overtime.
good,"It was a good place to work, helped customers on the phone to get power or to restore pay bills and things like that"
good,"A typical day at work consists of talking with Energy traders, Project Managers, Developers, and other BA's to determine user requirements and communicate those requirements to developers, in order to improve the business users productivity and work experience."
good,The only thing I didn't like about this job was the callers that wanted to argue about their electric bills.
good,DTE makes changes often and not always at the betterment of customers and employees. Last contract renewal they only wanted to provide yearly bonus and no pay increases for 4 years. This was renegotiated and there was minimal pay increases every 2 years of only 2% of hourly pay. Very disappointing and there were multiple changes made to the commission structure with no employee input.
good,Compensation and Benefits very competitive.  Lots of room for growth and opportunity.  Management selects who stays and leaves based of who they know and like.
good,The headquarter is very nice and they have a big cafeteria for lunch and gym for people who want to work out. The offices are a little too small
good,DTE has very long hours but the people are fun.You will get a lot of angry customers and you have to stay grounded and understanding
good,"They had great benefits, I enjoyed my six weeks paid vacation. Liked most of the people I worked with."
good,I learned many excel functions and even how to do an in-house data analysis. The major issue was among the team and failure to communicate how people felt. I really enjoyed their flexible scheduling.
good,"If you think outside of the box, steer clear of this employer.  Standard diversity targets are met well.  Need to work on inclusion of non-typical personalities like autistic people."
good,"The best thing about the company is the benefits! If you don’t have about several people supporting you with children this won’t be a good fit. If there are any type of weather emergencies, and you work in the call center don’t expect it to be excused! If your life revolves around work, and you’re good with being in cliques this is the right place. You will enjoy good holiday breaks."
good,"I worked with a lot of great individuals who were never allowed to perform their best. The company is too large, and verbally claims a ""collaborative environment."" What that really means is that every decision is made in committee, which takes forever and usually results in an inferior, watered-down product. This is not true of all departments, but it was true of two of the departments that I worked in the longest. First line and middle management do not receive enough mentoring or on the job training, and often flounder. There's a lot of office politics and pressure to perform, even if one is not qualified for the job."
good,Shenango suffered from lack of trust from DTE corporate in Detroit. Ultimately this coupled with the back steel climate brought Shenango down and out.
good,You given your assignment to a certain area to cover. Each day you were in a different area. The people I worked with was ok to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the weather. On some days it was extremely hot and other days extremely cold.
good,"The overall workplace is a very good enviroment but, there is no opportunity to move up im the company."
good,this job was ok and the pay was ok as well. the problem for me was with the people that didnt want us in their backyards.
good,"Typical day- depending on the weather, a day could be spent outside checking gas lines and reading business and residential gas meters or in the office filing or entering information into the computer system."
good,"Things are always changing, policies regulations, schedules ect. The 75% of customers are disrespectful or irresponsible. My family had to come 1st. I was stressed and would return home frustrated and in a bad mood. The ""new"" system doesn't work the way it is supposed to work."
good,"Can be very political, especially for advancement opportunities.  It's more about who you know than rather what you know which can be typical at most corporate offices."
good,"HR is ineffective as an employee resource for just about anything excluding legal liabilities."
good,"Good workplace with lot of politics and very slow pace, Higher management is good, but middle managers are sycophants. "
good,I enjoyed working at DTE. The management staff was very helpful. I learned a lot working for them. I also gained better knowledge about how the selection process of an applicant works.
good,"The job is not hard at all, over a period of time you will get better. You work 8 hours a day rain,sleet, and snow but you will get faster and better. I work four hours a day and get paid for eight because you will learn to work fast."
good,"no room to advance"
good,"Current management will not allow us to come in and train on our days off. There is too much stuff going on, while on shift, to properly train.  Other than that its a pretty good place to work."
good,"ok job to work for no the best, need to improve in paying better for the work that is perform. a typical day i spiking up ur route and doing deliverys"
good,"Management with none contracted agreements should be held accountable for lack of ..."
good,"Job was good but the traveling and hours were unbelievable. "
good,"Forced Relocation, management very secretive or just did not have a plan.  I do enjoy the work and fellow employees.  We created a great team despite lack of communication of upper management."
good,This position involved the constant interraction with possible irate customers and a level of tact and calmness had to be executed at all times.
good,DTE is an organization that values training their resources to foster a great workplace culture.  Their is a work life balance that allows an employee not to experience burn out or unappreciated.
good,"it was all good and nice, friendly people. You learn a lot, it can be rotational so you can easily switch/move to a different department and all student co-op are mostly happy"
good,"Nice place to work, parking is a hassle in the mornings. Good benefits, need better supervisors with more efficient training techniques. Overall decent place to work."
good,OK place to work management needs better structure and coaches need more training agents know more than the leaders. No room for advancement or raises.
good,"Work day is receiving and looking of Service Desk tickets that are assigned to my group. Deploying new PC to employee's. Doing break/fix, desktop support for hardware and software issues. Salvaging equipment, maintaining various Microsoft/SQL databases. Using the Symantec Management Agent/Altiris to push software,inventory machines, Run fix it jobs, ect. What I like the most is being able to assist my colleagues with their PC troubles."
good,Being as the self financed new institute lot of works are there. Its always pleasent and learning experience. Some times challenging your capability to find typical solutions for problem arises up.
good,Good place to work . It is a good environment very hard to get in the actual position but it is worth it once you get inside. Very well worth it . It was a good community to work in also good pay training is long but very valuable.
good,"DTE's commitment to the community is often overlooked and what makes it a special place.  For the most part, the employees make their jobs personal, and truly care, especially in the customer service area."
good,Management have a bully mentality. If you not kissing up look out you will be on the outside looking in. Surprised no bad retaliation has happened....
good,"Very antiquated company in some aspects, cutting edge in others. Depends on what part of the company you are in. Benefits are great. Very involved in doing great things for the community."
good,I had a good working relationship with the management team. I had a good understanding of what was expected of me. The work atmosphere was not very stressful.
good,They use contractors for almost all jobs.  They have very few actual DTE employees.  Job was simple and the co-workers were great.  No job security or chance to be hired in.
good,Competitive work environment with a lot of emphasis placed on teamwork. The benefit package was exceptional and it was a pleasure to retire from/work there.
good,DTE allowed me to take on larger data optimization projects from the start of my student co-op and provided a clear roadmap to obtaining a full-time position.
good,DTE is passionate about their contributions to the society they live in and serve. They hold safety to a high standard and it is ingrained in the culture.
good,the atmosphere is awesome and your co workers are very nice... ther will some things that you dont like as with all jobs but nothing that makes you want leave
good,DTE has a great safety culture that not only talks the talks but also walks the walk. Weekly meetings and walk downs were very informative and personable which contribute to overall morale.
good,Overall I loved my coworkers and the customers never gave me a problem. Some of the management however is just too unprofessional and they are very unorganized.
good,Good place to work. No comments. Perfect management and excellent benefits. I would recommend working for DTE Energy. It was a valuable 6 years of experience.
good,"The people are very nice. I learned a little about electrical engineering while I was working there, but I think I would've been better off working in another department in the company."
good,It is a good place to work and the co-workers are very good and encouraging. It provides the good place to learn new technologies and enhance your skills.
good,"A fun place to work, with great people.  The company is very dedicated to serving Detroit, and does so by supporting multiple charities and encouraging employees to take community service days."
good,This is one of the best places to work. There is the existence of team spirit and support. The city itself isn't so much fun.  Great coworkers.
good,"is a Detroit, Michigan-based utility company established in 1995 involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide."
good,"Greatest skilled trade talent to work with so far in my career. Work is performed by procedures and was able to be the mechanical procedure writer, changing procedures and working with engineering and other quality groups understanding how a team operates and seeing the process completed and performed in the field. Also, was elected as Mechanical Safety Representative for the Nuclear Maintenance Group."
good,It was an easy job if you like doing the same thing every day. Could get boring if it wasn't for the great work place and co workers.
good,A typical day at work was a new experience with working and talking with different kinds of customers over the phone. I learned how to handle difficult situation with customers with out getting upset and a way to  handle the situation. The DTE Team members I worked with were typically joyful and great to work with. The hardest part of the job was to me not being able to help someone turn power back one when they needed it when power went out. The best part of my job was helping the customers and making there day better.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me checking emails, attending meetings when required, and reporting to my supervisor after completing assignments and to receive new assignments."
good,I never felt as if I didn't want to be there. I went to work with the expectation that today was going to be more productive than the day before. Management was strict on processes but allowed you to do your job without micro-managing. The opportunities to take company related courses and receive training was great for experience. The best company I've worked for so far.
good,"The work environment was very relaxed and productive"
good,The employees at DTE are a highly engaged and motivated worhforce. Employees are encouraged to take on new responsibilities to advance their careers.
good,"DTE was a wonderful place to work as an high school student, working there opened a realm that I had never experienced. At DTE I was responsible for producing and updating digital blueprints of power plants using micro station software. This job was very important and tedious, if I made a mistake it could create a domino affect of mistakes that could possibly put someone's life in danger. The greatest skill acquired was responsibility.   "
good,"I dont remember much about this job, but I did like the people and the culture"
good,A good place to learn how the proffesional envorment should be. The company dose a lot of things right but a few things wrong in therms of the workplace.
good,Great place to work. Wonderful co-workers. Helpful and friendly people.
good,"● Making sure every teller cash drawer is balance at the end of their shift. ● Examine and verify checks, money orders and cash receive for"
good,Address Mmgt and Customers working with the USPS Postal Office. Customers are call snowbirds these are people who have a home in Michigan and Flordia live here in the summer then move to Flordia in the winter. Customer who moved to a new home but the Post Office Carrier maybe don't know the customer.
good,"Worked there for 3 years, advanced quickly and plateaued. Great bonuses and poor management. Their billing system has been broken for 2 years now and the employees have to face the p[ublic with incorrect bills and bills going to the wrong place or just not showing up."
good,Hours are usually flexible and management as a whole is usually very open to working differing hours as long as you get your work done.  The company is very dependable and didn't even lay any employees off during the recession.  Culture is reasonably progressive with a good amount of diversity from entry level to upper management.  The company as a whole seems to be looking towards investing heavily into people and resources in the upcoming 10 years.  Attrition is a problem for them and around half the workforce will be retiring in the next decade so job advancement could be faster than normal with great leaps possible.  The company is large enough to make it difficult to pin down what a normal day is like.  They offer a fantastic retirement 401K savings program.
good,It was ok. the typical sday was pretty slow it is similar to a government job. the harder you work the compay still makes the same amount of money so it's mostly about politicals and pretendin to look like you are working ahrd.
good,"The culture is really nice, the employees are not as friendly."
good,"DTE is a good company to work for... Forward thinking and nice family atmostphere. "

Ordering part and writing equivalent replacement evaluations explaining why and how it is suitable replacement."
good,"Working for a nuclear power plant was a unique experience.  Safety, responsibility, and alertness are highly valued."
good,A lot of culture and value great place to be. I learned a lot and used that knowledge in my current positions.
good,I enjoyed working at DTE Energy the coworkers is nice and helpful. It is independent work environment for the most part quiet and relaxed environment. I would recommend!
good,"Aging plant that presents challenges. Work hard and do the right work. Safety is huge. People are mostly dedicated professionals. Current management seems ok. Not bad but not inspirational though. Problem is so many processes to use. Too many databases to use. Streamlining is not used. How can you truly improve which they claim is so important. Beats me. Comes down to your team. I recommend this place. Make good coin, good benefits, if you are self starter you can do well."
good,I worked for DTE energy as a sales representative for the home protection plan. The typical day started off with a meeting about our sales goals etc... Then we would get our motivational speeches and bonuses discussed then hit the doors for about 10 hours to sale the protection plan to customers. We had incentives and bonuses to give us motivation to sell even more but we also had minimum quotas we had to meet which could sometimes be stressful because if you don't hit them then you don't get your entire salary.
good,"The group seemed to accept failure and only wanted bandaids.  The processing of invoices, tracking of overtime and efficiency standards were all out of control and there seemed to be little interest in fixing these shortcomings."
good,Day at work could be staying busy to non stop.
good,"A good company to work for. The nature of the job swings from a relaxing day to very stressful."
good,"A lot of busy office work, copying, scanning, organizing file cabinets, etc,. Little actual GIS work, lots of projects that seem to go nowhere. pick your own 8 hour shifts, days off are easy too."
good,Numerous opportunity for growth. Big on energizing your life. Company feeds you on overtime and storm occasions. Celebrate Birthdays for other employees.
good,"If you want a high paying job with great benefits and job security, then it's a great place to work.  However, the hours a long and arduous.  Decisions by management take a very long time to be made."
good,"Not good for international students as it does not sponsor job visa. Excellent company or else, nice package, great learning opportunity, job security"
good,"Great people.  Sometimes can be overwhelming with the amount of people in and out everyday.  Moving internally doesn't seem to be a big issue, which is great.  Overall, good place to work."
good,Typical day involves much walking. Must prepared to fight dogs and deal with angry customers. Only hard part is gas because you use your own vehicle and weather changes.
good,opened warehouse
good,Management at the director level and above applies to much pressure for those beneath that position I’m speaking in customer service only it takes away the positive working environment that  could be accomplished. Way too many lofty expectations on reducing or applying pressure because of MPSC complaints
good,DTE is a good place to work.  The operational work day was collaborative and exciting.  Problems were addressed with a positive outlook.  Operational gaps were addressed with enthusiasm.
good,"It is a good place to work but a lot of processes that on can be tired of. apart from this, everything was good and I really enjoyed my stay over there."
good,There is free parking adjacent to the building and badge entry required. The culture of the workplace changes from time to time such as continuous improvement or customer service or health focus.
good,"Good Company to work with. Great culture and environment. Friendly and Encouraging Management. Nice and Competitive pay. "
good,I get new work orders on a daily basis.  There seems to be new challenges with most of the work orders I receive.  It seems that I learn something new most days which keeps the job interesting.  Always something new to learn with ESRI and Maximo.  Managers are knowledgeable and we have meetings which lets everyone have a voice in the direction of our department.  We are a growing business and we make a significant difference in the community.
good,Continuous improvement efforts were over the top and adversely impacted morale.  
good,The company is lagging in technical innovation because they still use uncontrolled Access databases for mission critical work.  They will not facilitate discussions for working from home.  The manager requires that all department employees attend the the morning meeting regardless of value.
good,Work days are typically 12 hour shifts as a power plant operator. Compensation is a little above industry standard but on a pay progression schedule. This is a great learning experience and has plenty of room for advancement.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Overall, I believe it is a great company to work as an stuent. However, I believe there not enough done from what I saw to transition qualified interns to full-time employees. It is repeated stated how they are looking to hire entry level however many of the positions are for people who have graduated and have years of experience (i.g. senior/principal level). The process to hearback took 3 months from applying to the position to an interview. There seems to be a common talk among employees where many potential full-time employees are lost because of the response time from applications. Otherwise, a great company."
good,"The Co-op program was very well maintained, however, there were times I felt as an assistant (receiving jobs others did not want to complete) instead of an apprentice (learning the field of work each employee is a part of)"
good,"Day to day it was interesting work, trying to make really old outdated combustion boilers maintained and running to meet ever changing EPA standards. Safety is priority #1, and they do good work for communities around the plants.  Food courts were pretty terrible in the plants, and they were outdated. Overall the work was interesting, the PI charts for monitoring the boilers was really challenging to work with, good engineering experience as an intern"
good,"A nice job if yu in need of a 1st shift. The labor is not to hard or not to easy, anyone can do it. They had free water and Gatorade to keep us hydrated. The breaks were nice and management was respectful."
good,"A great place to work for balanced family life. The caveat, its such a mature workforce so its hard to advance. The people here are great people."
good,"co worker were wonderful group to work with  I enjoyed the training ,the education they gave me.. but ther was a lack of diverstysome times during the early part of my career there ,"
good,Probably a pretty typical utility company - really gives you great work/life balance and there is little turnover.  That leads to little opportunities for advancement.
good,Good working environment. The managers are all friendly and helpful.  They try to bring out the best in you while doing your job.
good,DOD operated by Husband and wife. Good company to work for. Pay was little and work was a lot. The experience however here was amazing. I learned a lot in procurements. I got to sharpen up my spanish. It was a great experience.
good,Good Place to work . Great Benefis. Good Clean atmosphere allows opportunity for growth.
good,"Typical day at work included creating financial reports for management and compiling data for those reports."
good,"I've been at DTE Energy for 13 years and have watched the culture change for the better over the years. The group I currently work in is a project management group which manages most of the capital porojects for the company. This group allows a person to bring their best energy to work everyday. I know what is expected of me every day and my work/schedule is self directed. "
good,A typical day at DTE Energy was very interesting. You have your own cubicle to take calls and handle some not so fun situations. I learned to take what everyone says into consideration and try your very best to keep the caller on the other end of the line happy. The managers were very rude. My co-workers were always very focused on their jobs and they didn't pay much attention to anything else. The hardest part of the job was when you couldn't help people get their gas or electric turned back on and they had children or when it was close to the holidays. The best part of my job was when I had customers tell me how nice and sweet I was or that they appreciated everything I had done for them.
good,"The administrative work was very routine and did not provide opportunity for growth. I had a few interesting projects, but they did not lead to growth. Layoffs cut down the force significantly due to business division merges and I was laid off."
good,Typical call center job with making a number of calls each day taking payments from customers. I learning different ways how to go about collecting payments from customers at difficult times such as past due payments on their electric bills. Management was fair I would say.
good,DTE has its Management issues from time to time as does any Company but overall I had a very good career with them until they sold the Gas Resources side.
good,Be punctual.  Some departments have flex time.  The workplace culture is good.  You meet and work with a lot of cultures and different people.  You get to know a lot of people within the organization.
good,"A typical work day at DTE can consist on may different things. There can be meetings, supervisor escalations, dealing with angry outage customers and more."
good,The is a great place to work with great benefits and a excellent family atmosphere. I have met and lot of friends while working at DTE and  will forever be grateful for the opportunities.
good,You can move up the ranks here fairly easily if you are willing to work hard. Good corporate culture with a visionary CEO.  Decent pay and benefits for the area.
good,"Daily safety meetings in the morning coupled with an independent, yet supervised work day made for a great job. The management, as well as my coworkers made for a great atmosphere, as well as a great place to work"
good,"Great place to start within the utility industry. At the time I worked their, management could improve as there was a few that didn't understand what it means to foster a team environment."
good,"DTE Energy offers great benefits.  It offers a secure environment and it gives employees the opportunity to grow within the company.  DTE Energy trains employees well and if you take advantage of the learning opportunities that are offered, you are set up to work anywhere."
good,"The compensation/benefit package is one of the best within the local corporate community.  The organization rewards staff with yearly bonuses, time off and opportunity for advancement."
good,DTE is a good place to work as a technician.  Good pay/beneftis but poor work/life balance.  Difficult to raise a family and be on call 24/7.  Impossible as a single parent
good,"Oracle DBA is very vast, every now and then i learn something new or something which i had seen in the past. Learning and experiencing is part of life and here it is part of job."
good,"DTE Energy is a great company to work for if you are a permanent hire. As a contractor it carries a fair compensation rate but an extensive wait to become a permanent hire. If you are patient it may be worth the wait for their excellent work environment, benefits and compensation."
good,"DTE is trying to become a competitive company but the culture is resistant to change at every level. People don't want to become a long term company, they're focused on getting out or making the most money for the least amount of work. The business units refuse to work together and act like they're out to get each other."
good,"DTE has a great focus on being an involved partner in rebuilding Detroit and offering employees great ammenities. The downtown office has great fitness facilities, a health clinic, and large cafeteria. DTE just built a new park next door to the office. "
good,Coal is going away and I was not letting someone determine my future! I loved my job and pay but was worried about all the plants that we were closing down.
good,"A really solid company with good practices. It would lay a solid foundation and provide the perfect kickstart for an engineer's career. Although the pay is not competitive enough, it provides good job security."
good,"There are specific responsibilities that occur daily however, there is nothing typical about my days. Being able to think outside of the box (within the guidelines of company policies) make my job exciting and enjoyable."
good,"Workplace culture encourages developing yourself through professional and personal goals, training opportunities to better oneself in the workplace,ample opportunities to advance in the company, great healthcare benefits and 401 k match, competitive salary."
good,"Great company overall. I enjoyed the way this company runs, its mostly about safety which is a great thing. Most of the bad stuff was out of there reach"
good,"DTE provides a good living for it's employees"
good,DTE Enegry is a very fast paced call center environment. answering 60-100 incoming calls pr day. the culture is very old school management are set in their ways and are reluctant to change. hardest part of the job is the call is the extremely high call volume most enjoyable part are the coworkers
good,"Place is nice to work at and job security is good. "
good,"This is a great company to work for if you enjoy challenge and opportunity.  There is MUCH opportunity for growth and overall management.  ...almost to the point of frustration.  On the other hand, the expectations set for most people are VERY reasonable and your goals are very achievable.  If you go a step beyond your responsibility, you will look like a genius."
good,"DTE is a good place to work somewhat Demanding at times, but  allows you to support your family and have a decent living. DTE is a customer driven organization and has allowed me to gain the necessary knowledge to sustain a career in the Pipefitter field."
good,I really enjoy working for DTE Energy. It is very productive and fun working here. I am not getting any benefit as I am a contractor but the salary is good enough to cover that. All in all this is a great company.
good,"I liked the work culture at DTE. No one forces things or work on you. So there is not a lot of stress involved. As long as you know your work, you are good."
good,"Corporate Safety was a leader in the Business Units, lead, guide and directed the business units and facilities to Federal and State Standards. I managed 8 other Safety Professionals in the Fossil Fuel Fleet, Corporate Training and Engineering.  The hardest part of the day was day to day operation as to balance between the facility and corporate functions.  I enjoyed my job and wish I didn't leave to pursue my next job opportunity."
good,A great place to work at enjoyed working in a fun and relaxed work place.
good,"Strong culture and corporate mission"
good,"This company is filled with professionalism and endless opportunities. As expected, everyone there is polite and reliable. It’s just a great place to work overall, they do not disappoint."
good,Positive culture driven by progressive CEO.  Motivated and engaged people follow company's mission of providing basic services (energy) to our communities.  Progression is slow and based a lot on tenure - have to wait your turn to move up.
good,"Great place to start a career and learn many useful tools."
good,pretty great place to work and it taught me a lot about working in a call center it was hard to get in but worth it. The pay is good the work is easy and the people are nice. its fun and makes going to work easy
good,"Management stayed in touch very well."
good,"great opportunities within position/department"
good,DTE is a a great place to work but the social scene is cancer. Everyone is seemingly friendly until they can find something to take to a manager. stay to self
good,"A day at DTE Energy is  challenging.  The work is of importance,   we all need energy in a modern society.   The people are professional there are new things to be learned everyday.   The physical demands can be there depending on the scope of the job.  Its a real career."

good,"A typical day a work in my dept would include working 12hrs.  Extreme busyness, directing and prioritizing the flow of work.  Meetings with management from our group and others.  The work culture is very diverse and sometime challenging.  The hardest part of the job was to convince Management to understand why decisions are made regarding operations and to educate them on best practices.  I enjoyed most being able to share knowledge and train the many new workers coming into the company."

The sky is the limit for what you want to learn, as it pertains to the companies goals. Management changes, but adheres to process and performance.

good,A typical day at work would be me receiving calls to turn on or off service or take a payment for a customer's bill. I learned how to save on utilities and to be compassionate to unfortunate circumstance. Management had no real training so we were all learning as time went on but they were very good at sharing information as soon as they received it. My co-workers were there only to do a job and there was little conversation which to me made the job hard because the coldness to each other was sometimes reflected with their customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to go above and beyond for customers and helping to the best of my ability.
good,"Very good company to work for. I learned that all the departments help one another best assist the customer.  The Management is very nice, friendly, and compassionate about their employees success.  My co-workers are dedicated to their work.

good,Very laid back culture. It was a great place to work in terms of work life balance. Not much growth there. Needs to be updated with technology........

good,"My job revolved mainly around consolidating metrics for the company. "
good,"Working at DTE was a unique experience. There was always something to do, a project or event to coordinate. The company allowed its interns to jump between different divisions, allowing them to confirm their career paths. The hardest part of the job was communicating with others. The emailing provider that Detroit Edison used needed a major update, and would lose messages/ data every now and then. Despite this, I still had a great time working there."

good,"I had the pleasure of subbing for the assistant to the President of the Gas Pipeline organization.  What a fine group  of people. Everyone was super nice and hospitable; I felt very welcome for a person on a two month assignment. If ""niceness"" is criterion for a rating, then this group has my vote.  Additionally, I got a general sense of the company and my observation is most people seemed fairly content. (BTW, I gave 3 stars on a couple rating categories because as a temp, these did not apply to my knowledge base.)"
good,DTE is an awesome company.   I am not an engineer so there are positions I would love to work in but I don’t have the skills.  This company by far is one of the best companies to work at

good,"Be prepared to work in a very structured call center setting, being at your desk in work mode 90% of the time. Customers can be irate but you can understand their frustrations. Coworkers very awesome and management attempt to lead you up the career ladder. Everyone I trained with 5 years ago has moved on to management roles or position level increasing their pay by at least $5hr."
good,I learn that you are one small pawn in a game of chess. You could make or break the game but even when your sacrificed you are treated like an asset to the game. Your value isn't noticed unless you have contributed to the company.
good,Steady work pace including a high degree of responsibility.  Often working alone but your part of a very cooperative team environment whose main goal is your safety and the overall success of the company.  Management takes an active approach getting to know each employee and supports each member’s professional/personal growth. The hardest part of the job for me was being on call full time and the frequent call outs to restore plant operations. The Most enjoyable part of the job is work working with the best people you’ll ever meet doing a job that directly impacts you community.

good,"Great place to work.  Very progressive, customer and employee focused.   Diverse work force.  Good benefits and competitive salaries.  Opportunities for advancement, flexible hours."
good,"Good compensation based on experience. Hard workers were rewarded for their hard work. Though it suffered from the many trapping of large corporations (superfluous meetings, old employees unwilling to adapt, pervasive wisdom being to do your job and avoid going above and beyond job description), it was generally a fun place to work."
good,"I was responsible for checking for gas leaks in mains and services. Everything I did, I had to learn and be trained for. Driving the big company vehicles and operating the machinery for the gas detection and even organizing the shop took some practice but everyone in charge was so patient and helpful and my coworkers became some of my best friend. The hardest part of the job was the beginning training since everything was so new but the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to spend so much time with my coworkers."

And the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you could count on your team leaders for continual support ."
good,"DTE Energy has an energetic workforce despite the stereotype of regulated, slow to change and aging industry. The genuine investment in continuous improvement as a way of life has taken hold.
