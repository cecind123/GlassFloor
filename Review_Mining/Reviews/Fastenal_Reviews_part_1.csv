rating,review
bad,The support to get the job done is not what they promise. Alot of broken promises. Never willing to help when needed. Run minimum staffing to help paychecks. Burn out ratio is high
bad,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. "
bad,"The Manager has his favorites and they can do whatever they want.  If you have an issue they tell you to deal with it. "
bad,"They truly don't care for their employees and only look out for themselves all of the managers. Good luck, don't get screwed over they will take full advantage."
bad,"They lay you off to get rid of you when they're done using you and want to get rid of your run. Then put a pub truck on it and lay off 2 people and then lie about it and say you were fired and not laid off. The Managers SUCK!! They are unethical SCUM!! Only care about their bonus at the end of the year!! After you serve the company with hard work and dedication, they have no INTEGRITY or MORALS. Untrained traffic managers with absolutely NO CDL driving experience, telling qualified experienced drivers they did something wrong?? What a JOKE!! Management sucks!! A bunch of lying , uneducated , immoral liars!! Don't drive for them, they'll screw you over in the end! Broken down equipment to work with. But they could care less! This place won't be around for long! Run the other way!!"
bad,I have never ever worked for a company that had such poor management. They offered no direction and are only worried about the bottom line. The employees are treated like cattle. This was the worst experience I ever had working for someone. If you are offered a position at Fastenal run away it isn't worth the frustration.
bad,Poor structure and greedy gm and bm . No commission have what you to work and drop dead. Run away if you can . No overtime once you are about exceeding 20 or 30 hours per week of part-time they will find a way out themselves.
bad,"the work load is intense. the people are nice. the job is rewarding.the management however, does not fully appreciate its employees. i would consider using this company for its experiences"
bad,"Bad work environment, The management was very unprofessional. I don't recommend this job place to anyone. Fastenal is a joke, and the pay is not good."
bad,Ever since the new manager in industrial services things have turned too the worse.. didn’t really understand the full concept of the packaging department was getting more work that the team couldn’t handle especially on the blister pack machine it came too a point to where it was too stressful and frustrating.. trying to rush to beat the quota at the end of the month.. management and KONEDIDNTUNDERSTAND THE DOWN TIME THAT THE MACHINE HAD!
bad,Absolutely the worse company I ever worked for. No management was ever in the store. Unexsperienced employees left to run the entire store including opening and closing of the store. Product was always late and never on time for customers. Completely unprofessional for a large company. Worked long days but was only compensated for 8 hours.  It's know surprise there closing stores everywhere.
bad,"Horrible Management with no respect for workers , even when you did your job you still wasn’t doing it , outside sales reps and the manager have no care if you get a break, manager will argue with you for everything even when he doesn’t do much himself, and manager at my location had no care for his employees. Also beware of the runs they sent you on which no clear view of what’s behind you on the road."
bad,"Pinemont sucks, known as the worst facility within fastenal. Its called r hub. They hire young, manager tries to play you by looking at your desired wage. If you put anything below $11 then he’ll go with that and say he’ll make sure you get a raise. When in reality he’s giving you a raise to the standard pay. Definitely don’t recommend unless you’re in a desperate need of a job. Then go for it."
bad,—————————————————-this job is complete trash and run by people who don’t get how to manage at all——————- and you barely make enough to get to work and back
bad,"Easily one of the worst companies I have ever worked for in my life. My boss was the worst boss I have ever had in my life hands down. Do not consider a position with this company. Poor management, the commission you are promised will never materialize."
bad,"it was intense, covered many different areas. had three interviews first one on one then with two people then with three people. took urinalysis test. watched videos."
bad,"Dead end place to work, typical corporate culture, management made up of the least competent people. Only reason to even work here is because there is little else in the area."
bad,"Awful company. Poor management, antiquated policies and equipment, no training, they thrive off screwing over coustomers and hanging other associates out to dry. Stay far far away from them."
bad,"Fastenal is a good company to work for depending on your management. Management in the San Diego locations is horrible. Arrogant, pompous, and know it all upper management will be the down fall. When you cant take criticism as a leader you should not be in a position of leadership."
bad,Corporate lies to you and takes advantage of you. Disrespectful management and dishonest sales people.  Salesman shorted clients frequently and figured ways to over charge them.
bad,"Poor management, alot of favoritism, and the make you work hard and pay you garbage money. Management treats you unfairly. They talk to you like if you are dumb and they take alot of advantage of people."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Don’t waste your time unless you’ve exhausted ALL other options. They could care less about their employees unless you have an aptitude for sucking d**k. If you have zero skills, you may run the company by the end of your first day."
bad,Long hours and little compensation. I would only suggest this job as a last resort. Leadership and coaching is non-existent. Work culture does not exist either. Training was sub-par and you had to figure out most by yourself. They ask you to do unethical pricing for same product for different clients.
bad,Had a female manager that made everyone's lives miserable. 2 1/2 years there and never had an issue until I drew the short straw and was forced to work with her because no one else would. Was literally throwing up daily from stress and crying to other coworkers. There was a ton of favoritism as well.  Hours got cut to 12 a week at times. Would change my schedule without asking. My mental health is so much better now that I'm gone
bad,"Just as the review says, I was 18 years old when I started working there. Never had any training on how to use their system and the equipment they sell. The manager only cared to reach his monthly goal without any concern to his employees. Area manager just cared the higher ups and not the frontline"
bad,"Treated poorly- Very thankless job. "
bad,I did not enjoy working here. The corporate culture was better suited to frat house than an actual company. I have nothing but bad things to say about this employer in general.
bad,"Had no issues with the company, management or pay. The culture however is awful. I was the only female in the machine shop and my male coworkers acted as if they never worked with women, made advances, stalked and made me so uncomfortable that I no longer felt safe and left. The female coworkers I did have were either only in shipping or in the office, all ""mean girls"" so I felt like the odd one out."
bad,"I worked there 13 years ago and i was pregent. It was a boys club hardly any girls worked in the warehouse."
bad,The company has no time management skills when it comes to the training of its workers its very few and far between. Not once while working for the company was i trained in the requirements of the job
bad,Fastenal between 2000-2005 was ran by greed.  Managers that only worried about money and would step on anyone to get what they wanted.  I would not hire anyone that was promoted through the management ranks.
bad,"Bad company to work for.  The supervisors are not good and didn't receive a raise for over 7 years, and that was only when the entire department got a raise when goals were met"
bad,"I worked at Fastenal for 2 years as a sales rep. The fact that they promote from within is great. However they don't train management for their new position.The two managers I reported to, knew nothing. The stock guy knew more than them. This ""book of business"" model sucks! Fastenal has a warehouse in Indianapolis that they encourage you to get product from, the problem is most of your accounts will want product from their third party vendors. Which becomes your problem as a sales rep. If it doesn't come from their warehouse your commission takes a hit.They assume every account wants their fasteners. Not true. It's makes sense for them to put the burden of what it cost to provide third party vendors on one employee. You're responsible for a percentage of the gas it takes to transport, the cost they pay the vendor, etc Nothing about this model makes sense. But this is the same company that had myself and other employees in a facility with no heat, for a month during the winter in Chicago. They stay out of debt, but taking from their employees. You ever heard the term, ""rob Peter to pay Paul"". You're Peter and Fastenal is Paul.  If you just want to get the experience, knock yourself out! "
bad,"This company does not promote a positive and trusting environment."
bad,"This company hires people saying it has a flex schedule.  Then it fires you for being out too many days.  This company is not for any one who has children or needing days off for other commitments.  If you need to come in late due to snow or doctors appointments, forget it.  They have a raise system that is based on attendance which means you will be stuck at the low paying hourly wage of $10/hr until the following year when it resets."
bad,"This job was a nightmare from day one. The training there is laughable at best. The pay and benefits are fine, but the job itself is ridiculous. The Management is an absolute joke, they sit in there office and offer little to no advice with issues."
bad,"No training, Left alone too soon, management doesn't care about customer, only with making margin.   Starting pay sucks, when you do hit bonus, it's nothing close to what they state.  only about 100-200 per month.   if you're lucky, you'll be making about $14 hourly, and putting up with a lousy manager."
bad,"Great place to work, good pay, great hours for daycare, great customers, off on the weekends and major holidays, good benefit packages, paid vaction and sick time"
bad,Traffic division full of people who could care less about you as a person. Your time with family is unimportant. Nit picky rules to follow. Speed gauge. No  comprehensive training program.  Trained by other drivers.  No communication between departments.  13 1/2 hour days working at night.  Expectation level is different for each department.  Driver turn over highest I’ve ever seen.
bad,Fastenal is not a good company to work for. Racism and nepotism in this company leads to unfair business practices. Especially towards minorities. Not a good company to work for.
bad,"Do yourself a favor and Dont work here! It is awful! The managers are terrible and they only look out for the bottom dollar. Their core values are integrity, teamwork, innovation, and ambition. You will only get far in the company if you throw all of those out."
bad,"Low pay for area, horrible managers, low moral, part time hours too not pay benefits, crazy work standards, 1920's break of 10 min, back stabbing coworkers, cameras every corner, more supervisors then workers, never getting a raise, stay away from this place."
bad,"District manager is a scoundrel.  No one really knows what they are doing.  No team environment.   Manager was a thief.  Hired sloppy people, would smoke in the truck knowing I didn't smoke.  Just real jerks"
bad,Its a terrible place to work. There are way better jobs out there that will treat you better and provide better work life balance. If you value your happiness and sanity do not work for this company.
bad,"Started as a great job under one DM, the DM changed and everything was a nightmare.  I was fired on the spot for 'poor performance' with no relavent reason why."
bad,"A typical day is met with chaos, they use employees like slaves. I should have listened to previous reviews before I wasted 3 years of my life. Management only cares about getting a bonus. Not a teamwork friendly enviorment. The hardest part was having no other employee to call in case of an emergency. Every branch is a bare bones crew. The part I liked was building relationships with customers that can lead you to better opportunitys."
bad,"The support you get from this company is a complete joke and 100% lacking. When you do ask for help, you are tossed around between several people and in the time it takes to get help/answers, you are better off figuring it out yourself, provided that's not the answer you receive anyway. I always prided myself on being a Sales Person; we are a rare breed - This company ruined that for me and I have zero desire to continue on in sales. The last 2-2.5 years of my employment with Fastenal, the ONLY reason I continued to work for this company was because I knew once I left, no one would take care of my customers the way I did. "
bad,"horrible place to work, culture is terrible payis terrible, no real way to move up unless you become a manager. If managers want you out they will build a case against you. KEEP LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE TO WORK!"
bad,"When DM was confronted about problems occurring, he basically told me he didn't care and the other employee had been there longer so I just needed to deal with it. I had the worst inconsistent, cut throat, try to write you up for doing your job, terrible coworker at my time at Fastenal. The pay was too low and I worked too hard to ""be in trouble for only doing my job"". The coworker was awful, tried to yell and harass and bully her way into everything and it was the most nonproductive environment."
bad,Sales are a great place to work hard and if you wanna make more money you just have to work harder each day. Fastenal a great place to work but the money wasn’t very good.
bad,Pay is very low and hard to move up. They promote the wrong people. Benefits are also terrible. They also have terrible training. i would not recommend fasten to anyone
bad,"This company takes advantage of its employees.  Raises do not happen but they will expect you to work more then 40, even tho, the position is not exempt and they should be paying OT.  But this is Fastenal - work you like a dog and pay you scraps."
bad,horrible place to work..they  are racist I had to go to the eeoc on them .If you are not a part good ol boy system do not expect to advance or be promoted.I was unjustly fired and won  my unemployment claim against them. If you want to know what kind of company fastenal is.Check out how many times they have been sued for discrimination .
bad,Sorry management always switching you around the warehouse. Always want to work over pay you every 2 weeks very cold warehouse give you only one bottle of water a day management sucks
bad,Upper mgt treats employees like gum you stepped in on the sidewalk.  The company is meant to brain wash young employees into thinking it has great opportunities and makes you think pay has endless opportunity... false
bad,Over worked under paid with baf benefits. Everyone doesn't do anything. Managers expect you to do there job and everyone else's job. In my area I was the one to get things rolling and everyone else would just stand around.
bad,"Not a good company to work for. I was transferred after a couple months and promoted. Transferred back to my original branch a couple months later. Then demoted due to no fault of my own. Hours lowered. Hours raised, hours lowered etc. Very inconsistent and unprofessional. Don’t expect your hard work to go noticed here either."
bad,Fastenal is a bad company. They start you out with low pay but expect you do 80 hours worth of work per week and get nothing in return. The management is horrible.
bad,"Fastenal is a cut-throat place. If you have the guts to climb the ladder any way possible, you will do great here. I love what I do for Fastenal, however the company and the values of the company are not something I can stand behind. It is tough for a women at this company as well. "
bad,Very repetitive job counting similar products constantly.  Management wants you to pick at a high count with zero errors and just a 10 min break.  You run around like a chicken with out its head and they stress safety which is a joke.
bad,"HORRIBLE place to work!  Had I known beforehand the practices (or lack thereof), I would have looked elsewhere for employment. Overworked/underpaid with long hours among short staffed locations with limited stock on hand."
bad,This job sucks. I will never work for this company again. They don't care about the employees. And they pay compared to the hours worked is horrible. Over worked.
bad,"It is a 'turn and burn' culture. It was made clear from HR and management that you were replaceable and should be 'thankful' to have a job. I was one of the top earning sales people, worked 75 hours a week and it was still never enough."
bad,"There were too many employees for the management to be overly exceptional, which just comes with the job. If you want something easy and under stimulating, with good pay it's the job for you."
bad,Fastenal is a disaster...management was caught stealing I was a driver and they would have me work a night route 6 hrs after working day route which is illegal.there was a lot of shady stuff that happened and management would try to cover things up.i worked there for 3 years and had 3 traffic managers that were very unqualified which should tell you something
bad,"They will not work with your schedule when you get sick and got a doctor not to not work, they still expect you to get your work done and work the hours you are suppose to when you neeed to take the time off for being sick."
bad,"A typical job. The hardest part of the job is the heat and management. The most enjoyable part about the job, is looking at the blue paint. The work place culture could be better."
bad,"terrible workplace culture, many silly managmnent members is the hardest prt of the job. I have learned noithing in this company. Everyday I have fight for right logical pathways with managment"
bad,"I would never recommend this place to anyone, constantly being asked to rip off customers, in any way possible, over charging, phantom parts, the list goes on and on"
bad,"Great job for college students, they don't really work with your schedule for school tho. I've worked here for 7 months and feel like we could get paid more for the work we do here. Picking is a fast paced job and they expect you to get 3 errors max and a 3rd error will end up with a write up.Not flexible with they work given and time to do it in. Picking Management is lazy and not able to do their own job and have part time workers do it for them, exceptions."
bad,"Bad management, Long  Hours, and terrible training. I do not like their ethics practices. If you have any other option take It. I am not a fan of their sales practices."
bad,"While Fastenal makes great promises for quick advancement and a lifelong career, don't hold your breath..The salary won't be anything you can live off, and it comes with heavy strings attached. You're expected to work well above your 40 hours a week, and you will never get overtime, nor will you get praise for going above your duties. You're asked to live and  breathe Fastenal blue, don't expect to have a life outside the company! The managers tend to be lazy and incompetent (trust me, I've been in 4 different branches in 10months), and quite frankly, treat you like garbage. Don't ask for a day off, that's a crime (even with your earned personal/sick/vacation days). Don't have a death in the family, you can't take grievance leave without being made to feel guilty for the inconvenience. The sales goals are set ridiculously high and good lord if you don't reach them, expect a stern email from your district manager about poor performance for the month; if you do happen to reach goal don't expect a nice email from him/her acknowledging your hard work either.  Every aspect of your work is unlikely to be acknowledged, and on the rare occasions that it is, it's always underhanded with talk of how you can do better. I've yet to see my full salary, despite working 50-60 hours a week. Big corporations are great! Don't get sick and have a hospital admission for a week, without getting a TYPED doctors note stating every detail of your stay, and make sure the doctor prints his nane underneath his signature, or else they threaten your job. And they wonder why  customers make comments about"
bad,"My time at Coca-Cola was very tiring and low paying. Long hard hours, for very little pay. I had to work at 2 a.m for 12.25 an hour. I was there for three years with only a dollar raise. The benefits are poor. I also had to use my own vehicle. They did not compensate merchandisers for any repairs to their automobile."
bad,This is the worst job i've ever had. To begin with there is no type of training whatsoever. They throw you out there and expect you to learn on the fly. This department is the most disorganized i've ever seen.  I have never seen so many people come and leave this job.  The pay is ok if you're looking for something temporary.  Also there is no chance for advancement.
bad,I was an outside salesman. Never got to give 100% to my accounts. I always was picking up the G.M.'s and inside salesman duties.
bad,"Part time employment for Fastenal was by far the worst employer I've ever worked for in 40 years. Management delegates responsibilities, takes credit for work they didn't perform, and assumes no responsibility when their actions/decisions fail."
bad,"This company in loves park. Has been open for three years. When I started there I could see It was going to fail. Very poor management, employees did exactly what they want when they wanted. I watch 3 employees one day , start dancing and singing in the middle of the shop floor . Another one of the lead men where sleeping with the QA person while he was still married and Manager even seen this on camera video . VERY VERY Poor Management!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Fastenal is only part-time unless you work in their managing department. It is extremely difficult to move into a higher position at this company and the managers do not respect you as a human and your opinions and concerns are not taken seriously.
bad,"Employed for over a year, no raises and passed over five times for job advancements to people who have no idea on how to even complete a sales order. The manager just gives his buddies full time jobs just like the in clique in high school. Overall if your are hard working and have experience in industrial sales,DO NOT APPLY HERE, you wil just be given all the busy work to do and only promote the idiots that can't even handle a customer sale. If your looking for a part time job, apply at McDonald's or burger king. The starting pay is just as good and within a year I'm sure you will have at least one good raise based on performance. Fastenal does not recognize hard work and training."
bad,The work environment is very dirty. Lot of dust and dirt everywhere. Move a box and your inhaling dust. Some people follow rules some don't and nothing happens.
bad,"I worked for Fastenal for a little over 7 months. I enjoyed my job as a part time helper when I first got there, however, after roughly a month, the facade faded, and I saw my manager and co-workers true colors. I was talked down to, was asked to stay late without pay, and when I requested for hours or attempted to move up, I was given the run around. If you want any type of steady full time work do NOT look to Fastenal. I had a problem with another associate who constantly berated women and made very rude, sexist, belittling comments. When such actions were reported to the higher ups, they were simply shrugged off, and no corrective actions were put in place. The managers at this company cut hours so they can receive bonuses, and when their' position feels threatened or you look to improve your position, they suddenly change their tune from supportive to extremely snarky, almost vindictive. I was also asked to do things that went against my moral code, such as charge things to customers that purchase large orders as they ""would never know anyway,"" which I did not agree with and refused to do. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Poor management, low moral, low pay and they treat employees with absolute disrespect. They will treat you nice until your start work and then you are nothing more than a slave."
bad,"The only bad thing about our traffic manager and manger is they always push driver to drive fast and come back early from your trip ,they all ways ask why you are so late ,you came back last week faster why you late this week ,that is dangerous fro driver because driver have all ways stress on mind to come back earlier ,so driver have to skip there breaks to come back earlier ,and the driver drive the truck while they are tired"
bad,"they do not ever review their employees, they don't believe in giving raises. They tell you in every meeting that you agreed to work for the wage when you were hired, and that will never increase. I overheard two from upper management actually say that they expect 100% turnover every two years."
bad,"i wish i would have stayed at part time and picked up another job but i decided to go to full time outside sales and had never done any of that stuff and got no training, they just gave me the keys to the truck and told me to go sell stuff and that didn't work out at all i couldnt sell anything"
bad,"Good Luck!!  Poor pay, Poor Management, and no growth opportunities.  Also will work you long hours and give you peanuts!"
bad,Company does not care about the advancement or recognition of the hard work of their employees. Not a fun environment to work in.
bad,"Somewhat flexible hours, work conditions sometimes unbearable as warehouse can get very hot in the summer or cold in the winter.  Management is very pushy, and pay is low."
bad,"If you want to advance it will not happen within this  company. Always be early, work really really hard and you still won't get a raise.You can mess up 5000 parts(which I've seen)and only if your best friends(butt kisser) with the cnc manager will it be no harm done. The floor supervisor has a major drug problem, he will tell the manager employees are looking for drugs, whenever he feels he is about to get in trouble, we just lost an employee because of this. He left for 2 hours while still clocked in to go pick up drugs, he told management his daughter was really sick and needed him. How could management really believe that? He also has burglary convictions from 2 years ago, so they obviously don't backround check.  If you want a steady job with potiential to advance fastenal is not for you."
bad,I was a Fastenal truck driver running northern Ontario for almost ten years and it was a great job until a fat funny eyed girl and a fat farmer took over as management and then it turned into a nightmare!!!! they don't care about your safety on the road as long as the product is delivered and if u are stuck in a snow storm in a day cab on the highway they laugh at u about it in a accidental text that happens to be for the pearly white hub manager but gets to u.........its a company that  cares little about there drivers and lots about getting there bonus on there pay check so stay away!!!!!!! this company only cares about making themselves money and not about the employees so if u accept a job good luck to u! oh and if u contact the male traffic manager on a weekend or night time with issues hes drunk and doesn't care so your on your own!!
bad,"Pay very little for working extra hours and generating leads."
bad,This was a while back but I remember 12-15 hour days and did not get to seemy daighter grow upna
bad,"terrible experience"
bad,"This company is a joke. The culture consists of a ""do it or die"" attitude with very little support. Most people are promoted because they landed one big contract and the previous guy quit to make more money somewhere else. They refuse to make it easy to sell."
bad,The managers are lazy the pay is awful. No advancements. Worked hard for nothing. No training.
bad,not a good company to work for. No Ethics in business. Just make the new employees work with out any benefits.
bad,The management was horrible.  There is no job security whatsoever.  Was let go for no reason.  I learned not to work for Fastenal and to let everyone know it. There was no joy.
bad,"little opportunity for advancement, a management staff that will lie to your face, but hey at least they are always growing!"
bad,Worst place ever to work. Managers allow supervisors to unethically treat there employees badly.
bad,bad work enviorment
bad,Work hard for very little money. Work for a District Sales manager that was very unprofesional who would talk about others in the district. Worked for an RVP that made fun of a person with a disablity. NO training at all.
bad,Company has a skelton usually. High stress depending on what branch. No checks and balance system. Basically if you have a problem in the company you should just keep it to yourself. Depending upon which branch yoou work under
bad,Temp job. Over all okay experience. Worked here temporary for a year. Had fun but pay was low.
bad,It's not a great place to work it does have its benefits. Driving a company truck. Salary isn't great but you always feel like you are in danger of losing your job.
bad,"Not the brightest bunch of transportation managers you will find.Unqualified would be a better description.Go see for yourself."
bad,"If your having a hard time getting hired this is the place to go.The most massive turnover in trucking that I have ever seen."
bad,"They started recruiting from an hour away because they can not find any more drivers.All the managers talk down to you.You have to drive the speed limit,yes the speed limit and not a mile over it.Don't worry though,you will get compensated for the 50 or 60 extra hours a year it takes you to do so...with a stupid,sad,pathetic,embarrassing  t shirt that you will be ashamed to wear that says 'we drive the speed limit' lol.It should say 'I made the managers a big bonus while working more hours for free'.The hub manager is so insulting you can expect to hear...'go ahead and quit,i got a stack of applicants on my desk'. And corporate traffic managers telling you in a snow storm...'that's it's our job to get you out,not get you back'.As soon as I get one year experience,I am out of here.The place is a joke...useless monthly meetings that you don't get paid for,getting treated like children like filling out permission slips for doing your job. Micro,mismanaged corporate garbage from the top down.Traffic managers that do not have cdls and can not drive yet they try to tell you how.Any employer that constantly posts ads for hiring is a sign you should drive...far away as you possibly can!...don't say you weren't warned!!!"
bad,"Cheapest, most selfish company I've ever worked for. does not take care of employees unless you are a store manager or higher. pay is also mediocre if you are part-time."
bad,The place is a place good for experience then move on before they move you on! They expect loyalty to death but even if you put your time in and advance in the company they won't hesitate to get rid of you! They have no loyalty or honor in the work place! They preach innovation but if you have an idea that's different they belittle you and make it seem like you don't know your job.  They put people that don't deserve to be in leadership roles then just get rid of them!
bad,"If you want to work hard  for pats on the back and little pay this is the place for you .Its only a way to get experience in the industry and that about it.Its loosely structured so you don't have a defined role they expect you to be a all in one worker janitor,salesperson,warehouse,driver,etc..so you never because good at anything just mediocre at lot of things which really frustrates  customers who are experts and professionals in there industries.If you decide to stick it through to management you can do all those things and more with a 50 hour work week.Management pushes you to be in sales because they take a percentage of the over all sale of the store so it would in there best interest and not because you have potential .Just like any experience it can be better or worse depending on the person but unfortunately for me it was not a good experience."
bad,"Fastenal promises to promote from within, bogus.  I ran a branch with no additional compensation ( but all the responsibilities) for almost a year.  I decided to move to another town, and even though they had a GM position open in the town I was going to, the DM nullified my transfer.  Wound up resigning and finding a much better job."
bad,Just stay away  The company is not worth the headache   The pay is ok management is really bad and if you do  decide to go just remember we told you so
bad,"Initially, the company culture and environment was positive and supportive, with room for pay growth and internal advancement, but due to a change in supervision, more focused was levered towards competition and increasing production, to the detriment of a stable and supportive work environment. This led to a dramatic increase in turnover within the department."
bad,"Acting manager was horrible. Would leave early or use company time and company vehicle to do personal errons. Lies to customers stating she was the only one working at times. Yelled at me, treating me different because her daughter and her friend work there. The two dont even work all they do is school work and claim company time. The list goes on! Not worth it to work there because you will get treated bad because the acting manager is having a bad day!"
bad,Gathered valuable skills and experience because they throw you to the wolves with zero product training. Your base salary is terrible and even in the event you have a good sales month your commission is pathetic. Corporate does not care about their managers or sales people they just want margin.
bad,"I used to lead 31 Soldiers on missions to break up ambushes and look for improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan. I literally had to lead men into ambushes to break up the ambush. People die in situations like that. And I never, ever, talked down to my people or treated them poorly. Not even once."
bad,"Everyone is replaceable at all times, and they make sure you know it. Their ideal new hire is a directionless white male with an ag degree from the local community college. The stock is good, though - I still own a lot of it!"
bad,"The management will lie directly to your face. These people have no morals. They only care about their own best interest and will step on anyone that crosses their path, whether they need to or not. "
bad,warehouse distribution conveyor belt system along with forklift. Achieved forklift certification and obtained management position. Workplace culture was slim to none and the hardest part was lack of concern for the workers. The best part was getting out the door when your work was completed.
bad,"I walked out and quit due to the disrespect of the manager! If your not so call fast enough for them they won't try to help you they will only treat you poorly! This was the worst place I have ever worked in my life, and I've been at some terrible jobs before but this place was horrible! The manager in the picking department is very disrespectful! I called corporate the next day!"
bad,The company does not give you any constructive criticism and they only care about making as much money as they can.  The only way you can advance in this company is to become a General Manager which is extremely stressful and it does not pay well.
bad,"it was a horrible place to work, they treat the employees terrible ."
bad,"Fastenal bought out our company 2 years ago because they could not beat us. We were a regional company who took care of their employees and customers, when we were sold to Fastenal we were promised it would be a smooth and easy transition with very little changes. They came in, replaced all of our systems ( which is fine, except we were given literally 2 people to train a group of ~30 (at the time). I personally got a 10 minute run down on what to do, others got less if any."
bad,"Fastenal is one of the worst companies to work for in this area.  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I don't approve of this company. Do Not apply here, waste of time, no advancement, no respect. Do not apply here. Horrible place."
bad,"worse company to work for,pay rate is low managers do what they feel like,no future for your expansion.u never wanna work with employees that vote union out by a large significant number.if u say your right u will get fired."
bad,"Fastenal, as a struggling company, is all about cutting costs. All stores are mandated to hire at least 2 part time employees, where one full time employee would not only be sufficient, but more efficient. Blame the ACA or the company for not impementing strategies to deal with benefit costs, but either way, the company's H.R. approach favors the company with no understanding of employee job satisfaction. My store has seen 3 general managers in the last 6 months, and the turnover will continue. In short, there is no incentive to stay at this company."
bad,"Fastenal is a good company if you are looking for a ""resume building"" job out of college.  They have such a high turnover rate that it makes it hard to build long term customer relationships.  I gave Fastenal 6 years of my life starting as an internship and growing to Regional Sales Manager of their FAST Solutions program within 4 years.  "
bad,"This place lacks proper management and organization. Almost anyone can be promoted to management and it's usually the dumbest workers of all. Full-time employees are given bogus low salaries so that the company can pay as little overtime as possible. Benefits are almost non-existent. Safety is not one of their priorities. Neither is efficiency.This place doesn't even care about how well you perform your job. A recurring theme that I've heard many people say is, ""At least he/she/you/I showed up."" Luckily I only do this part time on the weekends for a little extra cash."
bad,I really think tat they work there employees to the bone for little compensation.
bad,"this job is a joke. the manager will not accept any suggestions and is arrogant. he belittles you in front of everyone. provides no help with questions. expects more out of the ""new"" person than the regular employees that have been there longer. does not like to be told he is wrong and will fire you on the spot if he doesn't agree with what you have told him."
bad,Pros: it's a job
bad,"I spent a LONG 6 months with Fastenal, and I won't be spending another minute with them if I can help it."
bad,"Absolutely the most terrible trucking job.Heed all the other reviews.Hard to find a company that advertises for help more then them."
bad,"Flex schedule, get your 40 hrs in and done for the most part. Management is lost, no diversity, no direction, no real path to advance. If you value open communication and reasonable response times for issues to get resolved, look elsewhere."
bad,Upper management is flawed within this company.. Promoting within is a lie. All around a bad company to work for and I'm not surprised their turnover rate is as high as it is.
bad,"This company will bleed you dry, They only Promote Friends and have no ethical value. They are in it for the dollar and that is the end. benefits are sub-par if best and compensation is absolutely terrible. You would have to have two jobs to make it even in a small community. I would never recommend someone to work there unless they were my worse enemy, nobody deserves to get treated like trash."
bad,Horrible company to work for. They do not value their employees as they should. There is a lot of favoritism. The supervisor's and management is a joke
bad,"Would’ve been a great place to work if the management wasn’t so abhorrent. Durant Fastenal has the worst management I have ever experienced in my entire life. Go work anywhere else in town, this place is not worth your time."
bad,"back breaking work that my manager insisted I do in heels. Toxic nasty people, my office was infested with thieves and addicts. Haven't worked there for 5 years yet still routinely wake up from fastenal nightmares."
bad,"When I worked for Fastenal you could view your paycheck and all its deductions online. The deductions ran two single space columns that covered the entire page. If these deductions were turned over to a lawyer it would be the basis for another class action suit. If your store was broken into the loss would be deducted from your ""other margin"", which lowered your paycheck. Sales below a certain margin were not counted. They used to brag about being ""frugal"". No they are just plain cheap and don't want to pay their employees. How many class action suits have been brought against them for not properly paying their people?"
bad,Part-timers are paid $10 per hour and after several years you max out at $15 per hour.  No more raises after that.   Doesn't matter what the job is or what experience you have.  No benefits of any kind for part-time employees.  Managers are a bunch of good ole boys looking out and taking care of each other  All full-timers get monthly bonuses based on how hard everyone around them works.  Part-timers get nothing.  Turn over is terrible.  They lose as many people every month as they hire.  There are a lot of better places to work.
bad,it works for just out of high school or summer job and it is relax but management is poor where I work and it tends to be a stressful environment due to the management
bad,Not a good company. They are slightly racist. Went to a business trip and was singled out for being hispanic. Will not recommend this P.O.S. company to anyone ever.
bad,The job was great but lack of advancement and poor management and pay really becomes stressful when you basically have to run everything yourself.  Really poor management
bad,"Madisonville, Ky location only, the store manager is a joke. He is lazy, a youtube watching dude that wants to talk about playing softball and how to take advantage of the customers. The two young staff workers support him and he supports them. Nothing professional in the business."
bad,"Fastenal is a very poor company if a part time employee.  Promise of full time was always there, but never happened.  The team boss was a person that was out for herself looking good.  I will never work at the company again.  For some it is a great place for me not so much"
bad,Fastenal is a company for someone fresh out of college seeking a job to gain experience in the B2B side of sales. It's a fast paced company with a lot of product knowledge needed to talk the lingo with customers.
bad,"I was a top employee and for almost the entirety of 2016, at the Fastenal DC in Denton, they never gave me my raise and messed with the performance review just to keep me from getting it."
bad,"The lack of information provided to employees is very concerning.  It is near impossible to receive accurate information from the human resources department, as they refer you to the District Manager.  They are truly a hire at will/fire at will company.  You will start off working 40 hours, but will slowly transition to over 55+ hours/week with no increase in pay.  This company is not intended to make careers.  It is about as close to a pyramid scheme as there is.  The top people make a lot of money based on the sales of the smaller people, so you if have a bad month they are quick to find someone else."
bad,Awful incompetent management with a churn and burn mentality. High management is drunk off of corporate Kool aid and every one else leaves after 2 years. Would not recommend based on pay and complete lack of professionalism..
bad,"Very poor management, policies and rules changed daily. Communication didn't exist and neither did training. No breaks(even if you work a 12 hour shift), no benefits, low pay, heavy lifting, and lack of recognition/raises. I was told when I got hired we would be evaluated for raises every 6 months. I was in the top 3 for production percentages every month and only received one raise in 2 years. This place just likes to push around the guys that are lower on the totem pole."
bad,They do not care about their employees at all. No raises or benefits. Insurance is very poor quality and covers very little. Management is very out of touch with employees and only care about themselves.
bad,If you like a short career this is place to go--these people are experts in writing up people from everything from soup to nuts.If you are over 30 forget it--demotions are common--people that have been there over 15 years are now common workers down from management jobs--lousy benefits--no pension plan--management does not communicate with employees--more concerned about their fitness room--short breaks ok but when you see management out in smoking area several times a day you wonder--jessup facility was a great place to work up til three years ago--the only place in jessup were help wanted sign is always posted
bad,"The sales support position is based in the warehouse and store, so every workday consists of the same monotonous tasks: receiving freight from the truck into the warehouse, receiving UPS, putting away stock, and filling orders to be taken to clients by the salesmen. Occasionally, sales support is needed to answer calls, take orders, and operate point of sale transactions along with delivering orders to various clients when the salesmen cannot."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone with responsibilities or a family! This was not a very good job for me. I completely could not grow or advance.
bad,I do not recommend anyone working here. You will get screwed over by management. Do not share your personal life as it will be used against you when you get fired.
bad,"I have been with Fastenal for just shy of 5 years. I was recently demoted to part time because we have to many full time employees for our store apparently, even when our store is braking sales goals monthly. Our sales keep going up but they are demoting people to save money (to part-time). A co-worker just got another job and they are not going to replace him because it cost to much money to hire or promote someone. This in return is putting more stress on everyone at the store (we already do not have enough time for everything else going on). So in conclusion I would not suggest working for this money hungry company. I am currently looking for other jobs at the moment. ( By the way the benefits suck)"
bad,Bad General Manager. Play head games with staff. The general manager encourages other staff to play along with his games. The general manager picks on people who he thinks is below him or don't give him the attention he is looking for.
bad,"Everything was good in the beginning, they tell you what you want to hear, they promise you all kinds of advancement.  Then a male comes along (all other staff are female) this male lies and gets my hours, then HE quits on them!... I'd work for them again maybe with an apology!!!!!"
bad,Hard to move up. Too much of a popularity contest and not about work. Not paid as much as part timers even though full time. Make people do extra work that is supposed to be done by a manager.
bad,Oh man....what to say.  I'm glad to be gone.  I had a great coworker.   Low pay low hours very poor training.  Only place I've ever worked where you pay for your own company shirt.  To be honest just alot of really inept individuals collected into one company.  A place to collect some paychecks and leave. Also you'll need to work off the clock because of lack of coverage.  I guess they dont mind violating labor laws.  This place is desperate too I recieved keys to the store 2 hours into my first day.  If you show up to interview you'll probably get hired.
bad,This was the most miserable job I’ve had after 20+ years in the industry. Managment was the worst I’ve ever been around. Lack of training and leadership.
bad,"Fastenal, Is a great place to work if you like $10.00 an Hour.  Management in the south is a bunch of rednecks with no college degree.  Benefits cost you half your paycheck, and guess what the uniform that you wear... you have to pay for yourself.  Too many accounts.. the work load is handed by 3 to 4 people should be 8.  Management will not help you because they are to busy driving around talking on the phone staying pretty, while you sweat it out at some mill or factory.  Waste of time and no rewards for hard work. Plus - you get an account one day, the next its given to someone else secretly. You will find out on your stub next pay period. Bye Bye what little commission you were making. If pay check to pay check is your picture of the good life... then bye all means join the Fastenal Team."
bad,"The hours are OK.  The Traffic and Fleet managers are in over their head.  Both of them have no idea of how to lead personnel.  Because of their lack of skills, driver turnover is high."
bad,"Typical day at work was to unload trucks, label and put product away and then load straight trucks and 53' trailers at the end of the night with outbound product."
bad,"I worked at a branch for a few years I survived a sub-par manager and a District manager who would know about the GM mistakes and overlook them because the numbers look good , throwing integrity out the window caring more for numbers than the culture cultivated between employees . Overall the company has a great company mission but  bad apples in the bunch. Dont stick around even if you do good you will get overlooked by favorites."
bad,"The company itself was decent enough, but the branch I worked at was horrible. The entire store was nothing but a social clic. If you didn't fit in, you were looked down upon. The management made it seem like you could advance, but never gave you a chance to grow. We were fussed at for doing things people would tell us to do,"
bad,"Operating hours are 7 am - 5 pm & you are expected to be there during those hours.  This position covers end-to-end supply chain management including your sales responsibilities and growth goals.  This immediately spreads you very thin and sets you up for failure as a representative.  KPI's include freight costs, inventory carrying costs, maintaining a 55% margin, 20% vertical growth goals, number of invoices, etc.  And many of these KPI's carry a commission-divider which means you lose money out of your sales commissions for simple store operating costs.  The result is that unless you are in a perfect storm you will likely only collect 1%-2% commision.  The overall pay system is so complicated that most District Managers can't completely explain it to you. I personally was in a meeting where out of 20 sales associates not two of them got the same result form the pay training demo.  Another thing to address is that because distribution and sales are both your responsibility at a certain point you will no longer be able to grow because you will be so time burdened by the distribution side of the business.  Ultimately this leads to a pay cap that occurs that you can't overcome. "
bad,Would never go back to this company ..Was not fair to employees over worked under paid lack of good leader  ship ...some days very long hours with short breaks ..
bad,"I learned multiple product lines and categories."
bad,"No room for advancement, completely driven by unreasonable sales goals. If region fails, all employees suffer. Little or no support for employees to train or attempt to advance unless hired as management."
bad,"They do not care about their employee's, they do not help with advancement. It is a who you know not what you know workplace. It is really hard to advance."
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for and the turn-over rate shows that. I have been with the company for almost 7 years and seen countless people come and leave. There is no communication on changes in policies or rules and almost all management are overworked micro-managers. Advancement in the company is slow to non-existent and the work asked of you is not nearly worth the money you are paid. If you value yourself as a person, stay away from this company."
bad,"8.5 years with this company. They barely feed you  but if your willing to hustle your but off you can make a fair living. They preach honest and ethical standards and decentralized decision making but that all has gone to the garbage heap. In theory it was what made this company grow but now it's micro managed to the hill. I also have a hard time believing how freaking greedy this company has become. They want you to operate at 55% margin or better as a whole. If you are in outside sales and under that, they'll take up to 50 percent of your commission from you. Like I said to get this started. I hustle and operate at nearly 60 plus percent margin but it feels like I'm screwing customers over left and right. This company is honestly 1 step away from being an illegal pyramid scheme that makes it growth and sales off of young college kids coming into the Markey that need a job. Fastenal just throws enough crappie at the wall that something will stick. You never see them hire anybody over 30 anymore especially if they have any experience and they teach you to tell people right out of the gate that the reason for their high rate of turn over is because they hire and promote from within. I watched almost 30 employees go through our small store in under 5 years. Lack of pay piles of work that are not mentioned at the beginning and overall under paid employees. Most of wich get picked up by their customers or completion and pay them accordingly."
bad,"There was always work for me to do, but I was never really held to any standards. Just show up before the bosses did and I was never considered late. This place is the epitome of casual, so if you don't care about benefits, getting raises, or any sort of incentive, but you just want to work with little to no effort, this is the place for you."
bad,"i worked a fastenal for a short time but seen 2 older men in their 60's turned down because of the online test you have to take and put your birthday in.  Also there was a sexual harrassment case in the store that i worked and the manager got by with it because of the duma$$ dm in wv "
bad,"They said during my interview they promoted from within that's a lie, "
bad,You get little training and are left to run the store. If the manager isn't having a great day no one does. They have a very high turnover rate so I would look else where for a good job.
bad,"By far one of the worst places I have ever worked. Management holds people they favor to a much lower standard than others. Store management has showed up with alcohol on their breath on numerous occasions...in some cases late as well. Management will gladly turn a blind eye to things they know are detrimental to the company, for the sake of friendship. THis makes for a difficult work environment. This is also compounded by a lack of inventory control, this only makes it even more of a challenge to correctly serve customers in a timely manner.  Facilities and location are good though. And there is the ability to move within the company. They also have a difficult time with keeping talented help, high turn around. I would strongly take a look at job description before a hire, as much of what I was hired to do..is some of the last things I get to engage with."
bad,"Junior high school culture: bullying, lying, character assassination, as well as, rampant gossiping."
bad,"If you feel like being stuck in one place with zero upward movement for more than 5 years while never expecting recognition for above and beyond the call of what you're asked to do, then Fastenal is the place for you..."
bad,"They don't care about employees, manager in Atlantic got away with even putting her hands on employees. And treats employees horrible. Corporate wouldn't do anything about it. Not a good place to work. Worked 5 years there and only got one raise."
bad,"Garbage company as far as providing livable wages and respect for employees. Have heard about positive experiences from employee's, but not within MD/PA region.  Quality and involved District and General Managers are key to a locations success and employee happiness. My experience was that as an educated (B.S. degree) full time employee with years of experience in management through my 8yrs in the military, I was told by my GM that I was no better than any part time employee (but was hired as a FT to a position that was higher than the one I applied to) and my DM felt that I had no management experience and therefor was not promotable."
bad,"If you want long night time hours under incompetent management,this is the place to go."
bad,8 of us were let go on 4-1-18 with no notice. We were told it was poor work! But gave us unemployment. The Hub manager is a snake. He will lie and have expect unrealistic work goals
bad,"Not a great company to work for if you are in Canada, especially in a big city like Calgary. Trucking routes are big in the states which lead to long lead times for us in Canada. It is also very difficult to be competitive with pricing."
bad,"Prenez vos jambes à votre cou, j'étais un rep sur la route mais je passais mon temps dans l'entrepot à trouver mes commandes et placer le stock. Changement staff constament."
bad,Horrible place to work with extremely long hours. They treat their employees as disposable. The only benefit is pay and the other coworkers that you interact with for the most part. As a driver I would not recommend this to anyone unless it’s a last resort.
bad,"I spent 4 years working for Fastenal, starting as a part time shop clerk and moving up to a full-time sales position.  Expect a lot of people breathing down your neck, very little compensation for sales, and a lack of respect from most management."
bad,"Manager talked bad about employees directly to customers.   When it came down to corporate being called about the situations, the employee that was being talked about got wrote up.    This company doesn't care for their employees by any means."
bad,Been there 6 years and never offered full time. Wages were horrible and management sucked. The job was a all around joke and everyone in upper management lied about numerous things.
bad,"Position assigned will be just a name because you would be in charge of everything everytime. Everyday is a different downer at Fastenal, just when you getting the hang of things manager will twist your duties around using the District Manager as an excuse for all the hard times. With only few hours and 4 days of work you will have to obligated complete online coarses, large lists of CycleCounts (inventory) deliver products, stack vending machines, answer phone calls, emails, create quotes and take care of walk in customers. Not to mention updating a site where you call old customers and try to get them to buy from you again. Make no sense, no time to learn much and even when taking online coarses the staff will have loud non work related conversations, phones ringing of the hook or regular walk in customers that only part timers have an obligation with because Management and fulltimers only take care of big money making clients ""their rules"". Manager is always in the street doing personal things and other coworkers do as pleased during his time out. Manager is always criticising our personal lives and making fun of coworkers, Would advise not to get too friendly with him because once you're not, he will make your life imposible forcing you to quit and leave on your own. Employees only have benefits if manager likes you, as in having similar lifestyle as him, one guy got recruted and jumped to fulltime outside sales immediately, now him and the manager are always up and down together even doing non work related personal things like taking haircuts, taking their personal vehicles"
bad,"Not impressed with this company. They pound their core values into their employees, yet the management does not play by the same rules and values. The store I worked in has a manager and employee that smoke inside the store, even though the company has a ""NO TOBACCO"" policy. The manager and warehouse manager gamble throughout the day by playing quarters, rather than doing their jobs. I was wrongfully terminated from this company due to my disability. Benefits are decent, but not great. As an Outside Sales Person, you can expect to work 10 hours per day, on salary, M-F. The commission pay is less than standard to say the least. I would recommend working for a different company where the Core Values are followed and appreciated by all employees, from the bottom to the top executive. Your hard work is not appreciated here."
bad,"I did not work at this company for very long.  While I was there I was part-time and only worked two days a week.  I did this while working at The bulldog.  "
bad,You provide your own cell phone and work 9/hr. days (not including lunch) and get paid for 8/hrs. Must make 25-30 calls per day AND upsale while delivering product.
bad,I was having some personal problems which hr as well as corporate wouldn’t show compassion for. I had to go to detox and treatment for alcohol and requested fmla they sent me the wrong paperwork and fired me .Ive heard of other employees who had the same issue and corporate not only worked with them they even payed for treatment.Prior to my issues never had attendance problems or been late. This company has racial problems in the past I
bad,Until they moved to new building and policy changed employees now feel its more like working in a prison than at a job you like while the workers are all good people everyone in management are not
bad,No heating  or air conditioning. Run around all day like a slave. Low pay. Good for college students who need a flexible schedule. Benefits suck......
bad,"MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE ; Overide sotre managers decisions."
bad,"Manager is a joke. If you have any dignity this place will try and rob it from you. If there was a different manager I would've loved that job. But, with no help from corporate about the managers short comings I simply had to move on. Good luck to those of you who try."
bad,"Fastenal’s business model is to buy cheap and sell really high, really high. They feed you the kool-aid and make you believe if you sell a lot you will make tons of money. You can make decent money the first year but after that they expect you to top your previous years numbers and if you don’t your pay will suffer. It’s actually built in to their commission equation which is ludicrous. You bust your tail to sell the same product everyone else is selling at a much less expensive price and are not rewarded for doing so. It won’t take long for you to figure out why there’s a revolving door of new employees every 6 months to a year. The only other place I have personally seen more turnover is in the poultry business. Fastenal could be a great place to work if they would compensate their employees better and treat them with some respect. I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone."
bad,Fastenal does everything to tie the employees hands and make it harder to do there job and be successful.  Fastenal implements new policies every year to limit the amount of money they pay their employees.
bad,"Did not feel as a valued part of their ""Blue Team"" nor did I feel the company as a whole kept up with their core values, at least when it came to their employees, which explains the high turnover. Management, at least in receiving department, did not seem to care, nor where really there for their employees. Let to many things slip by which is very unprofessional."
bad,"Fastenal will ask a lot of you. Although confined to  you are expected to run a store, a large book of business and adapt to a very high learning curve, often with little to no prior experience. "
bad,A great place to work at if you are a manager and like to slack off. How that works don't ask me. So much focused on sells forget how much overhead is killing them but sells fixes all. That's what I was told. Place is a joke!!!
bad,I learned a lot because no one helped and 10 hours a day you get paid nothing for all the work you do. Take the experience you gain from the and start a biz...or dont work here!
bad,"If you've never worked in the industrial field, don't go to work for this company. The DM in the Shreveport area always has a very high turnover. He only cares about the numbers, not the employees!!! He's very young and has a lot more to learn about people."
bad,"Being with Fastenal in Cambridge for a year... Stuck as part time as it's their entry position... Been promised multiple times a full-time position... Never does it appear. Without that you can't make commission, you don't get bonuses, there's no salary, only 30 hours a week, and no benefits... It's ""OK"" if you have another job I suppose, but if you're looking for any possible type of career it's no good. The job itself isn't too bad I guess. I make the same amount of money as the new/old warehouse workers... Which is infuriating and degrading to me as I have SO much responsibility/stress to deal with. Whereas the several warehouse workers that stock shelves, pick orders, and clean have no stress and minimal responsibility... Yet they get the same pay as me and sometimes even more hours than me if they have lots of receive/pick, etc. All in all, the people who do the interviews mislead the job itself and don't believe in promotions as ""the company already pays you enough"" to begin with... In their words, not mine. So in order to get a promotion, you need to obtain fulltime which is next to impossible. I've seen many people come and go in my time there as well as heard stories from the past. Quite the turnover rate."
bad,"To advance in there company, you have to do a business plan. They take your ideas and never give anyone the job saying they have a hiring freeze. Management is all very young and never treat people professionally. Very low wage job with a lot expected out of you. They have a high turnover rate because they treat people very badly and push more work on you because they try to operate with skeleton crews because they can't get anyone to work there."
bad,"Middle management impedes any forward progress. The upper management has reasonable expectations, but the middle gets in the way."
bad,Worst management that I've had in any of my previous jobs. The manager needs to tone his rudeness and treating bad the employees. Just bad working environment with management here.
bad,"Listening to staff talk badly about each other at other branches daily, was exhausting. District Manager is a great guy however. "
bad,Fastenal has the worst management of any company I have ever been around. They work you to death in a high stress environment and put so much work on one person.
bad,"Fastenal is a good job for a college student and a company to start your career with and then move on.  I have nothing else to say, except for the fact that the work hours are good."
bad,Job is good for a young person. Prior to being hired get everything in writing. A pretty picture will be painted before being hired......... Then the truth comes out. The benefits are horrible. A multi-billion dollar company and they can't even provide a decent health care coverage. Obama care insurance would be 10x better. Don't believe what you hear and only believe half of what you see.
bad,50+ hour work week with below average compensation. No overtime available.
bad,"Men run company . Don’t care of their women and load too much work on one person "
bad,"Was often unsure of tasks to complete, as well as management seems very crooked and unsure of their own job responsibilities. No direction in the position I was in."
bad,"Fastenal may train for sales, but they don't train their Managers for dealing with people. The health insurance is horrible.You have to meet such a high deductible prior to even 80% kicking in. The pay is just as bad."
bad,"lousy communications. i applied for a job had a 2 minute interview and never received a call back or an answer. I showed up on time and prepared for the interview the least someone could do is send an email stating that they filled the position already. I think this is another company that has to fill a quota of interviews even though they know when they post the job who they are going to hire, and they waste job seekers time just to fill a quota for their HR department."
bad,"Worked in the warehouse for 2yrs. Tried to advance to an office position, but I had to wait I was ""replace"" in warehouse. So for the next 3 months, I would train for ONE HOUR in the office & then continue my regular in the warehouse. After 3 months......NO REPLACEMENT!!!"
bad,Basically did the same thing every day i was at work. Packing and scanning products.
bad,I would be on a computer putting together orders from all different companys. Would box or bag them up and put them on the belt.
bad,"A very non professional organization wtih non motivated, ignorant employees."
bad,Okay to work for. Limited pay. Must be very dedicated to your job to be successful. I worked 60+ hours a week minimum. I loved my job but theres always something better.
bad,"I literally found out that their pay scale is racially motivated. When I addressed this to my regional manager, the response he gave legit made me quit. I even contacted corporate for assistance and never once heard back from them. So my online research led me to some facts that are directly related to my suspicion. Unfair wages. Period."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked. They will lie and cheat customers every chance they get. If you are an honest person don't work for this company. Your commissions you are promised are never what you will receive Stay away stay far away from Fastenal.
bad,This company provides great entry-level sales experience that will allow you to take the next step in your sales career. A company this size has many dysfunctional management processes.
bad,I would discourage anyone to work for this company.  I only lasted this long because I was in school with the hopes of taking on a full-time role.  The last store I worked in or for has now had three people quit within a matter of two months apart.  The bottom line is this company does not care for its employees!
bad,"Too much screwing around."
bad,Management is a joke. I was there for six years and no raise. Was never offered full time employment. Overall the work environment was bad.
bad,fastenal is good if you want to work part time and if you want to work for a company that does not care about thier employees
bad,Facility closed down due to lost of contract.  Other than that its a ok place to work.  Now it is making me come up with more words.
bad,You'll never have a life...No set schedule..Long trips and low pay.
bad,Inside and Outside Sales.
bad,Its not a bad job however pay could be a lot better and they are only hiring part-time jobs. The job is easy and it's a pretty laid back job along with management.
bad,"Pago b ajo esquema de com"
bad,"Fastenal is an industrial supply company. I do not recommend working there to other people. Overpriced products, low salaries, poor management, cut-throat culture, poorly-educated coworkers, low-class clientele."
bad,blah horrible bad employers. expectations set too high for pay. horrible work environment. rude people all over. no working with employees. or exceptions to anything
bad,50 hours per week mandatory. They are considered a retail company so you don't get much off for holiday times. They have small regions so you are limited to where you can sell.
bad,management plays favoritism with working sift as well as job assignments. other then that. the work place is nice. with nice equipment. there was some room for creativity.
bad,"I worked here for only a few months. They lied from the beginning, and ever stopped. I never saw home, and was not making the money promised. As a CDL driver, they were still paying non-CDL wages."
bad,No benefits and a lot of grunt work. Hardest is doing more than the manager and not being appreciated
bad,We would come in and get our equipment and head strait for our assigned sections and start pickin and packing.some managers were fine and my co-workers were great. the hardest part of the job was living off 25 hrs a week because thats all we were allowed.but i enjoyed the warehouse atmosphere.
bad,This is a good stepping stone for someone just out of college who wants to be in industrial sales. Low money for the sales you do each month
bad,"Buena  empresa , pero es una lástima que al menos aquí en México , los directivos no sean los adecuados ."
bad,The company only cares about the money they make. The employees are no where near compensated enough for the work they put in and the money they bring into the company.
bad,"I liked the interaction with customers on a daily basis for the most part. The environments worked in were generally very industrial which were not the best sales environments. I felt I was very good at what I did and was not set up for success by my mentors and colleagues. This being said, the pay was pretty competitive and the benefits were nice."
bad,The management is terrible from general managers and to the vice president. All they do is take up for each other and never hold the gm accountable for anything. It's really a who you know job not a what you know job. I wouldn't tell or recommend anybody work here. The pay is decent but the leadership is TERRIBLE!!!
bad,Not a very professional work environment. It was very difficult to move upward even though they say the promote from within. Management was always changing.
bad,This was just a temporary job while I was in college that turned into a decent full time job.  The only problem was that the salary was terrible and so were the hours.  They expected a lot for not very much.  The management was also by far some of the worst I had ever worked for.
bad,The company requires you to work about 14 hours a day and never have 2 days off at a time.  The manager is very close minded and doesn't want to hear any comments from any drivers.
bad,"The management was cutthroat, promises made for advancement but when time came manager kept accounts and I was left in same position with no pay raise after 1 and 1/2 years.  Not at all would I reccomend working for the Elizabethtown ky branch.  Worst manager I ever had to work for.  Never knew when the lightswitch was on or off."
bad,Hard work in an environment not conducive to health. There are no management team (everything is on the spur of the moment). The hardest part of the job is not having any structure.
bad,What a terrible company I would avoid working here no matter what. They have lost sight that the employees make the business. Always trying to find ways not to pay employees.
bad,I have worked for Fastenal for 2 years although my manager was a great guy there is still a lot wrong with this company. They do not care about the part time employees. Our hours were recently cut down to 14 hrs per week which is ridiculous. I'm not sure how they expect people to function with those amount of hours. Overall I would not suggest working for Fastenal.
bad,"Deliver parts to costemers, not very many hours with little pay."
bad,"My typical day at Fastenal was about the same. I did out-side and business development. "
bad,"Fastenal professes to be a company that has no tolerance for bullying or harassment, but the truth is this situation was reported to management, and to the regional management, and it was laughed off on both levels. Because of the complete disregard by management that a very bad situation existed, an unjury resulted and still nothing was done by the company."
bad,"I choose not to say anything. If your looking for part-time work to cover bills it is acceptable. Advancement chances are rare and very selective. Not a career, just a job."
bad,There was very poor communication between management and associates. If an associate was stocking inventory or busy with the phones and a customer would come in and the manager was at the front counter(perfectly able to assist said customer) manager would yell for associate to stop what they are doing to assist the customer. Employees were treated like garbage and expendable.
bad,"Was a total waste of time all I learned was more nuts and bolts."
bad,"While each location & dept differs, my experience proved to be similar to high school popularity contest. The VP favored those he spent time with socially or found attractive. If you were not included in the 'inner circle' your ideas, suggestions, questions, comments, etc were ignored & even mocked. "
bad,"Good place to get you head into sales, but if you don’t know the right people and if your not with the in crowd, you won’t move up. Upper management uses you for their gain."
bad,I filed a discrimination claim with management and HR and they took sides with other coworkers and didn’t thoroughly investigate and started harassing me until I resigned
bad,"It is a miracle they are still in business. Corporate presence is very minimal, leaving unqualified people to run stores into the ground. A temporary job you could be at for years."
bad,"DO NOT work here.  "
bad,"Too many Layer's of the Sales Cycle.These layer's makes it impossible for the OSR and Management to reep the rewards of hard work. I could go on for days about there business model, but I won't. In short, the model remind me(a vetran Manager)of a Triple Teir Marketing ploy."
bad,"When interviewed I asked the question, ""is there room for advancement?"" I was told, ""absolutely."" The question I should've asked was, ""is there room for advancement amongst minorities?"" In the warehouse you'll find several minorities. However, among the management staff, leaders, offices, conference rooms, and training rooms you'll only find Caucasians.  Not one single minority.  How can you expect a minority to believe advancement opportunities exist for them when no one in those advanced positions look like them?  All the ""casual"" positions are white washed.  If you're a minority, you're stuck in a warehousing position...nothing more."
bad,There are many other more suitable employers in the market. The main CONS of this place of work are the lack of work-life balance and  job security. The pay structure is considerably less than its main competitors.
bad,The facility and job itself wasnt bad but they gave everyone a raise to 10.00 hr then cut everyone to part time.The managers at the time just didn't care.
bad,Good job for someone fresh out of college or high school but not a long term solution. Pay is meager but enough to cover your bills. Upper level management feeds a steady stream of propaganda to the store.
bad,"Worked as a naval nuclear propulsion mechanic, worked in a warehouse for 3 years and couldn't get a job as a mechanic or more than 1 interview. After the 7th attempt to switch departments and took up of my displeasure with HR for being passed over for the interview process I left."
bad,Fastenal is one of the worst companies to work for or do business with. Fastenal finds any way to make more money by overcharging its customers and underpaying its employees.
bad,The district manager has no idea how to deal with day to day issues the GM is all about his outside sales and literally would give product away then do is work in store.
bad,"I would purchase parts for the techs, pick and pack orders from stores. I learned to use the WMS and RF guns for inventory control. My co-workers where fun to work with. The hardest part of my job was the vendor warranty claims I did. I loved  working with the vendors and the branches. Management was poor because he did not know his job. I worked for 6 different managers before I said enough is a enough."
bad,Horrible job. horrible management no room for advancement. all they do is lie
bad,Fastenal is an ok foot in the door but that is about it aside from the freedom they give you. The pay is bad especially in the bay area and the turnover is insane.
bad,"Monitor product testing, machine building, scheduling installs, schedule truck routes, monitor DOT regulations, training, reporting, order supplies, trouble shoot machine malfunctions."
bad,"Typical includes checking in the shipments, putting away stock, and customer service. Management for Fastenal lacks communication and are not willing to help their employees when help is needed."
bad,"Hours are never as they are suposed to be "
bad,"alot of heavy lifting, not a very friendly work environment in all dept"
bad,I started working nights and then went to days and went back to nights again. it always seemed that the management could never be pleased with the work being done.
bad,"I enjoy working at Fastenal. The job is strenuous, at best. Learning on the fly is a must. Mostly good people within the company. Opportunity for growth is scarce, but chances do arise."
bad,They never have your back when they need to. Suppost to be a family like business but in the the end its not. Managers need to be paid higher and with the amount of harassment from men that come in and you report it they dont do anything about it.
bad,"The job isn't bad, but isn't good. Stressful conditions, zero to no training. And the customers are ridiculous. Imagine spending 45 minutes or more locating parts for a 5 dollar order, while customers pile up in line because you're so understaffed."
bad,Office staff have no clue as to MTO LAWS the 3 in charge of the drivers are clueless and not qualified to run logistics  2 failed truck drivers and a young women who is very nice as long as she gets her way .Job pays well if you can get your run done in shorter time but not paid overtime when things like weather go side ways Pay structure is very messed up good luck figuring it out They claim big yearly salary but it doesn't work out at the end of the year Overall the Job is not bad but middle management and driver supervisors are un qualified and tell you what you want to hear to get their product out
bad,"Lies from the start. Hardly any feasible time home. 90% of home time is spent sleeping unless you want to only get 3-4 hrs of sleep a night. Management doesnt care about you, though they will make it seem that they do. Stores hardly do any upkeep. Trucks get fixed sometimes, but it will be your fault somehow. Drivers are always wrong. Manager has hands in your paycheck for some reason and will short you constantly because of that. Good place to get experience but they will use you as much as they can. Turnover rate is high and they cant figure out why but if you tell them, they will still do nothing about it."
bad,"Worst managed company I have ever experienced. Over complicated Inventory Management system led to general confusion on daily basis. Young gun manager lost, made employees work in winter clothes for weeks and refused to get heat fixed due to ""no frills"" culture. Sketchy training then thrown into sales cycle."
bad,"Typical warehouse environment.  Long hours and hard work, but I learned a lot while working there.  Some of the management truly values the employees and works to help you succeed.  The corporate aspect of the company makes it hard to advance into leadership roles and feel like you have a long-term future with the company."
bad,They extract as much as they can from employees for as little as they can get and do not value hard work or sacrifices. All about sales and profit at all costs.
bad,"Great opportunity for a just out of school college grad, but the low pay and benefits don't add up to be enough for the amount and the quality of work asked for."
bad,"Fastenal as a whole is a decent company, however, once you enter General Management for the company, you realize bottom dollar and profit is the only care the company has.  Upper management proves to be unappreciative of General management's work and effort. Upper management also is not receptive of critical market advice or business development intuition from General management.  "
bad,Personal gets locked in to a position of part time with promise of full time but often takes years to achieve full time. Once full time there is no room for advancement. Yet it has a high turn over rate due to stress on management sales numbers.
bad,There is a reason there is such a high turn-over rate among outside sales reps. The benefits are terrible if you have to have insurance for your family.
bad,"I worked here for a few years and would have to say this is the most poorly run place I've been in."
bad,"This company has over 2,000 stores and about three times the amount employee's. One would think that they would value the employees that could bring great benefit to the company. However, they do not value any of their employees unless they are in upper management."
bad,"This a great company for people who just graduated from high school or college. Not a great long term company. "
bad,I was able to hone in on my customer service and how I handle stressful situations.
bad,Anyone looking for a honorable company who looks at out for the happiness and well being of its employees should look elsewhere.
bad,"I worked there for about 6 weeks. Quite a joke. The other people in the store I was at were sending customers to the competitor. They really didn't know what they were doing to try to grow a business. Shotty training. No real support. Poor management. They are just looking for people who can talk to a brick wall in the hopes that your kindness will make them a repeat customer. Oh and customer wasn't always right."
bad,This job is a lot of bs they start you at part time and expect you to learn everything in a short amount of time. 
bad,Worked for Fastenal for a little over a year.
bad,was promised a lot more then what was delivered
bad,"it started out great, hired by caucasian, hours, were good, then there was a management change  (not caucasian) and everything changed! surprise surprise"
bad,"The job is a fine job in itself, the problems always came down to the management not making the correct choices for the workers down on the floor half of the time. Most of their decisions on what they did look great on paper and great on their end, but forced the workers in my department to have to stay later and work harder than we would have had to or been necessary. Not to mention the reason why I left. I had been working there for Ten months, and I was getting payed less than people who were just coming in and who were under the age of 18. Their only requirement to get this raise on day one is to stay till close, which everyone else did anyway. It was not a raise of the starting wage, it was just a day one raise to do what we have been expected to do since day 1. Only the new employees get the opportunity to get that raise, which was more than my 6 month raise. I would still be working there if it wasn't for the terrible management choices there. "
bad,"The work itself is enjoyable. The majority of the work force is part time with little to no room for advancement. Unfortunately the more valuable you become in a department as a part time employee, the more difficult it will be to advance. Many departments have production base pay which determines an Employee's wages. Department Managers will change the production goals keeping wages stagnant. As a (part-time) Department Lead I was making $2 less per hour than one of my employees. This is a good job to develop skills and abilities to bring to another Company."
bad,the branch I worked at had an awful gen mgr....so it was a nightmare.Played favorites...no training...inappropriate conduct with fellow employess (male and female) . The job itself is ok....but work conditons ALL depend on the gen mgr.
bad,Fastenal has a good concept and could be a solid place to work. The part-time employment model is ironically a hindrance to company growth but provides steady opportunities for those looking to advance individually.
bad,I was put in a difficult position working here as I was promised one thing but given another because of a change in leadership in the region. I was more or less given a choice of 2 locations upon finishing college when I was told I could go anywhere in the state. The locations that were given were not appealing but I took the lesser of 2 evils since I was graduating college and the position was to be filled immediately following graduation. The manager that I had was a cool guy but not ready to be a manager which made it difficult to work there. Rules would not be followed and when I would follow them I would get griped at from the other employee. The area I was places in was garbage. Not growing. businesses were shutting down. It was just not a good place to work.
bad,"I never had a problem with the job itself, or the pay. This company doesn't do background checks, so be wary of who you work with. It is not female friendly unless you work in the shipping department or the offices. I was a dangling piece of meat being a woman in the machine shop and I was getting uncomfortable advances, so I ended up leaving."
bad,You show up and work at your machine or station all the whole shift. The work place is pretty relaxed. Management was good. The hardest part of the job was being paid very little. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers.
bad,"The management structure throughout Fastenal is young, inexperienced and relatively uneducated. Fastenal claims to have an ""Open-Door"" Policy regarding anything and everything but could be better described as a ""Talk In Circles"" Policy. Good place to work if this is your first job but if you bring in different ideas you may soon become the enemy to middle management."
bad,They are a company who says they are behind their employees till it is time to show. They have a huge mouth for action but the results never show up. As a new manager I was told this is your monthly goal get. My question was HOW? They never give you a real purpose you are promoted and then on your on figure it out but if you not reaching the quota they are coming at you saying that you aren't doing a good job. I was needing to make about 35 calls a day between my OSR and I. You cant give the customer the service they deserve when your running by since you are so busy. They cheat there time by being cheap with employees with huge territories and have no idea how to estimate a goal. Community economics needs to be included in that decision and it is not one that they are to look at is it all about growth
bad,Worse company I ever worked for. All they are worried about is you making them money and them finding ways to take money away from your paycheck. Highly recommend not making this company a career and just a company to beef up your resume with.
bad,loved the job I worked well to complete my taskes mngr never had to tell me to stay busy .but a senior employee there constantly bad mouthed the company the management and kept everything in turmoil .I was hired to work in a team effort. that it was absolutely not senior employee kept creating problems for others constantly being two faced . manager would do nothing so after a major problem causing me to miss a very important appointment I quit .it seems as if the senior employee doesn't want anyone to steal her job or fake glory she wants everything to be about her .it sucks as I would still e there if it wasn't for this heck both part time employees quit within 2 weeks of each other
bad,Big company that only allows 32 hours a week so they dont have to provide benefits for their employess. You can advance very easily to management if you want
bad,Lots of blame thrown around for ones own mistake. Not very good at team work. Everyone was looking out for them selves and would take advantage of others kindness.
bad,Lack of communication within departments. Overall no input on employees for evaluations. Manager felt he had a goood idea of personnal when there was no input from direct manager.
bad,"Worked for Fastenal for 1 1/2 years as an Outside Sales Rep. Company motto: ""Growth through customer service"" is B.S. They could care less about customer service. Only servicing customers who buy regularly and spend a lot. Other customer are ignored and told to come into the store instead of delivery. Lack of customer service. I fell need for there current customers. Manager will violate company policies and nothing happens. Manager has temper issues. Likes to talk negatively about both employees and customers to crew."
bad,as a part time person you get the blunt end of everything. everything is your fault. No management help what so ever. If there is a problem it does not get dealt with properly. Cannot keep workers there at all do to lack of proper management.
bad,"I drove a 26' tractor trailer and made deliveries throughout CT, MA, and VT. The trailer was on occasion loaded dangerously with heavier items stacked on top causing them to topple over and wedge other items making it difficult to move. At one point a length of steel strut came crashing down on top of my head while I was unloading a dark trailer and almost rendered me unconscious. That was the third occurrence I experienced and decided to terminate my employment."
bad,"The management is a mess. There is no consistency between departments. A lot of the people are highly unprofessional. If you only plan on working here part time, I think you would enjoy it. Part time work is easy. They are flexible with your schedule. I would never take a full time job here. Every full time employee is overworked, and it never seems to be enough for the guy above them. There is too much politics. Too many undeserving people get promotions just because of who they know. At the end of the day, nobody in management cares about you at all. You're just a warm body there to do grunt work. If that doesn't bother you, you'll be fine here."
bad,Fastenal was a decent company to work for but being an outside salesman was tough considering the brand is the most expensive in the industry.  I really had to develop relationships with my accounts so they would essentially purchase me and not the product.
bad,"Typical day's work I would assist and help customers, support the staff, inventory items, put items away, call on business accounts for payment, work with stores to help with getting the supplies needed for customers"
bad,This is not a great place to work. Terrible pay and absolutely no chance for meaningful career growth. Stay away at all costs unless you are desperate for a job.
bad,"The company provides excellent sales training to get you started. If you have never done sales, you will learn a lot. "
bad,"Terrible attitude. Totally mismanaged. Missed opportunity to make the place a success."
bad,"If you are looking for a job for maybe a couple years or just on the side, Fastenal is not a bad company to go to for 10 dollars an hour. The higher up stay higher up and don't care for their employees at the bottom. Such example is part time hours get cut during holidays just so higher employees get their bonus check. Also full time in store employees don't get bonuses, instead they give you candy and sweets for the Holiday. Honestly I'd rather get a gift card or 20 dollars to put in my car."
bad,Company has problems keeping empolyees. They change the pay calculator as they please. They have a huge problem keeping customers happy and meeting delivery times. Great co-workers the hardest part of the job is dealing with management.
bad,"its hot, turn over rate is really high, and management is weak. I seen people advance then a month later get fired or demoted back. its not a place to look for a career thats for sure. if they do offer you a full time spot expect to work 12 hr days"
bad,"This company is a joke.  The general manager steals from the company, lies to costumers, and blatantly doesn't care about anybody but himself.  The regional manager doesn't have a spine to do anything to him.  They tell you that there are advancement opportunities but with the manager there now, don't count on it.  The current manager uses the company truck for his own personal use and doesn't let the outside sales person do their job because he is always gone in the truck.  This affects the pay of the whole team.  As said before, unless they do something about the store manager, this place is a joke!"
bad,"I usually worked between 48-60 hours a week and was paid for 40.  I was the manager and had to make sure everything was taken care of and done.  If it wasnt, I made sure it was done before I left everyday or on the weekends.  "
bad,"Its an Ok job, good stepping stone for young grads to build up there resume and then leave to work for someone who wants to pay them a decent salary."
bad,"you do the same exact same day in and day out, management is terrible and there is no advancement with the company."
bad,"management is poor, shows preferential treatment, throws you under the bus. Pay is poor for the amount of work required. They will squeeze what they can from you and regardless of awards you may win and how good your scorecard is, they will let you go on a whim."
bad,"Fastenal makes great employees. You will work hard, there is a little training but not enough to make a difference. There is little room for growth. Not a long term career job, just a year or two stop over."
bad,"A Fastenal é uma multinacional americana, chegou ao Brasil em 2011, porém não vieram preparados para o mercado, faltavam ferramentas básicas de trabalho, como sistema por exemplo."
bad,"At the dublin location there is almost no chance of advancement. It's about the closest thing to slavery that I can imagine. You are expected to go above and beyond and not be compensated for it. The pay never increases and you eventually are enveloped into a mind-numbing monotony of doing the same repetitive tasks over and over plus the job of your manager that refuses to do it, so that they may get hair cuts, pick up there children in company vehicles, goof off on the phones and computers, all while you stay behind the 8-ball and do all of the dirty, grunt work. Would not wish this work, in this location on my worst enemy......."
bad,"Lots of rules. The joke in their industry is they work off of the 25-25 rule. Pay a 25 year old $25,000 to run their multi-billion dollar company. Many of the best managers are retiring and the rest are just looking for their next promotion."
bad,"I started with the company and climbed 2 promotions to management within a year. The next 3 years I grew and thrived under a seasoned district manager. My last 2 years at the company were spent under a grown child of a manager who used his power to bully other employees. I was eventually demoted so his best friend could take my store over, set up for failure then terminated based on poor performance despite having grown sales in any position I've had."
bad,If you get sick or health issues come up don’t expect to have a job. Unorganized always fighting and short on supplies. Leads are a joke. Part time is only 5 hour shifts
bad,"No hay RH, cuidado con que tengas diferencia con tu DM porque se acabó, te cobran errores de las administraciones pasadas, la cultura real de la empresa se vive en USA, en México es muy diferente."
bad,"This job is what they call ""part time"" but you are working a min of 8 hours a day onwards up to 13 hours! It is a physical job and you definitely stay active throughout your shift. Overtime can be reached each week, which is funny as to why it's called a ""part-time"" job... Maybe so they don't have to hand out benefits?? There are quarterly raises, of an entire 0.25 cents! I think the worst part about this job is that you definitely are UNDERPAID, like the amont of work they expect you to do is just rediculous for the amount of pay!"
bad,"I used to be proud to say I worked for a company of this size. But over the years there has been a definite down grade in leadership. It's 100% a mans world, they get paid and make the decisions and don't recognize the people who actually do the work. It's very difficult to go to work to see your leaders unable to follow the Fastenal Cultural values. I would NOT recommend anyone to look to Fastenal for a career opportunity. The ""we promote from within"" model is a joke at best."
bad,I left because I realized that I would never reach my goals as far as financially to start a family and live comfortably with my girlfriend and her kids.
bad,"It's just not a great place to work for some people. While I worked there two people quit, 2 salesmen let go, 2 managers let go. I was let go and I was always within the top 2 in sales numbers and margin. Very stressful job. I can say the pay was good."
bad,"In the beginning, days were spent dealing with walk in customers, while expected to also be packing orders for delivery in the back. Often there was not more than one employee on site at any one time so you had to stop one thing to help walk ins.   "
bad,"A Fastenal baseia seu sucesso apenas na performance extraordinária de seus funcionários. Não há procedimento para os processos, não há meritocracia nas promoções."
bad,"working for Fastenal was not a great experience for me it was so hot in the building they only had a few fans, but most of the building was super hot you had to but your own shirts they didn't provide them for you,"
bad,Limited room for advancement. Poor metrics and low team morale. High turnover rate. Unprofessional at times. Inexperienced store management with poor customer service.
bad,I just had to scan products coming in on a conveyor belt and place them on lettered or numbered pallets. Sometimes I would have to move a pallet or two using different types of how motors.
bad,"You are very busy. Employees wear many hats which make the days go by very quickly.  However, the pay was not equal to the time and effort that is put into your job."
bad,Work long hours and compensation is minimal.  Work environment is lousy and bare minimum.  Provide vehicle but no cell phone or computer while outside the office.
bad,Good place to learn what a successful business looks like. Managers weren't very helpful. Culture was pretty average. Work environment was kind of dirty.
bad,"There is a lot of opportunity for employment and advancement at Fastenal. Unfortunately, it seems that boasts and promises are rarely true. Upper management is not afraid to lie and deceive to further their own advancement. "
bad,Fastenal seemed like a good place to start my career. Boy I was wrong. After being promoted to full-time I was promised another commission based promotion after a couple of months of handling accounts but that didn't happen. I now do most of the work for two big accounts but get the same pay while the general manager gets all the credit. When everything is perfect all the credit goes to her. When things fail it's all my fault. Manager took very little responsibility for her mistakes and often blamed other employees including myself. Said manager was also very disrespectful towards her staff. One guy had a little trouble getting himself adjusted to the work and was very disrespectful to him and still is. Religious intolerance was also something manager enjoyed flaunting. The manager's manager is just as bad but in a different way as long as money is coming his way let them do as they please.
bad,"A typical work day at Fastenal was average paced.  I was responsible for entering work orders for the repairs staff.  In addition to entering work orders, I was responsible for picking the parts needed to repair the tools."
bad,"Hey, sorry for your time 2, and the other hand, I am a beautiful person who is not a problem with that said I was wondering if anyone has ever been to the next day"
bad,its pretty bad it would be much better if they could keep a full staff but they over work you and under pay you the management is ok but inexperienced
bad,"Fastenal's business model is not employee friendly.  You start out part-time with very little opportunity for advancement.  Even though part-time and with no benefits, they have a reputation for working those employees to almost full-time hours."
bad,This is a tough industry for a female to work. I would not recommend this company as a place of employment for a female. Hardest part of the job was the  harassment.
bad,"Advances Easily, otj training and competitive sales. No cold calling, customer base is already built. Sales goals and margin growth required."
bad,"The manager was unwilling to help solve employee conflicts. There were NO meetings at all. Being a new employee, I wanted opportunity to grow and learn but this was not the place to grow a new set of professional skills."
bad,Was supposed to be gaining experience but the manager only cared about one account and had me prep for deliveries. The prep was folding gloves and babysitting the store.
bad,It is expected of all employees to work at least ten hours over time per week.  It is a hard job to have any hobbies or a personal life as it demands too much time.  It is a good way to learn outside sales as you are thrown into it from day one.
bad,I enjoy the people I work with and most of my customers.  My paycheck has progressively decreased due to district management making poor decisions.
bad,"Cool people to work for, excellent training modules paid for by the company. The pay structure is not competitive and there is greater expectations with no added incentive."
bad,"A typical day at work here would include going from factory to factory, job-site to job-site to be told how previous Fastenal employees have let them down and that they will not do business with you and if you do happen to make headway with a customer and create oppurtunity for the company it will be met with a quick good job ( if your that lucky) and increasingly hard if not impossible goals Hardest part of this job is the aggressive growth plan that keeps you overwhelmed and under paid."
bad,this company is a horrible company to work for and the turn over is ridicules I have never in my life seen a business model like that before.
bad,"2 months to realise that some people do great and when the others dont,  nothing happens. "
bad,"I've worked at multiple stores and they've all had there upsides and down sides. They encourage you to transfer, then tell you you're not loyal enough for a promotion..."
bad,Commission structure changed frequently and you could never get accurate figures to allow you to calculate your commission
bad,I worked here for 3 years and by the end I was performing more task than my manager while getting paid a fourth of the salary
bad,The management is selfish and it's unequal when hiring management. 
bad,"A place that clearly loves it's young sales force. Great place if you want to work for a 22-year-old, that lives in their moms basement. They will tell you about how much money you can be making but never give the support to actually make that kind of money."
bad,"If you are VERY machine and tool oriented, you will advance fast. If not, you will wallow in the same position. I know this because I was not machine and tool oriented, and apart from the training classes in Atlanta that one day, I was not groomed to become any sort of account manager. Just ""on floor salesperson"" AKA store jockey."
bad,"Fastenal has a great distribution, training, point of sale systems, plenty of tools to help you do your job.    If Fastenal would simply pay their employees better they could dominate industrial sales. "
bad,"Company was good to me at first but that has leveled off.  There is blatant favortism and special treatment to choice employees.  People are allowed to stand around talking as long as they feel like without being held accountable.  There is a no cell phone policy while in the warehouse except for managers/leads that is totally disregarded.  Positions have been created just to give leads promotions without any new responsibilities or none that are evident.  But if you like having a job where everything is repetitive and you don't mind working harder (or not) than everyone else around you, work at Fastenal."
bad,"Don't have too many good things to say about being a driver here.  Really long hours,  got written up for telling managment I was tired. Made me work through days when I was really sick. They only care about their bottom line. Dont care at all about safety or drivers wellbeing."
bad,"Racist and homophobic management, rude employees. All in all a toxic work environment, as I was mocked for my ancestral history. On many occasions the manager would throw or brake product, then demand that I write it off under ""store use."" Till was out frequently due to the many IOU's that passed through it. Otherwise Fastenal was a great company to work for."
bad,"Good for 20-somethings looking to get some experience, but anyone that is worth a darn moves on quickly...it takes a 60+ hour work week to get the job done because they staff stores at a minimal level."
bad,"la verdad es una buena empresa, buen ambiente de trabajo, muy matado trabajas todo el día, la paa es muy poca y las posibilidades de crecer para las mujeres son muy pocas."
bad,"I have learned a great deal and do what my manager deems me to do.  I have to answer the phone, stock shelves, clean, wait on customers, sort and inventory.  The hardest part of my job is collecting on past due accounts.  Companies do not want to pay within terms of their accounts.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people I do and meeting the customers.  They are the most hardworking people I know."
bad,No concerns other than the bullying micro-managing store manager.  All the employees were subjected to it and upper management did not deal with it.  Customers did not approve and complained quite a bit.  Still nothing even though store lost customers which was then blamed on the sales reps.
bad,A typical day at work is very tiring. I learned how to fix the conveyer belt. I also learn how to operate a tape gun and communicate with co-worker. The hardest part of this job is managing the speed of taping boxes. The most enjoyable part of the the job is talking with co-worker.mi
bad,"After working to organize the branch and achieving targets set and hitting a year anniversary, I was not reviewed. I approached upper management for a possible increase in salary, I was told there would be no salary increases for the next three years. I accepted a position with a considerable increase in salary and turned in my notice shortly after. Needless to say, I was not impressed with them."
bad,"Arrival 6:30 pm. Zero forklifts available upon arrival. 15 forklifts for over 30 forklift employees. Must perform non job related tasks until a forklift becomes available. Approximately 8:00 pm receive forklift and begin to pre load Trailers according to Trailer reports. Around 11:30pm begin loading multiple 52 foot Semis until done around 1:30pm and leave. I learned to drive sit down and stand up electric forklifts between narrow aisles and outside docks. Workplace culture is collaborative due to inventory shortage, employee shortage, forklift shortage or non punctual Trailer arrival. The hardest part of the job is not knowing when or what condition the Semis tractor trailers are in upon arrival however, on time departures are extremely enforced. The most enjoyable part of the job was the quality of co workers that help you perform multiple tasks."
bad,"The position that I was originally hired for never came about. I was promised a time line that never came out. My pay was good when I was finally moved to full time, but management never made it clear to as what I would over see and be responsible for. It felt like I was constantly jerked around."
bad,"Very reactionary management. Not a comfortable environment to work in. A lot of long hours and driving. Puts numbers before anything else including family. You feel like a number and not an employee,"
bad,"My manager over promised and way under delivered. ""Quarterly"" commission was given it twice a year. Expected to work long hours without overtime. Poor leadership and direction"
bad,Fun college job. A lot of freedom and not having someone down your back all day but long hours and you don't get paid unless your high on the food chain
bad,"I worked at Fastenal for 3-1/2 years. I know I was doing an outstanding job, since customers would regularly give me positive feedback, but opportunity for advancement was not given to me because my DM deemed me ""irreplaceable."" I eventually quit because promises of a wage increase or promotion never came through, and because of other lies told to me by various members of management."
bad,"I loved my job and loved what Fastenal stood for however, employees are severely underpaid and upper management is a joke. It is perfectly ok for a DM to verbally attack you and not allow you to get 2 words in."
bad,Would be a decent place to work if it wasn't for the micromanaging at every level and constant changes to company policies and commission structure. Culture has a sink or swim mentality and if the branch you work at is understaffed the training you receive will be very poor.
bad,". Monday-Friday 7-5 if full time during busy season"
bad,"Hard work for low pay"
bad,Trainings and product knowledge easily accessible.  Upper management has a focus on big picture growth and profits for stockholders
bad,Did not know how to advance to correct people. To many management changes. Did not like like the direction of the company.
bad,"Multitasking all day, for long days, with little reward. Corporate cuts costs where it can leaving the branches to figure things out."
bad,"Good experience to learn the ups and downs of a large company. Very low morale with co-workers. People don't stay here long and the company doesnt mind because they can keep hiring entry level workers for very lower wages. Commission structure is good for your first year, but you're expected to keep growing at a rate of 100% in order to keep getting the max rate. Very sneaky corporate structure."
bad,el trabajo es pesado se carga material de 50 ha 60 libras
bad,"There are solid parts, like job security, benefits, and compensation (depending on what type of store you run). But you are required to work long hours with no overtime, and you are an accountant/collections agent/delivery guy/inventory manager/operations manager and unfortunately a lot of that has to come before sales sometimes."
bad,Strong fiscal company that was built on the back of there employees. Fatenal is not faimly freindly cumpany. Fastenal has many growth posibilities do to worker burn out.
bad,The great thing about Fastenal was they were a debt free company and the ability with unlimited resources was a great feeling.  The also had a great training program.  The biggest problem with Fastenal is they seem to be more concern with pleasing the shareholders than the employees needs at times.
bad,This store was Cool until you realize how much nothing matters but money for them and fixing already blown out stores. Place was butt...I learned somethings
bad,"Job was good. Customers were great. Co - worker was stressful to work with. Acted like a child. Managers and Hr seem to only believe certain people because they are friends. You are very unappreciated unless you are friends with management."
bad,Very lax in management. Very little communication. No employee reviews. When reporting issues little is done to improve. Product damaged in transit does not seem to be a concern.
bad,Fast pace work environment. Low staff and long days. Very little realization for work done by managers although they run an organized clean work environment .
bad,"They pay nothing. New hires get $10 an hour and are entrusted to drive a company truck and do sales calls. No experience needed. Managers get $3,000 per month, no negotiation."
bad,"Real world school of hard knocks. Learn what you can, take the small pay, move into a different area of business. Remember not all companies pay for their NASCAR sponsorship by not sharing the money."
bad,"Workplace culture drastically changed over the last few years, upper management lost site of the fact that customer relations and service are what drive their business and sales. all effort and focus is put on vending solutions that are making face to face interactions with customers less frequent. Don't sign vending machines in your territory prepare to be demoted, corporate bought tons of these and don't want to sit on them so stores are outing them out there just to hit a monthly signing goal. not a good way to go about business. fear tactics are also not a way to encourage and motivate employees"
bad,You can't get a head with Fastenal. When you acheave the goals that are in the hand book they change the rules. The more you sell the higher they they wanted. At the end I sold more and got paid LESS
bad,I've been working as a packager now for seven months and I knew going into it would be boring but was hoping for some kind of benefits or some kind of wage increase of any kind but I never will. I talked to a guy who has been working there for three years and he gets paid the same as me. The management is sub par. The training I received was not very good at all. And I seemed to get yelled at for other peoples mistakes a lot. I would not recommend working here. The only nice thing I have to say about working here is that they are extremely flexible which is nice.
bad,"Was an extremely slow-paced job, you could spend up to 3 hours of your day trying to find something to do. Since a lot of their business is the delivery kind almost no one comes into the store. When the full time employees are out on their business runs you can be left to watch the store for over 5 hours at a time. At first it wouldn't sound so bad to get paid to not do much, but when your their for over 8 hours a day it can become very tedious and slow."
bad,The company dominates your life with extremely long days and sometimes weekends/ You really have no time for family. The pay for the amount of work that you put in is not worth it at all.
bad,"Can be fun if you have a good manager. Typical day involved talking to customers on the phone, responding to RFQs, picking stock for vending machines, restocking vending machines, inventory analysis etc. I learned to use my time more efficiently and to achieve company goals. Management is bad. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job is sourcing product. It can eat up a huge chuck of your day. "
bad,"The company used to be really good. They used to believe in ""Take care of your people and they will take care of you"", but things have changed in the last year or so and not for the better. "
bad,Come in talk to guy on the machine before me and ask questions about the machine and the assignment. I learn how to work on a landis machine and thread solid pipe bars. The company was manage right. No problems with my co-workers. The hardest part was getting my tools for the job. I enjoy going to work. I was not ask to do too much. I was ask to just do my job.
bad,Hard driving profit making company but the benefits that come with profitability do not trickle below the stock holders and management.
bad,Working with this company allowed me to take on many task. I would operate power equipment to safely unload product from trucks into the warehouse. I also scanned products into the inventory system and shipped these products to their correct destinations. It was difficult working with the management at this company because they would often be dishonest with employees. The hardest part of the day would be the labor of lifting heavy products. What i enjoyed most was working with the employees that where there when I was hired.
bad,Not enough advancements. Everyone starts at part time and it takes too long to advance in this type of place
bad,Good starting job. Meet a lot of good people. Were not allowed to make much money.
bad,"The work/life balance is good but management is poor. Some managers have no business background or acumen. Expectations change monthly and are not realistic as the company fatally assumes ""ceteris paribus"", a latin phrase meaning all things being equal, conditions. Pay is great if you are motivated and can grow your business."
bad,I would only work for this company for the short term. Not a long term company.
bad,It is a steady job but you are under staffed and under paid. it is a good place to learn how to challenge yourself because normally you will have to do every team memberss job including your own at some point.
bad,Fastenal has a very iffy name in the Chicago land Area. Other competitors spend more on salaries and training and it often shows. If you need a pay check it pays the bills but not much else.
bad,"Hard work, but does wonders for your body. I lost weight, gained muscle mass, and all my vitals improved greatly."
bad,This company runs lean so they put alot of work on every person. It's about sales so everyone comes to work stressed out. It's not a fun job. I don't feel valued at all here for all my hard work.
bad,Highly sales oriented driven. High employee turnover.  Management cares only about sales and not about their employees. Don’t ask questions or make mistakes otherwise you’ll be looked down at.
bad,"A typical work day at Fastenal consisted of showing up to the retail shop, scanning new inventory in that came from the distribution center and allocate it to the clients it was going to, or put it in the right location at the store.  Management was terrible.  I was hired on as an Outside Sales Rep and was told that they were sending me to the corporate headquarters for proper training, but this never once happened.  I more less had to teach myself what to do within the company and learned from another Outside Sales Rep. which was not how I was told I would learn the necessary skills to be successful at that job.  That was the hardest part for me, in order to be the best I could be, and not have the proper training to do so."
bad,My experience at Fastenal can be summarized as a great stepping stone. I learned a lot from the company and moved into a National Account sales role. That was cool although the management was brutal and all sales goals oriented. lots of harassment
bad,"Fastenal is an enjoyable place to work depending on the store you work at.  The branch I worked at was good.  Manager was outstanding and usually very supportive in helping to increase production and sales.  On a corporate level, Fastenal tends to dangle promises in front of their employees without a real payoff.  The structure pits employees against each other.  This culture trickles down to branch level.  Work is fun and you get to move around a lot."
bad,I enjoyed my time at the Fastenal Company overall. if I had to go back to work for them I would probably do it it's a fast-paced job with long hours and the pay could be a little bit better I would still recommend this job to a friend or someone looking for a job Monday through Friday don't expect much overtime.
bad,"If you're 24 years old, fine with making $24K and plan on being around for 24 months than this is the job for you. Anyone else should pass."
bad,Nothing special here but isn't a bad company.  Pay is low but you make your own appointments and get company vehicle to drive once you are at your store.
bad,"A typical day at work is hectic and unorganized and majority of the time unprofessional. I have learned to be more patient, more professional, and more understanding. My management was exceptional at least my manager and assistant managers were. The hardest part of the job was putting up with the un-organization and un-professionalism. I can't really say any part of the job was enjoyable, other than getting a paycheck"
bad,"Putting away stock, getting orders ready, constant inventory, going out and selling our products"
bad,"The job was great until you are consistently thrown into doing thinks you have no clue about. The general manager was scatter brained and played favorites. If she felt like you were running for her job  she would hire someone else, at a higher pay and then stop relying on you. They increase your work load but don’t pay you for it. They walk you out when you put in your two weeks or they don’t acknowledge it. Over all they have left a bad taste in my mouth and a lot of others."
bad,They work you more than they pay. Upper management solely cares about what kind of numbers you produce and nothing more. If they believe you are not exceeding their expectations they will try to remove you.
bad,"Fastenal is not your average retail store. Fastenal is a supplier first, a distributor second, a service company third, and a retail store open to the public last. Employees at local branches are responsible for suppling, distributing, servicing, and customer service. All employees at local branches are salesmen and saleswomen. They appear to be cashiers, but they are not. They service large companies with inventory and construction supplies. They land accounts, service accounts, and maintain accounts. Employees buy inventory, order inventory, stock inventory, create purchase orders, create quotes, create invoices, and perform some accounts payable and accounts receivable functions. The company also is an inventory management company. Fastenal has more vending machines than Redbox. If you work for a Fastenal branch as Sales Support, Sales Associate, Account Specialist, Inside or Outside Sales Representative, you will likely have customers with Vending account. YOU WILL RESTOCK VENDING MACHINES."
bad,"As a commission-based company, I would think there would be a pay scale that is set in stone instead of constantly changing to squeeze an extra penny out of the salesmens' paycheck. Favoritism is rampant from the store and district level where managers can give better accounts to the salesmen."
bad,The district managers never wanna talk about raises. Only want to do the way they did it. Expect to work 45-50 hours a week if you want to advance in the company.
bad,"Fastenal, may be one of the worst companies to work for.  Everything in this company is sales based and like most sales based jobs, they always need growth which makes sense, but there is an extremely high turnover rate for employees."
bad,"The pay structure is so one sided.  Good luck making any amount of money if at a smaller store/area.  The coworkers are usually great, as well as the outings. But in terms of being able to pay the bills, look elsewhere."
bad,"Work is not evenly distributed, compensation does not fit expectation of staff. I would recommend job to students who are looking for part time work, but this is not a career focused job."
bad,"Fast paced, large work loads.  You never really feel like you finished anything at the end of the day.  Very big Corp. company.  You are just another number."
bad,"The work was alright, but the training and management was difficult to deal with. My manager was rude and unprofessional, and the compensation is not worth the effort."
bad,Management do not care about you All they care about is their numbers. Thankful I was given an opportunity and it worked well for 4 years but then it all dried up
bad,"When I started working at Fastenal, it was a very intense experience.  I did outside sales as well as duties inside the store.  I studied intensively day and night to learn about construction equipment and fasteners.  I excelled at what I did, and I became the sole person who ran the entire store from the inside, while still doing occasional outside sales.  It was a great place to work, the hours were set and the pay was good.  At the start of the New Year, the stores original manager was replaced by someone who had less experience with Fastenal than I did, and had only managed at a competitor for about three months.  They had a regional manager as well as another local manager coming to the store and issuing duties, while having me train in three part time workers and being the only one authorized to make sales inside of the store and answer calls.  It became too much and I decided to look elsewhere to further my career."
bad,"I enjoy the sourcing and the challenge of finding something that it out of the ""standard"" product that we supply"
bad,sink or swim company and everyone has that mentality. you can advance very quickly and lose your job even faster. Its all about who you know. very unstructured and they do not give you the tools to succeed but expect you to not only know how to do it already but then double the numbers.
bad,"A typical workday consists of receiving in the daily truck, pulling/packaging product, deliveries, stocking product, cycle counts, inventory redistributions."
bad,"As general manager I learned how to successfully run a business while gaining customers and growing sales. A typical day consists of gathering orders, making sales calls and managing the daily operations of the store."
bad,"Step out of line, and you're fired. Management sided with wealthy business customer, who had a documented track record of deceit and lies, and believed them over their own sales people."
bad,"As an industry leader, Fastenal is the only company to increase it's stock price for the last 28 years. However, employee's do not participate in the companies success. There are no bonuses or price of living increases. The only option to increase the wage you started with is to be promoted; however, after the GM level there are almost no openings. Management rewards top growing branches by leaning on them harder. This suggests to struggling branches to continue to fly under the radar, since there is no benefit to growing the business. The only positive for the company is the Job Security, everything else about the company is negative."
bad,"Management is a problem that plagued the shop, so much so that the CNC department no longer exists. Also management does not reward experience or abilities."
bad,"The Rhub warehouse has very poor management. They don’t want to pay anyone. If you ask for a raise, they’ll just come up with excuses. Management has favoritism so if you’re not a favorite then you will be working more than others."
bad,Great job to gain experiance and product knowledge. Be prepared to work 9.5 hours with no overtime pay. Used to love this place. Can't wait to get out.
bad,"Biggest waste of 12 years of my life. I lost vacation time every year because heaven forbid if I needed take time off! I went in to work sometimes EXTREMELY sick, to the point of, I had to have a bucket next to my desk. Your were not allowed to call of FOR ANY REASON!"
bad,"Fastenal employees are great people to work with. However, the company seems to actively prevent employees from making as much money as they should or could."
bad,Honestly Fastenal was just a toxic work environment with poor management. The company seems to have very little respect for their employees. I'm hope the branch I worked at was a rare exception.
bad,Completed inventory checks of overstock items and locating misplaced product. Frequent heavy lifting over the entire shift. Whether items are coming in or going out the clock is not your friend.
bad,needs new management at store and district level . no direction and extremely under staffed . no clear direction and a lot of dishonesty from management
bad,it was a very different work environment. The people were great including the local General managers but corporate is a huge joke who doesnt provide you with the correct tools to succeed
bad,Receive in truck load of supplies and stock store in the morning. Deliver supplies and make sales through out the day. Search and order products in the afternoon.
bad,"Hard work, not enough hours, will hardly ever get a chance to become manager and get 40 hrs a week. The managers are great. This company is good for young people who are just staring to work."
bad,"Job was boring.  Not my style.  Stocked shelves, put away truck, customer services was spotty. Searched online for parts, placed orders, pulled stock for customer orders"
bad,"Good start to a sales career, or will make you want to better your career. Did not have a great experience due to GM. Too many locations close together."
bad,"The Fastenal Company has a very good training program with many options to expand your knowledgebase within the industry.  However, the opportunity for advancement felt limited."
bad,"fast paced, unorganized. computer programs unorganized and hard to work through. small work area, hard to organize all work materials."
bad,"Great learning experience in a somewhat office setting. If you don't have a good GM, then you will be looking for a new job pretty quickly. Fastenal expects you to stay with the company because ""we're Fastenal"" and not because they will reward you with better pay or a better commission plan. Not enough employees for what one store can do, and have crazy expectations. The people that to make commission, have a strange commission plan that doesn't necessarily add up. Hardest part of the job is the fact that anyone can come into the store, at any given time all in the same time you're having to be an outside sales, account specialist, inside sales support, warehouse worker, a purchaser, and a material handler, yet you're still not making decent pay."
bad,"Decent benefits.  Decent paid time off."
bad,This company needs to stick with a goal and achieve it before changing to the next best thing.
bad,company upper management has no communication.  worked here while in college.  had a test and project due in class.  told boss 3 weeks ahead of time and he claims never told him.
bad,Frugal organization that maximizes output of the individual contributor.
bad,"4 hour shifts... Didn't learn much, very boring. Management was very by the book, as was the whole company. Didn't talk t co-workers much do to being far away from everybody. Always busy."
bad,Typically you would punch in and head straight to your assigned area for me it was bulk picking so you would find a pallet jack hopefully not broken and then hunt for a pallet. management was alright but only really looked out for their favorite workers. hardest part of the job was keeping up with the constantly changing pick rate. the things i enjoyed were some of the employees i met and the time starts.
bad,"You are forced to work the job of two or three people, if you can keep up they will let you go.  save you self the trouble  Management dont care is all based around the bottom dollar."
bad,I am able to work overtime to increase my income. My coworkers are very friendly and care for the well being of others. We work in teams to make everything work.
bad,"If you are hired in part time, you are most likely staying that way. No break room, one bathroom. The pay is above average compared to other part time positions in the area starting out (though you won't likely get a raise) and they are not open on the weekends and close at 5 so perfect for people with families."
bad,"i loved my job, my boss was great he helped me a lot, but the higher ups kept me from advancing i worked there nine months part time. i tried to go full time the whole time i was there. maybe if they would have promoted me i would have stayed but the company itself is a little stingy with the wealth!"
bad,"Decent company. Great 401k, low pay, weekends off, large cap company that produces year after year."
good,Why do I have to do that for you? If you want to know go ask someone currently employed there. For dinner I plan on having smoked chicken with potatoes.
good,It's a great company for learning how to run a small business. You will work 10hr days and and get a minimal salary. 
good,"This place is just somewhere where a bunch of wanna-be-still frat boys can jerk themselves off and pretend they're still in college while scratching each others backs. Management lying on time cards, leaving early, and doing nothing during the day, WHILE not meeting goals for at least 8 months in a row, is apparently okay and only warrants a stern conversation. Being passed up for promotions after being told that you would be moved into the position multiple times over the course of months is also a normal occurrence. "
good,Working at Fastenal is a life sucking horrific experience. Management is deplorable and unreasonable expectations. Commission basis is very deceptive and unfair for the hours you are expected to work.
good,pull oders and stock shelves
good,"The job was actually pretty fun, learning new things, working with new people and getting closer with clients. The pay wasn't great, and the work environment wasn't great. Upper management didn't care about us no matter what we said or did."
good,Local branches have great deal of autonomy of pricing and creating individualizes market.  Limited financial resources to work the sales market.  NO per deim for traveling employees.
good,It's quite interesting when a company lets someone go that is suceeding in their current position. Unfortunately the management that I had did a poor job in my opinion handling issues at the branch and personal level. Fastenal may want to look into it as they have a proven track record of not keeping employees for an extended period of time.
good,"making sure you careful of mistakes ,great co-workers, and nice christmas gift"
good,"Management is not very good, DM’s don’t listen to employees only to managers which is wrong as how can you talk about your manager habits to your manager."
good,"If you get a good District Manager, you'll go far in the company. If you don't, you'll be stuck with being micro managed at every level. You risk your life everyday trying to make sales that only give you a meager commission."
good,"The manager I had when I was there is no longer employed there. So it should be a better environment. Would work there again but corporate likes to run a very lean crew, so In turn it makes the workload very stressful. 100+ accounts over a 24,000 sq miles area by yourself type stressful."
good,"Fastenal was a ok good to work for, the job was a part-time job and it was close to my home, which was great. Fastenal relocated out of the state so I had no choice but to find a new job."
good,"This is a great introductory to sales management and hunting mentality. Poor commission structure, poor management, poor business model as it does not relate to digital trends"
good,"Not a bad place to work the work is easy. The morale there is at a all time low & coulld be a lot better. To much favoritism, thats only how you advance in the company not from your hard work."
good,Great staff and coworkers. Manager doesn't care about your growth or development. Always to busy to train you or answer questions but spends all day talking to staff.
good,"This is by far the worst job ever, management is very biases and goes by favoritism, they were also stealing our bonuses. Very little pay for the amount of work you have to do. I was working full time We never was offered health insurance."
good,"Management is a joke, business is way too micromanaged, coworkers are all on their own - if they are lazy don't expect for them to offer help, most enjoyable part was the paycheck. "
good,"Arriving at 2:00 a.m. in the morning, setting up station. I've learned how to pick accurate items from a tote that customers wants and to package them in a open tote or a box. I've learned how to sort item of all sizes and how to keep records and filing of orders for when the time came to ship the merchandise to end-users"
good,"Over worked and under paid.  Company only wants to hire part time school kids that they can pay $10 an hour.  Instead of promoting someone that already works for the company to full time they would rather bring in more new part timers that you have to train and then the experienced one that wants to go full time gets mad and leaves.  This is why they have such a high turnover rate and they cant even keep the managers they have, in place."
good,"Management isn't great, never know where you stand, and to much drama."
good,This is a good company for someone starting their career in industrial sales. They tend to give young people and opportunity to learn and develop in industrial sales. Management has a real disconnect with their store managers and how they need to be supported to be successful.
good,The don't listen to their employees. They don't fix what needs to be fixed. They don't want to hear other people's opinions. They only want to make it better for the mangers and the full time leads
good,I work in and pick her up roll and Pain Management isn't that great. The employee a pretty nice and we work well with each other. Management listens to our concerns but don't address them.
good,"No experience needed they train you. Request for time off almost always get approved. reasonable amount of sick time. Management needs to be chosen with more discretion, most managers aren't qualified they've just been there a long time."
good,"Fastenal is a good starter job to have as a teenager, it is very fast paced which was not a problem for me at all. I did like working there just the pay was not fair, such as my first year of being there i did not receive a review nor a raise for my hard work when others had gotten a review and raise when i was more of a hard worker than they were and i worked there longer, but other than that it was a good job and i would recommend a friend to work there."
good,"If you are a student, this job is perfect as the hours are flexible...but that's really the best thing. If the location is significantly out of your way you would be much better off looking somewhere else."
good,"Fastenal could be a great company if they took better care of there employees. Managers are taken advantage of while expecting to work long hours for low pay. My suggestion to any potential employees would be to find out what the store is doing in sales compared to other branches locally. If you are stuck in a lower producing store in a small market, you will have to grind until your legs fall off. The company states that there is room for growth but there is a reason for so much turnover. Its the way employees are treated. Great job for meeting connections."
good,"It is different store by store my store we worked closely and we were all friends. You are always on call customers always call, text, or email you at odd hours of the day."
good,"fastenal was a good place to start working and taught me alot about customer service, but the advancement career was not there that i was looking for in a company"
good,"It's a physical job that you can do as a part-timer when you need some money. Not hard, but very dull. Physical work that you must do fast. They post everyone's numbers daily and has people compete for fastest results. Although I was the neatest, they preferred the fastest, despite how much product was broken. They had employee appreciation, but employee retention is horrible. Promotions rarely happen either. Moving up is nearly impossible without being a person who screws other people over. I got promoted into another department that involved wheeling and dealing. Even when I hit my numbers, the full-time job they touted never came."
good,"Reach goal keep your job ! No goal no job. very little corporate support. Good training opportunities. Selling industrial products."
good,"Got asked to take as much as I could handle when I am making less than 30,000 dollars a year after taxes and bonuses. Why do so much work for such little reward?"
good,"They didn't treat the employees well once they were moving their location to another. All employees were laid off, I was given an opportunity to go to another location but they manager didn't want to make much of a pay change."
good,"Learned a lot about office culture, but the pay was not good. Upper management would come to my University and talk a lot about how much you will learn about the job, but when I started working there they skimp out on pay."
good,You start out part time which is tough to manage your finances.  You can definatly advance to outside sales. But good luck trying to get to the next level it's a good ole boy system. Many of the seasoned veterans at fastenal hire all of their family members and guess who gets the opportunity. Also the branch managers aren't there very often so guess what your carrying both badges and getting paid for one-which of course is the lowest paying one.
good,Pay was very dependent upon how well you could increase sales for your particular store. Worked as part of small team frequently. Pay was reasonable for work being done.
good,"Fastenal is a fast-paced and cut-throat environment, but if you dive in with both feet, the experience you get is unparalleled. As a General Manager you will have responsibility and autonomy in many different areas of your business, but beware that you are also held responsible for every aspect of your business."
good,"Not your true sales job.  The more you sell, you don't necessary mean you make more.  Only benefits corporate, not the employees.  Hostile environment."
good,Fastenal's distribution center only offers part time empolyment unless your management. Basic warehouse responsibilities. Learned how inventory moves through out a distribution center.
good,This was a decent job to get me through school but I would not recommend it to anyone looking to build a career. They offer very limited advancement and compensation is much lower than the competition.
good,This is an awful place to work for. They don't pay you enough and they push off all of the work onto the part timers. Managers can play around all day. There is no authority and motivation at all.
good,High turn over rate in many areas of the building leave some departments stretched thin at times. Minimal opportunity for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and you have to pick a lot of orders. All of my managers are very nice and I get along with all of them, as well as my co-workers."
good,Worked for the company for 8 years. After taking over a store for 4 months as a General Manager they closed my store down with no notice or anything. Made a lot of good friends and business relationships.
good,"This company overall is pretty good. Just disappointing when it comes to pay and raises. "
good,"As soon as I clock in, I go straight to my station and retrieve my scanner and then to the sortation docks and begin scanning. People are usually getting ready to leave from the morning shift once I arrive, then second shift comes in and within the next hour the second shift comes in and begins work and it's a fast pace of scanning correct items to their bins all night long."
good,"computer training to start.  need to be a jack of all trades, you do everything from sales to deliveries to building to cleaning on a daily basis"
good,Depending on who you work for or with this company can be a good place to work for.  Advancing in the company requires more on likability rather than skill set.
good,Fastenal is a great place to get your feet wet in the industrial  sales competition. They have the best training in the industry. Management is very top heavy and corrupt. Once you get to a certain point with in the company they tend to believe everything that you say rather than what the people who do the grunt work say. District managers tend to choose a few managers who they label as their guys and they tend to treat them better than anyone. There is definitely a pecking order when it comes districts. This does not mean that it goes by tenure. It is by who the district manager likes the most. District managers tend to spend 90% of their time either writing the same emails every day over and over or calling managers on the phone. With in the company they are probably most useless position and waste of money. Upper level management changes the commission structure frequently to basically make the company more money and make you less money. Benefits were good Blue cross blue shield for health and dental. Very High Turnover rate. While working for the company for 2 years I saw about 25 people either quit or get fired. Expect to work more than 50 hours a week unless part time. Compensation is the industry worst. They preach that growth through customer service. However over my time there I saw a lot of people upset with customer service around the company. Having to mend those relationships from previous employees was one of the top things to do. There were also times that my district manager would sign people up for training's without any knowledge what so ever. They also take
good,"Open store in morning with co workers. Manager is always late for meetings and careless of store, keeping it organized and well clean. We sell fasteners, and help customers find what theyre looking for."
good,"A typical day at Fastenal starts off with clocking in and working with the delivery drivers to get them docked and unloaded in a timely fashion.  I will then either help the receiving staff verify orders into our inventory or operate a fork lift to deliver pallets of product to various parts of the warehouse.  I also assist, when I can, with the training of new employee. My favorite part of this job is helping my co-workers and attending to the delivery drivers."
good,"I have been with the company for 6 months with a bachelors degree in management. I was hired on expecting to move into full time sales. So far I have been on one sales call and have had 0 training in Sales. Everything that part time employees do is inventory management and some account management. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of writing up orders, finding parts for customers, and stocking merchandise.  I learned how to locate a variety of merchandise through Fastenal. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and delivering merchandise to local contractors like BMW.  The hardest park of the job was working with the store manager after several other employees left."
good,"Advancement is hard to come by... With the company not growing, a lot of different styles and programs are coming that just done work well with the business model"
good,Fastenal allowed me to advance my customer service and sales skills exceptionally as my job focus was outside sales.
good,"This company is growing. You would think they would have things under control, but there are a slew of problems that trickle down from the top. They have slowly been losing managers to competitors based on hours and pay. They have recently took away their bonus program, which was one of the things they used to advertise the company. Over they are just an okay company to work for."
good,The co-workers and the camaraderie are awesome. The hours and stress do NOT translate to fair compensation. Benefits are costly and unremarkable. There is little room for upward movement in the Cincinnati market (upward will require relocation). Management is challenging to tolerate due to lack of grasp on daily activities and unresolved lingering problems.
good,"Took a part-time, on-site position expecting to advance within 6 months or less.  After a year, there has been no mention of moving up anytime soon.  Very frustrating and feel like I'm spinning my wheels preventing me from my goals of taking the part-time position in the first place."
good,"Company has the potential to elevate but during my time there, priorities were about the customer and not about the employee. Very fast paced and not a lot of communication between departments. Safety was also an issue and there were times when it was required of you to take chances with your safety. Climb into or on unsafe platforms or walkways. Reaching for product without knowing the weight. Very Strenuous work environment. Definitely not for the middle aged or older worker with average lifting skills.    As an ICS, I was tasked daily under these conditions in order to successfully complete my job requirements."
good,Lots of online training and company sponsored classed designed by Fastenal and taught by Fastenal personal. Pay and job assignment don't match. High turnover in management even more in hourly employes.
good,"I enjoyed the work. Dealt with store operations mostly. Work provided their own internal educational program that was great - learned a lot from that.  There are opportunities for offsite learning as well. Also, you could move around in positions through out the company anywhere there was a store in the US. If you don't have a good leader there is a lot of ""sink of swim"" learning. The only bad things I would say is that there was a lot of gossip among all levels of management. Also favoritism was an issue on the store level."
good,Very little mangagement. Very little training. Great benefits with mediocre pay for this area. Bonus and commissions were promised by never followed through with.
good,"Was not a fan of the commission structure. If you were in a small market with multiples of competitors, the company would discount the margins so much that it would remove all commission from your paycheck."
good,"The work culture was positive with everyone working together, however hours were limited even during the busy times of year. I did not observe any major safety problems."
good,I have watched over the years how good it is to have a place like Fastenal to learn and not be afraid to make a mistake. I like how they help there employees in hard times.
good,"Arrive around 6:30am, log onto emails, print out your book of business, plan your day, meet with sales staff and out the door by 8am.  Sales calls, service existing clients target potential clients and meet the expectations of the day."
good,"I learned to advance in my product knowledge, I was sent out of the state to participate in workplace knowledge. I learned also the values and culture of the company and got to meet the company's CEO"
good,"Working here overall is not bad, you get paid competitively. Hower in terms of business experience there is a lot left to be desired. I have learned how to quote, invoice, and deal with customers as a whole. This job is training to become an Outside Sales Rep. with the company and is mandatory to fill this role before doing so. Your experience will depend on the General Manager at your store."
good,Good job for someone who recently graduated high school.  Work is easy and not very labor intensive.  Does not pay very well.  Management and co-workers were friendly.
good,We received a truck full of orders every day with large amount of product and had to put up daily and delivery daily very full schedule no breaks didn't have time and most of the time couldn't finish the products putting up on the shelves to sale.
good,this company is a good company but it does not provide any type of benefits and it will over work a person. but if work is all you are about then its a great place to be.
good,"Fastenal is a good place to get experience and training, however if you want to make a good living you will have to move on to another company.  I do not regret working for Fastenal, but I do not regret leaving them."
good,"Worked as a Night Shipper.  The job was fast paced, stressful and physical.  Days could be long or short depending on how much product needed to be moved that night.  Could not depend on getting a minimum number of hours so pay could vary greatly."
good,Fastenal focused solely on the bottom line. They were not there to serve the customer. It was all about profit and never about providing a service to its customers.
good,Most positions at this company seems to require you to give your soul to them. Very high stress and a 24/7 commitment is expected. Company seems to be growing but at what cost to your work/life balance?
good,Overall Fastenal was a decent experience.  It lacked pay but offered experience as a trade off.  Most managers were inexperienced and had no formal training. There were a few managers that were really great but they were rare.
good,Fastenal is a company that expects alot for too little. Benefits are OK but hours are long. Pay is inadequate and too long between raises. District Managers are obsessed with profit numbers.
good,Field Manager was unacknowledged and uncommunicative. Completed degree and could not find opportunities within the company. Left company to pursue a unrestricted position.
good,"Hours everyday managing children."
good,The management tells you you are getting a raise but 6 months later you are still making the same amount. Raise dangling methods occur when asinine managers attempt to manipulate employees.
good,Not much advancement opportunity and the pay is well below the work and hours you have to put in to succeed at the level they demand.
good,"Fastenal makes a lot of promises they don't keep. When I took my position, I was told I would have the flexibility to attend my daughter's school functions and take care of other personal matters during the day. That was patently false. I am forced to remain at work from 7 AM until 5 PM or later every weekday. Furthermore, I am often expected to respond to customer and supervisor emails well into the night, often as late as 12 or 1 AM, not to mention Saturdays and Sundays. There is NO work-life balance."
good,"It is extremely difficult to receive the ""compensation"" that is promised to you for your sales. The company finds a million ways to drop your commission as low as possible."
good,A typical day at work for me was working on orders in my individual cell. Learned to work individually and in a fast paced environment. Supervisors and managers were mostly supportive and flexible. Not much time to interact with coworkers because of the nature of the job except to ask for assistance. The hard part of my job was its physical nature and getting dirty. What I enjoyed about my job was the feeling of achievement I got when I was able to reach my target.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customer, stocking inventory and other basic daily activities. Poor management, they have a hard time realizing good employees when they have them. Will not honor a 2 weeks notice."
good,"It's a good fast pace and mutli-tasking , since you are in charge of the people and sales. Fastenal  gives you good knowledge all the way around from account payables to customer services."
good,i loved my job. i was very sad when i returned to work from a life threatening medical emergency to be fired for being late. i had only one write up with the company in the four years i worked for them.
good,"The company is stable but the ever changing values, business philosophy, and managemnt make it a difficult enviroment to perform in. All of the travel makes a home life difficult as well."
good,Very contradictive for confusion to whats going on from team leader to supervisor to mangager to department manager not well operated and managed great employees but high turn over rate due to no pay raises and stability
good,Get ready to log 50+ hours a week and be compensated in the mid 30's.
good,Typical day requires checking email and responding to critical requests for quotes or job training. Coordinating and directing sales staff in order to maximize sales effort for each day!
good,"When I first started I got put into a mess of a store. A new young GM was coming in, old GM out, and longest time running employee passed away. I got pushed to perform tasks and duties not covered by my job title. I was over worked and under paid without benefits. Working 40hours a week with only PT wage, no benefits and no protection. I was then promoted to FT but it’s been 6months and no sight of benefits. Got a $1 raise since then, but typically working long, dragging hours, without getting paid for overtime because of the cheapness of the company. They expect us to reach for the stars but they tie our hands behind our back. With a PT support staff now that has quit, and another FT salesperson quitting, they cut back the hours on everyone else which adds more pressure and stress on everyone. "
good,The company could be great. But  with the lack of communication  and caring of there employees  it drags it down. I mean Fastenal expects  so much from there employees  but dont give anything  in return. While being a Fastenal employee  you wear so many hats but do not get compensated  for it. I imagine  for the things we do that I would get paid alot more at other companies.
good,Was a decent place to work but not a place I would make a career out of. Pay was horrible had to beg for a raise. Job duty and goals changed and was hard to advance or know what to do.
good,"Enjoyed the work but could not always finish a job without being interrupted to do another,  Machines outdated and had mechanical issues delaying production."
good,"Everyone I worked with was amazing, very talented people working hard to pay their bills. Management was aloof without coming off stuck-up. Also, the manager was excellent at encouraging workers to constantly improve themselves as well as their workplace."
good,"I am a current 5:30 am picker here. On this shift the main manager comes in about 3.5 hours into it, ( Maybe two times an week) and relies on the team picking leads, to just enter our production totals about every 40 minutes, the  PICKING lead likes to sit during most of that time, and do computer work( looking busy most of the time). There are many breakdowns of the crane that sends all the orders to us in our cells, to pick. One picker does work harder than most and puts on a harness, that  should be the leads duty to fix a crane, but as I said the more you do, the more advantage they take!(Some days it stops running,making our numbers look a lot worse than they are,( you should be near  a 70% rate ) Some lines have easier picks than the others, but the team lead can manipulate what picks we get? Of course they will take advantage of the few pickers on their lines that do more than others, and the ones who show up daily on time to do their job, verse the others on the shifts they work on! They go home early, no-shows"
good,This company is a great opportunity for someone to learn how to run a business. Very young employee base with lots of advancement opportunities. Pay scale is pretty low.
good,"Hours get cut each season end, yet upon losing a full-time outdoor sales rep due to random testing, still unwilling to give back hours taken from indoor support staff."
good,"The company values profits, products, and customers before anything to do with their employees. Constantly understaffed but all employees are expected to carry the workload of at least three people."
good,"I really enjoyed all the knowledge and training I picked up at Fastenal. However the trucking system caused us to miss deadlines constantly and I could never advance past my initial starting position, despite the fact I was promised a raise for the entire second year. "
good,Okay job. some days are better than others. do not prepare you well. pay is lacking. no bonuses or incentives. hr is out of touch with company. have to share rooms with strangers
good,Good company.  There is no room for growth for myself here at this time.  I enjoy the people I work with.  I’m just ready for something new I can make a career out of.
good,Ok company just a bad culture. Month to month sell more and more but no focus on customer retention. Typical corporate leadership. Distribution centers are in good locations though.
good,It’s not what I’m looking for in my life for a career it’s not a awful job for those looking for a summer job or maybe just a job right out of high schoolers
good,"Fastenal is a good company to work for if you do not mind the outside sales driven culture. That is, a culture completely based on growth. Your district manager is helpful and nice as long as constant growth is shown. The instant it isnt, the questioning and micro managing begins."
good,"A day would start by printing out tickets for customers."
good,"Ok place to work. Got to learn alot about construction supplies. "
good,your day may be calm and relax or busy and irritable. if youre a good worker they will take advantage of you while everyone else gets to slack off. management is cool at times and can call as many times as you want
good,Large portion of day spent delivering product. Customers were excellent to work with and lots of opportunities to help solve problems. Low pay and long hours.
good,Fastenal was great for parents who needed to get to work and still be able to handle business the environment was fast pace and but easy going Fastenal is a good company to work for and I would not mind returning to.
good,The job was not extremely hard it was harder to deal with some of the people. on another note being a sales man was not what i wanted to do and that was one of the only way to move up. if you want to be a sales man i suggest working a few years at fastenal because fastenal has ties to alot of factories.
good,My department was very physically demanding. I picked threaded rod and bridge construction bolts and sent them to shipping. I liked the job because it helped me stay in shape but an injury I suffered in the military made it very painful to be on my feet and carrying heavy objects all night.
good,"The management in place is not qualified for their positions."
good,"Management is horrible, unless you are an OSR they do not care about you. Hostile work environment, favoritism you will service accounts and get no credit for it. Not worth the time or energy but it pays the bills right now"
good,"At my local branch we had a superior staff, My immediate boss left for a different company and once that happened the new manager who was not a sales oriented manager at all. Our District manager let things get out of hand at the branch and things went downhill from there."
good,"Fastenal is a great company, but it seems to be hard to move up within the company, especially when you are in a smaller area or one of the smaller locations. Management is okay for the most part, but seem to somewhat take advantage of certain situations and their freedom of time when no one is looking. The best part of the job is the customers, especially the frequent ones. All in all it's a good company, just not one for everyone or some's situations."
good,Sales is the driving force for this company and is the primary success indicator by which its employees are measured for advancement.  Very high turnover because of this.
good,"I learned more about nuts and bolts than I thought ever existed!. It's a stepping up type of career, typical of any sales in retail business."
good,"Fast-paced work environment. Company seems to struggle with management. No manager im aware of has any type of degree. Most of the emphasis/work load is put on sales people ,and part- time help.But typically you are paid fairly and over all a decent career."
good,Stay away from the Medina and Lorain county area. The manger in charge of this territory is horrible and a real back stabber and liar. Go South to the Akron/Canton area.
good,They pay you a flat salary on the 1st and 16th of every month. The routes may start out at around 50 hours a week but they are always adding on more stops which can kick you over 55 hours.
good,"• Fill industrial vending machines in Naples, Fl"
good,"A typical day at the solutions specialist role is to work with individual branches in a set territory to help identify new potential customers and to maintain and train employees on the vending program. Provide troubleshooting, manually fix machines, and to meet with presidents and CEO's to present a cost savings plan and to reach an agreement to implement the vending program. I learned a great amount of technical skills as far as troubleshooting mechanical issues and fixing them. Management was located in wisconsin and was not supportive and distant. When a problem or a major decision needed to be made they were very hard to reach if they could be reached at all. Difficulties included getting branches to setup appointments with good qualifying candidates, and relying on the sales staff to follow through with repairs and or upgrades. "
good,Good company as a whole but the middle management in Canada is trash. They promote young inexperienced kids to middle management and they come in with a change the world attitude disregarding the people below them!
good,"Fastenal is a sales (read: stock value) driven company that doesn't spend the time managing its infrastructure in a method that maximizes production and results.  Fastenal seems to make money in spite of itself.  Management decisions are knee jerk, which leads to high turnover and low morale.  Regardless of performance, non outside sales personnel are demoted to part time without warning due to lack of sales performance by others, stores are closed and opened depending on monthly branch performance.  This is not a career job, as there is limited upward mobility, and not a good place to make money as there is a cap on what outside sales WILL make."
good,Easy to learn the system is a very sales oriented environment must be able to sell in order to grow the hardest part no respect for lunch breaks overall is a good stepping stone for gaining experience in sales and customer service.
good,"Hard work is rewarded with promotions throughout the company, however the compensation throughout these advancements is less than average. "
good,"I learned time management and customer relations, and how to network and develop sales tactics. This was beneficial in the development of growing as a work force professional."
good,Great work environment and great company to work for. Not much room for advancing even though they said I would. Got hired part time and manager said within two weeks I would be full time. After a month went by and I was still at part time I had to go.
good,"Great company if you are located in USA, not a great company for competition based in Canada.  Don't be fooled by the commision compensation.  Unless you live in a remote area where you are the only company, you will never be able to sell products at a 50-60% margin and be competative.  If you can't sell at the crazy high margins than you won't earn commision.  If you don't make sales you will lose your job, so your base pay is really all you will earn, and you have to make sales at lower margins to make Fastenal money, but you wont earn any commision."
good,Okay company to work for.  Pay stops at a point.  Growth is key.  Compensation is mainly commission and upper management does not like salary employees.
good,"great place to work and good pay, however at the time of my employment there were issues with consistency in work hours. one week I would have 30hrs or more the next week I would have 15hrs. by the end I was working 5hrs a week."
good,"Working for the Fastenal Company was an overall good place to work an to obtain great knowledge from a Fortune 500 Company. Its a fast paced job with a lot of responsibilities. I was fortunate enough to have a great team to work for, my boss, an the one OSP, he gave me a lot of knowledge and helped me to get where i needed to be. The hardest part of the job is like any other job in sales/marketing. What was most enjoyable was all the accounts an the team i worked with. They not only were my team but also like family. Overall Fastenal is a good company to work for, I wouldn't have the knowledge if it wasn't for them."
good,"Fastenal culture is different from many places. Some may enjoy the work/life balance (90/10) but some may find that the reward for such disparity is not worth it. Depending on geographical location, the company is great; however, different roles have different results."
good,"Honestly love this company but the packaging department is awful. Extremely boring, same shift and same machine every day. They don't train you, and expect a lot out of you. Will even expect you to run two machines (double the amount of work) for the starting wage. Doesn't give 6 month reviews and no raises. Absolutely not worth it. Worked there for 1.5 years and couldn't be happier that I'm leaving. Used to have third shift (pays more $11 starting) and once the third shift lead left, the workers got to keep their wage even when moved to second shift like everyone else.. Aka $1.00 more an hour and those people are lazy. Overall not a fair company!!!!!! Sick of working my butt off and getting nothing back."
good,"Salary non-exempt position, salary is low compared to other companies in the industry, no advancement opportunities and the office managers are very frugal."
good,"Decent place to work depending on the manager, upper management is strong. Be a go-getter and you will enjoy your job and you will make the money you are seeking."
good,Fastenal is a good company to work for and have really great hours. Monday thru Friday 7am-5pm. You just have to have a tough skin and nit take anything personally.
good,This job requires you too think on your feet.  One gains considerable experience in the industrial marketplace. Within the store teamwork is a must.
good,"I am working part-time at Fastenal while going to school. The only opportunity for advancement is Sales to ""maybe"" management. All of the corporate positions advertised are listed as part-time. The environment is very laid back and sales support has a wide range of responsibilities."
good,"The worst part is the repetition, besides that a very easy job for the most part, been with Fastenal for over a year and not the slightest hint of increased pay nor advancement."
good,"Loved the people I worked with, but upper management liked to micro-manage"
good,"The hours are decent, but the pay is below average and there is little potential to move up."
good,"management is somewhat clueless. "
good,Walked around product to big for the line and anything else needed
good,While working at Fastenal i got to perform daily sales calls and present product professionally to customers. Great place to sharpen skills.
good,"a typical day is come in a 10 threw 2an start working in small/large sortation get ur scanner an make sure u have water an a maker an a tape gun ..Make sure u have light but proper dress attire an steel toes shoes . I learn how to drive a forklift, standup, Sitdown. the coworker are the best part of working there ,they are great ,honest trustful, and respect ur personal life .The hardest part of the job is not the work or the heat  or the steel shoes  it is the breaks or lack there is. the most enjoyable part of the job is the advancement in the company."
good,"Good hours, anything above your store management was out of touch with what happened at the branch level."
good,This company seems more interested in paying their stockholders than their employees. If you are single and need a starter job it is good just dont plan on supporting a family.
good,Not very good pay for over-the road. Good bosses and designated routes.
good,If you are looking for an IT job Fastenal is a good place to start. Don't expect to be paid anywhere near even the lowest average for your job title. This is why you should work here to get experience at a semi-large company and then move on.
good,"Hard work does not advance you in the company. Being near an area that is growing is the only way you move up. Tenure and hardwork does not matter if you do not hit their ""goals"" of 25% growth yoy and 50% profit margin."
good,I loved working and learning with this company but when my sales dropped with the economy they just terminated me rather than try to work with me or offer a lower position.
good,Don’t appreciate there workers and show favoritism.They fired the district manager and cleared rest of the branch based on who got paid the most. So it became a contentious environment.
good,if you need some good money while in school and want weekends off this place is okay other than that i wouldn't recommend it at all. If you want a future in the company from working hard good luck.. The only way to move up here is by sucking up and getting in close with higher ups even if you are terrible at the job if the higher ups like you thats all you need.
good,"Had a bad experience with one manager tried to report it-it was ignored.  If you have the right manager this can be a very rewarding position."
good,"Unfortunately Fastenal varies a lot at each branch. Good for motivated and independent workers, but a job excellently done takes support from the team. Management is goal driven and may not know much about people and how to get the best from a team. Fastenal is great with product and selling skills training, but NO training for management and operational excellence."
good,I was there around 17 years which is unheard of. I won nearly every district competition. Showed growth up to 1000% in a branch. Worked my way up as you should. Unlimited resources and the distribution system is second to none. I loved the company and was a “lifer”. They restructured after the founder stepped aside. Allowed people that were not qualified to jump up quickly. This expansion caused the company to lose focus on those that really cared and excelled. Started bringing in the cheapest available labor and it shows. Long time employees cast aside without a care by VP’s. Focused on import product at high prices. Customers noticed lesser quality products and high turnover. It’s too bad. Was a quality company with no ceiling. Now an expensive version of companies they used to beat easily with lack of pride in my opinion. Want my gold watch? It’s rare.
good,"This place is a very unfocused company as far as getting everyone on the same page. Job assignments are always different, even if you have never done the job they expect the most from you"
good,I did learn a lot from working here but the management was terrible they seem to only care about the numbers and doing it there way other then the customers and trying to make them and the employees happy.
good,"It's like everyone is running with their heads chopped off. Management does not know how to talk to employees correctly,. Unorganized and spoon feed people then expect you to know how to do it when management is around. Taught me nothing"
good,Not enough hours for me. 28 hours a week is just not enough. There's never any full time positions open. Only part time positions. It's very hard to elevate within the company due to a shortage of full time positions.
good,"Fun workplace, great team efforts.  People at the top do not share the financial rewards with those that are making their business a success.  "
good,Not a bad gig if you're in school and looking for a part time job. They'll work around your schedule to make it easier for you to come to work. Only thing that sucks is the pay.
good,I’ve been at fastenal for two years and I had to work my butt off to be a part time lead. Fastenal’s human resource department is one-sided. You aren’t treated like an adult rarely a human being. Raises are foreign.
good,"Overall great place to work with awesome benefit. When it comes to who they want to keep around for the long run can be quite political based off of ""how cool"" or ""who you know"" basis."
good,really great place to work for trucks where loaded and ready for delivery the next morning ready for you to pull out and make your delivers and always had access to all safety equipment to do your job in a safe manner
good,"Fastenal has been in my family my entire life and it has its pros and cons. It is not the company it once was and has become appallingly mis-managed. The tone and how your job will go completely depends on the store you are hired into, there are few set guidlines and managers are allowed to do as they want with their branch. Some are good some are terrible."
good,"If you want to work harder than the man next to you and watch him succeed or train him for management ,this is the company for you. Move in and out of department and/or states, achieve Top Performer in your field only to lose the position at no fault of your own? Then Fastenal is the company for you. Good luck."
good,"This is a perfect place for a college student or someone looking for a P/T job.  The company knows it pays below market but does provide incentive/bonus."
good,taking orders delivering orders around the area. taking inventory. supplying vendors with potential customers to buy cutting edge products. making cash deposits.
good,"We would come into work, talk about the goals that we were trying to meet for the given week, then as the interior sales, lots of inventory on the materials, serving customers, and organization and cleaning."
good,"In charge of way too many aspects of selling, accounting, delivering and everything in-between to be paid less than the industry normal. Corporate changes initiatives too often."
good,Retail store that likes to call it's self by another name. Is an ok job but not fantastic. Sales assistants make an hourly wage that is not much more than minimum wage. Sales guys do much better but it is hard to break into that position without a few years on the floor.
good,"Fastenal was a great company to work for, however management was poor. I quickly learned its not what you know but who you know. I really enjoyed working with the customers and helping them with their product."
good,"Good starting point for sales career.  You will wear a lot of ""hats"" when doing your day to day task.  Worked with great people on a daily basis.  Management seemed discounted at times."
good,"I loved working at our branch with our local staff. The compensation and salary are undesirable to say the least. Benefits are also not the greatest. Management is good in most cases. Everyone is under trained, under paid, over worked, and under appreciated. Just like most places."
good,"Little chance for advancement,  keep your head down and work. Stingy with the hours until they have a period of people quitting ( which always happens) then they overwork you with no benefits for months of 40+ hours."
good,Daily sales.  Workplace culture was good and staff was good.  Poor leadership on the local levels.  Good place to work your way up the ladder if you wish to do so.
good,Not happy with career advancement. Seems biased and i really have been trying to move up in the company but have always been pushed aside. Better opportunities have been given to people to people who do not deserve it.
good,"The company offers good opportunities to learn for individuals who want to further their knowledge. Flexible work hours, though it depends on the team you are in."
good,Fastenal is a good place for part time work but it will be a grind and ur schedule is ever changing and hectic very high turnover.  Decent leadership but overall a lackluster place to work
good,"This was a fine place to work while going to school in Winona, Minnesota. I would say it is probably best to stay away from Large Part Sortation if you care about keeping your body healthy."
good,"Training is limited and advancement opportunities are few and far between.   Not a team oriented atmosphere, more every man for himself.  On the job training needs work."
good,"Great start to learn about the industrial sales world or just sales in general. "
good,"Felt stuck there. Was never compensated for the amount of work I did. No bonuses, box of candy. The upper management was not helpful. Long hours and tried to cut overtime."
good,the management has no concern about the employees only their own job and bonuses. they do not mind asking the best employees to do way more than everyone else while giving them no more compensation or lee way
good,I company can be used to work for a life time i you are around the right people. It is great in training new people and it makes others want you to work with them.
good,Loved working with the owners. they treated everyone eqauly and fair. the pay was not great but it worked with me having babies at home. its more of a side job job extra cash like a second job
good,This was just a part time job that I had in college. I worked in the distribution center doing quality control audits on shipment containers. I was also responsible for logging errors.
good,A lot of busy work. A lot of responsibility for little credit. Always short handed because people would quit because they were unhappy with the working conditions
good,I enjoyed my time at Fastenal but became displeased with lack of advancement opportunities and rewards for tenure and rewards for excelling. At times it was a good company to work for but not a career.
good,Being stuck under poor management can ruin your career with Fastenal. Part timers are cut to 15-20 hours during holiday season. Every day is different so work does not become stagnant.
good,Great Company when Founders where still operating. Loss of Bonuses. Collections come out of commissions. Great School of Business and Leadership.
good,This job solely depends on who is your branch manager and district manager. Overwhelming amount of product to learn about and a lot of training falls on yourself to learn. My manager was helpful at times but wasn't very supportive overall.
good,"Company provides beneficial experiences to help further ones career, but Fastenal as a company does not value employees. High turnover rate for roles due to this lack of employee satisfaction."
good,If you work part time its a good gig but if your are full time its not worth it. You get paid 24000 a year and are expected to do a job that takes over 40 hours in exactly 40 hrs.
good,Good company to work for to learn about  the industry. Pay sucks and the company knows it. They usually try to recruit fresh college graduates because of it.
good,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I have coworkers that trash their area of stock so I have to organize it over and over again. And they bill customers but never deliver the product."
good,"The work schedule was terrific, home every day and weekends. However the managers like to be a little over the top in the way they micro manage everything."
good,Management is mediocre but the job duties for the job are fairly simplistic. The compensation was better than average for college students in a college town.
good,This a great job for your first job out of college.  The pay is mainly commission based so you determine how much you can make.  The hours are Monday-Friday but you might have some long work days if you want to be successful.
good,"Loved my job! Fun, fast paced, good workout. Management on the other hand was a nightmare! They made work unbareable and miserable. Higher ups have no idea what's going on because your manager is doing all your surveys and tells you what to say and you feel like you can't be honest because the source of the problem is in control of who's being told."
good,"Start your day by putting up truck, approving hours for employees, respond to emails and plan your daily route. Scheduling and time management are key to surviving in this business. Depending on the location, you may be put out to fend for yourself and learn the job with little to no guidance."
good,Working in Fastenal is slow as well as boring the store gets about two customers a day and the managers don't train you they expect you to be more of a custodian than anything else
good,Worked part time for Fastenal while in college. After graduating I took a Outside Sales role and loved the interaction with the customers. Enjoyed the challenges and gained knowledge with B2B sales.
good,"Good place to start your career, but not so great for a long lasting career. Pay starts decently, you will be capped off a some point."
good,Establishing relationships directly with customers. It is a growing company with some opportunity for advancement if you're willing to relocate.
good,Fastenal has a unique business model. It has allowed the company to grow at an incredible rate. It' s no debt operations makes is a very stable place to work. Management culture is a little difficult to accept.
good,Not a bad company to start career. Worked and have met some great people at Fastenal. Opportunity to make decent money. Low base salaries. Was promised a lot of things to take the Manager position which have yet to be fulfilled. Upper management needs to be more involved with the branches.
good,"Contact me Personally for a full review."
good,they were a good place to work for if you are just out of college.  if you are an esablished professional then it will be a frustrating experience with lower pay.
good,"This job was a great experience. The hours were very long and rare days off. It was very hard to juggle work and being a single mom with this job. Work was expected to always come before everything else, which made it hard to stay working there with children."
good,"A typical day: Meetings, sales, receiving product, researching product for customers."
good,Days are longer than most jobs. Learned how to manage people effectively. The management is not great. My co-workers were hit and miss in the quality department. There were too many young kids out of college that didn't commit to a career with Fastenal. It was a revolving door of employees. The hardest part of the job was the pay. Best part was the team aspect.
good,"This is not the place for older seasoned drivers. The pay is not sufficient for the job requirements and the job description does not match the job. Tread lightly and document your time and experiences while there, you'll need it. The traffic manager in the KHUB is the only person there with trucking experience."
good,"When construction is slow, so are the commissions. People work hard, but can be cut throat at times."
good,"You might have a great year but don't get used to the decent paychecks...they will go way down next year since your commission is based mostly off of growth and not sales percentage.  Ride the wave because it's up and down and when you average it all out...you are making less then other sales positions out there.  Management is almost always a joke or non-existent...just keep selling, they care about nothing else. Each store is run like a franchise but minimal profits are given for ""running the store like it's your own"".  If it was my store I'd be making 5-8 times the money.  How the store is run and whether it's laid back or a mess is completely up to the General Managers.  One store might be fun and laid back and another might be horrible to work at...all depends on the personality of the GM."
good,very busy work day learned alot about management running a industrial supply store was in management upper management to much corprate politcs.good to work withwor 6 diffrent hatsbest part of thejob was givng customer great sevice and product the they needed.
good,"a typical day at work consists of clocking in and going to your assigned locker to retrieve your work supplies. ( scanner, hip printer, tape gun etc..) and going to set up your cart with ( bags, boxes, extra labels and tape). After you're all set up you login in to your scanner you go to the RF picking menu scan your hip printer and type in the beginning and end locations for the section you are working in. Then you proceed to the location it gives you and scan the part and control number of that particular part and proceed to pick/package it. I learned how to work well within a team oriented environment and it enhanced my communication skills as well. i also learned to operate several machines such as forklifts, scissor lifts and electronic pallet jacks. The management there was alright and while the communication between me and my coworkers was fluid, I cant say the same about management. They were also very bad about doing employee reviews. They consistently seemed to be behind in their paperwork, which caused them to spend more time in the office rather than on the floor supervising.This caused a resentment between the bottom or entry level guys and management because when they were on the floor they would be obviously frustrated about some other aspect of their work yet it would come out in a negative way when interacting with us.This was probably the hardest aspect of my job. not necessarily the job itself but the more often than not negative interaction with management. My coworkers for the most part were excellent. I always had a good working relationship with most of"
good,"A typical day at work involved heavy use of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and other company software applications.  Much of my time was spent in a cubicle with most of my human interaction being done via email or telephone. Unless I was involved with a colleague on a project or a customer/vendor was in the office, I could pretty much just keep to myself.  I learned several complexities of business during my time there.  In distribution, there are several components that go into turning a profit for the company.  Some of these components include the P.O.S. (point of sale) cost, effective and ethical markups, lead times for manufacturing and delivery, the Industrial supplies industry itself, and the human element that inevitably ties all areas of business together. The culture of the company was nice.  My co-workers were easy to get along with and I never had any professional or personal problems with any of them.  The management of the company was mediocre at best.  Of course, as in most organizations, you have good managers and not so good managers.  My direct supervisor was excellent in the way he went about managing my department, but the company was less than impressive when it came to effective communication and getting the necessary information to the right people in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job was being confined to a cubicle for up to 10 hours a day.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was learning the vast and complex industry and all the products involved, as well as the process of getting those products to the customer.  I also enjoyed being able"
good,"Good first job, commission structure is bad, Management was poor, promotions are easy to come by, a lot of inexperienced help"
good,For a driver job it gets you home consistently but the workload can be very tedious at times and management doesn't make those matters any easier.
good,"Company is one of the fastest growing industrial supply company because one thing, push push push!!"
good,Count and pack orders to be delivered to construction and company sites. Clean and organize warehouse.
good,"- Creating POs, assisting walk-in customers, handling customer calls as well as vendor calls."
good,When I started with Fastenal I was in College. After College I continued my relationship with Fastenal. Fastenal does a good job at recruiting college kids and teaching them about all aspects of business. I had a bad DM when I started there and it put a sour taste in my mouth. I will always look back and appreciate what Fastenal did for me as far as jumpstarting my career in the real world.
good,I have worked for them for over two years. I have done many jobs and Ther longer I stay the more I begin to feel unappreciated. They have given me many chances when I have messed up and they rarely lay people off. They cut everyone's hours instead. The are very reasonable if you are going to school and need accomidations. Full time is very hard to get and the salaries are generally on the low side. You have to wait until a manage quits or gets fired most times.Overall a three because they do not care about their employees enough.
good,"Not a recommended company to work for. Constantly being threatened for job, not worth the headaches, working during most holidays. If you want to be treated badly and not paid what your worth, apply for FASTENAL.The only positive thing I can say is the customers can be great people to meet."
good,Great place to use all your potential as a multi tasker and people skills. Do Not expect to excel though if you are female.
good,"This company expects a lot from its employees, but pay is not very good. The hours are very long, and you never get the tools needed to truly complete your job."
good,"That they are a part time hiring company. very flexible, no benifts unless a full time employee. consistantly picking orders to meet customer demands. Must pick so many orders an hour to meet demands for departing trucks."
good,"Unloading the boxes off the conveyors and scanning them out is easy and simple as long as you keep a steady pace, Fastenal isn't half bad the management could be better."
good,You need to really be into tools and care about nuts and bolts to like working at this job. Like to help customers and being on the phone . Being polite when customers are rude to the point of discrimination.
good,Overall I am grateful for the opportunity to pursue a career with Fastenal. However due to a change in the current market and miscues due to executive management the company has taken a turn
good,"Management only cares about numbers. They do not let the sellers sell, but instead have them spend most of the day stocking vending machines and delivering products. Working Monday-Friday is a huge plus but benefits are middle of the road. There is room for advancement if you want to go through sales. If you are not the sales type STAY AWAY!!! Fastenal only focuses on sales minded individuals before considering promotion."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company.  "
good,Fastenal is a fast paced dynamic industrial sales company with a strong focus on sales growth. Hard workers are easily promoted for exceeding expectations.
good,"This would not be a bad place to work, except the employee turnover doesn't help.  There is also inconsistencies in the purchasing from the corporate level.  One week you could be caught up and everything could be well and good.  The next week you could be behind without any warning."
good,"I enjoyed the freedom to move about the warehouse,self starting self motived and work independently. Also the camaraderie of my fellow co workers was a great aspect and made going to work enjoyable."
good,Fastenal is a great place to work and gain sales experience. Many sales jobs require some sort of sales experience where Fastenal does not. Only issue I have found about working here is your pay does not always make sense and I feel like they expected a lot out of you for as low as the pay is.
good,"Sales at Fastenal is a grind. You get out what you put in. With that being said, there is a lot of competition Especially if your in a large market. The long hours and pressure to hit sales goals can make for a stressful work environment. With that being said it is a great place to gain experience because of all the hats you where as a OSR."
good,"I would recommend anyone to start their career here. However, based on my experience within my department I would not recommend staying here for very long. I found the culture to be very dry and somewhat negative. Not a lot of interactions outside of your cubical which you spent practically 8 hours in a day, so it can get long. I didn't find the culture to be what the company makes it out to be, so I was a little disappointed with that. I met a lot of people that loved their job at Fastenal, but they were in a completely different department than me."
good,Consistently pushing for more and more. Each month is a scramble to reach goal and then the next month its the same thing all over again. There is no end.
good,"Workplace culture is made up of people who dont want to be there, and leave the slack to be made up by the other workers. Management avoids turnover at all costs and keeps people who dont fit the job well or lack the qualities and skills to be successful in this industry. Customers are easy to work with for the most part."
good,"Job security is good.   Pay is good.   Expectations and benefits are not."
good,Very grateful for everything I have learned and the opportunities provided with this company. Would recommend a starting position to anyone. Loved working with my customers and growing business relationships.
good,Have to be very motivated in sales to survive.  If you aren't you'll get left behind to fend for yourself.  Not all jobs are equal. The interactions with the customers were things I always enjoyed.
good,Seasoned professionals stay away. Compensation and benefits are sub-par. Good for a kid straight out of college needing to get some experience under his belt.
good,"The work was very easy. Unload products, stock inventory, clean, run the cash register, help customers, answer phone calls, package orders, delver products."
good,A fair company to work for but believe more in part-time and they try to  keep full time employee down.This is the most I have to say about this. Fasternal is more of a part time with no benefits and they work to keep their full time personnel down to  a minum.
good,"Fast paced and diverse.  Sales and goal driven. Managers have the hardest job to be successful.  Many different jobs to do, one would never be bored. Can be a lot of fun, working with others as a team."
good,A veces el ambiente de trabajo tan relajado con el que cuentan repercute en la eficiencia de las operaciones.
good,"Fastenal is a good place to work for advancement.  However, salary and commission structure is low when you compare it to other companies in the same category.  Management at local level is lacking."
good,I like Fastenal and everything they have done for me as a company. But all in all they are not a career advancement opportunity. Start here for sure but not really room to move around and I’m my opinion a lot of selective promotions.
good,There are various positions at this company.  Store locations need employees and truck drivers to deliver the products to the stores in a timely manner.  It is beneficial to have forklift experience and certification.  You must have a CDL-A license to drive trucks.  It is a learning experience if you are starting in the truck driving industry.
good,As a product handler you are required to be trained and licenced to use a fork lift (They do training there). You move product from the overstocks and put them in the primaries. You normally lift things between 30-60 lbs.
good,"Decent company to work for. only if you have the right manager and district manager, lack of communication and no one listens to you. You can always count on someone yelling at you or telling you that your never doing good enough"
good,I really enjoyed working with people directly. I would show up at 6am and start filling orders that had to be sent out for the day.  My least favorite part was there was no structure to it.  Although i was in charge of filling orders i there were multiple people that would try to help and would complicate things
good,My boss is the farthest thing from a leader. He's always yelling about the smallest thing and is childish with calling you out in the work group chat. He's a stickler times twelve.
good,Here at Fastenal you are required to meet specific numbers each week in sales. If these numbers are not met you could face the possibility of losing your job. Long days were worked even though it was a salary job and the pay hardly seemed worth it.
good,At Fastenal employees are able to make decisions without having to get approval by corporate. We have the ability open new accounts and determine pricing terms.
good,The building I worked in was falling apart (literally) and did not have working AC or heat. Management did not seem to care about the working conditions for their employees.
good,"Fastenal Is A Great Place To Work, Especially If You're Planning On Furthering Your Career In The Construction Field. It's Laid Back, Friendly Environment."
good,"Good work experience. Covers a lot of different aspects of business."
good,I think Fastenal is a great company but it could definitely pay more considering the amount of work and responsibility that is placed on the employee.
good,"Good starter career, but not the best for a lifelong career due to how little they pay their employees who are salary and work 50+ hours a week."
good,"This is a great company to start with, but the commission/benefits are sub-par and do not encourage loyalty. This company has a high turnover rate. I do not intend to stay for much longer."
good,"It's not a bad job if you like mindless work. Very flexible hours which is great for college students. Pretty much the same thing every day, loading and unloading shipping containers, move boxes weighing between 5 and 40 pounds, sometimes more. Not much skill or knowledge required although you will memorize the location of 140+ shipping containers by only reading a 5 letter code for the store."
good,Great employment for new job experience or part time labor. Management tries their best to do a good job however the company commonly hires under qualified management without proper training.
good,"Management is nice and treats you with respect. Hard work, heavy lifting 13 hr days/ 4 days a week. Work in any weather. Stores you deliver to are not in safe parts of town. And you deliver from 12:00 am to 7 am. Good Equipment."
good,"The workplace itself was actually pretty nice.  Management was fair, and the workload was busy enough to make it decent.  However, the chance for advancement seemed minimal at best.  District and Regional Managers are stingy with promotions, even with recommendations from general manager."
good,"No time is given for in depth training, and accessibility to the necessary information to do my job effectively is minimal. There is miscommunication and learning my position has been series of trial and error."
good,"Great people to work with, a family atmosphere. the pay was not the greatest but its a great place to develop the experience. many of the higher ups look to help you develop and seem to go out of their way to mentor you."
good,"Job title is outside sales representative but they expect you to do much more. The hours are not good and the amount of responsibility you have is not worth what you get paid,"
good,Good for a part time job very hard to get into for full time great starting pay for highschoolers friendly environment yeah
good,I can see some taking a job with them if you just out of high school but for someone who older 9.00 is nothing also you have to pay for your own DMV recorder lame. I would pass unless your looking for a job right out of high school.
good,"Very good place to learn the basics of industrial sales. Training program to be one of the best. Enjoyed getting out and making new contacts with prospective customers.  "
good,At Fastenal I would take and deliver tool and hardware orders to clients. I learned customer service and how to anticipate my clients needs. Management and coworkers had a high turn over rate. Hardest part of the job was meeting a large amount of clients timelines. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients meet their goals.
good,"Drastically varying management philosophies. Was fortunate enough to work under a Direct who show genuine concern and interest in personal growth and career advancement."
good,"After a year of learning how to be a sales rep you either will know you like it or don't. I advise that at that time you either make a decision: leave and find another sales job paying more, leave and find another job, or start applying for other positions inside fastenal. sales reps are treated like slaves and every year it seems they find new ways to take more money out of your commission check"
good,I worked at two different branches with this company.  The management makes or breaks the enjoyment of the job.  Structured like most larger corporate cultures.  I feel like the leaders in the company are very disconnected with store operations and have expectations that in many situations are unrealistic unless you put in hours a week of extra (Sales reps. work 50 hours as is) and are on salary.  I am gaining tons of relevant work experience that will help me in getting jobs down the road.  Good job for someone just out of College or trying to get into the world of sales.
good,"The job is okay long hours though about 10 hour days. Pretty much just check in the truck, get your orders ready, and go on about your day Monday through Friday. Management is a hit or miss depends on you have."
good,"Atypical day at work for me would be operating a forklift for around 3-5 hours. Moving products around to a specific destination and placing the items on conveyor belts. The management was very unstable continuously had a new manager never had a set manager. My coworkers are awesome best group of guys i worked with by far. The hardest part of the job would definitely have been the switch truck. Most enjoyable part is lunch break, because depending on how well performed our supervisor provided lunch for us."
good,"Good place to start if you want to get into business."
good,"I learned and grew a lot as an individual during my tenure at Fastenal. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I worked, there was no opportunity for upward growth. I was promoted several times and moved from position to position, which allowed me to develop new skills in a variety of business areas and departments. Sadly, the work that was put into the business was not supplemented with balanced compensation. "
good,I would put bolt packs together for a company.  I would get orders ready for delivery and take them to the delivery site. Help with customers when they came in to the store.
good,"Good place to work if you're looking for part time employment. Advancement opportunities are plenty, constant turnover due to 90 percent part time staff."
good,Fine company for young go getters. Hours are long. High turn over.
good,"7am-5pm Monday through Friday."
good,"This company used to have a good program to move up.  I started out part time and was expecting to move up.  The cut part timers hours across the board for the slow season, but then didn't increase them.  The district manager was closed minded and said I wouldn't make it in sales.  At that point, I decided to move on because I knew he wouldn't promote me."
good,Diverse industrial supplier with ambitious growth objectives. Lots of new positions and sales locations being developed.
good,"I get in to my branch at 7am to open our doors to the public and local customers. I begin by reviewing the previous days sales results and establish a plan of achieving a daily sales goal. I discuss with my team of outside salesmen what their target accounts for the day will be, and charge them with the task of meeting a goal with which to strive for. It also helps to have encourage rivalry of internal competition, to promote initiative and success."
good,"This company is very caring and goes the extra length to meet the customers needs. They can be a little pricey, but you are paying for more than the item, your paying for the customer service that comes with it. Fastenal is a very good company to work for."
good,"learned inventory skills and product knowledge, liked the people i worked with."
good,mon-fri so that's always awesome pay isn't good part time but makes up for the time given to spent with family.
good,The pay is great but an opportunity for advancement is not likely. But they will add more duties for you to do...with the same pay. Unappreciated.
good,My typical day include me printing up a restock report every morning. Then I use several different forklifts to build restock pallets to replenish the inventory on the shelves all while checking an correcting inventory qty.
good,Responsible for all daily operations.
good,Standing still in one place all day but you can always get hours. Hire you in as part time so they don't have to give you insurance but want you to work full time hours.
good,"Typically the day began by recieving in the truck from the previous days orders and preparing them for distribution to the various customers. Loading trucks and delievering the merchandise. All the while working with walk in customers and sourcing merchandise. There was a lot of multi-tasking going on during the course of a day. Waitng on walk in customers, merchandise sourcing speciality componets and the like. I learned a variety of new terms and applications for various tools along with the severity of locating items within a specific criteria and variences. I enjoyed working with my co-workers we shared a work ethic that kept the shop up beat and indiviually motivated."
good,Fun environment with family standards. You work hard but get well compensated for it
good,I will never go back to this company. They do not take in consideration that you have more going on then them. I lost a lot with them and will never go back to this company.
good,"I worked very hard and doing all the training necessary to become successful. I was offered a position of advancement at another store and accepted, only to be told I no longer had a job three months later."
good,"Good place to work, I enjoyed my job and meeting the people in the companies that I traveled to in the area. I had 75 accounts that I was responsible for and made a lot of good contacts and friends in the area."
good,This industry is hard for women because of the customer base not the company. Fastenal has wonderful people working for them but they were not flexible with a school schedule
good,A good place to work to develop sales skills to take with you and go elsewhere. Overall a decent place to work with plenty of advancement opportunity due to the high rate of turnover
good,Great Place to learn civilian sales. If you cannot work independently you have no business applying. I would recommend this company if you have domain knowledge in construction or a specific industry.
good,"Fastenal had an interesting work culture where a customer might enter without a clue of what they wish to purchase, and leave in a rage because you had never heard of an item they dreamed into existence."
good,great place to work. the entire staff across NA work as a team although also compete is sales competitions. Job can become repetitive. great place for someone looking for a stable job.
good,"I worked at Fastenal for eight years during my college career and couldn't be happier to move on from that. Early on it was made clear to me that the only option for growth from the part time sales associate position would be to go into Outside Sales. While this can be fine for several employees, it wasn't the path I wanted to follow. Nothing ever came my way when it came to moving or growing within the company because I wasn't trying to be an Outside Salesperson. Eventually, in my last year there, I was trained on inventory management, but it was more of a project position rather than a permanent position. I got training and additional hours to do the job, but no pay raise. Only slightly reimbursed for mileage.  It might be an okay stepping stone to build experience in Sales, but if you're looking for anything else. I can't recommend it."
good,"Fastenal is a good company to start at if you wish to work in outside sales. Fastenal is not your typical work environment. It is much more casual, as far as language goes, since you work with industrial/construction workers."
good,Long 10 hour days and salaried for 40 hour weeks.  Expected to do everything in the branch with little help. Goals and margin expectations are usually unrealistic in most areas.
good,Fastenal was a great first experience for a stocking job. I learned some things that helped me get another job that I’m actually still at . Fastenal is very fair working.
good,"Fastenal's core values are really good, when they are followed. The downside is that you inherit the last Outside sales associates route, good or bad. You are paid based on that route or docked in pay for said route."
good,"good place to work"
good,The job is great!  Nice working environment. People are very nice. Fastenal is a good place to work as a part time job. I wish they had a full time jobs.
good,"For a beginner its okay, but for long term it will  not be a right choice if you are thinking of a well paid job and you cant expect  good pay unless you are super efficient"
good,"They hire you as a temp, but you work 8 or more hours a day. Ending time increase all the time. No benefits. You work your butt off. Leads are lazy, I love to pick and pack but give me benefits. Don't tell me I'm working part time and I am working over 8 hours a day so you can save money on benefits. I like working for a company that treats their employees fairly. And they don't. The leads are lazy they will call you down stairs 3 flights of stairs to pick up an order, they wait till you get up their and then page you. They won't don't bring the orders to you. I enjoyed the work, I could have went permenent but I would lose $2.00 an hour. Go figure."
good,"A typical day at work is account management that would include traveling from business to business maintaining accounts. Inventory management, client relations."
good,"I have not worked here in over ten years so I cannot accurately review this place; however, I'm being forced to do so. It was a great part time job while in college."
good,"Fastenal does train you well and it was not a bad company to work for, but a lot of hours and if you want to move up you better hope the DM likes you. and if you mess up once you are gone."
good,"I have a wonderful manager to work for but lack if communication an dsome other factors that make the job frustrating. "
good,This company is all about themselves. I believe they only want to drive profits but not reward their employees for exceeding expectations. They work on skeleton crews and have too much work for the employees to accomplish in a timely manner.
good,"Scanning products for delivery, DOT inspections pre and post trips."
good,Fastenal was a good company for introducing young people to the work force. The provided good training and decent career path for those that liked the industry.
good,I have worked at Fastenal for 7 years and it is a great company to learn how to run a business. The work environment is good and the more effort that is placed in your job the more it can benefit you.
good,Fastenal was a good company for a first time sales job. They train you on how to sell and interact with clients. You are exposed to many types of the businesses.
good,"This was a pretty straight forward sales position. Manage your accounts, keep the customer happy and grow sales. Only thing is they weren't priced competitively so getting new sales was dependent on your ability to sell yourself and your service."
good,"dumbest place on earth, tries anyone for manger really boring, make you pay for everything, doesn't compensate medical leave, no training program and sucks"
good,"A good professional enviorment. The size of the company makes it easy to feel like just a number and not a employee. The company did a good job at consistently showing appreciation, but consistent was the only positive thing you can say about the appreciation."
good,"Good company, could use better management.  Not enough one on one training, however 13 dollars and hour for part timers, 17 an hour for full timers plus bonuses.  Easy work as long as your not lazy."
good,"This job is perfect for college students looking to get more experience within a retail environment. Advancements are possible but heavily sales focused. Pay isn't great but hours are flexible depending on store staffing. As with any retail environment, customers can be irritating. Helps embrace skills in sales, customer relationship management, supply chain management and helps you understand the importance of profit margin."
good,"Making sure every pallet is clear from both lines and being toted. If anything was going wrong, you would have to contact a manager or lead to overlook the problem"
good,"I was employed here briefly during the last recession.  Hours for part-time employees were heavily limited then, so I cannot attest to their current policies."
good,The work was fast paced and the the workplace was a friendly environment as well as having room to advance in the company for growth. Management worked around your schedule in return for better production.
good,Great job for college students and recent college graduates. Good track to growth from within the company. Hardest part of the job is getting past the initial part time position.
good,I got my start here. I'm thankful that Fastenal was able to give me a chance to start in the IT Industry. The people were pretty cool. Job was fairly easy
good,"Good successful company. Seems that the more you did, the more it wasn’t enough to them. If you start hitting goals and making too much, then they change your pay structure."
good,"Very expensive, with schemes to be more profitable. Pricing decisions made by district managers."
good,"Long hard days."
good,Fast paced work environment with a lot to learn but pay is low. Management could be better and held to a higher standard. This company does not give out yearly reviews for pay increases.
good,"""Growth through customer service"" is the mission statement. The company is severely understaffed, so customer relations can be negatively impacted. Management often fails to support their employees."
good,"Willing to train, good pay, fun environment, good hours. Coworkers are a lot of fun. Can be overwhelming at times when numbers aren't hit or when customers are demanding."
good,My manager was all around just not built for running that branch. He had a confrontation issue and hated talking to employees about issues. Other then that my other team members were great to work with. The pay made it worth staying with the company for as long as  I did.
good,"Not good, the company runs on part-time employment. Early start times. The trucks provided were in good shape. A great place to work if you enjoy driving and working in a warehouse."
good,Fastenal can be great or not depending on who you are working with and where you are the experience can drastically change. Why would you give me a minimum on a box I'm required to type?
good,"Fastenal is a great place for full-time students to make a pretty decent wage. It's physically demanding, but if that's your thing, then apply now! "
good,Great position to learn about sales. Lot of support from the company on expanding your knowledge of the business by providing trainings. The trainings also help with your overall performance.
good,"Stable company that pays fair wages but lacks incentives for part time employees.  With that said, I've learned tremendously in terms of supply chain and inventory controls over the 2 plus years I've worked for them."
good,"This company has all of the makings of one that could be successful for years to come, but a lack of direction and weak leadership at the top has lead to the future of this company being uncertain."
good,I really liked working at Fastenal.   Structure and policies were fair considering the size of the company.  Local management is awful.  Branch & district both.
good,"This is a good job to have when you are in high school, not something that is enough to support am adult helping to take care of a family. Not a whole lot of hours.1"
good,Worked at this company too many years ago to know how they operate today.  There was room for advancement within the company.  They treated their management staff well.
good,A typical day on the job is a 10 hour day.  I have learned a great deal about industrial & construction materials & supplies.  The management is very poor.  The culture of the workplace is is extremely difficult at times because you mostly work with people with a lack of experience & who are mostly working at a place for the first time.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with a cut-throat environment & dealing with poor management........a lot is put on your shoulders.  The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing & talking with my customers.  I have established great relationships which is very rewarding.  Another enjoyable part is the freedom to work as your own boss most of the time.
good,Fastenal was a job I had in years passed  it is an exciting fast paced go go go job. You develop relationships with customers win their trust and keep the business.
good,"It was my first job out of school and was a good place to start. There is room for advancement when you first get hired but good pay, raises, and company advancement comes few and far between."
good,"Fastenal took over a company called Fastners.  This transition was very organized, and took longer than it should have taken.  This caused stressed with customers getting the right parts."
good,"Learned a great deal about the products, had excellent training and worked with great people at our store. The environment was fast paced and busy due to the customer base. Met a lot of interesting people and learned a great deal about an industry that was previously of my scope."
good,"7-5 job. No weekends. Good money. If you had a good team to work with, work was fun. If your stuck with lazy people your store numbers would show it. W"
good,"Good place to start a career or to get experience. I've worked here for a year and now have full time and health care. Management is okay, but the turnover in my particular location is kind of high."
good,As a picker my job was to up or down the floor of warehouse to get products that rf gun told me to pick and which floor they were in.  some products need to be counted packed in box. some products needed to be weighed and then put in box was a hard job that revolve concentration and focus.
good,Great job for young fellas to understand supply chain and warehousing. Received my forklift operating license and learned about specific parts in manufacturing.
good,"Decent Job to work at, very fast paced environment, had to get certain deliveries done, if not the customers would get upset and angry, pretty much left on your own certain days, undertrained."
good,"The Fastenal team was a great experience as it allowed my to gather experience in a wealth of different areas. With my desire to go into the logistical field Fastenal provided me with some experience in shipping, receiving, ordering, scheduling and 3pl/freight. With Fastenals reach up into Canada it is possible to have some experience in importing/exporting duties. "
good,The pay could be better. The commission is not great and if you would like to move up in the company it would be hard to advance. The job is not hard but you do alot of extra work that you don't get paid for.
good,A typical day at Fastenal required the truck to be received everyday. You had a list of at least 20 people you had to make sales calls to everyday. The hardest part of the job is not being able to see the 20 different customers everyday. The best part is seeing them and getting them what they need.
good,"I enjoyed working here, I learned a lot about how industrial supply works. I had the opportunity to learn many different things, like how to be a much more efficient  worker and how to properly deal with customers. The work was hard, dirty, and rewarding. the pay wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. If you disagree on how the way they do things, show them why your way is better and prove it or you wont get your way. Just be on time and productive and you wont have to worry about losing your job"
good,"Company was good, coworkers were very friendly, job just simply wasn't right for my wife and I. Not a lot of home time, less home time than was pitched tome."
good,Overall the management team is weak and sales philosophy is managed inventory only. Members are very clicky and not open to progress. There is nothing more to add.
good,Fastenal offers a lot of responsibility and opportunity to those who are able and willing.  Up to the point of being a General Manager.  There are a lot of great people to work around but sometimes the bar is set a little low due to the fast pace and lower tiered salary system.
good,"Fun place to work. Very fast paced, and can be very stressful at times. The hiring process if quick.  A lot of individual online training is provided.  There is a lot to learn, but almost everyone starts out as a part time associate."
good,"Must keep your eyes on the prize. Regardless if the job is temporary or planning to retire there, don't allow the stress to cause you to crass and burn. Study all information available, practice your duties, understand your roles, and ask for help when needed, keep a positive attitude and you will go far."
good,"has given me experience on storage management, sales, costumer service, shipping and receiving,construction sales, good part time  and full time job for anybody."
good,"Runs a very small crew with little training, more of a unskilled temporary company unless you plan to transfer around the USA.  High turnover rate, mainly young college kids place to work"
good,Same job everyday got to be boring.  People were ok.  Management was ok.  Good stepping stone and learning experience.  Time to move on to next opportunity..
good,Take care of the customers and they will come back.  You make your money off of being a service sales man.  Price does't always win.  Its all about the relationship you share with you customer.
good,i worked there a longtime ago and cannot give a fair assessment on how things are there today.  Sorry i will say that they have grown quite well after my departure
good,Good company just does not pay for the amout of work you do. flexible on hours if needed . Plenty of opportunity to move up but not always for the right reasons
good,Great place to learn sales culture and organization. Good place to start your career in sales or a management field. Great at building a strong work ethic.
good,Great work place good stuff to work with . Gave me the opportunity to become a manager to hire new empolyees organize work schedules  and plan delivery routes. Hardest part of the job is managing students who are not 100% dedicated to workplace being so young and uncertain with there career. Fastenal very Understanding and flexible with my kids  school schedule . Great job security but unfortunately no room to advance to better your future .
good,"good place to work, commitment to excellence good managers and work staff. I enjoyed working in the product handling department and also the receiving department as a fill in."
good,"It was great and I would have stayed, if they had better management and if upper management would listen to ideas to help improve business. I feel as a whole the company should listen and take in consideration what their employers are saying."
good,"good place to get professional and sales experience"
good,"Typical warehouse work. Left due to expansion taking precedence over promised raises and advancement. The people were great, but corporate is out of touch with the warehouse."
good,"-Some days we're slow and some days we're busy."
good,nice place to work. great pay. and loved my hours and the people that worked with. hard working place but laid back environment. good place to work if you like helping people.
good,Good place to gain experience before moving on for better pay. Great co-workers. Good support from distribution centers and support services. Upper management seems disengaged.
good,Well established industrial and construction  supply company that gives you many opportunities to grow and build your career through sales and management in various capacities.
good,Company with a lot of potential and opportunity for someone desiring a sales position. Benefits are average. Health care expensive and 401k option available. Outside sales rep position is what you make of it. Established customers are fairly loyal but there is a lot of competition. Having growth is really the only way to earn fair compensation.
good,It's like any other warehouse. Same type of environment people working hard on and off machines .If u dont like to work hard this is not the job for u
good,"Good College job"
good,decient place to work. fast paced hard work but decent pay. was a good place to work while attending trade school. accommodated time for class and trips home.
good,fastenal is a decent place to work if you really dont want to move up anywhere they like you in the low positions so they dont have to pay much because thats not good
good,I worked as a intern. I was told that this was going to be a sales position but all I did was make kits and send them to companies in the nearby area.
good,The only reason I continue to work here is that they have very flexible scheduling.  Everyone is seen as replaceable and you don't get paid for the work you do. Employees who work their butts off get paid the same as the ones who stand there on their phone. They don't have much appreciation for their employees. Management is friendly but aren't strict enough.
good,A wonderful place to work right out of college. A very young company where people want to balance work and play no problem but the job always come first.
good,Lot of driven people who try their best to help you succeed. Your attitude and hard-work directly reflect how quickly you can move throughout the company.
good,I worked here for over 4 years its an okay place to work has job security but they don't pay well always changing commission pay program which always hurt the paycheck in some way
good,"•	Managed client conversions to Applied System’s EPIC insurance management software from various source systems including TAM, INSTAR and VISION."
good,I entered this job no absolutely nothing about industrial sales and the products Fastenal sells.  Fastenal does a great job training inexperienced workers.  I gained a lot of valuable experience.
good,I am at a implant branch and spend my whole day on plant working with the customer. Cant complain. I only work sixteen hours a week right now because I am a senior in college still.
good,Just a average store associate sitting in a industrial store answering phones.  The opportunities are there to advance but you need to work hard and meet deadlines.
good,"The warehouse is good for what it is ..a part time paycheck, high turnover but if you stay on task it's not hard to stay on. Decent pay but you'll never end end up with much more than you start at regardless of performance."
good,"When I first started working at Fastenal, everything was fine. I am a part time employee. Over time, corporate started cutting hours for everybody, including full time and salary wage people. I just don't think it's a place you would want to be, long term."
good,"fast-paced, hot, depending on season work can be hard or easy. great people, good vacation policy. hardest part is working with people or other departments who don't treat the job as a job."
good,"Great company to work for if you have an entrepreneurial spirit and willing to put the hours in for little to no recognition.  Upper management is disconnected from the people who are working the hardest to make the company money at the 2,700 store locations."
good,"A great work program for students interdiction to the workplace. Learn about how to work with others, make resumes, & job interviews. It was great am glad I did it."
good,"I performed helpdesk related work using company's databases, I provided customer service to branches, data entry, criticle thinking, I also worked in the warehouse pulling orders."
good,"Fastenal has flexible scheduling, allows casual dress, and has a good benefits package. They focus on promotion from within."
good,I have been with the company for awhile now and there mato is do more with less.  Everything is chaotic all the time because of people not being able to be on the same page because of everyone being part-time. How can you manage and see a project all the way through when you are only allotted 28-18hrs. a week!? This job is good for parents maybe getting back into something as their children go back to school. Don't expect to make a living at it though.
good,"- all employees where a pleasure to work with"
good,Good company to start out in management and sales for young businessmen and women right out of college. On a daily basis you will be challenged in multiple different areas of business.
good,"The store employees were great, little room for advancement, without relocating. I was offered a promotion, but my DM quit, so it never happened. A very laid back place to work, with little requirements and pretty slack attitude (at my store at least)."
good,"Fastenal is constantly chasing its tail as it tries to cater to investors and forgets where they have found so much success.  The company is always pushing the latest and greatest initiative while ignoring major flaws in it's business structure.  Overall the company gives good training and gives you freedom to manage your accounts, but falls short on salary and commission.  Fastenal will continue to compete in the industrial market, but the growth is slowed by the misdirected effort."
good,"Fastenal is okay to work for, if you like lower than average pay for similar positions in the job field. I would not work for Fastenal ever again in the future though."
good,"Good company to work for with growth and plenty of advancement opportunities. A typical day is checking in freight, getting sales rote plotted and capitalizing on sales leads."
good,"Putting up stock, making quotes. invoicing things out, doing cycle counts, making deliveries in company truck. answering emails and the telephone."
good,"Company experiences will vary wildly based on how well you get along with your Branch manager and other team members. Store employment experiences are generally positive, the work is different, and tends to lack routine, but one bad egg can ruin the whole experience."
good,Good position for college students in the area. This company is very flexible when it comes to working your hours around your school schedule.
good,Its a decent company except they have odd business practices that did not sit very well with me its good job for the time being but Ifeel as though if your not looking for longevity you should find something else
good,Fastenal is a good place to work as long as you can handle non stop working and moving. Co-workers are good to work with and for the most part they know what their doing.
good,"Work by yourself, General Manager and Sales Associate are out all day. The ability to learn a lot, but also limited. Learning new task is difficult depending on manager and expectation. Overall it's the employee overall morales on the company. The company usually have a fast turnover and burnout from their employees, because the work load put upon these employees with no support. If your lucky your branch would either have 4 worker depending on your store growth and sales."
good,Great place to learn how to run a business. Their school of business is amazing I learned a lot. work experiences have been a ton of fun.
good,Fastenal is not a bad place to work for young career individuals. Salary has much to be desired with the amount of work/time you put into it.
good,Good work Envirnoment. Wonderful staff. Would continue to work for them but am moving. Not much room to grow unless you're willing to relocate to where there is positions available.
good,"A typical day at work involved pulling product to fill customer orders, taking care of in store customers and running product to a customers location. Inventory maintenance was a constant need as everything needs to be accounted for and easily found in the store."
good,It is just a part time job. No job security and o benefits offered. Just an in between job. Easy work and the pay was okay. Not a career move unless you know someone higher up within the company.
good,This location is currently closed but I would recommend any Fastenal environment to anyone. Management was great and I made $13.00 an hour.
good,"great co-workers, job is repetitive, sometime stressful, overall a good place to work for entry level workers fresh from school- long term sales development opportunities"
good,Work will mostly students who spend their time walking around and not working much.  Management is super relaxed.  Not much structure
good,Fastenal is a good company to get your feet wet in sales.  The pay scale is set up to you get paid well when you introduce new growth for the company but then way back if you are just maintaining.  You are given a small territory so it is easy to get tapped out in your given market.
good,"This company provides excellent sales training.  They are fairly demanding which is fine, but the compensation is light."
good,Fun place to work at and supportive management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"Answer Phones, Input information into Computer, work with several different screens at one time. Send out fax/emails. The hardest part of the job is being able to sometimes not meet my goals. The most enjoyable part is being on the phone"
good,"I started working as an assistant manager for Fastenal but moved on to a new position that was created for me in the largest branch. I oversaw everything from sales, inventory, to training and hiring staff. Fastenal is a very fast paced environment which I enjoyed. Every day you met new people when you were out on sales calls or customers were dropping in for product. The hardest part of the job was the work load for the amount of hours in a day and the amount of staff you had to work with."
good,I enjoyed working here. The Sales training was a great experience. The pay could have been better. I liked the day to day operations of my job.
good,Provided great training on customer care. Great training program through their Point Of Sales system. Good incentives for all employees.
good,"Fastenal is a great company. However working for them in this role will only be a short term position for most. The pay is low compared to the same position at other companies in the same field. You are placed under high expectations and will work usually 50 hours a week. If you are gifted for it and have a knack for connecting with people, you will have no problems getting promoted to a general management position or an national sales position. If management isn't your goal then get some experience and find a job that actually pays somewhere else."
good,"Fastenal is a great place to work. It's difficult to make upper management happy with your sales, and it's difficult to earn a decent paycheck unless you're a store manager."
good,"Oversee daily deliveries and inventory, processed accounts payable and receivable, organized the store along with cycle counts. Maintained or developed relationships with key accounts collections of invoices past due invoices, controlled purchase orders."
good,"Great place to get experience in outside sales. Not a great place to get rich by selling. I've learned volumes of information regarding construction and manufacturing, how to effectively communicate with all contacts, purchasing negotiation, estimation, supply chain lead times, among many other valuable skills. Good salespeople are rewarded through promotion."
good,"Inventory management, and menial store front tasks. Slow advancement, and false promises about advancement. Average compensation for industry."
good,"Learned how to drive 26 foot straight truck .Help loaded all trucks."
good,"I am currently working there as an agency worker and having to commute there the management is ok but this place is not a very safe place to work, there is so many breach of H&S at work act 1974 laws"
good,Good place to start. Gain experience in all areas of business operations. Lots of freedom to make decisions and run business.
good,"No experience needed, decent training, average at best pay depending on territory, each location differs from the next."
good,enjoyed culture and met alot of great people. looking forward to taking my skills to the next level. Enjoyed meeting new people.
good,This job helped me learn and have a greater knowledge of customer service and fastener applications. You will gain a larger understanding of industrial solutions and the time in which it takes to implement these solutions.
good,"load docks and picker, i learned how to use a forklift, my coworkers are cool. i enjoy the job just looking for a fulltime position."
good,"Typical day:"
good,"Fast paced, sales driven position. Great introduction in learning how to run your own business. You will learn to sell through the people above you instead of utilizing classes. High stress environment to maximize profits for a publically shared company."
good,For those looking to gain experience with industrial sales.  Great entry level sales company. Amazing team to work with.
good,"The structure of the company is solid and the individuals that I work with are great. "
good,Fastenal attempts to use an overall strategy and apply it to all locations/industries it conducts business in. They provide training that attempts to convince their workers of their values rather than create values that employees would be proud to own.
good,"If you need a part time job to get some money, they are an awesome company to work with. They will help fit to your schedule so that you don't have worry about that. You use a computer to fill orders that are sent to you."
good,"Each branch is run as if it is its own company, giving employees freedom to handle individual accounts as they see fit.  Each employee has the buying power and distribution resources of a major corporation while providing customers with personal, strong customer service."
good,"I learned many new skills.  Some skills I learned were: customer service, telecommunications and advanced multitasking.  I enjoyed the people I worked with very much."
good,"Day starts out at 7:30 a.m. and we receive the truck into our system. After that we check all back orders and continue to our Invoice process. After we print the invoices we deliver the product to our customers.  After all the deliveries have been delivered outside sales will make their sales calls.  Sometimes we eat lunch at the store, sometimes it is out on the road. Overall it is a fun day on the road earning business."
good,easy going. had a horrible regional manager. a lot of calling people and getting shot down.
good,"I believe what slowed me down at this job was the fact that I went in with no expectation and no real knowledge of what I was going to be doing from day to day.  I believe I did the best I could with what I was given but I most certainly could have worked harder to learn the individual parts that we sold. I would say that was most certainly the hardest part of this job was that I had no real experience with nuts and bolts and things of that nature before I started, giving me nothing to go from. I enjoyed the environment I worked in and my co-workers were patient with me and helped whenever I needed it. Overtime I most certainly got better with knowing the parts and working more thoroughly."
good,"Fastenal provides a challenge everyday. There is always something new that needs worked on or improved. The atmosphere was a bit hectic, but easy to thrive."
good,My employees and my customers are the most enjoyable part of my job.  A typical day involves making sure product is delivered on time and that my sales people are creating future sales.  I learned how to work at a high pace in a demanding market while still growing accounts.
good,on the road sales was enjoyable an was a gret way to meet new people and see how the companys are run
good,"Learn how to run a business in the industrial sector."
good,I enjoyed and valued my job. I learned a lot of new things and found it a great asset to my knowledge for future employment.
good,This company claims to promote frequently inside of the company from what I have seen and heard they do not.
good,"Run and operated in a decentralized manor when I was working allowed a lot of flexibility and creativity to be successful. It was trying when hiring, training, selling, bookkeeping etc... was an everyday task. It was like running your own business in a lot of ways and over the time I was there the corporate culture started to change and become more aggressive in sales growth, the turnover became substantial in both management and sales force. ''Hire and Promote'' became a theme losing sight of customer needs at times. The push to open more branches became priority and every business conversation started revolving around the investors. I enjoyed the challenges and fast paced world in this market, I would do it again considering the rewards of the business with customers."
good,Lots of down time. But a great start to learning buying position.
good,"There are varieties of duties performed, making it an interesting job and always something to learn"
good,they really need to look at their compensation structure. the main reason why I left there
good,"Make own schedule"
good,You really get to learn all the positions in running a small business. 5 days a week is a good. There are only two people at a location so that can be tough on logistical planning on days but if there is a will there is away.
good,this job would hire you as a part time employee but you would work full time hours
good,"Long days in a dirty environment. I worked with many co-workers. I was able to balance job requirements with minimal equipment available.  Co-workers were difficult to manage due to lack of age/experience.  The long hours after the scheduled day, were hard to maintain motivation. The end of the day and mission accomplished to the managers expectations was very rewarding."
good,"Assisting customers, by proccessing orders and quotes, and create PO's from vendors."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and can get extremely tiresome mentally, especially if you're new. I would try to see 20 to 30 customers a day while also placing orders, sourcing product, delivering product, and receiving product. I learned a lot of critical thinking skills, learned how to manage time to be efficient, and learned how to run a business. Management is very helpful with anything you need. Co-workers vary due to high turnover rate in the company. Every part of the job is difficult and challenging, that's what makes it fun. I enjoy just about everything, but I feel like I can now have a better opportunity to use the skills and knowledge I've gained."
good,Fastenal is a great company that truly cares about their employees knowing the products they sell.  I enjoyed the training that they provided me in sales as well as product knowledge.  I thought they could retain more employees with a better compensation package.
good,"good company, poor continuity in management. That's all I have to say"
good,I was payed to go learn how things are made. In the process I would learn how many of my products were a necessity to the company making things.  And finally I would find out why they weren't buying them from me.
good,All aspects of growing sales and operating my own business.
good,good job but very hard to move up. cut throat environment. hard goals to meet. Last month is last month
good,"Really had fun, just wasnt exactly the place for me. But not a bad place at all."
good,Managment lacks communication. Provides little training but expects a lot. Compensation is extremely mediocre.
good,Pay structure must be revised.  Upper management gets paid too much while they figure out how to take more money out of the pocket of the employees.
good,"A company driven to succeed and open to entrepreneurial ideas, it's a place for young employees to start their sales career."
good,"7:30AM - 5:00PM work days. On the road doing cold calls and growing existing business accounts. I started off in the training program, which is excellent. Got to travel to the main distribution centers and the company headquarters. Management is great. I have learned different sales and marketing techniques, and have been able to show my skills as a sales rep. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am able to plan my day on my own. I make my own schedules and have the freedom to go about how my accounts are managed. The hardest part is that sometimes management loses focus on how to manage employees, which means communication can at times be a struggle. The benefits are also really good. I would just like to find a new position where I can take the next step in my career."
good,"If you like a competitive work environment that keeps you on your toes then this is the job for you. It has room for advancement and a pretty competitive salary. Over all I have nothing horrible to say about this job. A few areas that could use some improvement is in its managerial training, and simply training in general. It often becomes a team effort to solve even the simplest of tasks or problems due to the fact the company doesn't train properly."
good,"received outside sales experience "
good,work hours 6-3 Monday through Friday. A job for a self starter. Hardest part of the job is lifting 50-60 pound boxes above your head to place on shelf. Most enjoyable part is the driving
good,"At first Fastenal was a great company to work for because they set my work schedule around my school schedule. This was a plus because I was able to further my education while working 25-30 hours a week. But over the last year they have put the hammer down and now all part time employees must stay at 25 hours a week no matter what the circumstance is. They ask you to fill in for other people's jobs or they ask you to double the amount of work because they are understaffed and still expect twice the work to get done with the 25 hours a week they give you. It is a great job for students because of the flexibility of scheduling around class schedules. If you are looking for career opportunities, they are there but major relocation may be the only way to move up within the company."
good,"Outside sales"
good,"Fastenal was a good place for me to begin my career fresh out of college.  I was able to learn the basics of the ""real world"" plus become more knowledgeable about both sales and business.  Although small in staff, my coworkers were great.  I'd recommend it to anyone with interest in construction supply and/or sales. "
good,The workplace does not seem to be organized and the people always seem to be under stress waiting to the last minute trying to meet deadlines instead of planning ahead which may be understandable since there is no consistency at Fastenal you just have to do your best to help them meet deadlines stay focus and just remember why you are there.
good,Its an excellent job if you want to be  promoted from within but the pay is not that great.  The ability to run the business as if it was yours is great but constantly changing pay and high turnover
good,Help customers with fasters for major company as well as small business. Fun place to work.
good,"This job allows you to not only gain sales experience, but also learn about a variety of industries by providing supplies to them"
good,poor management and work long hours but u can learn alot the hardest part of the job is driving over night now the pay is good and competitive u go in at 11 and get off around 11 again long houres
good,"Begin the day by checking in inventory... Allocate items to accounts. Load up the delivery driver with orders that is on the route for the day. Take phone orders, call and check on customers. Check in vendor active items, keep track of purchase orders, and invoices"
good,A great place to work and to gain knowledge of the commercial industry.
good,There's a lot to learn and the pay isn't very good. If you've never been in the manufacturing wholesale market there is a HUGE learning curve. Overall it's a good company to work for.
good,"My work day initially as an Asst Mgr started @ 7:00am every morning and sometimes ended late into the evening. I was responsible for establishing new accounts and providing excellent customer service to existing accounts with industrial and construction products within a specific territory. I was eventually promoted to General Manager with only two additional staff members to run a store, make deliveries daily with the use of a company vehicle, and adhere to key accounts based upon order request. I learned how to produce purchase orders and complete Sorbanes Oxley reports each month, along with providing potential customers with strategic assessment reports to establish why they should do business with us versus our competitors. I was given the ability to order specialty products, due to our manufacturing site in Minnesota to meet customer deadlines. I got along well with co-worker's, and met monthly sales quotas at least 85% of the time. The hardest part of the job was expanding my business, given that my territory was cut in half, when a new store was opened less than 10 miles away. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the necessary management skills to operate a store that produce at least $350,000 in sales yearly that yielded a handsome commission check each month."
good,"Repetitive, hard labor. Little chance for advancement. Decent schedule. Management is average."
good,"makeing sales calls, dealing with customer concerns, cold calling. Little direction by the mgmt. Hardest part of the job is understanding expectations. most enjoyable part is working at your own pace"
good,"I learned inventory management, how to take care of multiple customers, and how to operate a Point of Sales System. I made deliveries, and ran the store by myself helping customers and answering phones by myself."
good,"I worked here full time while attending college 18 hours. They did work around my schedule, however there was a lot of heavy lifing and the pay was very little. I learned so many selling skills here the hard way."
good,"Gained experience in many facets of the fastener industry. This included store management, account management, sourcing, and account sales."
good,B2B sales
good,Lots of work for part time inside sales. You pretty much run the entire branch location while osp and manager are out selling.
good,interaction with customers is any everyday thing and you good organizational skills are requied its a fun job
good,"A typical day working at Fastenal is extremely long. The most you learn in one day is a new kind of part for something so extreme most people haven't heard of it. The management is find, my boss was always good to me, letting me have the day off, leaving early for school or coming in late. Co-workers was a joke, the only co-worker I had was my boss. I'm sure that some Fasentals are busier and have more people working there but, the one I worked for didn't. The hardest part of the job was staying awake, and putting the parts in the right place, and knowing what the customer is asking for. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the part right."
good,"I brought parts to Bergstrom daily. I picked and packaged parts at a Fastenal Warehouse; then, I brought them to Bergstrom."
good,"there is a current thing goin on on which part-timers hours are being cut, to cut costs, searching for FULL TIME JOB"
good,"Fastenal is a great company with lots of room for opportunity and growth. A typical day would consist of taking broken power tools from inbound line troubleshooting, diagnosing, and allocating parts needed for repair and testing tool for proper function before closing work order and shipping repaired tools back to customer."
good,"Everyday we would check in our deliveries then put stock away. We printed out our special orders and got those set aside for early delivery. Made sales calls to customers in out territory new and existing, answered phone calls for customer service, placed orders, did inventory to ensure we had the correct counts and that we were always ready for an audit. Every day was very busy and a fast paced enviorment."
good,"Hard work but the pay is decent, hours change drastically therefore u cannot depend on steady income"
good,"After having worked here for almost a year, I have learned alot about different tools and such. However, my opportunites for advancement have been totally nonexistent."
good,"Good Stable company to work for, compensation wise not a lot of upside, it takes more of seizing open opportunities rather than being able to create your own, start from part time to full time"
good,I have been with Fastenal for almost 6 years and I have enjoyed it very much.  It has been filled with ups and downs but there has been many more ups than downs.  My GM and my DM are very understanding and friendly.  They have fought for me and helped me in many ways over the years.  It has been an amazi g experience
good,"Tiene buenas prestaciones y tienes la libertad de poder hacer que Fastenal sea como tu propio negocio. "
good,not a bad place to work. management very strict and kept you working even when there was no work to be done. drive a company truck. normal business hours monday through friday
good,"At conferences I would get to know how other branches were run and my branch was definitely miss managed. I didn't feel like I had the tools or the time to hit sales goals because I was stuck at the branch as the only person working, stocking shelves, and doing reception work when my title was outside sales. If I could have been on the road, doing my deliveries and meeting with costumers more of the time I think I would have done a lot better there."
good,Fastenal was awesome to work for. Got a lot of experience there. Met some cool people going from business to business. Got to see the inside and outs of steel jobs and stuff like that. It is hard work from time to time delivering heavy boxes. The overall training can go a lot better tho. Also would be cool if they offered vision insurance.
good,"Fastenal is a great place to start out working. They will invest a lot of time and money into teaching you how to be a smart business or sales person. However, the pay could be more competitive, and consequently they have a lot of turnover. I've stuck around because I like the people and it is a pretty casual atmosphere."
good,"My biggest pet peeve of this company is their lean staffing approach. It is impossible to be an outside sales rep if you're constantly running the store and dealing with store issues/problems. I don't mind those jobs, but I need to be free from 7-4 every day to go make calls, deliveries, product pick-up, etc... Also, there are more ways to lose than win when it comes to their commission guidelines. The company does, however, invest tons into employee training and there are endless company funded courses to take. That is a major plus. They are through the ""Fastenal School of Business"" and it can be cheesy at times but usually very useful. Even outside the company. The starting salary is very low as well. Should be at least $40,000 a year. That's not that much."
good,great place to work if you're a very active person with lots of energy. Hard to advance in company unless you've been there for years. flexible hours to an extent.
good,"Great company to springboard to larger opportunities. Always allowed for good career advancement, and provided good training to all. Family oreiented."
good,Fastenal is a great company to work for when you are first getting into sales.  On the job training is very good and the pay structure works well for one year
good,Very laid back work place. I love the management. Sometimes the work pace can be very fast and stressful. You can listen to music while you work. The vending machines are amazing.
good,"Customer service and industrial sales provide many learning experiences, but there is an overwhelming amount to learn about the products and the system."
good,"Fastenal is a morally driven, broad picture company which strives to instill within its employers the meaning of integrity and work ethic. As with any company, there are different leadership mindsets which can make or break an employment decision, but I do not regret my time nor the experiences I gained in the company. I went from one city to another within the company, so the work environments were quite different. My latter experience was the most favorable; I had a wonderful boss who was willing to assist and provide guidance every step of the way. It was a wonderful opportunity to grow my skills and exercise my customer service. I would have preferred more opportunities to grow and learn more."
good,"Fastenal’s Pay is terrible. My salary was 2,200. Month. I had to find a new job because it was such a terrible pay rate. The hours and great and you do not work weekends"
good,Management is happy to work with your school schedule. Very physical work which involves lifting product and stacking product unto pallets for hours continuously. Product can range from less than a pound to 70 pounds.
good,Fastenal provides employees with the opportunity to make their own schedule and puts employees in the driver seat for success.  It is up to you to visit and grow customers for future advancement at the company.
good,Learned quite a bit and was provided all the training you could want; however the pay was not the best. Enjoyed most of the people I work/worked with.
good,Company is willing to train anyone. This is a great job for someone looking to potentially start a career but pay is too low for anyone that is already established. They do offer great benefits but 50 hours a week is mandatory even for the Outside Sales reps (salary position). Commission structure will never allow someone to make over $45K for more than one year.
good,Working at Fastenal was fun and not that stressful. Whenever someone on the team needed help there would always someone else to help. The only bad thing I would say is the amount of dust in the air so it would get uncomfortable after a while being in the warehouse.
good,Fastenal is a typical work environment.  Put in your 40 hours a week and work well with your customers.  The workplace can be different sometimes out making sales calls and other times behind a desk.
good,Fastenal is fine for anyone who does not care what they do and is fine with everyday being the exact same as the last. Very mundane job that gets old very fast.
good,Day to day sales. Mornings unloaded inventory truck along with daily held for items. Helped customers with purchasing and problem solving. Delivered and managed account products
good,"sold to existing customers and went to new accounts to try to earn their business. Hours were great, 50 plus hours and nights and most importantly, weekends off"
good,"As a driver, one would work 12-14 hours a day.  The pay was not very good for the number of hours worked.  Inconsistent start times was the biggest issue.  Processes are sketchy for drivers.  Management was easy to get along with and would work right along side you to help the team."
good,Days go by quick but management is difficult and stressful to deal with. Sales driven company so not a laid back environment. The hardest part is being able to manage your time.
good,"Good company to work for, although there is a high turnover rate that makes it difficult to succeed, in area where your reputation has been tarnished."
good,The company reputation and MO precedes them. It a company of the 24 policy. They recruit 24 year olds and pay them 24 thousand a year and these employees stick around for 24 months. The revolving door is very frustrating to store managers and customers alike.
good,"If you are looking to get and idea of sales this is a good place to start. However if you want to make money at sales...this is not the best place for you. Their atmosphere is ok, but they have a lot of young inexperienced mangers that don't know really how to lead a team. Most mangers have only been with the company 3 years or so. They also run their margins at ridiculous levels and that can hamper your ability to get sales. If you are wanting a good foot in the door for sales, Fastenal is for you. It is not really a company to grow with on the store level though."
good,"i can see where working in a warehouse can be fun and rewarding. however,  when the department supervisors are slacking on their jobs, it becomes difficult to want to go to work every day."
good,Making sure that every items is stocked and or on order for stores or customer. Workplace is dusty and over stocked with items and workers. management is not the greatest.
good,"Having been there over a year I spend majority of my time on-site at our main customer. Taking orders, making deliveries, and just keeping overall relations in good standing are just a few of my everyday tasks of the job. Upon arrival back at the store I begin to source product that had been ordered that day and aid in helping walk-in customers. At the end of the day I take out trash, sweep the store, and count cash in the register."
good,"Lots of products to offer customers good environment for growth, strong logistics  system to manage inventory and move products.  Lots of branches smaller sales areas"
good,A typical day at work would consist of invoicing and sourcing parts for customers. Placing orders and taking care of inside store duties as well
good,I started part timr and upon graduation frome college took on full time. I eouldnt call it a career. It does trach you basic business skills. I hated sales and sales goals.A lot of Micromanaging from the DM. Big turnover as well.
good,"Good place to start career."
good,"Fastenal is a good place to work, it gives you experience in building relationships with customers as well as customer service."
good,"I enjoy the job because of the people I meet, but long hours that are beyond the meager salary make no home life. They have stringent guidelines to which items must be sold or you do not earn commission on the product."
good,"Good place to get sales experience. Long hours, low pay. Opportunity to advance. Good co-workers for the most part. If you want to be in sales (which I do not) there are better jobs out there."
good,"I received in depth training from the company about many different construction products. I was in charge of a strong growing territory. I had problems with a General manager who would routinely not follow through, miss work for ""personal"" reasons, and lacked any form of professional decorum."
good,"Worked many hours and very hard for poor pay.  Work at least 50 hours a week and get payed very little.  Each store manager I worked with was very knowledgeable and a great manager, but overall company did not treat employees well."
good,I was a female learning all about nuts and bolts.  All of the men there were extremely helpful and wanted me to lean.  I liked my bosses and they pay was good.
good,"Their compensation is really on the low end for outside sales and their health benefits are some of the worst out there however, their retirement plan is very good. Most locations are Monday thru Friday 7am-5pm which is really nice. Overall their training is very detailed and elaborate, they give you about every tool you could have to learn about your products along with most vendors a phone call away for more information. They have so many avenues for advancement within the company itself, the only frustration is that sometimes there are too many things going on at once and usually causes frustration for your customer. Your greatest strength or weakness is your management structure, that will make or break your time with this company."
good,I worked behind the counter at a busy local branch and had to learn very quickly! was promoted to GM at another store within 1-1/2 years of employment.
good,Nice relaxed environment with steady work flow. Enjoy management trust you to get the job done. Great co-workers. Team environment.
good,"Fastenal is a fair company to work for, the pay is decent starting off. There are few career advancement opportunities, but when one is available the pay is greatly increased."
good,"Low salaries put Fastenal in a corner. The average person that works at Fastenal is 26-27 years of age because at this time, the employees start to figure out that they can work the same amount of hours for more pay."
good,Only advancement is through sales positions. Long work hours. Typically would work from 615am till 5:30 pm. Loved the fast paced environment. If your branch is understaffed it is very easy to become overwhelmed or stressed.
good,I would recommend Fastenal to anyone who wants a career in sales and they don't know where to start.
good,"This is a great job for being out in front of your customers on a daily basis.  It's great to get to know the in's and out's of some large companies that everyone if familiar with.  "
good,"Employed with Fastenal close to three years in positions of Outside Sales Rep, National Account Rep, and General Manager. The training was comprehensive, most of it very useful and industry specific. A lot of investment made in training by the company. Outside Sales Rep training was two weeks at the corporate office. General Manager training was four weeks at the corporate office. Other regional and local sales trainings took place as well as self-directed training at the local level."
good,Upper management is always switching gears. Going down one road today and another tomorrow. The pay/commission sucks for the amount of work and responsibilities you have. But other than that you are at will to do as you please.
good,"I like working here but they expect so much, sometimes it's unrealistic. I love that they close at 5 and are closed on weekends."
good,Company is a good company to work and is a well know for its products.  Pretty good benefits.  Compensation can be good or bad since it is based production. .
good,"If you’re liked, you’ll do well. If you do well, you’ll like your job. Salary is minimal but your commission is what you make it. With any sales jobs, you’ll have good and not so good months."
good,Great place to work on your own as a manager but be prepared to be on an island. Lots of advancement opportunities within the company if willing to relocate
good,I worked here quite some time. I was alone everyday all day inside the store because the other three people I worked with were supposed to be outside of the store all day. I was tasked with doing everything and then getting treated poorly when I couldn’t get everything done
good,I was there on an internship as they were partnered with my college for global supply chain management. I learned nothing pertinent to supply MANAGEMENT but rather how to stock and cycle count a small warehouse. Which is the tiniest facet of the subject there is.
good,"I really enjoy the company and LOVED my job. But don't ever have a family emergency in your first year or get sick in your first year. I think that there is no room for sickness or emergency for new employees and if they work with you during the situation they do not follow through on words after the situation is over. Management is only there if you mess up or work at a branch location, otherwise you do not see or hear from them."
good,I was only summer help however it seemed at some times there was no help needed ad the days went by super slow.  Looking for something to do seemed to happen on the daily.
good,"Fastenal is a global company with salespeople all over the United States, Canada and Mexico. Its is good for helping employees learn the process of selling and interacting with a variety of customers. Mostly male work force but has women in high level positions."
good,"lots of different positions, part time wasn't the best, but the jobs were fun and kept you on your toes. Great time driving around talking to different companies and helping them."
good,Management was usually good. Current manager in Georgetown is excellent. Plenty of room for advancement for hard workers who understand sales. Pay is unattractive until you hit management levels. Make it what you want.
good,"Great company, just not enough room for advancement. I enjoyed working with the branch staff, and I had a great branch manager and great outside sales staff."
good,Fast paced. Poor outside sales support structure. Grossly understaffed. Good benefits. Pay is performance driven. Freedom to run your book of business as you desire.
good,"Fastenal has great culture and resources. It is a great place to learn and hone your skills. "
good,"You'll get out what you put in.  Unlimited opportunities with above average earning potential, but hard work and willingness to roll up your sleeve attitude a must!"
good,"Corporate environment with opportunity for growth, Very flexible with school schedule. Not the industry I want to work in long term. Training methods need improvement."
good,"Great commission opportunities, but not consistent, and generally low salaries. Good people, good customers, slowly seem to have moved towards chasing the almighty buck vs. trusting in new ideas and riding them out."
good,"Lower pay, with very very high turnover.  However if you work hard you can stand out pretty easily and have chances to move up fairly quickly.  Don't regret it"
good,Fastenal was a great place to work in general company wise. Everyday was the same thing got on the phones and helped troubleshoot issues with software
good,"Ok place to work can be fun at times, But they want a lot of work for a little amount of pay. They want to pay you off gross sales but when your doing well already you can milk a dry cow."
good,Worked here while in High School. They allowed for flexible hours which worked around all of my sports and events I had at the time. Although I worked there a short time there was plenty of time for advancement.
good,"The co-workers were good."
good,Fastenal wasn't a bad company to work for. Management could be a little less selfish and they should have tighter reigns on promotions internally.
good,"Hard workers and excellent salesmen will be rewarded in this position with a high emphasis on commission.  Culture of the company is excellent and fosters young employees.  However, must enjoy sales to succeed in position."
good,"Fastenal's business is mostly handled through B2B sales, but a small percentage is done through walk-in customers. With that, one has to be prepared for both at all times to run efficiently. My role has evolved over the years from mostly outside sales and relationship building tasks to more of an inside managerial role. With a growing business you are constantly having to make adjustments in order to make sure things run as smoothly as possible. With 5 part-time employees and 4 outside sales agents (typical store has 4 employees including Manager) we are a fast-paced sales force, which requires dedicated oversight. I have learned many tasks to compliment my sales and presentation expertise such as inventory allocation, inventory adjustments, audits, collections, and maintaining a healthy culture in the workplace. I have enjoyed everything I have learned at Fastenal, just feel like it is time I broaden my horizons elsewhere."
good,"Outside business to business sales."
good,"Most days consist of acquiring new business through cold calling potential customers, meeting with existing customers and growing their business, and managing internal store functions (ex. inventory, purchasing, customer relations.)"
good,A typical day of work is going to customers and calling on customers.  Expanding territory and customer satisfaction.  I learned how torelate to customers in theIndustrial settings.  The management at Fastenal is the worst of it all.  They were not able totrain properly at times and had to adjust to sales on your own.  The hardest part was dealing with pricing and theunwillingnessfrom districtmanagers to negotiate. The most enjoyable part was being with customers and creating new ones.
good,Used to be great job.  Now very micromanaged.  Hit your numbers or byebye commision
good,I gained valuable knowledge of account management. I managed 150 accounts at a given time. I would visit each one each month to service their facility. Fastenal also has a store front in which we serve the public. It is typical retail in industrial supply services.
good,"Processed payroll for weekly, bi-weekly and semi-monthly paid employees. Manually entered employee changes such as direct deposit and address changes. My co-workers were excellent and always willing to help if I had questions especially starting out while trying to learn so many procedures. Overall it was a good job that constantly keeps employees thinking of the best way and fastest way to get things done."
good,"It is a sales based job. I spend the day going business to business on cold calls. Since working there I've learned various aspects of the construction industry. The biggest thing I learned while working here was that sales is very cutthroat and competitive. Management provided no training, and never showed me how a proper sales call is supposed to go. I was on my own and have been since becoming an Outside Sales Person. I really like my co-workers and we get along. The hardest part of the job is spending the entire day trying to get sales and coming back empty handed. The most enjoyable part would have to be the feeling I get when I take a decent size order."
good,"As a part time Sales Support employee, my day revolves around answering phones and finding parts for walk-in customers."
good,started as co op for high school. Great staff to work with. Relaxed inviroment.
good,"Everyone works as a team and are very easy to get along with, It was like a second family. Busy from the time you clock in to the time you clock out! Always something to keep yourself busy! The only down fall is it takes a while to get a full time position."
good,"Fastenal is a decent company with a few perks. Great job during college or directly after. Room for advancement is often available. Like many places, store managers are cool but district and above can be questionable at best."
good,"Hay poca probabilidad de crecimiento hay pocas vacantes de cada area, te hacen trabajar horas extra sin remuneración."
good,"Working at fastenal was a good job and although i was only hired as a part time employee I felt that i made a difference when i showed up to work. However, the district manager only cared about the bottom line and cut my hours right before Christmas, basically forcing me to quit. I felt bad for letting my co workers down, but only making $11/HR and having my already short work week cut in half the result was inevitable"
good,Fastenal is a company driven by customer service.  Fastenal was a good company when you are young to get great training for you future career with Fastenal or other companies in Sales.
good,Empresa dinamica mas com falta de competência na gestão de recursos/funcionários
good,"I was pleased with the amount of hours I got. had wonderful co workers. nice environment to work in. I absolutely loved my job, just could not work for them due to location"
good,I worked at Fastenal part-time when I was in college.  It was an extremely helpful job for me as I got some experience in seeing how businesses operate.
good,Staff at this location is fair and friendly.  Retail space plus warehouse sales are in the same location with salesman/delivery opportunities. A quick paced atmosphere makes for an interesting work day.  Product knowledge is a priority in this environment.
good,Good company to work for though raises dont come easy. Never out of work. Use six sigma lean processes which can effect the quality of co workers and compensation
good,"Physically demanding so if you are not up for the manual labor this job is not for you unless you are working in the office. There will be extreme weather conditions so if it is hot outside it is hotter inside the warehouse, if it is cold outside it is freezing inside. They do provide fans and heaters which can be helpful. Raises are every 6 months based on your performance, quality, and punctuality."
good,"Management is pretty good as I was blessed with a great supervisor. As far as advancement goes, be prepared to pay your dues. The starting salary at entry level barely exceeds the poverty line. Not a bad place to pick up some skills though."
good,"Fastenal was not the right fit for me but for someone who is willing to invest in industrial supplies it can be. The money is there to be made, management is relaxed"
good,Potential to move up if the situation is right. OSR commission is 5% based on growth from the prior year's month. You can't raise a family on 30k so unless you bank on growth you may have to turn elsewhere.
good,"I was a manager in multiple departments for Fastenal. I was the Shipping Manager, Picking Manager, Receiving Manager, as well as a purchasing agent. Basically I knew all facets of the warehouse and its daily operating procedures. Management at the beginning was great and when I quit it was not a strong group. As for the co-workers, I enjoyed the group that I worked with. We also would make plans outside of work as well. Hardest part of the job was the long hours and some of the weekends that were required of me after a while. Most enjoyable was the time at work and outside of work with the other co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working for Fastenal for the most part. Large turn over left for confused and unhappy customers with little explanation as to why old osp left. Changed how we were paid twice in the year and a half I worked there. My personal DM was great. I enjoyed my coworkers. They expect you to work 50 hours a week and very demanding schedules.
good,"The workers there are friendly if you're on the morning crew. The managers are some of the best I've ever experienced. You start at $12/hour, and a 25 cent raise hits every 6 months. You will either be placed in Picking, Sortation, Shipping or Receiving. Picking you work at a computer scanning boxes, taking out parts, packaging them, and then readjusting numbers. The parts are sent down a large convey system which eventually gets down to sortation line. Which is extremely buggy, and sometimes eats the boxes, or gets jammed. As a sortation worker; you have to pick up said boxes and place them in large totes, scanning them and then the totes. Occasionally, you will have to unjam boxes, or tape boxes back together if they got eaten. Most of the parts are metal and will not break, but some products are fragile, and have to be placed in special locations. As a shipper you will most likely be operating a forklift. You will be unloading trucks, making sure sortation has all the skids they need, and scanning skids to locations. As a receiving employee you take boxes from skids, scan them into the system(need to learn software), and put them down the convey to go into the system for pickers to use. This part of the job is still not refined, and needs a very careful attention to details. If you generally do not care about your work ethic, please don't apply for a receiver position you will only make their job worse."
good,"not right now  regular part time job "
good,"I start the day by receiving a daily shipment in. Then I put stock away. After that I take care of any orders that need to be placed. Throughout the rest of the day I will take care of customers, phone calls, and take deliveries to customers."
good,"I'd say this place is a great place to gain experience in a warehouse environment, and also the people here are very laid back, and very helpful to, but other than that the pay is not really good, if your getting a position that's not a manager, technician or a driver position, you don't get full time, its a part time forever position and its pretty hard to get a full time position there to. If your looking for a job to gain experience in this is the right place for you, but other than that, its pretty difficult to make a career there."
good,I really enjoy working for a company like Fastenal. It allows you to have a work/life balance and allowed me to work as well as obtain an education. I have learned many new ideas about a business as well as product knowledge and how to provide great customer service. 
good,"The daily experience at each store is highly influenced by the immediate management chain. Job advancement is fairly common given the rate of turnover and the company prefers to promote from within. As a supplier, sales is a very big part of working here. Training is handled by a standardized program and the remainder is left to the immediate supervisor. Sales cures all here."
good,"This job consist of checking emails, restocking products, and keeping a cycle count on all products. I learned the system to my best ability. Management is laid back for the most part, but can sometimes become more laid back than usually. The workplace culture is fair. The job is not hard long as you come to work prepared, and get things right the first time. The most enjoyable part of the job is making yourself have to stay busy when things start to slow up."
good,"While it is quite a dry industry, this job was great experience as a college upperclassman majoring in business. I learned not only about sales, but about operations and logistics as well. "
good,Competitive industry and market. Must be proactive and be able to make cold calls.  Commission based job so inconsistent paychecks. Great stepping stone job. You will gain excellent sales experience.
good,"Great place to work , great benefits . Not a place to start a career at, I have worked at better places, the managers there are not that great .  Would not recommend someone to work there."
good,"High paced, but everyone gets along and helps out. The hardest part was learning every stop throughout the plant, but there was sufficient training and everyone is willing to help you get through an unknown area."
good,"The job is simple yet very physically demanding. Especially during the summer when things are very busy and very, very hot. The managers are very laid back, but almost too lenient to the point it's unprofessional. They let people get away with a lot more than they should which can affect you and make your job there more difficult. It's a good job for those in school as they'll work with you on your schedule and give you days off as needed."
good,This place has a very good work environment and is a pretty easy place to work as long as you put in the time. The pay scale across the board seems to be below industry average.
good,Great management. Learn that it is much more then just nuts and bolts.  Always more for improvement and a great opportunity to move in ranks within the company.
good,self motivation required.  must work well with others.  management will sometimes encourage unethical business practices to complete  a sale
good,"Fastenal offered vendor managed inventory programs that are customized to fit the needs of each customer.  Enjoyed sourcing and delivery on time, finding solutions when other companies were unable to and saving companies by eliminating warehouse space and consolidating items.  Loved working there and the high profit margins."
good,"Typical day at work was to make cold calls and bring a value added service to our customers."
good,You learn a lot about different products but are often working 50 hours a week and spend more time with your co workers than with your family. The company talks up the pay but over all it is lacking.
good,"Overall an Job worth working for. "
good,not bad but was never given the opportunity I was told I would get after much demandinging training. Mgr. gave up on me even though I obtained new and lost business.
good,"Over the company training and perks are good. The pay rate is low unless you are in the management position. You can get promoted if you work hard.  Not a stressful environment, and very relaxed atmosphere."
good,Overall I like the energy and culture.  The overall business model seems to be based around part-time low experience staff however and a full time position is not something I can't go long without.
good,"A typical day of work for an Outside Sales Person (OSP) at Fastenal is a very fast pace and fun. OSPs typically spend 75% of their day out of the office doing business to business sales with customers in their book of business. The rest of the time is spend processing orders and handling paper work. Fastenal is a great company for people who like jobs with less structure and more freedom. However, the pay could be better and management is usually only worried about the bottom line."
good,"I worked here 4 of the last 7ish years and have little to complain about. They generally don't start off more than $10 hourly and part time for a warehouse worker."
good,"some of the people are good to work with and some arn't."
good,"Great place to work if money isn't very important to you. There is opportunity to advance, but you never receive even adequate compensation for your work"
good,"Entreprise qui oblige à devenir autonome"
good,My time at Fastenal Company
good,Good company but does not compensate their employees correctly.
good,"When I was first hired I loved working there. After 3 years of employment Management was not handling issues with coworkers or other staff effectively. We were to report problems with freight "
good,"The culture at Fastenal was everything I could have asked for. The management was very helpful and motivating. The staff was always ready to work and grow the company. Each day was a challenge, but exciting. Goals and expectation helped ensure maximum effort and execution."
good,"It was a productive job very clean and organized, the supervisors were responsible and respectful it wasn’t a very hard job i did my job very carefully and correctly."
good,Outside sales is very  difficult because of the commission in order to get a dissent commission check you will have to make sure all your customers are above 55% in profit and that is difficult when you have a lot of big company like N.O.V. who have very heavy discount applied to them.
good,"It was a great job to have while in college. I learned about business to business relationships. Great experience, and they like to promote within which is a great factor."
good,I have learned a lot a good practical business practices since being at Fastenal. It's not a hard job and easy to learn. Management actually cares for you and your advancement in the company. My favorite part of the job is working with my coworkers.
good,Overall great company to learn essential business practice from. They invest a vast amount of money in employee education/development. The business management fundamentals that you will learn from working at Fastenal will stick with you for the entirety of your professional career.
good,It was an okay place to work management was horrible maybe I would still work there if there was opportunity to move up in the company I could even consider going back if the current manager left
good,"Fastenal was a great company to work for. I always felt the need to learn more and had resources available to me to do so. Also the company took my training seriously and sent me to various locations to improve my knowledge. Their mission is ""Growth, through customer service."" and i feel they do their very best to achieve that goal. However where i feel they struggle is management. I came across a district mgr that felt he was above reproach & questionable ethics. Discussing this with the Area supervisor he did his best to fix the situation which was highly appreciated but ultimately nothing was done. The philosophy in my district really seemed to be more centralized around hitting sales numbers in not always the most reputable manner."
good,For anyone who wants a faced pace job..this is what you’re looking for. It’s very easy and even easier to advance if your performance and rate are above 70%
good,Great job for college. When the right people are in place it is a good environment to work in. Likes to hire within if they like you.
good,"Work starts at 7am til 5pm, learn to delegate responsibility, inventory management, and business development. I have great co-workers, very dedicated, and customer oriented. The most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction I get from customer service and their appreciation for our efforts. Hard part is dealing with working with less tools to do our jobs."
good,Great workplace if you have the right management in place. Lets you run business as you see fit as long as you grow. Company takes out of your paycheck for unsold inventory MONTHLY!!! even if you were not the one to buy it.
good,"Fastenal is great for out going sales people that like factory settings. The company is currently pushing vending machines, but lacks the correct amount of training to implement vending machines at the current time. The company has too many irons in the fire and needs to focus on one thing at a time."
good,The company has lots of potential. The company has a policy of hiring only from within--I am not sure if this is a good idea. I believe that this stifles leadership development. But I did enjoy working for the company and would definitely do it again.
good,beware management only cares about themselves and are ruthless to hit sales and Vending numbers. Decent money but you may work 10-12 hours per day on a salary
good,"Overall, I loved working for Fastenal. I was given free reign and really allowed to set my own pace. Most, not all, of the customers are great. The computer system they use is easy, just a lot of steps to remember."
good,good pay but managers are horrible mine could not tell me how to print a sales report for an osp district meeting
good,Job security is the biggest worry with the new turn that the company is taking.
good,"it was a cool internship opportunity. Management was a mess, felt like I was joining a sinking ship from the first few weeks there. Everyone in my store was being moved and transferred which never seemed to end."
good,"Fastenal is a great place to work for the younger crowd. It is very demanding on the body with a lot of lifting and moving things. It is harder, as a woman, to advance in some areas. The hub I worked in had a very picky operations manager. He treated people unfairly and chose favorites. Otherwise, he did his job as needed. My direct manager was amazing! Any manager that will do the necessary things to keep their employees happy and working is a great leader, in my opinion. Unless you want to do manual labor as a career, Fastenal is good for someone in college."
good,"good place to work. very low pay starting out, and most people usually start out part time. I learned a lot working there but couldn't handle the low paychecks and every other week pay periods."
good,"Fastenal provides opportunities to those who are willing to work hard.  They provide good technical training to assist new employees in adapting to the MRO market.  Sales training is on going and there are many resources at your finger tips to help people succeed.  The operating system is pretty straight forward."
good,Choose to get rid of me due to no reason other than position was eliminated. I done everything I was told and asked and even got relocated bc of the fault of a unhealthy relationship between me and a manager that was fired earlier in the week.
good,"Easy paycheck.  Regular schedule, but only hires part time so can only be used as supplemental income.  Good atmosphere to work in.  Management has been working for company for years"
good,I was an intern over the summer and I overall liked working there. I do not think every store was like this but they would leave you alone in the store without training and you had to figure it out on your own.
good,A 50 hour work week is quite an undertaking for the pay. I enjoy all of the people I work with but after so many years this industry has just beaten me up. I am forever thankful for the skills I have learned from this company.
good,Part time jobs have steady work for each employee and professional atmosphere. Management was willing to work with employees and be flexible with schedules.
good,"Mi dia inicia a las 5:30 ya que entro a trabajar a las 7:30 am realizando funciones no solo de ventas pero también como de procesos y administrativas, lo que hace que aprenda mucho de otras áreas."
good,Typical culture is to hire out of college and burn talent out. Left to pursue college degree and other opportunities. They do offer strong training with a focus on customer service and one will leave with enhanced skills.
good,Fastenal is a good place to work for a student.  They worked with me around my class schedule.  It is face paced and required attention to detail and safety.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to rely on co-workers to show up.
good,"I worked overnights. Let me just start by saying I loved the guys I worked with."
good,"It's a good place to start working as they have flexible hours and have a greater pay rate than other retail places around. It's very difficult to grow and it becomes easy to be pigeonholed into certain positions. As per most jobs, it's about who you know and not always work performance."
good,"Fastenal is a great company with awesome products, however it just wasn't the right fit for me. I enjoyed the fast paced working environment, but that's about it."
good,"Fastenal was a good place to work for 8 years, unfortunately, there were  branch management issues where I worked. Mostly did computer work, buying, expediting."
good,Loved this company in a whole. The day would start with checking e-mails and purchasing. Quotes for new business was the most of this job. I received the totes from shipping and put up stock. I kept a clean and tight ship. In 4 years had 3 Managers and 3 District Managers. It was like starting over to prove yourself all of the time. This company could not keep help. They were very professional and safe for all employees.
good,"Amazing structure, excellent training protocol, established USA brand but great potential for growth in Canada.  Helped establish new monthly sales record for local Fastenal branch.  Always able to work on the store, displays and quotations.  I learned how the planogram, re shelf, re procurement system worked, and was amazed at how much information was available for customer sourcing and service.  Procurement for on time delivery a bit difficult without a Canadian distribution center to pull from.  Liked the manager and outside sales department.  Hardest part of the job was trying to do things the Fastenal Way, as opposed to previous procedures from other industrial companies I'd worked for.  Recognition from corporate was excellent and District Management involvement helped us know what was coming up and what was going on."
good,"This was my first ""real"" job after leaving college and I couldn't be more positive about it. Of course, there was your standard cooperate bs, but overall it was a great experience for me. It taught me the basics of sales, and allowed me to grow as a salesperson."
good,I took the job as a transition to just make a paycheck worked there for a year till I found a better position that suited my families needs. The job was fine nothing special and really no room for advancement. when I was there the pay calculator changed multiple times.
good,"If you need a job that is fast paced and you are looking for an opportunity to move up in a work place, then this may be the job for you. The pay is horrible for the type of work that you do in Sortation. I am the type of person that loves to put my ""signature"" on the work I do and be recognized for it. In Sortation, that opportunity is not there."
good,I love that my manager was cool everything was fine but it wasn't what I wanted to do and I constantly leave jobs because it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life
good,"Was a good part-time job. Learned a lot at this job specifically B2B aspects of the job.  Plenty of opportunities, which take a lot of hard work to reach."
good,"In my opinion,  there is not a lot of room for advancement here. It is a nice, relaxed workplace and really great if you like to work on your own. Part timers were only allowed 28 hours per week, no more. It was very flexible schedule, just not enough to make a living on. The management I had when I first started was amazing. Great, friendly, and helpful. I switched shifts and found the management to be a bit more difficult to get along with and harder to find when you actual were in need of them."
good,Fastenal is a Good starter job but with the pay and not very flexible hours it is not somewhere I would see my self staying or starting a career there.
good,"A long drive to and from work along with a boss that had no consideration of the associates made this a less than ideal place to work."
good,Great culture of advancement.  I was moved through many different positions until I discovered sales.  I ran a store for many years and loved it.  Would still be there if 2008  down turn never happened
good,"Printed out the daily orders and distributed them among the 6 employees for truck or customer pickups,  Unloaded trucks with forklifts and documented material into company's database. Stayed in contact with trucking company's to ensure time of pickups. In constant conversation with sales people in case of order changes. I learned a lot about supervising others and dealing with different personalities. Most enjoyable part of the day was lunch time, practicing my broken Spanish."
good,Usual day is very busy and stressful. Management doesn't stick up for the employees. Has good health insurance. Lack of communication between co-workers.
good,"The job is fast paced and goes by quickly. Part time work is simple and the schedule is flexible for students. Full time however, is more difficult, but not in the work load. Lack of communication, and egos cause some mild tension."
good,"The social atmosphere at work is great. You meet with alot of different people from multiple companies. However, the job is pretty mundane. Unless you have a specific interest in fasteners and construction supplies, the job can get dull quickly."
good,"Unless you are willing to go into management full time at a distribution center where you're required to work 50+ hours a week, this is a temporary job."
good,"Fastenal has an issue with replacing managers and letting people sit in the same spot for so long. We have managers who've been there for 20 years and the same with District Managers, and they haven't moved up. There felt like, in the area, there was no room for advancement."
good,"Great place to work in college.  Company has flexible schedule to work well with College students, as well as good pay in school too. Helping customers and answering phones is what most of the day consists of.  I worked there for four years and my coworkers became like family to me."
good,"50 hour work week, salaried, and a set commission for this store in Madison.  There isn't much room to grow unless you want to become management.  The culture of Fastenal is slow but with excellent core values, which aren't followed closely."
good,Good customers to work with and great industrial products to sell. Great computer system and ordering system. Sales and product training were professional.
good,"A typical day at work was generally easy going. It was never too stressful completing daily responsibilities such as pulling product, helping customers, placing orders, and putting up stock. The hardest, most stressful part of the job was pleasing my manager and dealing with my co-workers. The best part of the job was the great friendships I made with my awesome customer base."
good,Good job to get your feet inside of other companies for potential advancement with customers. Other than that the compensation is poor for all the work you do.
good,I had a great time working in the branch they higher great people but once you hit the General Manager position the room for advancement is minimal.  Be careful what you say around co-workers they might throw you under the bus for that next promotion.  I don't miss the hours 50+ a week to make not much more then 50 grand.  Corporate has the pay calculator figured out so that you will never make 6 figures.
good,"Good starting job, some cultural issues and long work days, however, pay was commiserate with performance."
good,Fastenal was an excellent company to work for. A typrical day at work would consist of takinng multiple calls from cutomer regaurding their purchase ordrers and shipment days and times. I also maintained a detailed inventory log for the company and reported to management on a weekly and daily basis. I worked really well with my co-workes to accomplish daily goals.There was nothing hard about my job because I realy enjoyed the type of work I did. The best part about my job was going to work and getting the satisfaction of a job well done!
good,I have a flexible schedule that allows me to take care of my family needs.
good,"Assist customers with needs, answer phones and direct to correct person, daily invoices, and stock shelves"
good,Managing accounts and acquiring new customers on a regular basis. Provided my cell phone number for customers to contact me at any time.
good,"Fastenal is a good company for starting a career.  Business model for company, providing competitive priced industry supplies with strong customer service, leads to a penny pinching mentality pushed down from corporate.  This is not a bad way to operate but it does mean payroll and therefore staffing is tight as well as other fringe benefits, etc."
good,"I initially got connected with Fastenal through a college internship, and eventually worked at three different branch locations.  Though two of the locations didn't provide for the best working environment (which is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5), my time at the Duncansville branch was the best job that I ever had.  The team was absolutely incredible to work with.  Being a female in the industry, I had a lot to prove to this group of guys.  But once I showed that I knew my stuff and what I was doing, they all had my back 1000%.  I've never worked with a better group of people than these guys."
good,"My typical day at work involves calling customer and vendors, cleaning up our receiving grid, helping walk in customer, and keeping the storefront clean and organized. The hardest part about my job is when things get stressed my coworkers and manager do not handle it well. Also I was in a car accident during my time here and corporate made it very difficult and put me in a very hostile position."
good,Handel National accounts $36 million a year. RFQ/RFP on a weekly basis. Have sign an average of 4-6 new national accounts  year.  National account programs and structured pricing files. Conference calls and face to face meetings with Directors and Corporate VP's of purchasing.
good,"Part time schedule with full time work amount"
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, buenos jefes, demasiadas actividades por persona."
good,"Definitely recommend the Burlington fastenal, great environment. Teaches you new skills, interaction with different customers. Definitely a knowledgeable job"
good,"I joined the company as a part timer with the intent of advancing. I had plenty of responsibility at my first store, but since I was a part timer, I had a mandatory transfer to a different branch. While I was there, I no longer had the same level of responsibility and none of the improvements I wanted to make got implemented. Good culture, but you have to twist some arms to get anything done."
good,fun good people easy work but needs more full time on 3rd shift if it had that i never would have left had alot of friends that made the time and work fly by
good,"Job is very easy and laid back. The hours are flexible and if not, the company is willing to work with you to an extent. Very productive and hard working company."
good,Move up quickly. Work with lots of different companies. Benefits and paid vacation. Workplace culture varies store to store. Compensation could be better.
good,"had a good experience , great opportunity for learning and an awesome team. would recommend working there, management could use work on professionalism."
good,"Worked here part time for 6 no months, alot of slow days, seems to be alot of people put in managerial positions that do not know what they are doing, or have never managed people."
good,"Many things I learned at Fastenal, I can use at many other places in the work field. They have great training opportunities and great implementation of new process improvements."
good,Over work the employees . never really gave breaks to employees or provided any type of water while working in a hot warehouse. It was an okay place to work at.
good,Working at Fastenal was a fun part time job.  The store and warehouse managers were both fun to work for and were good people.  Good coworkers made going to work each day a joy.  The work was varied enough to keep the days from getting boring.
good,"Fastenal was a great company to work for. I always felt the need to learn more and had resources available to me to do so. Also the company took my training seriously and sent me to various locations to improve my knowledge. Their mission is ""Growth, through customer service."" and i feel they do their very best to achieve that goal. However where i feel they struggle is management. I came across at least 2 store managers that were verbally abusive and felt they were above reproach. Discussing this with the Area supervisor he did his best to fix the situation which was highly appreciated but ultimately nothing was done other than transferring me out of the store. I dont feel thats really the best way to handle a problem. The philosophy in my district really seemed to be more centralized around hitting sales numbers. Which is obviously the main goal."
good,"I would recommend working for Fastenal, its a good conpany. I had good experiences there. It’s good money and the people I worked with were good people."
good,Fastenal is a great career opportunity for a young person out of college. It offers that individual the opportunity to eventually advance their career into a branch manager or a national sales account manager. The company has a wide range of industrial supplies readily available from shipping depots throughout the Midwest. This is a highly recommended company for a new college graduate.
good,"There are advancement possibilities and job security. Benefits, vacation and 401k with Fastenal Stock Options all with a growing company that started out in small town Minnesota. (Winona)"
good,"great stater job for business majors. Teaches you a lot in how to work in a timely fashion and accomplish your tasks in a 8 hour day. would reccomend this job to many,"
good,"I was a branch manager for Fastenal for 4 years.  I was in charge of reaching branch goals and expectations.    I showed double digit growth at both branches I managed.  I was able to work with and get to know several different customers within multiple different professions.  I also got a chance to help teach and mentor my sales people.  We built and executed sales plans, sales calls and grew the business together."
good,All the employees are friendly.if you make your production quotas everyone gets a bonus based on the shops goals.We have barbecues two or three times a year .
good,"Fastenal gave me higher knowledge of industrial materials, computer systems, sales support duties and customer service. I performed many inventory checks and helped customers find the materials they were looking for on a day-to-day basis."
good,"Good company, just not for me. Fastenal works well with people and has great opportunities. Sales just aren’t for me. Looking for something else that’s out there"
good,"The people were O.K. and it was an interesting company to work for, but management was constantly on everybody's tail to get the work out. I, nor others, could see no advancement opportunities in pay or position."
good,"Overall a rewarding job. The company doesn’t provide enough staffing. Hardest part is being left alone with multiple phone calls, walk in customers and needing to make promised deliveries"
good,"Their computer system which drives everything from counter sales to customer service to inventory is complex requiring the memorization of several key components. Not much attention in training on this system. It takes a full year to get competent in its use."
good,A day at work wasn't anything complicated. The work was pretty easy. The thing I liked most about the job was how laid back it was. The hardest part of the job was having a lot of the workload thrown at me when we were understaffed and I didn't have any help.
good,"Place is run extremely lean. Most employees take safety seriously however, production remains king. High turnover and a turn and burn culture make it hard to make significant progress in safety."
good,"Excelente empresa con un buen ambiente de trabajo,"
good,"Learned a lot, took plenty of free trainings.  Got to meet new people everyday and build relationships with the customers we development.  We grew our accounts and had plenty time out on the road to grow our sales."
good,depending on the store and location you will work between 18-32 hours per week. the job is not difficult but there is a steep learning curve for those without a machining or tool oriented background
good,"Good place to work. Would recommend this employer in Indianapolis, but not in Atlanta.  There was room for growth and opportunity to become full time in Indianapolis, but not in Atlanta.  Could only get 20 hours in Atlanta."
good,"•	Developed and executed sales plans with an inside and outside sales team which included: blocking time for sales prep, scheduling vendors, prospecting, customer mapping, nurturing existing customers, and prepping for phone calls"
good,A Productive and fun workplace with wide opportunities and scope for trying and exploring new challenges. A very corporate work culture where you could see a professional and passionate people working together. Overall a great workplace with a great platform to excel.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Fastenal. As a sales support staff member, it was a flexible and enjoyable job to have while attending school. I would recommend Fastenal to any of my friends looking for a part-time job."
good,"Fastenal is a great place to work. While it does have some cons like all other places, it is made up for with a great crew and management."
good,I have enjoyed working at Fastenal. The direct contact with customers on a daily basis has sharpened my customer service and sales skills. The overwhelming majority of my coworkers and managers have been competent and kind individuals.
good,"It a great job, depending what job your doing. It really disorganized and indirect communication. Lack of resources, no benefits, and improper payment . Best thing I can say is that you have flexible hours and easy to doing."
good,It is pretty easy work at Fastenal. Both of my co-workers are very cooperative and fun to be around. My co-workers make the job a little more enjoyable.
good,"Fastenal Co is a big company still growing, with a customer based culture. It is not centralized which could be an advantage, they train their people very often."
good,"I enjoyed working there, and learned quite a bit as it was my first job out of college. Good benefits, but highly demanding schedule and short deadlines with unrealistic expectations"
good,I enjoyed working at Fastenal until they reduced my earning potential by adding additional sales representatives to an already saturated territory. Benefits were lacking.
good,This position was a good for me at that part of my life. It helped me with multi-tasking and understanding sales and commission. Overall A great place to work if you are into sales.
good,"The team was amazing, fun people that worked well together. Job was fast paced, worked with many different customers. I learned lots about the different industries in town from working here, and there was also lots of opportunity to learn about our products."
good,You will hit a wall however at certain level and can only advance as people quit. Also you will work 60 hours a week on average if not more. The pay is good however
good,"Fastenal was a good place to work for a college summer job. The job, however, does not offer opportunities to move up the company and is not exactly in my desired field."
good,Fastenal is a solid company. They'll be around for a while. Doesn't really pay that much though. Except for a few positions.
good,"Develop and maintain a good customer relationship. Manage inventory, coordinate sales personnel, collections, purchasing."
good,You have job security but only the desirables advance (favorites) doesn't really matter how much you know if your not in the circle you stay put. Pay is not the greatest the recent pay increase now is 15 cent every 6 months it used to be 50 cent to $1.00 every 6 months. It is a job though and its really hard to lose it  so its guaranteed pay every 2 weeks that's the important thing.
good,"Fastenal is a strong forerunner in the industrial sales market with the right attitude and resources to continue to move up.  With a decentralized decision making mentality, the General Manager is entrusted with their own store with little involvement from Corporate.  With business to business sales as its primary focus, the General Manager is responsible for sourcing items and services, scheduling, hiring team members, maintaining existing relationships with customers, developing new accounts, and training employees."
good,"Easy warehouse job with decent pay.  Now offering quarterly bonuses for reaching sales' goals.  No offered during my time of employment, as we had no room for growth.  I left the company due to the fact that I was working harder for them than what I feel I deserved.  Management is almost non-existent in the workplace.  No help from management staff."
good,"Major emphasis on sales numbers. Compensation is based off both store sales and individual sales. Competitive company culture, and great distribution networks."
good,Good place to work. Fast paced with plenty of room for advancement. Extensive training provided for you starting from day one.
good,"It is a fun place to work with great management and coworkers that make it enjoyable to come to the workplace everyday. The hardest part of my job would of been paying attention to tiny detail. The best part would be the hours and how flexible they were with my busy, college schedule. I learned a lot about all of the parts fastenel uses."
good,A typical day at work at fastenal is either checking people out or running parts to factory's and making new orders for people and factory's. Putting up stock or counting stock and making sure everyone's orders are complete and are on time.
good,I like this company and enjoy my day and time at work. it's not a typical call center or collection agency. management is great people are good to work with as well
good,"Working at Fastenal as a part-time in store sales support was a good experience during school. It gave me the hours I needed and also the pay I needed to make it through school. It was something that kept me busy, and taught me a lot about customer service."
good,There is a lot on your plate here. Must be able to multi task without being overwhelmed. Being self motivated is a must. Need to be able to adapt to ever changing company initiatives.
good,"pros: all on your own, your effort will directly affect your results"
good,The only reason that I didn't give the company 5 stars is because I only worked part time and the opportunity to work full time didn't come around as frequent as I was led to believe
good,Great place to work company works to help employs to get ahead in company. Every one helps to do every thing and teach each other.
good,Manager and co-workers welcome me everyday when I walk into work and there is always something to do that challenges my skills.
good,"-Développement de compétences en gestion et leadership"
good,Fastenal has been a great company to work and learn.  I have a very supportive group to work with.  There is a great sense of collaboration amongst the staff.
good,"Great company, good management, flexible hours,a lot of customer focus and great opportunity for advancement within the company"
good,Fastenal is extremely production as a company and they really care about their employees. They have wonderful benefits for both part-time and full-time jobs.
good,you will learn quite a bit about running a business and product knowledge. If you want to move fast in a company this is a great place to be.
good,Fastenal is a great place to work if you're in school and need something part time. Pays well for the time you are there and the work is fairly easy.
good,"A typical day of work does not consist of that much. I count inventory about once a week, take calls, create quotes and help walk ins as they come. So far, I have learned a lot about nuts, bolts, safety equipment, and other construction based tools and what each of their individual purposes are. The hardest part of the job is staying busy. Since the store currently relocated, many of our customers are not aware of where we are. I would much rather be busy rather than doing busy work."
good,Putting away stock and finding stock to pack was the main part of this job. Nice people and opportunities. Did not work for long because of personal experiences
good,"During my time at Fastenal I gained tremendous experience in customer service, outside sales, and inventory control."
good,"A crash course in business.  Learn the programs, the culture and be a go-getter.  Think outside of the box and innovate.  You will have success if you learn how to use the ever evolving system to your advantage.  Stay engaged and always pay attention to market trends."
good,The company invests in it's employees and has a favorable business model that allows for year over year growth and employee advancement opportunities.
good,"It's a great place with very good management, but they have a hard time putting people into a role that suits them, and most positions are part-time unless you reach a management position."
good,The co-workers at Fastenal were great and would help me with whatever I needed if they had the time. We worked well as a team.
good,"While going to School at UNT, I worked 25-35 hours a week as a warehouse picker. It was a job that kept me busy every minute I worked there. I learned how to stay focused and how to deal with face paced induced stress."
good,"Great company to work for, pay isn't where I want it to be. Commission structure is built around growth. I would like to move on to something a little bit more challenging with more pay. "
good,Fast paced work environment with room for advancement in many different areas. Ability to improve upon skill sets and develop new ones while given a career opportunity
good,Very hardworking company and employees. There are many opportunities to learn and network throughout the company and many of the customers.
good,Provides a challenging but interesting place to work. You learn a lot about many different product lines and provides you a diverse wealth of knowledge.
good,Work can be enjoyable if all entities in a store perform their required duties. If any part of the chain falls apart it can be difficult to perform sales operations at required and efficient level.
good,Working for Fastenal was a great experience I learned so much working there. I briefly worked in the shipping department but really enjoyed working for maintenance department. The work was steady and mostly consisted of building maintenance. I worked nights wish I could have worked days. This was a second job for me as I maintained another job.
good,Very Good Company for learning Industrial Products and Customer Service Values with Focus on Sales and Revenue Growth
good,Learned lots and made great connections. I was able to work on my b2b sales techniques. I liked the decentralization of the company
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Fastenal and was able to gain great basics for sales, while working part time in college. There were lots of directions and products to learn and help customers with."
good,Going out and trying to get new business and taking care of the business that you already have.
good,"Fastenal has taught me more than any other job could have.  I have the ability to run my own business with the back bone of a huge billion dollar company.  I will forever thank Fastenal for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow my sales career.  I would highly suggest Fastenal to anyone who wants to learn to sell and develop a business.  Fastenal has the training, tools, and resources available to be successful for anyone who has the determination to achieve personal and financial goals.  Working for Fastenal I realized quickly you get what you put into this job and it is not a good career for lazy individuals who have no drive.  Fastenal is a place where your work is never done, and you always have a reason to wake up and come to work the next day.  I love this job, its not the best, or the highest paying, but most rewarding. Knowing I did it for myself, and no one gave it to me is one of the best feelings I get from this career."
good,It was a good time. I have nothing bad to say. Youll learn alot about business but you wont get paid alot to do it.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Fastenal. The people I worked with were a lot of fun and the environment was very productive and enjoyable. It was only a part-time job, but they treated me very well."
good,"Worked there about 8 months, couldn't even get moved up to full time. They wont let their part-timers work more then 29 hours a week. Didn't get paid enough for everything that I had to manage."
good,"My day starts at 6:30 a.m. I spend half of my week covering and maintaining a large group of customers in the Ohio market.  The other half of the week is spent putting together the next sales territory for the next sales specialist, currently Pittsburg.  One day a week, I spend in my Akron office doing all of the paperwork that needs to be caught up on from the week.  My day usually ends about 5p.m."
good,Sales is a great business if you're a driven motivated person
good,"Ship and receiving inventory, billing customers, customer service and walk ins, good hours."
good,"The economy in the area has made it difficult for a company like Fastenal to grow. Fastenal is a nationally owned and operated company. My typical day at work is answering phones, filling orders, completing cycle counts and assisting walk in customers. "
good,"responsible for selling, order, and delivering all product.  Management is sometimes helpful."
good,"I still patronize the branch from time to time, as well. Good management"
good,Never the same routine. Great if you like a change of pace from day to day
good,Fastenal is a good place to work if you want some experience in warehouse and assembly lines. The management is not bad and they give you plenty of breaks.
good,"opportunities are limited by the region, varied responsibilities according to different cities and the industries the Fastenal branches service. Running the store can be routine but every walk in customer or account holders needs and requests vary greatly and some tasks can be somewhat challenging, but interesting."
good,"In the 5 years or so working for this company I learned many different skills. "
good,Great company to work for but would like the opportunity to move up.
good,My time with Fastenal was short but I loved working there. You get the opportunity to go out and talk to customers face to face and there is never a dull moment.
good,"Receive inventory, stock shelves, help with inside sales and deliveries."
good,Very energetic personnel who help each other out and are not afraid to go the extra mile.
good,The pay was bad.  The way the GM treated you was not worth the time spent there.
good,I felt that I was able to learn and apply my education within marketing to my job.
good,Pretty decent place to work with a lot of freedom.  Not the best pay for entry level positions though.
good,"Major company, aquire new customer, maintain old customers, searched for military, municpalities contracts."
good,"If there's anything I've learned from Fastenal is the way business  should work and the way it shouldn't work. If people work together and keep each other on the same page then work can flow more smoothly and the duty to serve the customer and make them happy will be fulfilled. However, if everyone works differently, sees everything differently and communication is poor amongst employees then the work will lack completion and pride."
good,"picked parts "
good,"I had so many tasks to do each day, I kept real busy. I enjoyed learning everything I had to do and excelling at it."
good,"Fastenal was a wonderful job, great people to work with. Many incentives. Customer interaction was wonderful and working with a big team was great."
good,they promise you the world and can't deliver.  I started working part-time and went back to school.  Ok job for a year or two but not a career!
good,There is a lot of chance for advancement within this company. Very easy work
good,"Great place to start a career, you are given opportunity to grow and learn in a hands on environment.  Responsibilities include a full range of duties including but not limited to development, sales, retail, scheduling, logistics, warehousing."
good,Learned valuable management and sales skills.  Made use of sales plans and interacted with business customers on a daily basis.
good,Customer is always number one. Pay attention to their needs and exceed their expectations.
good,"Inside and outside sales to private contractors, delivered products to construction sites; and looked for new clients.  Inside sales to general public – finding the right product to fit their needs."
good,fastenal is a fun fast paced place to work i needed full time picing of small parts and counting indivual pieces
good,Fast paced
good,I needed a job that could fit around my school schedule. I work 4 to 9 every morning.
good,"Fun, Fast Paced place to work. gruely work but fun bunch of managaers and people to work with"
good,A fun workplace but needs to pay more. The people you encounter on their accounts provide good information if you wanted to work in their field
good,"Inventory Management, Waiting on Customers and Answering up to four telephone lines, Shipping and Receiving, Delivering product in the company vehicle."
good,"Had a couple of issues with past management, but the company itself offers classes to train and educate their employess. Many opportunities to travel as well. I enjoyed seeing my customers and doing the sales and ordering."
good,"Good experience, only worked with 2 other people."
good,Checked inventory daily to make sure it was up to date with the numbers represented in the computer software. Checked and balanced accounts of sales and receivables.
good,a good starting point in sales. lots of ways to learn and advance.
good,Supplies hardware and office supplies for local businesses.
good,I do not want to write on hundred fifty characters but here I am doing it so here you go. That was a run-on sentence. It was smart to have this portion at the end so you are too invested to just exit out before finishing.
good,"It was a pretty solid environment. Wonderful workers, positive environment, great communication with fellow coworkers. The only negative that I had about Fastenal was job security."
good,"Great fast paced work environment. If you work hard and put in the time you will be promoted. Long hours is the only negative to the company. Overall very pleasant experience, if you would like to move up the ladder faster then be sure to tell management you are willing to relocate."
good,Fast paced highly competitive market with growing internet based sellers as competition.  Fastenal is well positioned within the fastener sales with 9 manufacturers owned wholly by Fastenal.  Very good training programs both online and at their distribution HUBS.
good,"Work directly with accounts in the book of business to service and grow sales objectives. "
good,Good place to work would have stayed for longer but DM was a tool bag and he was on a mission to get rid of me. I would have really enjoyed my time there if that DM was not there.
good,"In general , the company gives plenty of good possibilities and opportunities for advancement and learning. Very good morality and aspects of unity. You work together as a team and together push forward to help better the buisness. The key is growth through customer service. Learning what the customers want and fulfilling their needs. Great job for those with industrial,construction and safety experience. Always learning something new and achieving set goals.Management overall is good though it depends through different branches and environments. Many customer service skills and company programs and systems may be learned as you go. This job is a good choice for those who want to better their sales and customer service skills. For those who also look to move up the ladder the company definitely encourages it. Give it a try if these may sound appealing to anyone."
good,"A typical day for me was managing branch/customer stock, receiving orders, placing orders, picking orders, contacting vendors, and delivering orders.."
good,"Pros- great coworkers - autonomous work environment. Management is very macro.  I love the company culture for the most part.  Tasks change from day to day - very fast paced."
good,Great place to build a career if you are dales driven. The pace is fast and training is excellent. It is a growth company so you must be comfortable with constant change.
good,typical workday was to open the store about 7:30 a.m. and have several regular customers come in right away with cheerful attitudes and get what they needed. Manager was quite helpful as well as another worker in teaching me all things I needed as I am a quick learner and within days knew most if not all the daily operations.
good,I  was warehouse manager and customer support for inside sales for the time I was at Fastenal and delivered supplies to companies in Muskogee and surrounding areas and made sales calls .
good,This was a great company to work for while still attending college. I would recommend due to the good pay and flexible hours. My manager was excellent as well.
good,"Good/safe work environment, I highly recommend people to apply. One of the best employers ive ever worked for, they have pride in there jobs providing free gear for there employees (I like the shirts and the color).."
good,"I work a day shift for the Fastenal warehouse in Indianapolis.  We are the largest distribution center in the company and furthermore handle the most volume.  My typical day begins by picking product for a few hours (supervisors are currently assisting to cover shifts).  I manage the Help Desk , and resume at the desk to check our call queue, review emails, and check in for emergent situations. We can handle between 8-9000 calls a month from any Fastenal branch in the company worldwide.  Since we handle the most product, we are involved with the most branches in the company as an integral part of the supply chain.  The management is tough, but fair.  There is liberty to do your work, but there are firm expectations in place.  As a Help Desk, we are to respond to every call received in a day the same day.  Emergency calls are to be responded to within 2 hours of receipt. There is a push for continuous improvement on the floor by connecting help tickets to the responsible issues.   I have learned the importance of prioritization and organization to get my work accomplished.  There is a sense of urgency to assist the branches as quickly as possible, and this can be a stress point and make the job quite difficult.  It is rewarding to be able to provide a meaningful solution to the branches."
good,My views are indifferent and it depends on the store or department you work in.  Everyone's experience will be different based on what their job is and the management in charge.
good,Every shipment has a deadline and time so everyone must work nicely together to get the job done. Assignments are given to each employee at the start of each shift to keep from everyone from running into each other
good,Great place to learn about the industry and gather insight into other opportunities. Can be lucrative if you are part of a profitable store with a solid client base.
good,"The Fastenal branch that I worked at as a sales associate is an extremely exceptional branch in terms of performance and staff quality, so my experiences at the company are likely more positive than most.  That being said, besides upper management cutting part time employee's hours (among other things that I saw being detrimental to company performance) it was a great overall experience.  I was working under a great manager who was very supportive of the staff overall and was able to get work done while maintaining an upbeat work atmosphere."
good,"This company is very decentralized, meaning each store is kinda independent of the corporate offices. Each store is run by a General Manager who calls the shots. Obviously there are many corporate guidelines, but the GM still makes a lot of decisions. That being said, if you have a good GM, which I did, it can make the job very enjoyable. My first couple years with Fastenal were very good. When I got promoted to a GM, however, things went sour because we also got a new District Manager who was terrible. My store was a good store, after the first year we started growing yet my DM was always down my throat. It was very frustrating. He also had his favorites. We were doing better then his ""buddy's"" store yet we got more heat. My store team was phenomenal though. To the extent we were good friends outside of work as well. This company is purely dependent on the people around you and your direct superior.  Overall I had a good experience though and would recommend to a friend pending they like the current store personnel."
good,As an onsite employee your work/life balance sucks. Constantly working over your initial shift and pulling 12-16 hour days. Coming in early all the time as well. Lets not forget you're an EXEMPT employee. So you don't get paid for overtime. I never even really got my lunch breaks or paid breaks. I had to work straight through my day.
good,I had two jobs at Fastenal and I liked being the IT Specialist.  I would fix workstations and printers in 5 interconnected warehouses.  It was great adding more workstations in an automated system and see how it all worked.
good,have worked here over a year and i like my job. But i have not been promoted as much as i feel i should and they are not fair about everything
good,Management needs a definite change of culture. Good place to work at and grow when you have the right team with you. Commission scale could be better as well as base pay.
good,Good place to work with good benefits. Availability to advance in many different positions. Very fast paced company. Not always punctual with promotions and raises.
good,"Roughneck job - working hard and put away wet. I stayed in shape while working this job, lifting heavy boxes, moving quickly. Easy job to feel good about when you move quickly and get stuff done. Loading semi trucks, your hours could be all night, or a few hours. Your night could be bad due to moving a lot of product, or little at all."
good,"Day to day a great experience from regular sales to odd parts procurement for custom jobs. The job included putting away freight to be sold in the store,answering phones, taking custom orders, calling vendors and other branches for parts, and assisting outside sales associates with loading parts and picking orders. The co-workers and immediate management were the most enjoyable part of the job, but the hardest part was advancement from lower level positions."
good,"Whizzing around on a forklift and packing pallets speedily to make a deadline for the shipment to be sent half way around the world made my work interesting. It was hard work with heavy lifting and very ambitious timelines for the items to be shipped, but I felt like it made me a stronger person."
good,"I was a part time sales associate, and for the most part I enjoyed it. There was lots of time where I was at the store by myself for several hours. I stocked vending machines also. The main reason I quit was because November-January they signifacantly cut back on hours. Also the rest of the year it was very hard to get a raise and when I did it was $.50 and they would not give me anymore hours that 24."
good,It's a great place to work with excellent individuals. Team work is built on getting results and finding solutions effectively and the plans to progress the company have been good.
good,"Fastenal is a large company with many positives.  I always said Fastenal promoted to ineptness.  Sales and Management do not always go together and very often a store manager would get fired or quit and a far to young and brand new sales rep would step in.  My 6years at Fastenal taught me a lot but as an outside sales rep, my last 2 years there kept me in a branch haggling over miniscule problems and I went weeks sometimes without making sales calls.  Though I maintain a relationship with a number of people who were coworkers and past managers after 6 years it was time to move on to somebody who wanted a sales rep and not a counter worker."
good,"They are very flexible with school schedules as long as you maintain your weekly hours. This was a huge bonus as a student as I could choose my hours. Down side is there is not a lot of weekend work for some that may be an upside. Some ""management"" or ""leads"" are ""bad""(indeed wouldn't let me use the word I wanted) and bark orders, you can literally hear them yelling from across the warehouse. In my opinion they should not have a job from the way they treat their employees and I did not even work for them. Other managers are great and friendly. Stay away from sortation!"
good,Your happiness is dependent on the type of manager you get. The manager is who trains you and helps you when you are having difficulties.
good,"Only problem that I found with this company is the ability to find help and keep them. Benefits, pay, etc could be improved."
good,"This was my first step into an ""office"" invironment. I leaned a lot of valuable skills here."
good,Had disagreement over compensation and decided to part ways.
good,"Pick product to be shipped out that night. "
good,"Normal day to day routines involve pulling restock products to fill vending machines at various industrial facilities. Creating computer generated quotes for all products needed by each industrial company. Driving and delivering all products to their locations."
good,"Good place to work. I learned a lot there."
good,A lot of work and some training for what you do. Some managers could be better and the hiring process isn't the best. The pay was not very good. My immediate co-workers and manager are pleasant to work with.
good,"•	Worked with incoming freight transportation to receive accurate stock"
good,"I enjoy sales, because I get to go out and interact with a variety of customers each day. The most rewarding part of my job is when I gain business by recognizing a product line that my competitor is providing, and gaining that sale/business and eliminating my competitor's presence within that business."
good,"Fastenal is a great company to work for part-time while you're still in school. However, there is little opportunity for advancement unless you've worked for Fastenal part-time (20 hours a week) for an entire year."
good,"Fastenal Company proved to be enjoyable as job workings dealt primarily with the customer. From sales to the delivery of product, job satisfaction was fealt daily as I was able to meet the needs of the customer. My customer service skills increased and with the management of several large accounts I was able to maintain product stock levels for each so request were not needed; product was always on hand."
good,"While working at Fastenal I learned much about Retail sales and business operations. As a business major, it was a great learning experience."
good,"Great place to work initially but it wears on you. You begin to feel undervalued and when your workload increases your pay stays the same. Management can sometimes get in the way of that due to wealth distribution. Stressful at times, but overall a good place to work."
good,"Fastenal provides equal opportunity to those who wish to advance in a variety of areas, and the chance to move for work if the positions are open. The managers are also willing to assist you in learning and advancing within your branches."
good,Big corporation with big corporation downfalls. I work in the vehicle maintenance department and I feel like Fastenal does not put enough emphasis on what we do for them. Outsourcing labor for our equipment seems like a shot term gain and long term loss.
good,"Fastenal is a great company to work for because the company is worldwide with over 3,000 stores and 30 hubs; more importantly, there is always something new to learn. demo and sell."
good,"Good company, but too much pressure from upper management to hit goals with little help from the higher ups. Some of the promotions are given from nepotism and feels like you need to be in the cool kids club."
good,"Can be very stressful, depending on the department you are working in certain managers are better than others. "
good,"The people were very helpful and always nice and fun to talk to and work with, but often times I would finish tasks early and be left with little to no work, or vise versa, so I wasn't always guaranteed consistent hours."
good,"It's not a bad job, especially if you're just getting into the field. It's not really for me. I dont know much about fasteners or anything but I can still get by."
good,"Assisting large companies with daily operations and help develop a more efficient work place. Learned a lot about different industries and  how they facilitate our daily lives. Work culture was really good. Hardest part was selling new ideas to older generation management.Really enjoyed meeting new people, the sense of accomplishment when i got a new sale or contract."
good,"Fastenal was a great place to learn how a company runs. Also a great place to teach you if sales are for you or not. You are entirely your own boss day to day in a certain sense. You are given enough rope to hang yourself or swing like tarzan, again its all up to you.  It was definitely a great foundation ."
good,Good starter job looking for better opportunities easy work good people to work for a growing company that treats your with respect and care for your job
good,"Fastenal was by far the most fun company to work for.  The reason I walked away was pay.  If you were to lose a major account, even the most profitable store locations would decrease your pay year over year."
good,I have learned typical safety procedures in and outside of the industrial field. Also how to manage a warehouse and become passionate about my work ethic.
good,Good starting place..only way to go anywhere is to do sales and excel in it. Other than that they will promise you the world and won't deliver. Pushing you to look elsewhere for work.
good,"Probably the best factory job you'll find."
good,"One of the best companies I worked for, besides the lack of management and lack of training! Very fast paced job that promotes from within the company"
good,"Learn the customers, be available to them, and and adapt to their needs if you want to be successful. You will be multitasking between your customers and store operations."
good,Good opportunity for inside and outside sales experience with territory management. Company has a large variety of clients throughout the greater Tampa Bay Area
good,"Start with pulling out supplies needed for cleaning,  keep break rooms and bathrooms clean, repair fixtures, touch up paint, buff floors, minor maintenance, clean and safe work environment,"
good,"On a day to day basis the job can be different, exciting, stressful, but there is a lot of opportunities within the company. Also training and help for the right individuals for advancement. There are stores all across the county, and thousands of employees. It is a team oriented company, not just within the walls of your own store, but throughout your region. They provide training opportunities for any position that you are interested in."
good,"Work at your own place and no one bothers you as long as you are doing your job.  Everyone here are great people, and get along with eachother.  If the pay and benefits were good, I would retire here."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, I was able to grow at my own pace, design tooling work anywhere in the shop I wanted as long as my machine was running. overall a great job."
good,".Stable job, a lot of career advancement opportunity, long days to keep up with work load. Pay is adequate with the amount of work that you are willing to put in."
good,"My main job is to maintain the vending machine program at our Onsite. Using software I check on product that is below mininum or out of stock. I compile restock lists and then pick and deliver the items to each machine. I also check departments for needs of OEM parts and shop supplies. I create quotes for these items. I also take care of the OEM, shop supply needs and vending in a separate building. I take care of the supply, fastener and other needs of an adult workshop that does assembly for our customer. When in the office I wait on walk-in customers and provide quotes for tools, supplies and equipment."
good,Good internship to learn many functions of supply chain. Pay could have been better. Turnover rate is high as well as expectations from the higher ups.
good,Fastenal is a very good place to work. The work environment is very fast pace. You must learn quickly. They do have trainings on the computer as well as on site. A lot is expected out of you on a day-to-day basis.
good,"Working for Fastenal is fast-paced & high pressure coming from corporate and the customers. "
good,"La empresa es un lugar muy bueno para el desarrollo profesional. Siempre y cuando el gerente de sucursal aplique liderazgo y relación humana sin degradar a sus subordinados. "
good,Fastenal gives people the opportunity to work with a large variety of customers and companies while learning a lot about different products. The most enjoyable part of the job was the small office work environment with people that worked as a team to meet high goals!
good,A typical day at work could be very busy if you are the only one in the store. The business provides its employees with many tools to find the answers for customers.
good,This is a great entry level job. No real experience is necessary because as a new hire you are required to go through Fastenal trainings. You will learn more about fasteners than you ever wanted to know.
good,"Fastenal is a great place to start a career in sales, and continue that career if can build a strong enough BoB.  Management varies from location to location, and there are poor experiences more often than better."
good,Fastenal is a great place to work. You get your percentage of how you did during the week. Management always congratulated you on how well you were progressing.
good,"Fastenal is a fun and fast moving sales driven environment that provides a great learning experience for people beginning their careers. Although the culture at Fastenal is great, the compensation is questionable at best. I've found that the pay structure often changes and it becomes difficult to personally develop and grow within the company past the General Manager position."
good,Great place to work but not a lot of room to grow if you aren't in good with certain people within the company. Learned a lot while working for the company. Just not a company I wanted to work for or retire with.
good,Pretty easy going place to work. Unless you have a manager that likes to micromanage. Do not need need any special skill to work there. Pretty laid back at most branches
good,"Through Fastenal I have learned so much. They have excellent and continuous training. "
good,Ok workplace not great culture alright pay the culture is kind of against minorities but it's kind of a fair game wit employment opportunities
good,"Answering phone calls, helping walk ins, delivering product to customers.  Stocking shelves on site and at the branch. High turn over.  Lots of opportunities to grow."
good,I really enjoy working here but advancement is tough because they heavily utilize part-time workers. Pace is steady all day long. Store is open 7-5. I really enjoy the autonomy given to employees for normal day-to-day functions
good,"•	Assist with sales/customer service"
good,"I worked for Fastenal for nearly three years. I was even awarded the employee of the company as a part-time worker. I was recommended for full-time jobs, so I applied for them. I interviewed for six full-time positions but I was not hired."
good,"Everyday is different but interesting thats for sure, love the people I work with. Management is always there with a helping hand and options to better yourself"
good,good company to work for that always hires within. compensation is not the greatest and typically hire younger sales employees. you do have a great opportunity to run your own branch similar but less risk than your own business. Fastenal always hires within so if you are motivated you can do well moving into better positions than at a typical branch. Job security is also a plus as there are always different opportunities within the company.
good,A nice place to work. That honors hard work and dedication. If you work Hard here you can advance here! I started out as part time unloading trucks. Transferred too maintenance department. Where I advanced due to my schooling to a management position.
good,"I learned a lot while working at Fastenal. A typical day consisted of receiving and shipping products, managing the store front, and delivering product to customers. Management and co-workers were professional to say the least. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with certain customers who are impatient, but it also came with great reward accomplishing these difficult tasks. The most enjoyable part would be the daily interaction with our top customers."
good,"Fast paced work place with supportive management. Many opportunities for growth and development within the company. Lots of unnecessary rules and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Fastenal is good company. Good opportunities for growth. Flexible hours and great training programs.The stress and pressure you have to deal with for growth and margin can break a lot of young guys and lead to bad turnover.
good,Fastenal is a great company where everyday is different and presents new challenges. One moment you can be presenting products and knowledge to a customer them the next you could be assisting a customer source product that meets certain specifications for the task they are wanting to accomplish. The hardest part of working at Fastenal is dealing with suppliers who do not meet their deadlines in supplying product to you so therefore you have to inform your customer that you were unable to get them the product that they need in time. Fastened is a great working environment that believes in decentralized management but also gives its employees a great amount of resources to accomplish any goal.
good,"You can move up quickly and increase your compensation but keeping it there is a struggle.  The pay structures make it hard to grow your income year over year or even keep it consistent.  You must move up or over in order to keep your pay the same. Great tools, great teaching/training, and decent structure."
good,I learned a lot of how to deal with things when things aren't going your way. This position really taught me a lot and helped get me through college. a typical day would consist of me scanning as much products as possible to the correct location ensuring accuracy.
good,"Fastenal is a good company to work for if you're young and looking to start a career. You don't need a college degree, and it helps your future tremendously. I left because I was transferred to a location with an unbearable manager. Overall, though, I loved working at Fastenal."
good,"Great place to gain experience in warehousing. Part time employees are regulated to 25 hrs per week but can find other opportunities through out warehouse departments. Advancement isn't easy requiring to show dedication and innovation, plus a business plan even for a lead position. Most of management has a laid back style of management. Internship here was useless because everyone was too busy to train, no mentorship, and poor structural integrity."
good,"Where I got my start in the world of business and learned so much from selling, presentation, marketing, production and research."
good,I worked my way from warehouse manager to general manager in just 3 years. I learned how to manage A warehouse and inventory control to maximize profits. I had great coworkers and sales people during my tenure. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers weather inside or outside sales. The hardest part of the job was the travel.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 7:30AM and includes a wide range of job duties, from receiving in a truck with store/customer product - to making sales calls, filling bin stock, creating Vendor purchase orders to handling accounts payable."
good,"Great work, poor management in some areas, not much time to idle, in-depth customer relationships"
good,Great Job to move up in. Work hard and become a manager and you will be set.
good,Great company to work for ! easy to go far in company if you are aggressive .
good,"I spent almost 14 years with the company and I advanced quickly, you have to be self motivated, honest and willing to sell."
good,This company offers a secure work environment with potential to move up.  The work day can take major turns and you never know what is going to happen.
good,"Inspect, estimate and repair all air and electric forms of tools and equipment. Perform vendor and manufacturer warranty tool and equipment repairs. Repair and service pneumatic equipment and tools  but not limited to nail guns, impact and pneumatic production tools. Ingersoll Rand, Chicago Pneumatic, Dewalt, Hitachi, Senco, Porter Cable, Stanley-Bostitch, and other pneumatic tool vendors."
good,You can learn a lot about the day to day business operations of a company with working at fastenal.
good,"My typical day at work started immediately upon arrival. I had so much to do daily that I couldn't afford to even take a break or lunch. I learned how to configure vending machines to house and vend a variety of industrial products and supplies. I learned quite a bit about all the products that Fastenal supplies and also learned how to use their computer system fairly well. My manager was hardly ever in the office, which left my co-worker and I to run everything by ourselves. There were only three of us employed at this branch:  the manager (who also did outside sales), the inside salesperson (who ran the store and the warehouse single-handed), and the delivery driver (me--I also did warehousing, inside sales, and purchasing). We managed to keep our branch profitable by managing our time wisely and putting forth the extra effort to work extra hard every day. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting that was required on a daily basis. My first day I had to unpack, check in, and organize by size 3000lbs of steel pipe fittings using nothing more than my body to do it. The lightest box is 40lbs. I think it was my manager testing me to see if I would come back to work the next day, which I did!"
good,"I throughly enjoyed my years with Fastenal, The work was fast paced and never repetitive."
good,"Work starts at 7:am open store and ready for customers, and take phone calls. make all deliveries lesion too customers needs. hardest part of the job is not finding the costomers needs. having fun why'll getting the job done. most ejoyable part of the job having team players.  "
good,I would show up to work and the first thing i would do is shipping and recieving of the products. Then I would do inventory. Once my GM and outside salesman would leave the shop. I would start answering phones and do our day to day sales.
good,"I packaged products for vending Machines. I learned to be more efficient by developing a routine. The management was very understanding and supportive, my co-workers were wonderful and easy to work with. The job involved some heavy lifting, but overall i really enjoyed my work."
good,A good company to start with and build a resume. Advancement within brings a lot of opportunityt and ability to move with the company throughout the country. You get to meet a lot of people and build relationships and network for other future employers.
good,"I was in a very industrial area when I was Outside Sales, which allowed me to run a very fast paced side. I enjoyed the personal business relationships formed through the many diverse customers that I acquired."
good,"Salary is fair, challenging, managers are awesome, you get benefits if you’re full time, as a part time some bonuses. Will be more successful if you are willing to locate, good company to over all."
good,Great place to work. Pay is low. There is opportunity for advancement if you are willing to put in the time. Plenty of training for the employees. I enjoyed my time with Fastenal.
good,Pretty good company to work for. Hard to move up to management. Pay is low for the amount of profit dollars created. Good place to start at the bottom and move up quickly.
good,Great company to work for and great people.  Hardest part is learning the computer system they have.  most of the job is self paced.  Everyone was always willing to help others.
good,Working at Fastenal was a good experience. I would recomend someone applying there. I wish i could have continued working for them. The people were great.
good,"A typical day at Fastenal is what you make it.  As part-time sales support you decide what you will do that day.  You are given direction, but it's up to you to keep pace with the rest of the team or set the pace.  Management does not micromanage you, but they will not give you raises or promotions quickly either.  Sheboygan Fastenal is fast paced, customer focused, clean, and fun.  The hardest part of the job is the monotony.  You find yourself doing the same daily/weekly tasks.  You need to find things to make/keep it interesting.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people.  They are friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and fun to be around.  If you don't have a sense of humor, you can't work here.  The most frustrating part of the job are co-workers who don't keep pace.  You MUST have a valid drivers license and no record, because even the part-time sales support team members are sent on deliveries, pick-ups and use a forklift.  One great thing, for a part-time job, NO WEEKENDS!  M-F, hours range from 6:30am - 5 pm, 4-6 hour shifts."
good,"The environment is nice and fast paced. While picking the orders they allow you to listen to music, the breaks are kind of short depending on how many hours you are allowed to work for that day."
good,I worked for a really good manager.  I think this can make all the difference in a job.  I know many other people did not have nearly as good of an experience as I had while working here.
good,"Overall, my time at Fastenal was beneficial. A fast paced environment where much needs to be done to run the store itself, prepare outgoing orders, deliver orders, answer the phones, clean the store, and manage inventory. A very multifaceted position in Sales Support, you will learn a variety of skills in a fast pace."
good,"Large amounts of inventory management and stocking/restocking type work. Expectation from customers that you will be an ""expert"" in all things industrial. I learned a great deal about the industry in my time there, especially as related to fasteners. Workplace culture is very goal oriented and very independent. You will be expected to work independently and without instruction once you are past your probationary phase as an employee. Most challenging part of the job was initially the learning curve. Prior knowledge of the industry will be very useful in this job. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, as it so often is."
good,"Fastenal is a great company, with the opportunity for advancement if you are willing to be flexible geographically. It is a fast paced and competitive environment. The company prefers to promote from within and invests a lot of resources into its employees"
good,"Lots of issues internally. Good place to gain career experience. Potential to make good income but corporate handcuffs the branch and other issues arise from this. Can make good income, but you will not fulfill the full potential of the oppurtunity."
good,"I started my machining career here. I worked here for almost a decade but life took me in another direction.  I have worked at many shops since then honing my craft and taking the knowledge I learned from Fastenal along the way.  I had a lot of great memories at the shop, my coworkers were the best crew of guys ive ever worked with and in this trade that is very hard to find.  Long story short if you want a career not a job and have the right attitude with a willingness to learn this company is a good fit."
good,"Nice place to work, promote within, nice people to work with, higher pay would be appreciated but I get by fine. My manager is hard to get in touch with since he/she is always in meetings"
good,"Great place to start a career and like other places if your willing to move around advancements will come a little easier. However, learning to work with less will become a daily struggle in terms of people. A typical day would start by receiving in product delivered by delivery truck, pack orders. Follow up on emails and make perpetration to visit customer and make deliveries. Return back to the office late in the afternoon work on quotes and orders received that day. Other daily task may include purchasing, inventory management, inside sales and general clean up of the store."
good,"nice relaxed atmosphere, fun management some parts were heavy work but other areas are nice and easy going. not bad salary as well as hours were standard . good overall experience"
good,i really like fasten as a company and I'm sure every store or branch is run differently. it really depend on what you want to do while working with this company but most likely in order to move into a position you want you may want top relocate but the pay is better than most and the environment is relaxed yet fast paced and competitive. i recommend this to anyone.
good,Not a difficult job but could get boring after a few hours. The people were nice and management was friendly. Could listen to music while I worked and not a very strict dress code.
good,"The average employee works at Fastenal for about 3 years. There is a great amount of training on product and sales techniques, so I really appreciated that. The management is margin and quota driven that the stress is felt thru ought the chain of command.(had to maintain a 55% margin and was docked 5% of commission for every point you fell below 55%)"
good,"It was okay. I am currently working here, but lately the job has been stressful. It is very difficult to get fired from Fastenal, and I have seen this evident in the fact that other employees should have been fired by now."
good,"its a good job for starting out, but all the money is made off sales that you make. you will find yourself working for someone else salary and not your own."
good,Fastenal has flexible hours and good work environment. Hardest part is the manual labor involved witht the job. It hard work but worth it. Most people are willing to help when needed.
good,"Always something different going on around that place, never know what you will be working on when you show up. Work had to be done fast as to keep up with the demands of the warehouse and loading docks."
good,"Great management that are flexible with all work/school schedules. Nice people who are there to work efficiently. A typical day consists of picking inventory, sorting those items accordingly, and working with others to ensure daily distributing goals are met."
good,Fast paced job but it is really easy and as long as you pay attention to detail and meet daily quotas then you will be successful at this establishment.
good,On a typical day at work I provide quotes to customers and constantly  answer phone calls and help both our customers and store while tracking customers shipment
good,Excelente empresa con una gran oportunidad de crecimiento
good,"I worked at Fastenal for quite some time before I had to leave for college. I learned a lot, made good money for a part-time job, and had fun while doing it."
good,"Flexible, Worked part time, fulfilled each other needs..many responsibilities, good people to work with, successful business, great deliveries, customer focused"
good,"En general los beneficios que ofrecen son mucho mejor que  bastantes otros trabajos, pero en si el ambiente laboral no es el mejor y podría mejorar bastante, aparte el trabajo en si es pesado ya que es muy físico la mayor parte del tiempo."
good,"Really enjoy the environment and coworkers, fast paced and can get competitive, supportive and encouraging management, great way to learn how a sales job can be"
good,There is a lot of interpretation when it comes to figuring out what mechanics want. You sales will be a direct reflection of the reliability of the service you provide to your customers.
good,"I received well rounded training that included AR collections, Purchasing, Inventory Management, Cost Saving Reporting, Value Stream Mapping, etc. Starting off in outside sales I quickly learned that I was given more responsibility than I would in most sales positions. Its a sink or swim company, you either have what it takes to succeed or you don't."
good,I worked for $7 hour for 2 years because I knew I would become management.  Then when that day came......I excelled! I was taught well and passed that knowledge on so that I could be promoted.
good,"Fastenal is an overall great place to work.  Very Sales oriented, fast paced depending on the store and location.  Tons of training available and there's alot of advancement opportunities if you're willing to relocate."
good,"receive daily freight, stock shelves, help in store customers, deliver product too job site customers, stock vending machines. It was a good part time job."
good,Decent Job with potential if you can move up to a high position. you do alot of deliveries and getting new sales can be easy or hard depending o where you live and the size of your store
good,"I work part time for Fastenal as an inside sales rep.  The outside sales reps and management team seem to be under great stress to meet sales goals.  Other than that, this is a great company to work for and I enjoy my job.  There is a small amount of heavy lifting required with this job but Fastenal provides tools and safety equipment to prevent injury.  You will stay busy helping customers in store, handling phones, and processing orders.  The very worst part about Fastenal is the lack of training on the Point of Sale equipment.  It is not user friendly."
good,Fastenal has a enjoyable atmosphere with very diverse customers. I got to Build and grow in customer relations in many different company environments.
good,Amazing salary and bonus structure.  could use more freedom for sales reps to tackle the surrounding markets.  My individual Branch manager was very narrow minded in this area.  Yearly Trip to sales convention in Orlando in December.  Lots of freebies from suppliers.
good,"Great job for any level, whether its college part time or a career. Typical day varies from opening the store to helping customers to going on sales calls. There's a lot to be learned from this job. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of work."
good,"The managers for the department I worked under were fantastic people. They did their best to make sure everyone was happy and comfortable, while keeping the workplace organized."
good,Fastenal is a very hard work company. Making sure that all customers are pleased with the best quality at all times. Even if you have to spend some time research items for certain clients.
good,I am constantly talking with customers who need certain parts. I take orders daily from the companies I travel to. I have learned procurement strategies and also I have learned a lot about customer service. My co-workers are all about the team and we all strive to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is finding specialized parts for customers and also meeting the ideal price on these specialized parts. I personally love fast pace environments where decision making is key and Fastenal offers this to me.
good,"Not a lot of customers would come to the store, maybe like 30 overall. It would get boring at times since the GM was not very good. I would of stayed had he got fired before I quit."
good,"Great place to work at. Good and easy work that can be done. learned somethings here, like how to drive a forklift all different kinds of them. Great people to work with. Hard part to my job was going and working in the back on the race track by myself. Enjoyed working on the race track with others. Most of all though would be driving forklifts."
good,This job is operated at a fast pace which requires a person to learn everything quickly. All of the co-workers are good people who are willing to help when they are needed. The managers are very good at making sure that the employees are able to do things correctly. The hardest part of the job is making everything is learned correctly in order to fulfill the company's needs. The most enjoyable part is that it's an open environment for the workers to communicate while they work.
good,Fastenal is a great opportunity for college students and people just out of college to gain valuable learning experience. The one negative is that you usually start out part time.
good,"Fast-paced workplace with great management. In a sales support role, you learn a little about a lot of things. You take inventory, pack deliveries, delivery packages, set up sales meetings for outside and GM of the individual store, and provide customer service to in-store customers. The hardest part of the job was probably learning about everything that was in the inventory. There is so much to know about the hardware industry and it is very tedious to be able to help customers with super specific needs. One awesome thing about starting a job at Fastenal is the potential for growth within the company."
good,"Fastenal is a great place to work for and always makes you feel accomplished.... However, they don't always pay the greatest."
good,Great experience for learning general operations.  It has given me the chance to try out different positions and in the end decide what I wanted to do long term.  I have truly enjoyed being an asset to my customers and getting to know all of them.  It takes a lot of dedication but can be very awarding.
good,"Stable company, good benefits, excellent room for advancement. Pay program is not so good, very long hours with not much reward for success."
good,"Great place to work, great staff and environment. Good balance on things outside of work, long hours and great management"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  Unfortunately the the industrial market diminished in my area and we had to close the store
good,"The days went so fast as I was constantly doing new things and learning new concepts.  I loved the fast paced environment.  The co-workers were wonderful and helpful.  I worked very closely with management including the CFO, Controller, and Assistant Controller.  I also had two associates underneath of me at the time I was there."
good,"I would visit about 20 customers per week and help them fulfill any industrial supply needs they have. "
good,Fastenal is a growing company. It is a busy atmosphere with always something to do. I lead a small group of employees. We receive in product and move it where it is supposed to go. The hardest part of the job is training new employees on where things go. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing everything that we get accomplished at the end of our shift
good,"It was a great place to start out at, I was able to learn a lot from great people.  Easy to advance if you're doing your job and willing to relocate."
good,"Friendly coworkers"
good,"A typical day starts between 5am and 10am depending on the shift that you get. Most days are started off by immediately starting to receive in product from the lines, working with little to no supervision. Some days though material handling could use some assistance and a couple or all of receiving help them. Putting product away in the racks is also how some mornings start, it all depends on what needs to be done. I've learned quite a bit from working at Fastenal. I've learned how to efficiently operate the programs used in receiving, including word, excel, and outlook mail. I've learned to communicate more effectively with other Fastenal HUB's and vendors. I've assisted in training new employee's and helping them get into the flow of the warehouse. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the pressure that is put on us when we are backed up in receiving. Also having to deal with moving heavy pallets, fixing pallets that are not properly stacked, and when packages/products are lost. The most enjoyable is when it is a productive today, a lot is received in and we are just that much closer to getting caught up."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty easy dont see how anyone cant do it, honestly."
good,"A typical day includes developing relationships with customers, you not only learn about their business, but their lives as well.  You have to develop a close relationship with co-workers since there are only a 2-3 people who work at a store."
good,"I was a truck driver for about 5 years. The pay was ok. Although it sucks if your new to the company.  But you get tons of vacation 2 weeks after your first year. And three after 5. 10 you get a month.  The Manager Pushed us To The limit. 70/8day week. I had to tell her not to call me to cover shifts after a while. She's gone now. The manager now is awesome to work with. Super nice guy. You will drive out of state and pick up backhauls. You won't be home very much if you have some certain routes.  But there are some that can be sweet runs. If you manage your time right. They have good benifits. If you work on the part time side...it's not so great. But it is what it is. A JOB. So if you work hard and don't complain all the time, check the website. You can advance quickly if your smart about it... IMO it's a great place to start a career. So get your CDL and you will make more than your boss.  Trust me!"
good,Fastenal is a well known supplier of industrial products with a diverse culture of employees.A decentralized management structure allows for quick action to change and modify local policy. A well run company with opportunity for growth.
good,"The store I was in was brand new, the district manager expected the sales to immediately go from $0 to $50,000. He was not helpful towards me or my store manager, It was always someone else's fault."
good,"As General Manager of a Fastenal location I am responsible for not only the Key Accounts within my territory but all the day to day management of a busy store front.  This includes P&L, inventory management, AR, employee training and motivating, goal setting and oversight.  "
good,"Broad array of products that helps you sell to a vast amount of customers."
good,Worked the 3am overnight shift. Didn't take long to learn the processes of my specific job.  Management is pretty good. They try to work with you on scheduling with school and give you days off when you need them.  I also work in Sortation in addition to Picking and split my shift between the two departments.  Alot of physical work but overall a pretty good job.
good,"While I am completing multiple daily store management tasks, I am helping customers as they call and enter the store. I've learned customer service in a sales oriented manner."
good,Fastenal is a great company with which to start your career. Exposure to a wide variety of industries and business practices. You are essentially the owner of your day and your success. Compensation leaves much to be desired and it is difficult to move up unless you are willing to relocate anywhere in the world. 
good,"Work can be fast paced depending on department, packaging was less stressful. Can be trained on SAP systems and duties of other departments. Management could need better communication. Co-workers are generally nice, but low morale. The hardest part is paying attention to certain details."
good,"A typical day at work would be come in, load product in the truck and deliver and stock it at customers site. Best part of my day is the interaction with the customer."
good,This was a good place to work with opportunity to grow and advance.
good,Working at Fastenal has a been a great experience professionally. I have learnt a great deal of skill and expertise while working here.
good,At first I was enthusiastic to work for a well known company. I worked as an associate product manager for over a year and when I wanted to go full time there was no opportunity for advancement for quite some time. Management was friendly and hours were extremely flexible.
good,There is no typical day. No need to plan because a wrench will be thrown into the wheel and you will have to reschedule. But that is what makes it interesting. The most important thing you will learn is making decisions on your own and not having to get a managers approval for everything.
good,"A typical day woud start by unloading yesterdays orders from pallets dropped off that morning, labeling and getting the orders for customers loaded onto trucks and be rolling by 7am deliver orders by 10am and going to get moreand hitting that days route by 1pm. Being done with route by 3pm and going after additional bussiness in that area by 430pm. Back to the office and getting all orders in by 6pm for the following day. Doing a store count in assighned area and leaving usually by 7pm. I left this because after growing the area and having my area divided twice I went after a better opportunity."
good,I had a good overall experience with fastenal. They allow you to be creative and your constantly working hard all day. I was able to learn a lot working for fastenal and now have the skills to run my own business if needed. I really enjoyed the experience.
good,"Great for people with family obligations. They offer part time, during the week, no nights, no weekends."
good,"Overall a good, secure job to have with decent benefits. The environment keeps morale up and has an energetic feel to it. There is a lot of opportunity to grow. The most stressful part is dealing with customers."
good,"Awesome company. Awesome co-workers. I learned everything I could from their in house/online sales training. After 9 years it has prepared me for the future. The salary is usually sub par for branch employees but the commission program helps to buffer that deficit. I was a Regional Sales Rep and maintained the same salary throughout my 9 years but averaged about 65K per year. I did that by working until 5 every day and not watching the clock. I wanted more, and as with any job it's all about what you put into it, and if you work for good District Managers and Sales Directors like I did you will thrive."
good,I enjoyed working there in the beginning but there was lack of Management. No support. A typical day at work was placing/expediting all purchase orders per customers request. Expedite purchase orders and implement cost saving strategies for customer.
good,"I honestly love the company. I regret not staying with them. They were so caring for my needs, but still let me get the hours I needed. Side note: I was a student in college so I’d have classes then go to work for about 4 or 5 hours after class. So I wasn’t full time while I was working there but they we super flexible, worked around my schedule and it was just a good experience."
good,"They gave me a chance for someone looking for a career in sales with no experience, so I can’t forget that. As I found later, the hands on job training isn’t the greatest. It felt like the  general manager didn’t have the patience and time to train very well. I was on my own in some situations. You can survive off the pay when you get sales commission towards the end of the month. It was fun and met good co-workers along the way, but not meant for a long-term career. Learned from a co-worker that it is very hard to get pay raises."
good,Fastenal overall is a great place to work. They have treated employees fairly and continue to drive through their missions and goals. They do stick to promoting from within as most people have to start at a lower entry level position to make their way up.
good,Fastenal was a nice entry level warehouse job. You learned that you wanted to keep up with others and finish quickly to excel. You had goals that you wanted to hit.
good,"The buildings are all fairly quiet, which leads to higher productivity. The middle line managers have some of the best management skills I have experienced. The company makes you feel like you are part of a family, even if that family doesn't always have competitive pay. Overall, I would recommend working here if you enjoy a more relaxed and quiet workplace that like to promote from within."
good,"It’s a lot of fun at fastenal, you work but also hang around and have fun with the co workers. It’s easy work especially for 16/h. They’re pretty lenient with taking time off"
good,"A fine place of employment, not very great for college students because they will need you to work 30 hours and that is challenging as a full-time college student."
good,"Branches consist of small teams: sales support, outside sales, branch manager. Each branch is different. Great internal logistics. Able to work independently."
good,"So I was one of their CDL drivers, and I would come in around 8p.m. as the loaders were just about finishing my truck.  For me, I lucked out cause I was able to get my own route and my own brand new truck within about 3 months.  My route, however was one of the longer ones.  500 miles round trip, with 6 stores to stop at.  Management was great to me, cause I never gave them a reason to dislike me.  Went in...did my job...went home.   All in all it was a good place to work(at least for me it was)"
good,"You learn a lot to organize, plan and execute."
good,With fasten you are at the mercy of your team members which ours had only 4 members at our branch. If your management is poor it can make for a not so ideal working situation. The work itself is highly rewarding and engaging.
good,Had fun work environment with very helpful management. Worked with my schedule needs as I became full time. Was responsible for my actions because I worked alone and got the jobs done .
good,"Fastenal is a good company to work for. The managers are kind and fun to be around,the employees are also fun and the work is time consuming and serious. People will have a very good time there and would like it very much. I would definitely prefer someone to work there"
good,"The jobs is very busy and stressful at times. However the managers are very hard working and are really relaxed, but when work needs to be done they are more pushy and making sure we are all working. Also they are great with making the job fit around your life so you can enjoy life outside of worker and not have to work 24/7. Over all fastenal is a great place to work."
good,"Work was regular, no surprises. Fast paced with constant lifting. Fair starting pay. Uniform was a company t-shirt and jeans with steal toe boots. In house gym!!"
good,"Fastenal was a great company to work for part time while in college because the hours were extremely flexible, due to the fact that they need help all hours of the workday. It was also fair because the managers would would not have you do any task that they wouldn't do themselves. The one drawback is that the pay is low and it is difficult to earn a commission in a part time sales role."
good,"All of the systems that the store uses are used by various companies. It is a unique experience that teaches people about teamwork, customer service and understanding people."
good,Ok pace to work. Lots of turnover. Focus was on margin not customer service. Most general managers are very young just cutting their teeth on being a leader/manager.
good,"flexible hours seamed to have everything together"
good,"Some managers were tricksters to achieve monthly sales goal. Stay away from those. However they were good managers as well with integrity, those you definitely want to surround yourself with. Great School of Business."
good,"I started out as a store clerk, and now I'm an inventory specialist given all the freedom I need to be an autonomous worker.  Some locations are better to work at than others, and you'd better be well versed on how to calculate profit margin and be able to sell as high of a profit margin as possible.  They do decent at recognizing hard working individuals and allowing the right people to advance.  Communication between stores can be a bit difficult at times and there are a few territorial issues between them, but you'll probably see that just about anywhere you go that has a competitive work environment."
good,"Commission pay in current role needs to be updated."
good,It is a great company to work for it is just not the right position for me. It can be very stressful at times if you are not trained well. There are advancement opportunities in my case I feel I advanced too fast which is part of the reason I am looking for a new job.
good,"Fastenal provides you with the sales tools to succeed in a competitive marketplace. The hardest part is gaining product knowledge in order to provide customers with answers they seek. Once you have a grasp on product and services you will then need to jump into a competitive field and win customers over. Depending on your book of business Fastenal can be a fast paced environment. If you are someone who likes a good challenge and are motivated by goals, there is a place for you at Fastenal. You work with team members to service customers and will rely on their help."
good,"This is a good place to work and I would recommend it to someone else. Just looking for something new. Not as fast paced as I would like, slow moving."
good,"Ok place to work very chill, tedious work part-time job. People are very nice here not a lot of drama. Just show up do your work is the attitude here . Management is okay but like every place can used a little Improvement."
good,"Typical day is busy; plenty of work to be done. Fastenal values teamwork, customer service and sales growth. Hardest part of the job is not enough hours in a day, but seeing a satisfied customer while utilizing the tools readily available is highly rewarding!"
good,"A typical day for me at Fastenal was to clock in.  Go to engineer and review certain job function that needed to be completed for a particular machine and program the CNC to do so.  Also run the machine.  Eventually i was intrusted to inspect various material at as many as 70 inspection points.  if defect was found, i was to document it and return engineers for secondary inspection and to process managers to recycle or scrap the material.  Hardest thing about the job was the standing and lifting.  the most enjoyable would be the crew members i worked with.  They taught me to be confident in my decision making and how to be task and goal oriented."
good,"Nice place to work. But the price of living goes up and they do not give raises that often. I’ve seen one in 9 years"
good,Fastenal took care of me. My boss was always helpful. We had a routean and an expectation for how each day should go. I liked all my co workers. Great job if you don't like sitting still. Always moving and talking with people.
good,I loved working at Fastenal. My husband still currently works there and my brother has been with them for 10+ years. I just got tired of the people I worked with. I like a work environment where everyone respects each other. I was the only female in the department which didn't bother me but they sometimes tried to run me over. I was part time and made $10 an hour which wasn't bad at all. I did get vacation/ personal days and I had invested into a 401k plan. Overall I would recommend Fastenal to anyone looking for employment
good,"Great company to work for a great chance for advancement. You will learn a ton of information on all different kinds of products and deal with all types of customers, but it can be stressful to find new business because it is a competitive market."
good,"Very structured organization, with many opportunities to advance. Serious about training. Managers were very accommodating and knowledgeable. A fast-paced, yet fun, place to work. Always something new to learn."
good,Fastenal is a good place to work if you're looking for job security but I wouldn't recommend if you are looking to make good money. You will do a lot of work and not get paid for what you do.
good,Best part of the day was getting to meet customers .  Hardest part of the job is making sure all deliveries are met on time.  The workplace is very fast paced.
good,"I enjoyed working at Fastenal, although it sometimes felt as if the right hand wasn't in tune with what the left hand was doing. The office I worked in had a very family-like atmosphere and we all got along great. Better communication from upper management would've been great, so that there could've problem prevention, instead of having to make all kinds of corrections. A lot of it was just normal office environment stuff. Overall, I loved my job and the people that I worked with."
good,The job is a Monday through Friday job from 8 to 5. A great place to start and opportunity to promote within. Job culture is typical of a manufacturing industry environment.
good,"This is really a company that can be used to build a good resume, or move up in the company fairly quickly. Also the people are very like able and friendly. I would recommend this job to someone but be prepared to work hard."
good,"As a manager I was left to pursue new business and operate within company guidelines to make the branch function profitable and to grow. "
good,Really my only complaint was compensation.  I understood it and couldn't really fault it other than it is the same no matter where you live.  The problem with this is that it doesn't cost the same to live everywhere.  My salary didn't provide a quality of life where I live.
good,"Good pay, not great. 9 1/2 hour days, every day. It could be worse but the job is relatively easy. The people you sell to need your products so it's usually an easy sell."
good,Typical day was going in getting orders that needed filled for the day filling those orders sometimes delivering those orders sometimes loading trucks
good,"I loved working here. Very fast paces, which i love. The people I worked with were great and the management understood you have a life outside of there."
good,"Good entry level position, comes with company truck. Long hours but can make solid money. Stay as a trainee for as long as possible so you can make solid overtime pay."
good,Fastenal is a good place to work. Fast paced environment with room to grow. Adequate training given to succeed. Management cares about you. Most employees easy to work with.
good,Hours are very flexible. Every semester I was able to readjust my work schedule to fit my classes. Was a great opportunity to make money while pushing through university.
good,I enjoy working for Fastenal. I've learned many new things since I have began working here. I feel very comfortable in this work environment.
good,The work environment is a nice friendly place. Ive learned many skills their. My co workers are great people. I enjoy most interacting with others in my job.
good,I worked for Fastenal close to 10 years ago.  I'm sure things have changed quite a bit since then.  It is fun working with local companies to help solve their problems and contribute to their products.  They have a vast product line and are immersed in their local markets.  Employees wear a lot of hats and get to experience a lot..
good,"Fastenal will ask a lot of you. Although confined to 9-5 hours, you are expected to run a store, a large book of business and adapt to a very high learning curve, often with little to no prior experience."
good,"My best experience which I never thought work . I learned about sales , quotations , deliveries and interact with clients and companies . I liked interacting with the public and offer our services."
good,If you are willing to work hard. Do the job right and are a quick learner you will love Fastenal. Given you have the willingness to go that extra mile then Fastenal is the company for you. The pay isn't the greatest but the potential is there for it to improve quickly.
good,"This was a very challenging sales market to be in as there are over one million products that Fastenal deals with. Fastenal also deals with more than 100 different types of businesses that all have different needs. I had to be knowledgeable in many different industries to be able to sell the products related to these industries."
good,"Lots of things to do in the day, hardest part of the job was driving the forklift to unload the trucks, management was good."
good,"Opening Store"
good,"Pretty good part time and is very flexible with school schedules. Its always room to grow if you put the work in."
good,"I learned how to make sales, order/ ship products all over the world, human resourcing, how a big company works inside and out."
good,"Typical monotonous warehouse work, same thing day in day out, great people to work with tho, most of management are good people. Many times of year strict on productivity. no full time positions but management and drivers, low pay."
good,"Started with the Fastenal Company in 1998 as outside sales rep when we first opened the Eufaula branch. Became store manager and grew business from $20,000 per month to $105,000 per month. Ordered stock and maintained adequate and accurate inventory through daily cycle counts for customers. Had to run business and was responsible for operating expenses as well as sales growth through customer service. Managed and supervised four employees and two store vehicles as well as maintained clean and safe work ethics and environment."
good,Fastenal as a company is a very successful company. They are debt free and grow an impressive amount every year. I think it is a great place to get your foot into the door of sales and to get yourself some experience in the field. You can grow very fast or you can stay at the same position the whole time you work there.
good,"Fastenal's work environment is excellent and very fast paced. Although it can be stressful at times, everybody that works at Fastenal loves their job, and that is truly what makes them an excellent company to work for."
good,Great company to begin a sales career. It is a highly competitive environment that rewards it's employees who work hard and are successful.
good,Busy workplace with new things arising daily.  You were always learning new things and people in this position.  New problems showed their faces very regularly.
good,"pick orders, order inventory, restock vending machines. friendly and helpful staff. Room to advance and grow. Would recommend it to others."
good,Strong company that will continue to grow no matter the strength of the economy. Everyone needs nuts and bolts. Decentralized decision making allows the employees to really think outside of the box.
good,"Good place learn and grow. Under good store management advancement is fairly easy. Very open environment to learn and ask questions if desired. Salary may not be as expected but time and keen eye for opportunities, expected income will grow."
good,With a year of experience as a Fast Solutions installer it can be said that the management is always willing to help and cares about the staff under him/her. The work atmosphere is fast paced and positive. The only downside is the lack of upward movement and inadequate compensation for work performed.
good,"Typically, I start work at 7:30am. I have a wide variety of tasks. Around 7:35 I receive in a truck (sometimes a van) of product that needs to be put into our inventory system. The product is then transferred to its proper location in the store. This takes anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. "
good,"started off out of college with a great salary, however, I was burnt out very quickly because of the long work days.  In general, sales is a very self-driven field.  This company makes you work 7-5 every day. I was pushing hard for 50 hours a week, rarely taking a lunch. Couldn't do it forever.  Great place to start though."
good,"Good place to work.  Everyday is different from the last with new challenges presenting themselves constantly.  As a Branch Manager, I am given complete responsibility for the business unit and ability to control it like it is my own small business. "
good,Typical day or work requires allocating products for customers.  Arrive at 6:30am and unload the product brought by the company semi.  Deliver the product once it has been sorted and packaged.  Great experience of sales from a part-time standpoint.  Hardest part of the job is learning all of the different parts and product that Fastenal offers.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly environment that the staff offers.
good,"I have worked at Fastenal's Indianapolis DC for about 7 months now and have to say it is a really great place for a College Student to get some hands on experience while in his studies. They give you the opportunity to learn the ropes and expand your skills a qualifications in any way you want. "
good,"I had a very repetitive job while I was at Fastenal.  But there was a lot to learn about it.  I did reports, inventory, and paperwork management.  It was the start of my warehouse experience and knowledge.  The management there was great and understanding of whatever needs you had. The co-workers were very hard workers and were always willing to help.  The hardest part of the job was having to find the lost product that wasn't in the inventory.  And the most enjoyable part of the job was doing a hands-on job and staying busy."
good,"Great place to work, a typical day includes identifying needs and wants of new and existing customers and finding products to best fit their needs."
good,gets annoying doing the same things over and over day end and day out.
good,"A typical day at work I spend invoicing, quoting, inventory management for customer locations and the store, and also bringing new business to the company. As an outside sales you have to keep constant customer contact with a very wide variety of customers and present new options for better business. At times you will have to do collections on account to receive payments, you will have to source products from vendors all over the country, perform logistics tracking, and submit purchase orders."
good,"I had a great manager at the store level. Learned a ton about the products the company carries and they are very big on training and safety. My experience with the district level management, if you like to play golf and hit the bars regularly you will probably go far. You need to fit in. To spite the cons It was a great company to work for."
good,"Nothing to report Typical Manufacturing job, work 4th shift"
good,"Fast pace job within a rapid growing environment, fun and rewarding."
good,Great Customers and co-workers. Love going out to sell to customers. Love my customer relationship that walk in daily as well to get them the product they need and think they need. Find the products that they are not sure where they can find them or what it is that they are looking for.
good,"I supported the Disneyland Resort and being able to work closely with those people day in and day out was the best part of the job. I spent 75% of my time inside the park in meetings or replenishing their bins.  Every once in a while, I was lucky enough to get on a ride or two before the park opened."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you have a strong work ethic, can think on your feet, and have a competitive drive to succeed."
good,Not much to say about this job other than it was extremely challenging and everyday was a learning experience. 
good,"I spent 4 years with Fastenal, staring as a part time in-store support, then promoted to Outside Sales, then again to General Manager. Throughout my tenure there I was trained on product knowledge, sales skills, management techniques, and all encompassing industrial market knowledge; putting those skills in practice day to day, maintaining and growing a strong customer base, driving sales and running a profitable business."
good,"I enjoy my job, I have worked with many people with many types of personalities, Fastenal has a huge turnover because of school kids. I've worked in several departments familiarizing myself to how the company functions."
good,Very easy company to work for. seems to care about family. room to grow within the company
good,I worked with fastenal and was advanced quickly in the company i should have stayed longer. if you want to work then you will be compensated
good,Great pay and benefits package. friendly environment and management is easy to work for
good,"Really great place to start a career. The people I work with are really great. Very flexible hours, you can go in anywhere from 7-9. Fastenal is a very stable company with good job security."
good,Trabajar en Fastenal fue una oportunidad laboral positiva laboral
good,It’s great hours as in Monday through Friday job and no weekends. If your capable of taking and filling customer orders then it’s not a bad place to work.
good,Good Group of people to work with. Good benefits and fun travel. Great managers and they help teach you a lot about what they know. Fun and challenging projects with a lot of room to express yourself.
good,"I have worked for this company in several positions, each offering a new challenge and pay increase. Left because of an on job injury, but was blessed with a chance to return after recovering."
good,"Fast paced sales environment that is very goal oriented with lots of hands on opportunities for the employees, as well as a different day to day routine"
good,"A typical day at work includes arriving at work, Changing into clothes and looking at the list of things that needs to be done. Taking calls, assisting walk ins, deliveries and packing orders."
good,te daban la oportunidad de desarrollar las habilidades necesarias.
good,Fastenal overall is a good company to work for. There is certainly room for advancement. Once you get in to an OSR or management position you do get to travel.
good,Great place to get started in sales with many ways to grow in company. Fastenal does train it’s employees and compensating is fair. Again great place to get started in sales with a career path set from within.
good,"Their pay system is a mess. You'll never know what you got paid for, or how. every paycheck it's different even though it's supposed to be salary for drivers and you are supposedly paid a salary plus miles plus stops.  None of this is broken down so you can see if you're paid correctly or not."
good,Enjoyed the work and customers immensely. Only advance if you have a degree or are a college student. Overall my GM was awesome and so were my co workers. Never a boring day because their was always something to take care of.
good,It’s a good job. Just not the best fit for me. Not very much into construction and things like that. I like working Monday through Friday but wish I could work overtime to get more pay because they pay the wrong people the wrong amount of money
good,It was a great job to learn and but not to excel.  If you do not have a degree and are willing to wait for opportunities to arise you will do just fine.
good,"I enjoyed working there, but the work itself is boring. I wasn't challenged enough while I was there. I always went above and beyond and was never rewarded for it."
good,"It was a typical work day. Worked around 9-10  hours a day. Did shipping and receiving, helped customers, made deliveries. Managed staff. This is a decent company to work for."
good,"Each branch is ran independently, but the culture encourages its employees to strive to work hard and to learn new things. You learn a lot about construction and manufacturing industries, business to business relationships, and internal warehouse operations."
good,I enjoyed working for Fastenal. Management is supportive and professional. Job duties are easy to understand. My mathematical skills have improved over the period of my employment.
good,Fastenal really invests in its employees with many opportunities to learn both in a classroom and in the field.  Essential to find branch with great mgmt
good,Working here PT. Relaxed work environment. Opportunity to move around/up if you want. Internal jobs posted regularly. Very flexible/accommodating for students and Reserve/NG soldiers.
good,"A typical day consisted of each employee completing his/her daily responsibility, usually split by morning and afternoon. The work was busy but usually not stressful."
good,Was a good place to work but at some point you will top out at a position with no where to go or if you are a specialist you can easily become a scape goat for the managers to blame when things are not going well.
good,I held several positions within the company.  Fastenal is a resourceful company who strives to train their employees well though does not focus much on employee retention
good,"Un gran lugar para aprender de la industria en general, desarrollar habilidades administrativas generales y educarse en difererntes disciplinas. Excelente lugar con estabilidad laboral y grandes oportunidades de crecimiento a una velocidad muy rápida."
good,"Most positions have a set of tasks to be completed daily, as long as you stay on top of it, its fairly easy.  And you can always ask a colleague for help.  they will provide all training for the position you are in"
good,Great company to work for if you are seeking flexibility and a chance to make a decent amount of cash. Tend to be more desirable for college students.
good,Always something new and new problems everyday. Hard to hit production numbers as half of the equipment is broken and dated. Job security is really high though.
good,"Overall it was good way for me to learn about industrial sales.  It was a good addition to my resume.  It was a very informal company that was very focused on controlling expenses,"
good,"Technology and quality management techniques where great at Fastenal Company. They offered very competitive pay and work balance. At times this was stressful, but overall it was well worth it."
good,"I enjoy the ability to help people every night through answering calls, taking issues from people via chat and email. I also enjoy the variety of work that is done every night."
good,Great company to work for who promote from within. Monday To Friday 7.30am-5pm which offers a good work life balance. Very good training program. Average pay and benefits for the industry with commision paid for F/T employees. You often get back what you put in.
good,"This company is an exceptional company to work for. You will always receive motivation for growth in your career. Lots of training and support from the district and company. "
good,"Strong company. Been around awhile. Tons of locations, great opportunities to move up or around the country. Sales driven, but what company isnt? Overall good company."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the autonomy that the company afforded the employees. There were plenty of opportunities for advancement, but the location closed."
good,The ability to make make commission is based off of your motivation to find the next customer and your ability to service your current customers. Fun atmosphere to work in if you enjoy sales. The ability to generate a schedule that works for you and your customers is a bonus.
good,Everyone here is pretty laid back but knows when to get work finished. customers are great management is reat what more can you ask for in an awesome company
good,Fastenal allows me to manage daily operations with little to no interaction.  Hit sales goal and margins and the DM and RM leave you alone.  Collections of past dues are a second priortity to sales.
good,"Was there for nearly 2 years, and it was one of the better jobs I've had. Perfect if you are a student who wants a low stress job. Only uniform items are a company provided t-shirt and ballcap."
good,I enjoyed working here overall. The people were great and I had autonomy to manage my area in my way. The employees were great also. The most enjoyable part of this job was definitely the people.
good,is fast paced but laid back at the same time. good benefits and good schedule with career advancement available to those that are looking for a career
good,I loved working at Fastenal. Anyone who wants to achieve personal growth is given that opportunity through corporate training and giving their best.  Work/family balance is difficult at times.
good,Great company to start out with in sales.  They will teach you everything you need to know and you can use them as a stepping stone to a great career.
good,Good job with opportunity for advancement.  Product knowledge is paramount.  Must be well versed in product offerings and applications to be successful.
good,"build hardware kits, deliver parts, order parts. The people I worked with were very easy to work with, was a very small staff. everyone easy going and fun environment."
good,"Freedom to run your business as if it were actually yours.  Not for everyone which is why there are always opportunities for advancement."
good,i love working there nothing bad to say about it would tell anybody to work there its a really great company like it really is!its very down to earth and easy going
good,Working here has been a very good job. Easy work life balance at part time and easy to learn. The biggest con at my location was poor management which caused a lot of problems.
good,Great early career experience in sales management and running a branch store. District Manager was an excellent coach/mentor/ teacher. I enjoyed the responsibility thoroughly.
good,"Worked on my own, very satisfyingI enjoyed the coworkers and the job itself, self reliant to complete tasks on time."
good,"it was hot working in a warehouse, but the staff was very friendly and tried to make it as comfortable as possible for the employees. I would recommend this place for temporary work"
good,A good company to work for with a growing and competitive place in the industrial supply field.  Primarily managed from the local level servicing markets that are primed for growth.
good,"great first sales experience "
good,I worked for Fastenal during the past few summers. I had a relatively unusual role with the company as I was there for general support which basically means I was responsible for any tasks that I was told to do. This did lead to a more interesting experience working here as no two days were exactly the same. I was always doing something new. Whenever I needed there was somebody there to show me guidance and assist in my projects. Overall it was a fast paced and enjoyable work environment. I would recommend working here to anybody.
good,Fastenal was a great start to my professional career.  You get a taste of the professional world and your time there is what you make it.  You can take control and advance or just get by.
good,I do not remember much about working at a warehouse part-time 25 years ago. Why isn't there a stop button on your program? I had no desire to do this type of work. it was a part-time temp job. I did a good job despite.
good,"Buena empresa para laborar, con buenos cursos para capacitarse"
good,Good Company to work for. Good Work/Life balance. Customer service focus. The company makes sure the employee knows that they are talking about when it comes to materials.
good,"It was a challenging place to work for just due to the fact that we had national accounts in our location and we would have to travel into Mexico to take, maintain, and restock materials for them.  Overall it was challenging because we always wanted to give the best service."
good,"A cargo de toda la cadena de suministro de varios clientes, es necesario tener una excelente organización de tiempo."
good,I would work there again.  I don't know why Indeed.com requires a minimum of one hundred fifty characters to fulfill this field and I don't have much to say.
good,I worked there through college and really enjoyed the people I worked with and the manager was very nice about letting me off when needed for school or family events
good,"I personally worked at the Oshkosh Defense Fastenal location and because of that there were strict rules to what you had to wear (steel toed boots, eye protection, hard hats, ear plugs, etc) "
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and opening the store up and helping the customers to the best of my abilities. Management was very well here and very understanding to work with. nothing bad to say about this company.
good,Helping customers finding what need like the right hardware for their home projects and work projects. Taking sales orders for the customers. Understanding their needs as well
good,"The hardest part of working at Fastenal is that you have to sort several skids before your workday can be completed.  You have to work as a team to get the job finished before you can leave.,  This means waiting for all drivers to get back."
good,A very competitive and highly emotional job. Not so much with the people that work at Fastenal but with the people that hold the accounts with them. Beware if you have soft skin
good,"Great Stability for their employees"
good,"Un dia tipico es recibir en sistema material, cotizar mediante correo a clientes, entregar material solicitado, facturar, cobrar dicha factura, resolver problemas técnicos como los envíos o detalles que surjan en el proceso de una compra y darle avances a un proyecto de ventas."
good,Great place to work. If you had an establish customer base you will do great. Good pay and the more you sell the more you take home. I recommend working for this company.
good,"A typical day at Fastenal for a part-time employee is helping full-time employees. Managers are typically very nice, appreciate help, and aren't too strict."
good,"A typical work day starts by receiving in the delivery from the truck and stocking the items in the shelf , after words I print up a packing slip and deliver the items to the customer. After words I do a cycle count of the inventory and place orders for customers."
good,When working part time they were willing to work with my schedule to accommodate me. They had a good bounce incentive that helped people the achieve their goals for the day.
good,Working at receiving for Fastenal I was in charge of making sure orders get received in properly. I also expedited parts to their proper locations within the warehouse.
good,Good place to work. Good people. You get stuck in a role here and have little room for advancement until people leave. However people leave often as they don't pay that well on the top end. If you have some schooling in machine tool technology and want to learn your craft though its a good place to start.
good,"The hours are good and the staff is nice to work with. A typical day for me would involve cycle counting and managing stock levels within the warehouse before going on-site to one of our customers. "
good,Work schedule was very flexible and the culture made it easy to love the job. Management worked just as hard if not more than the person beside them. Felt more like family than an employee.
good,"A typical work day consists of, unloading the truck, receiving inventory, logging it into the system while applying the right customer labels to each product. Those items not brought in for customers must then be put in stock and placed on the right shelf. You must answer phone calls and help customers find the right product for the intended use.  Emails are also a responsibility.  You must complete training before you can do any hands on tasks, but your coworkers and managers are there to help you through it.  The team is very friendly and are there to help and support each other.  If you are in school it is a great job to have as it offers flexible hours for a part timer."
good,"I loved working here in college, they were very flexible with my class schedule. Met some good friends here aswell. Typical work day was go to class, drive to work, then drive back to class. Never work past 5."
good,"Really enjoyed my job, I interacted with customers daily inside and outside on deliveries. If you learn quickly and follow protocol you will do well. Pay was decent but got much better with advancements."
good,"Put your heart and soul in to whatever role you assume and you'll be rewarded directly based off of your efforts.  Great initial training to get you started, what training you do after your intial 90 trial period can only build up your value to the company.  Again, you reap what you sew.  Good luck!"
good,Great culture. You learn about different widgets and how other industrial business work. You will coordinate with other stores and learn logistics at its finest

good,"A typical day at work was taking care of customer - orders, shipments, returns, bids/quotes, and deliveries. I learned how to interact with customers and gauging what products they may need. I also learned how to make cold calls, how to manage time effectively in order to manage all outside customers. Co-worker worked as a team - even though the team was small, it was effective. The hardest part of the job was time management, considering the volume of customers vs. employee ratio. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ever-changing atmosphere."
good,Enjoyed the people I work with. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the items they sell. fun and laid back environment.
good,"In the picking department we are working hard and efficiently. Allowed to listen to music while working. I've learned to increase my attention to detail with my work. The managers vary in personalities. Some are firm and tough while others are laid back and silly. In all it's just best to do your work and be productive. My co-workers in my department are college aged, young, and full energy. The work can be quite tedious because of the pressure placed on accuracy and speed. What's most enjoyable about the job is that it's a very flexible and works around class schedules. Allowed time off when scheduled in advance. Weekends off."
good,Love working here it's part time and they work around your hours. The supervisors are great and so are the employee. Nothing is hard about the job at all.

good,"Es una empresa en la que se puede aprender bastante y a la vez crecer rápidamente, un excelente ambiente laboral, trabajo bajo presión y consume la mayor parte del día, la recompensa puede ser muy buena, pero naturalmente al ser pagado por comisión a veces puede no ir tan bien, ya que la calculadora de comisiones castiga mucho el salario hacia el vendedor, esta mucho mas inclinada a la empresa que al empleado y es muy fácil dejar de recibir beneficios por factores fuera del alcance del especialista de cuenta."
good,"	Managed 10-25 workers as well as hired and discharged employees"
good,"•	Established more business for Fastenal in my sales territory "
good,While working at Fastenal I ensured that customers were able to find the material they needed as well as delivered products to customers.

I really enjoyed working here because I was able to meet people and help them with whatever they may be needing in their visit that day.

good,A good company that offers plenty of room for professional and personal growth with experience in management and industrial sales environment.
good,"Great company with great job security. Decent pay, good opportunity for college students and those working on academic pursuits."
good,"Fastenal is a good company that offers real-world business experience for college students and advancement opportunities once you prove yourself. The work can be dull at times unless you have a real passion for selling industrial and construction supplies, but you get what you signed up for. It's really all about your coworkers and the G of the location that you work at. Some are great and some are self-centered and brutal to work with,"
good,"Fastenal is the kind of company you work for when you're just starting out as a machinist. You can get hired on at school, and you can really see what a production shop is all about immediately. It's really easy to find out if this is the career for you. The management team at the California shop is top notch. Friendly. Helpful. Understanding of life's curve-balls. If there is one knock against Fastenal it's this: Fastenal is sadly a little more frugal than their employees would like, so moving on from Fastenal to another shop is almost a necessity if you want to make really good money."
good,"- Great place to grow as a BTB professional"
good,clean work environment easy going well maintained employees flexible with students and hours great benefits and competitive pay
good,"Physical, but easy work. Coworkers and management are amazing. They work around your schedule, so it's great for college students like myself."
good,"A typical day at Fastenal includes me pulling inventory off the shelves to be loaded into the customer's vending machines by the sales representatives.

good,Excellent place to work.  Learned many things about industrial supplies while I was here.  Good benefits and good atmosphere.
good,"Fastenal is an overall good company to work for.  They pay you for your performance.  If you get more sales, then you get more money.  They provide the tools needed to get the job done, but they push you as far as they can.  Enough is never enough.  They run on as few amount of employees as possible.  Often times this leads to you being overworked or sales decreasing."
good,I started my sales career at Fastenal and was able to identify my strengths and weakness' and they were willing to help me in any way I could. I left Fastenal with a  sharpened skill set that set me up to take on any sales role I wanted.

I also learned how to use RF scanners, pallet jacks, manual forklifts and propane forklifts. the staff and management were really nice and friendly so were co-workers. the hardest part was when there wasnt enough work to do slow times."
good,A typical day includes servicing existing clients with custom product and implementation solutions to fulfill their needs.
good,A typical day at work would include working in spurts and organizing things before it is actually time to load the trucks so there is a little bit of free times in between but if you don't use it wisely to get yourself ready then it will be a long hard night. I learned a lot while I was there I learned how to drive and operate forklifts I learned the differences with cdl and non cdl trucks and how they can and have to be loaded differently as far as the amount of weight is concerned. Management here was very fun to work with as well as understanding of particular situations that may arise when at a workplace. Hardest part of the job was being timed and having a very short window of how much time you had to load a truck sometimes but not all the times was it like that. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were finished and you printed that ltr and the report was empty meaning that you did not miss anything.
good,Manage 2nd shift tool room working by myself with little supervision. Hardest part of the job is not hard and the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the maintenance team helping them with their daily task.

good,"There are 4 full time employees at my branch, and would consider each a friend. They are supportive, and we communicate well. The customers are very easy going and understanding most of the time, as long as you work to satisfy their needs. Compensation and benefits are mediocre, but the convenience and easy-going environment are just about worth it."
good,"Fantastic company to work for, management is extremely laid back and understanding Incase of an emergency. Starting wages are good for what you are required to do"
good,"overall a great place to work. I learned how to drive forklifts there, the management there is great."
good,"Only quit because of school and the distance away from where I live currently, other than that great place to work. Got a lot of sales experience and my coworkers were great."
good,"I was able to work part time while going to school at Fastenal. I learned so much at this job in the short time I worked there about dealing with customers and getting them what they want/need. Good place to work, friendly co-workers and great management."
good,"The only negative I experienced was termination out of the blue, with no prior disciplinary process, no offer of PIP, etc. I found out that virtually all OSP employees in my District were let go. Shortly after, we were informed that the District Manager who had terminated us all had embezzled and misappropriated funds, and was terminated himself. Meanwhile, all of us were labeled unhireable."
good,"Fastenal has an excellent training initiative called ""Fastenal School of Business"". They provide you with all the information and resources you need to succeed in your position."
good,Great company to work for however the rate of pay was not what I expected and the job was too laid back. Other than that overall company is growing but no room for advancement.

good,Good job with up to date equipment.  Good co-workers.  Someone always available to answer questions.  Nice home time.  Can be strenuous at times (construction equipment).
good,This job was perfect me. I will worked there while I was in school and it was great. They are very flexible to school schedules and the job is not hard at all
good,"Pick stickers, do trainings, deliver product to customer. "
good,Working in the warehouse was a nice and relaxing time. Working in the shop was an exciting time and very educational. The hardest part of the job was the weather there was no AC but they did very well circulating the air through the whole warehouse.

I have learned many skills such as problem solving and independence. The workplace is overall a really relaxed atmosphere and the management is super understanding of my hours with school.
good,"no complaints, other then the health insurance did not include vision if you not afraid of working then this job really fits you. enroll in the 401k program it's good to have with this company"
good,Good bunch of people. Management is a good group. Everyone works well as a department to get the trucks unloaded and loaded on time for the drivers to leave.
good,I love working at Fastenal but the hours for the part-time aren't very good and the pay isn't very good at all. I would be more willing to stay at the company if it was easier to promote or if they raised the pay of part-time.
good,"Overall positive experience. Management was excellent in the location I was at (Ada, OK). I would highly recommend working for this company if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"Good place to work, A very sales motivated company, if your not selling your out, Management was good, lot of opportunities to travel and go to events"
good,Excellent entry level position for anyone willing to learn about sales and developing interpersonal skills with customers and managing different accounts.
good,Best part about this company is by far the people. I enjoy the work I do and the customer base we work with is enjoyable and rewarding. I would recommend this company.
good,"Management is easy to work with. Job is M-F daytime. No stress environment that allows for as much or as little initiative as personally desired. Supportive, enjoyable coworkers.

good,"Tiene sueldos competitivos, y la posibilidad de crecer rapidamente."
good,Good place to work but the money could be better. I would recommend to the salesman looking to gain experience. Great company to learn how to sell effectively.
good,"I enjoy working in new environments, learning new fields, and love meeting new people.  Fastenal has provided me all the above.  I enjoy coming in early in the morning, preparing my day based on client needs, loading up the truck, and being out most of the day conducting business.  Everyone from Fastenal I've come in contact with has been very friendly and eager to help me and others.  My co-workers at my store have become more than that, we're a close group and always willing to help each other.  Our General Manager leads by example and teamwork is at the top of his list.  The most challenging part of my job is all the thousands and thousands of parts Fastenal carries or can get.  Not a day goes by that a costumer comes in asking for an item I've never heard of.  I look at this as not only a learning experience but also a challenge.  Certain items might take hours, days, or in rare cases a week to find, order, and deliver to our clients."
good,They have a lot to teach about life and business. Fastenal has really taught me a lot. I would recommend it to a friend. They offer a wide variety of jobs from sales support to tech.

If your persistent, motivated, and determined you can become very successful in any position you choose to apply for. Become organized and efficient and grow through the company."
good,Fastenal is a great company. It has helped me grow and evolve into the employee I am working to be. They provide me great knowledge that allows me to think and solve problems on my own.
good,"The daily workload was very manageable, but the monotone routine can be frustrating. The first couple of months were very educational and I was taught all the important procedures to ensure smooth operations. The management is great in communicating their goals and have a good understanding about employees needs. Co-workers were friendly and helpful in the beginning, but this being a commission based company relations could get heated. The most enjoyable part of the job were the daily interactions with customers and their appreciation for a job well done."
good,Team oriented hard working team. Working under pressure and meeting deadlines from day to day. I have learned have to manage people accordingly.
good,"A typical day consists of opening the store at 7, receiving in stock, putting stock away and making deliveries.  Along with helping walk-in customers and answering phones."

good,"Sometimes the various initiatives can cause your time to be spread thin."
good,"Work days varied job to job. I learned about precision tools such as calipers, micrometers, lathes, CNC Lathe programs, blueprint reading. Management was terrific to work with. "
good,Fastenal was a very safe enviroment with great co-workers. An average day had little to no stress and was always a fun place to work. The hardest part of the job was keeping everything in order and helping all the customers at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was gettting to know the customers who came in on a regular basis.
good,"It is a base plus commision job neither is that great. Could definately use more. Love the people I work with and the pace. long days but they usually go by quickly. Office at a branch and perform the daily tasks in there when not making sales calls. These include shipping and receiving, waiting on customers, stocking merchandise, cash proof, etc"
good,"I have developed superior problem solving and conflict resolution skills. My daily goals include delivering excellent customer service on every level, meet daily deadlines, and effectively manage all aspects of operations. Multi-tasking, exceptional organizational skills, data analyzing, planning, highly competitive environment with training offered to help new and tenured employees equally."
good,The job is well-paced and the work place is enjoyable. Most of the day is dealing with customers and taking deliveries which can be a hassle but overall it is an awesome place to work.
good,"A typical day at work would be me arriving at 7 AM since I took afternoon classes. I'd start off by getting inventory ready to go out to customers, and receive any UPS that might have arrived the afternoon before. Then, our truck would offload all the product that would either be allocated or go on the show floor."
good,"I started working here through an internship program and was hired on full-time within 2 months.  It's definitely a lot to take in at first but once you get the hang of things, it's a pretty consistent schedule and if you're working part-time, it's really not a lot of work, not hard work, and you get compensated well.  They work around your school/personal schedule, everyone is super easygoing and it's a great gig for those still in school, or those who just graduated. There's a lot of moving parts so my only complaint is not having enough staff for the work that needs done, but we always manage to get it done."
good,"Coworkers were very friendly and always willing to help out the newer drivers"
good,"Never had a problem requesting off for personal reasons. The managers were very understanding. The fellow employees were kind, everyone tended to keep to themselves and to the task at hand."
good,I left fastenal because it was only about 4 hour days and it just wasn’t enough at the time. Far as the work style and the people I worked with I liked it a lot it was really nice.
good,"En los año que labore con ellos aprendí mucho de como manejar cuentas y clientes,como hacerlos mas potenciales,el proceso de pedidos y manejos de transportación marítima y aérea,conocimientos de tornilleria y  materiales de construcción."
good,the work place had a great culture. Everyday i came in happy and ready to work. the managers made sure that everyone were well prepared throughout the day.
good,"It is a great place to learn lots about manufacturing and hardware. "
good,"En esta empresa tienes la oportunidad de crecer a medida que vas dando resultados, tienen un buen sueldo base, pero las comisiones dependen mucho del margen y los históricos, aún cuando los clientes ya hayan sido atendidos desde 5 años atrás. tú te encargas de todo, visitar al cliente, cotizar, si no tienes el material lo cotizas externamente, generas orden de compra, se lo entregas al cliente y te encargas de la cobranza, tienes que ser muy dinámico y si te toca un gerente que no apoya, termina por afectarte. Hay un excelente sistema de capacitación, en verdad, excelente. En el área donde estaba si vas creciendo dentro de la empresa, disminuye mucho el tiempo libre, valora si vale la pena, incluso puedes ocupar los domingos a estar viajando."
good,"I team drive a dedicated route, which has worked out well, which is not always the case.  Home time is decent and consistent.  Though Fastenal claims its pay is competitive, it should be higher and pay raises are minimal.  The traffic and fleet managers are fair and do the best they can with their hands tied.  The relief drivers are often stretched thin because Fastenal, like so many companies today, is chronically short drivers, likely due to their pay rate in a highly competitive industry.  The trucks are well maintained and there is very little slip-seating.  Communication is decent, though there is room for improvement.  Overall, I give it a 4 out 5."
good,The work environment at Fastenal was good and they have high quality managers that provide you with high quality work in a relaxed stress-free environment.
good,"Fastenal is a great company to work for! Everyone helps each other when they are in need, without complaining. I will say a lot of my success has came from my manager! I thank her everyday!"
good,"very fast paced and competitive. there is a lot of pressure to succeed and if you focus, you will succeed. customer interaction is usually good but there are always some bad eggs. overall good comapny"
good,"overall, a good place to work, just didn't pay very much.  very flexible with hours though.  great college job.  management is excellent, coworkers easy to get along with, laid back but fast paced culture. and again, great management."
good,At Fastenal we welcome everyone to come into the store and we will help them as much as we can. The job could be stressful because of everything that has to be done everyday. We try our best to get all our deliveries done and get everything inside the store done each day before it is time to leave.
good,"Fastenal to me has been a great job for the most part, they give you great opportunities for training so you can better assist in your roles, the only issue I've run into (it may just be my district) is that there's no a whole lot of room for advancement especially for women, with that being said the company as a whole is amazing and the pay is worth what you're going through. I just hope in the future that the company doesn't hold women back solely because we are women."
good,Fastenal is a very chill and relaxed place. Everyone is very understanding. Your allowed to have a very flexible schedule. Sometimes things can be hectic but not all the time.
good,"Great moments to build and grow the business. "
good,"Amazing manager that could always make us work our hardest, strive for the best. Appreciated all the hard work and always open to new ideas that have to do with the store improvements. Makes sure that everyone is happy working together at the store. Co-workers are amazing and can cover for each other when needed."
good,Manager sets and amazing example in work ethics and treats his part-time employees as equals. Respects school hours and your opinions about some things that could be changed at the workplace. Pushes us to strive for our best. I learned a lot of things related to my job as well as life from my manager. Co-workers very friendly and helpful. We cover for one another when needed.
good,"this company is a good company to work for, competitive wages but not many hours. management varies from store to store and so does work load."
good,"Work with great coworkers and work well as a team. Received a promotion due to hard work. Upper management recognizes hard work and will reward you, respectfully."
good,"Fastenal was a great place to work, had great management from district level up to executive level.  Very competetive industry, all about building relationships and earning business."

good,"Working at Fastenal has helped me gain a lot of experience and knowledge to move forward with my career in sales. Working here has helped me learn how to efficiently and effectively manage inventory. I have also learned how to connect with customer's and build upon those relationships to further the company's goals. "
good,"Many days were great, some were bad.. typical job. My co-workers made the day better. Work was sometimes slow and boring. Learned alot from others and was able to advance quickly."
good,Bosses are very easy to work with and are truly there to help you in anyway. Branch was somewhat short staffed so you get thrown right into the mix and is a great way to learn from the bottom up of a company. I enjoy working in the Industrial Supply field and see an opportunity to make good money as a salesman in the industrial supply field so Fastenal is a good place for me to get my feet wet.
good,"Each day new challenges were given related to sales to enable the office to reach their weekly/monthly/annual targets.  Focus was sales but remembering to keep the place tidy and pleasing to the eye of the customer.  Learned to use their inventory computer system, Point of Sale equipment and completed all of the company required training. Management and co-workers were approachable and helpful while I was learning. I enjoyed learning new ways to do things and gaining knowledge on the job."
good,"Great place to work while going to school. Management could function a little better, but all in all a decent place to be."

good,Constantly learning new products and building relationships with great customers. Some of which have become good friends over the years. Every day is something new.
good,"Loved my time at Fastenal, worked for a great branch. The local management was great but upper management sometimes didn't follow through. If the local branch has a good manager, it's a great company to work for"
good,"Some people have written that being a Fastenal delivery driver has ""mundane"" tasks! I'm not sure which companies delivery drivers have ""non mundane"" tasks,"
good,Got to delivered a lot of job sites was able to meet new people boss was great pay was decent benefits for good relaxing comfortable place to work company does treat you right hours were great to work no weekends
good,"The workers are great and management is nice, the work does get repetitive but because of the coworkers it is an even balance of good to bad, I would recommend working here."
good,"I wasn't really able to view fastenal as a whole since I only worked part time, but it was still a great experience. They will work around your daily schedule and help you move forward, even if it may not be with the company"
good,"Great management, great coworkers. If you love people, and learning something new everyday then this is a great place for you."
good,"A typical day at work included signing into a P.O.S system in order to view any and all orders submitted by the customer from the previous day. Also signing into a work email to stay connected with customer needs. Picking and packing orders to get them ready for deliveries. I learned how to interact with many different people, and how to address their needs accordingly. The hardest part of the job was having to sometimes urgently attain any orders that were needed at that moment. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun with coworkers while continuing to work hard to achieve the same goal."
good,I started in sales at the local branch in late 2001.  We serviced local companies through parts delivery and vendor managed inventory programs.  Cash and carry customers were also a big part of the monthly business.
good,My day started at 7am to open the store and get daily orders ready for delivery. Afterward get my sales plan ready for the day with a list of customers to visit and set up product quotes to compare with current customer providers. Did both key account managing and cold calling throughout the day.
good,"Very productive, hot with breaks whenever needed. Water was provided, and they open the garage when heat is to intense. All pickers go home no later than 8. That was perfect for me considering I am in high school and college."

good,"If you prefer a someone smaller type Midwestern town to settle down in you're not going to find many places better than Winona, MN, and you're not going to find many more solid companies than Fastenal. Despite being based largely on the construction industry Fastenal did not need to lay off a single employee during the recent down turn, and is currently growing like wild fire."
good,Fastenal is a great place to work at. You will get the proper sales training by going to school. Also you will get great on the job training with Fastenal.

good,Fastenal offers employees opportunity to pave their own way and grow within the company.

good,"I learned responsibility, time management, how to show and sale products. The most enjoyable part of the job was going to different companies,showing my product I was selling(how the product works,why they need it for their business and how beneficial it would be if they purchased the item.), and making a great sale and a long term client for the company. Management was great. The managers helped me learn a great amount of information about all of the products we sold. ""You cant sale a product without knowing what the product does""."
good,"Fastenal is a great company& I exceeded in sales topping my neighboring branch office from my satellite store. I was outspoken,self-assured&confident,which are fundamental characteristics of any successful salesperson, however I was not well liked because of it by my District manager&the branch manager at GANY-as a result I lost my position via a well devised plan & could not prove there scheme not to be the truth. There is no telling what heights I may have accomplished in construction sales because of my rich affiliation with the contractor base. It was my idea in the beginning to have a satellite office on site of a major construction project,which I am sure I was never credited with either. It was the closest practical idea of fulfilling BK's dream of a vending machine for fasteners."

good,"A typical day includes sourcing product, viewing manufacturer drawings and samples, sending out request for quotes and compiling prices."
good,"I enjoyed the training aspect, the work culture was okay. Promotion depends on favorites not skill and ability. Definitely recommend for candidates who are interested in Engineering and Construction."

Everyone I have worked with while at Fastenal was very polite and always willing to help, as well as very understanding and willing to teach you anything you want to learn. I would recommend Fastenal to any college student looking for work as they have flexible work schedules and an amazing boss willing to work around your schedule on his."
good,"I loved working for Fastenal.  I moved up within the company, made lifelong friends, and had a great management team.  I loved my work load and could always depend on my team for assistance if needed.  The hub manager cares about all employees not just the higher ups.  If you want to work and are willing to invest in yourself, Fastenal will invest in you as well."
good,I work part time and did various jobs.  Working there was fun but there is a lot of products to get familiar with.  So dealing with customers sometimes was tough because different trades had different names for the same item.
good,"Good company. Good entry level place to work. Great place to start even if you don't have a degree at a young age, mainly promote from within so easy to move up the ladder."
good,Par-time job i took during school. management was easy going and was mostly out on sales calls allowing for self work and possible work-study options.

good,"Great place to work"
good,Fastenal Beaumont branch was very busy; A typical day had 5 or more hours on the road visiting customers and delivering parts or bin stocks. Inside the warehouse stayed busy as well. A lot of attention went into inventory as far as putting stock in a identifiable location labeled with a full description and quantity. Workload was evenly distributed among co workers and everyone did their job well with very little conflict or issues. The hardest part about the job was keeping up with customer request.
good,"Fastenal is a great company to work for, there are opportunities to grow in the field and they provide various trainings to expand product knowledge."

good,"When working at Fastenal I felt a strong pride for all the work I was doing. I felt like I was my own boss, people depended on me to get work done and I also depended on myself or I wouldn't be living up to the fullest of my potential. Fastenal has given me deeper insight to the word of logistics and procurement in the supply chain management world. I know the experience I gain from here I will be able to apply to every position in the future."
good,My job responsibilities consist of managing existing accounts while expanding their product line.  I am also responsible of territory expansion by attain new accounts and clients.
good,From my time working at Fastenal I worked in the warehouse putting together customers orders to working in the machine shop running CNC machines. The company is a great place to work and had many great employees.
good,"My work day changed by the day, and was hardly ever the same. But mainly consisted of unloading the semi, scanning in merchandise, and then spending the day delivering that merchandise to factories and other purchasers. I learned so much at this job, and it was a wonderful experience working here. My manager was an excellent man and was very involved in my training, and the daily work day. I'm not sure there was a hard part of the job, and the most enjoyable part was being able to work there."
good,load and unload semi trailers with a sit down or standup forklift
good,"customer service"
good,"Fastenal is a great place to work.  They have systems set up to teach you everything you need to know about fasteners and anything sell.  Pay could be better,but management is very helpful."
good,"Was the sales associate and assistant. I was in charge of restocking, cleaning, and helping customers when they came in."
good,"I started with Fastenal as a box packer in Orlando. I ended as a General Manager with my own 2 bay warehouse (branch) which serviced Tropicana and other large companies in the Vero Beach and Port St. Lucie, Florida territories."
good,"Good Management, great coworkers. Busy work day. The hardest part is moving inventory alot of heavy boxes."
good,"Even though each day consisted of the same task all day long, the people I worked with and the management team made it a very enjoyable place to work. The hardest part of the job was the manual labor put in and keeping up with the number of products moved each hour."
good,"you work days can be on and off, but the staff you work with is the best there is! and the boss is awesome!"
good,So far it has been very helpful and resourceful in helping me further my job search and ability to find a better paying job with benefits

good,El trabajo es excelente las personas que estan ahi solo por ser muy amistosos y los gerentes que no saben dirigir es el unico detalle
good,"Answer emails, phone calls, process orders. Check status of orders, Check in our daily delivery truck. Get orders ready for delivery. Check back orders. Call vendors. Cycle counts. Daily cleaning list. Help walk in customers. Check the PO match exception report, freight report. There are three employees at my branch. The hardest part of the day, is having no control of what our distribution center sends or not, and letting the customer know their order isn't in."
good,late night truck driving. had to load heavy construction equipment and deliver it in the dark to stores in bad neighbors hoods. great pay was hard to stay awake at night.
good,When I first started here I did not know anything about the business but I learned quickly and developed my own work plan to build my knowledge and business. I still learn new things everyday working with different companies and learning what they do and products that they need. I am always offering help and assistance to everyone.
good,"I pulled parts for buisnesses and counted them, I placed them in boxes and created labels for them to be shipped off to the correct company. It was relaxed and flexible"
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot and was able to use the knowledge learned elsewhere. The employees were fun to work with and it was not hard to learn to properly work there.

good,"I built Vending Machines for customers expectations. that would help them control there inventory, Gloves , glasses and anything the employees needed for there job duty's."
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, porém sem muita estabilidade"
good,Good company to work for if you get the right Management team.  Seem to not be replacing executive and upper management at this time so advancement is on the slow side.
good,"Active"
good,"shipping/receiving, quotes, customer communication, ordering parts,"
good,"Worked here for a year, with no signs of advancement. Basically you are where you are. It was a lot of hard work,but a fun place to work."
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of customer service skills. The location I work at is a national account so a lot of resourcing of product and purchasing skills are required.  I am in charge of our corporate credit card and must maintain all records in an organized fashion.  I have learned a lot about business and the inner workings of the company over the last three and a half years.  Management is on premises and does help with any issues or conflicts that arise. Most of the coworkers are hard working but sometimes younger people are hired that have no ambition to go anywhere in the company and their job performance reflects such.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining a balance in the myriad of duties that are required on a daily basis. Prioritizing is a huge must.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the hours and having weekends off.
good,"I liked my work there. My supervisor and co-workers were friendly, however, I had to work a lot and the pay was not very good."
good,Fastenal is a great company to work for. They strive on their motto “Growth through Customer Service.” When you become a team member the company invests so much into the employees as far as providing special paid trainings to move you up in the company. The only downfall is the pay.
good,They were great about hiring from within and building a great reputation.  Tons of training to understand the product you sell.  Being in the field and calling on customers is enjoyable with this company
good,"I thought that the work environment at fastenal was a clean place of employment. Also thought the set up was convienent and well organized. Liked how they have you a chance to make up hours that you may have had to miss out on during the week, like if you had to call off work one day, they let you come in early the rest of the days of that work week to make up for the day you had missed. The co workers were friendly. The bosses/supervisors were also very friendly, and extremely fair to their employees. If you were doing something differently than how they'd wanted it done, they would either call you to their office or come out on the work floor directly to you, and in a well manored way tell you what the problem was, and explain the correct way of doing the particular job and why was needed done in that specified way. Never belittled or came off like scolding you. Was always respectful and polite."
good,productive as long as the message from management is positive. good pay and good work life balance. no weekends. lots of turnover though and stores can be massively understaffed.
good,"They are very flexible with my schedule, which is great. I go home with my body aching because I am on my feet all day long and i constantly lift heavy things, which I expected to do. My coworkers are people I can really get along with."
good,Fastenal has been a great place to work. The environment is very open and management has a positive direction for employees. the core values of the business are based on positive work place
good,very decent place to work just not very good about getting to full-time or about having benefits even for part time employees
good,You can make good money in the sales part of the job. The warehouse will keep you busy and so will the research. It is nice to be able to go out on service runs as it gets you out of the office.
good,"Great place to work, do your job just like any other place.  Hard work will get you to where you want to be.  Great opportunities and advancement to those that deserve it."
good,"Productive and challenging, good training, good management, large product line, fun environment, business to business selling with lots of inside support"
good,"Fastenal is a sales based company.  It is branch oriented and each one runs as its own separate business unit.  As general manager, I was responsible for every thing associated with my branch,  Sales, inventory, personnel, purchasing, etc.  "
good,"We start the day by receiving in product that was delivered that day, this is product either for stock or that is sold to your customer. We make deliveries, make sales calls, source new product from either domestic or overseas suppliers to give our customer a quality product at the best possible price. I learned excellent time management, you only have one day to complete your deliveries and try and capture new product to increase your sales. Sometimes this includes dealing with over seas suppliers or domestic suppliers that you hope can make a timely delivery. The management is great, they always have an open door policy so you can talk with them anytime. The company is always growing so if you are willing to move there is endless opportunity. The hardest part of the job would be the recruiting of new personel. We are always trying to keep a pipe line of potential candidates to fill in for those employees that get promoted or that move on. The most enjoyable part would be to either see an employee get promoted or to get your customer what they need when they need it. It could save them a lot of time and money if we have a late delivery."
good,"Me gusta trabajar en companias muy grande como Fastenal, con expectativas ambiciosas. Aprendi lo que es trabajar en equipo y bajo presion. Aprendi como se debe manejar una unidad de negocios en cuestion de ventas, inventario, logistica. Aprendi lo que es trabajar con el sentido de pertenencia y urgencia. Mis companeros son personas profesionales. La parte mas dificil de mi trabajo es cuando las metas no fueron alcanzadas. Me encanta de mi trabajo el interactuar con gente de la que puedo aprender mucho (clientes, companeros, gerentes)"
good,Fastenal is a great company to work for paid training as well as great upper management that is always available to answer questions or assist to ensure your success. I have been in my position for 3 years and absolutely love what I do.. there are a few bad apples that let their title get in the way of being part of the team but for the most part all the people are great
good,"I love everything about Fastenal except for the high cost of insurance and the lack of raises. It has been 4 years since my last raise. Great friendly, low stress atmosphere!"
good,I inspected packages for picking errors and entered my findings in a database.  If the wrong part was packed I emailed the discrepancy group.  I gained much knowledge about types of parts sold.  The Hub is a very busy place.
good,"Fastenal is a large company with small brach locations all over the U.S. Stores vary in size, inventory, personal, goals, clients. Very competitive within the industrial market, working on advancing vending automated solutions to bring product closer to consumers on site."
good,The job was ok just had transportation problems. And lack of communication was a prob that manager had..really terrible wouldnt suggest it for anyone to be honest
good,I assisted the sales team which was fast paced but everyone pitched in and helped without complaining. The manager made sure the work was getting done correctly but they never micromanaged me. My schedule was very flexible.
good,"Pay doesn't match what other companies of similar type offer."
good,It was a great place to with  only one bad thing and that it is only part time unless you are leads or management . There can be a lot of heavy lifting involved
good,"Fastenal has various opportunities and would be great for someone to possibly make a career at. Great people, competitive drive, and always a sense of purpose when working with the company."
good,It's a great place to work at my experience at Fastenal was a life long lesson while there. The supervisor s was tolerant with workers. I was able learn my task without worrying about loosing my job
good,"Being able to work quickly and accurately is important, but the atmosphere is really laid back and all the people working there are kind and willing to answer questions."
good,I have worked for Fastenal Company for almost 3 years now part time. Fastenal is an excellent place to work especially as an engineering student. I have received a huge amount of experience and an excellent place of work.
good,"A typical day at work started with sorting through mail that aided in resolving any branch requests or company updates and then I would login to our daily help desk computer programs to see customer concerns to determine solutions. I learned patience and kindness when dealing with customers helped deliver company policies and procedures when assisting with problems. My positive personality made it a delight working with my co-workers especially when they were dealing with challenging issues I enjoyed putting smiles on their faces. This made it easier for my co-workers to help me when I would deal with all company knowledge. There was so much information I had to know about the different branches and employees titles in order to lead customers in the directions that would solve their concerns so, my co-workers were always excited to help me. This made the hardest part of my job very enjoyable because I was able to learn something new all the time."
good,"Fastenal is a great company for college students! The managers are very understanding and flexible with class schedules. "
good,Everyone I worked with was really cool. The hours were decently flexible and the manager was very understanding of the school/work balance. Got hired with little to no experience in the industry. Would definitely recommend to other students looking for cash/experience.
good,"•	Identified potential customers and made sales presentation"
good,Start of the day consisted of delivering parts to different companies. Scanning orders and p/o. Pulling parts and loading skids for the following day.
good,picking orders
good,"Learned more about profitability, margin and how to close deals.  Expanded my product knowledge, learned how to sourse items and to negotiate a better purchase price."
good,I really enjoy working at Fastenal. The pay is fair and the Environment is friendly and safe. There is a lot of opportunity for growth in this company.
good,Great company to work for. Learned alot. One big thing about the company is they allow individuals to put in their input for ideas to make improvements.  This allows an employee to grow and add value.
good,"I worked at fastenal for 12 years, it was a great place to work. I did a variety of different jobs while there. I picked parts sorted parts operated fork lift"
good,My local branch is amazing. Can be busy and fast paced. But also a lot of down time. Goals... Some realistic and some not. Definitely a corporation that your work for but my branch manager made it feel small and home town. Not sure if all are like that.
good,I have worked at 2 store and the manager of the store makes a big difference. My fist did a great job at sales but burns employees out quickly. Second is much more personal and allows for side projects to keep employees active and wanting to work.
good,It was a good place to work. There is room for advancement if you show up and do a good job. I enjoyed the fast paced environment and the people I worked with. Should have stayed.
good,"pick parts for orders, ensure there was no damage, scan products into containers, ensure all product was there. Close out containers and prepare them for shipping"
good,Fastenal was a fun place to work because you get to meet a lot of different people from all different career backgrounds. fun fast paced worked environment.

good,"Fast paced environment, encouraging growth. Great co-workers. Fun place to work and make new friends. Working at Fastenal challenge me to be a better worker under stressful conditions."
good,"A typical day of work starts at 7am and goes until 5pm.  In the morning you answer phone calls and run pick tickets for product.  Pull an pack product and load in the back of your truck.  Most of the day is spent on the road delivering product to customers, establishing new relationships, and growing existing business through customer service.  "
good,Great company to work for. Has great benefits. Gain a lot of experience with not only industrial supplies but purchasing and also sourcing product for customers.
good,"Great company to work for, the benefits are very nice and the people are great to work with as well. I love seeing new customers everyday and helping them with sourcing their products along with helping their business grow and run efficiently."
good,"Nice for a first time sales job, if you plan to stay with a company for a long time this is a good fit. The compensation is not unto standard with other companies of similar caliber because they go for young people they know what they can pay them."
good,"Convives y te apoyas con tus compañeros, la empresa confia mucho en sus empleados"
good,the store was great but the management did not care about the store workers and were only concerned about driving sales and the bottom line.
good,"Like the fast pace work environment. I also like the people I work with, I believe we have a great team and it makes it easier to go to work everyday."
good,"Each morning we get a truck from our distribution center in Salt Lake, that is dropped off at my store for us to receive in the orders for our customers."
good,I loved working for Fastenal I would highly recommend it. Great managers and company values.
good,"If you are a hard working, self motivated person, there is an opportunity to rise within the company.  It is fast paced and high pressure with rewards being big commission checks. As a sales person or a driver it beats having to sit at a desk all day, the scenario and view changes daily but you have to be able to deal with rude people."
good,Great job but I would like a job more suitable to my skill set.  It is part-time and I would like to be working full-time.
good,"Absolutely loved working at FASTENAL. Only left due to family emergency out of state - relocated. "
good,"Love the job, and my co- workers. I enjoy the laid back atmosphere, and the flexibility."
good,Sales Support - I learned everyday operations of the individual business unit I was apart of.
good,Come in to the offic at 9.
good,Love the job and the company only downfall is they don’t have many full time positions. My manager is very professional and thorough. The assistant managers are also professional and thorough. The only complaint I can think of is there isn’t many full time positions
good,"Very flexible and good at working with people in college. Co-workers are willing to answer any questions you have. The computer system is confusing at first, but again management is very patient with you when teaching you how to work it."
good,I like working there but currently looking for more. It’s a great place to work wonderful employees  I truly enjoy working with them they are great people great management.
good,Great company and treat employees fair. I think it's a great place to work but i feel like there is only so far you can go with the company. Tough to make bonuses if you work in a small market.
good,Fastenal was an awesome place to work.  they allowed me to be very productive and would come together and solve a problem together instead of the blame some one else.  Learned what being a team really was there.
good,"Management is awesome. Fun place to work the only downfall is training takes too long and pay is low for the amount of work you do. If you have a degree you might not be using your abilities to your fullest here but, still a great place to work and I enjoy it."
good,In Rapid City South Dakota the Fastenal Team is a very friendly and very motivated group. Everyone is a team player and has the same goals. Management is extremely understanding as long as you are doing your job they will work with you.
good,"If the management was different I would still be there."

We bring new ideas and improvements to business and we work independently as well as part of a team and show respect to co-workers, customers, vendors, and visitors in the workplace while demonstrating Fastenal's core values of Ambition, Innovation, Integrity, and Teamwork.  I help monitor, audit and report on processes and inventory at various stages of movement through the distribution facility."
good,The typical day at work starts at 7am with receiving in the merchandise delivered by our 18-wheeler. After receiving the truck we start pulling orders from our shelves and delivering the orders to our customers. The store front sells to individuals while our deliveries are run from the back. Store hours are 7am-5pm but the day typically goes by fast.
good,Great place to get a experience in a sales position. Work is faced paced and challenging. Best part about the job is being out on the road all day basically being able to make your own schedule.
good,"This workplace allows and encourages teamwork, but also trusts an employees ability to make their own decisions. They truly make it feel as if we are all one, and there isn't much rank as all employees feel equally valued and important. Other managers and higher up employees are easily approachable and accepting, and certainly don't make you feel like the underdog. Fastenal is a great place to work, and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,Very relaxed and non stressful place to work. I worked this job while going to school and the management was awesome and understanding about my schedule.
good,There is plenty room for advancement. They promote from within the company. they provide plenty of training for employees. Management provides a clear path for employees to follow.
good,"I worked part time both times I worked for this company. It was very balanced job. I never had a stressful day working there. The only times I did was when I was being trained and accidentally ordered the wrong things. You have to pay attention when ordering from vendors because if you order something wrong, then Fastenal has to pay for your mistake. "
good,"As a student, Fastenal is a great option for me. I am able to gain experience my field, as well as continue to excel in my classes at the local university."
good,Incredible environment with fantastic customer relationships and Training. Fastenal is a great company to work for with so much opportunity and growth.
good,"I worked at Fastenal in Southern Ohio, we had accounts ranging from farms, prisons, factories, and everything in between.. In one day you may be selling 1,000's of tubes of toothpaste to the prison and $10,000 in tools and bolts to a local factory.. You never knew when someone would come in and lay something on the desk and say I need one of these or a bolt to fit in here.. It required a lot of great research ability.. Find a number on the thing the customer needs and become best friends with google!"
good,"this company is great, amazing opportunity to advance, and satisfying work no matter where you are! you'll love working with Fastenal, as long as you get along with the people!"
good,It is a fun place to work. Sales men are on the road daily. The work culture is relaxed. The company has different sales training for the salesman. The point of sale system is integral is learned right away to help learning the items they sell.
good,"A typical day at Fastenal would start off with a staff meeting and discussion of the day. Then we go over our cold calls and see what customers we are going to visit. Next we would get our binders and materials ready, and then go visit our customers and deliver product. Towards the end of shift we will all head back to the store to finish up paperwork and get prepped for the next day."
good,"it is a good paying job, but you also have to know what you are doing because there is hardly anytime to learn on site at job area. Always mobile there was not a set location."
good,"This is a company that gave me a great start into the working world. They took time to train me and let me grow in knowledge and ability under the direction of management. I was blessed with a few great individuals in lead rolls who taught me the value of great management. There are some draw backs to the positions such as long work hours and bellow average salary, yet the opportunity to make a business your own is very inspiring."
good,The people and the work environment were friendly and energetic. I entered part specs. Management values the importance of schooling and encourages you to better yourself.
good,I loved it! Really great Management there. I drove a Forklift and worked 4hours per day. Management was really cool! Pays $10.00 per hour.
good,Supportive teammates and upper management whom always encouraged us to think outside the box. I enjoyed being able to make decisive decisions. The hardest part of my job was learning about all of my different product categories.
good,Ship Different Items To Different Stores Across The States. Wrapping items. Scanning items to they location. my co-workers was very helpful and hard working.
good,"Inside sales and service running the store while the outside sales team is out and about creating more business. Stocking shelves, packaging fasteners for private outside customers and factories. Delivery and pickup."
good,Great Company to work for.  Only this company does not pay it's team a good compensation to work here for very long unless the person seeks advancement.  Base salaries are well below average.
good,"Same process during picking repeated over and over"
good,Opened store with manager. Greeted customers and helped locate items and merchandise. Explained any necessary product information to customer to ensure knowledge was maximized. Strived for customer service excellency and accurate orders from large businesses to smaller customer orders.

good,warehouse work with a family orientated enviorment. freindly employees and truckers
good,Great place to work!!! Absolutely adore the people I work with but at this point in my life I need full time employment which is not offered with this company.
good,"Busy work environment, fast paced, individual decision making abilities.  Hands-off management, supportive co-workers."
good,10 hr work days can get to be long but fly by. The store personnel are often left with many things to do besides being out on the road selling and sometimes seems to be abandoned by upper management and corporate.
good,"I have been at fastenal for 3 years, started out as sales support part time while in school, then after a year I was promoted to full time sales and have loved every moment of it. "
good,"My typical day will be receiving product In to inventory, and putting product away If it hasn't been allocated to a customer. Making the place look neat and tidy. Help with sales In store and on the phone sales, cleaning the restrooms, putting orders in order in the receving area for customer to pick up. Checking company emails and always getting things done before the end of my shift."
good,"If you are on as a full time employee you have a lot of room to grown within the company.  Team work is a must, and I have yet to find a disgruntled Fastenal employee."
good,"I would come in and go directly in back to get my tools and go to my table and start doing my paperwork, then I would check my table and see if anything was missing or if I needed more parts. Then I would start doing my thing. If there were people who needed something to do because their table was down I was more than happy to let them come and work with me. I learned how concentrate a bit better. We counted screws and put them into the right kits. My boss was a pretty laid back guy. He had his angry moments but he's was all in all a good guy. Very lenient and easy going. My coworkers were all very nice and very open to meeting new people. I enjoyed everything about this job. From the way my supervisor's understanding,  to the other employees, and the job itself was pretty amazing. I wish I could have stayed, but I guess thats that bad part about temp work."
good,"Very fast pace work place, but even with that it was a very fun atmosphere to work in."
good,"I loved this job, but it did not pay enough to cover costs of living. A typical work day consisted of many task, from answering phones and consulting customers to shipping, receiving, and delivering products in person. I took pride in representing a company and using my communication skills as a tool for the job. I learned much about sales, margins, customer service, and a multitude of products in a short amount of time and my coworkers were great with helping me learn procedures. The hardest part of the job was also the most interesting and challenging, and was problem solving and helping customers with their questions and issues. I guess you could say, the most enjoyable part of the job was the hardest part of the job."
good,Fastenal was a great company to work for.  The pay was good and the benefits not bad.  If I hadn't moved I would still be there.  There was some heavy lifting required.
good,The hardest part of working here is literally the heat but other than that a wonderful place. One day they gave us food from jimmy johns and pizza from Marcos. It's a wonderful place to work.
good,Fun place to work with good people. Great enviroment not the hardest job in the world but itll keep you busy. Pay isn't the greatest but not bad. Good  job to make connections and start out in. Great manager and co workers made the days fun and fly by.
good,"In my three years at Fastenal, I genuinely enjoyed what I did. The company values its employees and stresses growth and promotion from within. The pay scale is slightly lower than what I needed which is what encouraged me to move on to another employer, but I enjoyed my time at Fastenal. I have referred other people to apply there since leaving. You will be involved in B2B sales and often in a manufacturing environment and it is a great way to start a career."
good,"Great Culture and environment but hard to move up. Not a lot of openings and opportunity is rare. Health insurance was very good."
good,I worked at Fastenal for a few years while I was in college. I was a material handler that later became a supervisor. I was always treated well by management and co-workers.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Fastenal because i had my own responsibilities to handle. Your day was as long as your task took, it I would’ve been advanced to Full-Time I would have stayed there as long as I could’ve"
good,"This job was more of a sell your product to different companies. I didnt have that experience and I wanted to try something different, It wasnt for me."
good,Fastenal is a wonderful company to work for. Very fair and a great culture to be in. Day to day work is what you would expect with any inside sales job and outside sales is about the same but more planned as opposed to cold calls.
good,"I learn a lot on this company from customer services to management they ware all great owners and employees, must of them ware Hispanics I'm Hispanic so it was fun for me"
good,"Fastenal gives you the autonomy to succeed and advance within the company. If you are willing to learn new skills, it’s a great place to work. There are multiple facets to pursue."
good,I worked for this company for 12 years and though I loved my job and pay they would never allow any promotion for myself due to the fact they felt they needed me more to help out other stores rather than running my own. I have learned a great deal from this company and from our customers companies as well great for business management students just not so much for women.
good,Very happy to have experienced their culture. You can learn a lot and accomplish a lot. Basically its like running your own business and you can earn what you put in.
good,"Fastenal is definitely a better place than most companies in my area for a job , I regret leaving it was a good route I had, I  worked nights on a route to Fastenal stores in a designated area.

good,Overall a great workplace. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and really enjoyed the work I performed. Would definitely recommend to work for this company.
good,"Since day one I have really enjoyed working at Fastenal. I have learned many tasks and gained many skills working here. I have the opportunity to do many different processes on a daily basis and that makes work fun, exciting and rewarding. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement. I would refer a job at Fastenal to close friends or family."
good,"I learn how to read blueprints and how to run the machines. You also learn how to set up and program if you have a interest in it. The managers were very helpful, and I've learned a lot by working for this employer."
good,Learned a lot of responsibility from being put in charge of multiple accounts and their stocking deals. Very laid back but a good bit of accountability on yourself as well.
good,"Consistent daily work processes"
good,Showing up to work with plenty of work to do with many amazing people to work with.  Fastenal is willing to teach you and train you for anything you're willing to learn!  The management is very politically correct and depending where you are you may have a passive aggressive manager.
good,Enjoyed working as a part timer while going through school. The people you work with are great and overall it was a relatively easy job that was rewarding.
good,This is a great company to work for career advancemnt is a huge part of this company as they like to promote from within. Management is all on the same page at every level and that helps the company grow.
good,"They have completely changed management, so I am unaware of how it is now. Low level employees do not get that many benefits, but it is easy to move up, A lot of decisions made are in management's favor, For instance, managers got bonuses, monthly and annual, and the lower employees get/got nothing."
good,My position at the company was pretty enjoyable. It did require some tedious work but the customers were entertaining and unique while the co-workers are lively and always willing to help
good,Good place to learn. flexible hours. Chances to really move up the ladder. Outside sales is a challenge but training is top notch to make you confindent to grow your business and maintain customer service.

good,It was a great place to learn about the sales process and everything that goes into making the customer happy as well as making money for the company.
good,Fastenal is a place where you can work and enjoy time with your peers. Here at Fastenal you are family. Everyone is willing to work with each other to determine schedules and you have a great time learning what the company is all about. The management is great. The hardest part about the job is having to learn different names for various products and sometimes not having what the customer needs right away. The most enjoyable part about the job is having a team to support you and making relationships with the customers who are constantly coming in.
good,"Fastenal was a great company to work for, great people, products and services."
good,A good company to start a career at and gain experience but there is a strict FT/PT ratio set by corporate that makes earning a good living difficult.
good,I learned a lot about how to do cost and margin analyses. Working a lot with wholesale and discount analyses. Using Excel v-lookups and peoplesoft reports to come up with the best prices
good,"I love working for Fastenal they are a great company with high morals and amazing hours. For only currently working there for roughly 8 months it has been an amazing opportunity. I was part time the whole time while finishing up school and also did my internship there. Great people, environment, I had no benefits through work because I choose not to because it was not necessary and I was only part time."
good,Love everything about the company except the inability to hire full time employees when needed.
good,Management and coworkers were extremely friendly and very competent. Management worked around my military schedule and even accommodated working extra hours in lieu of taking a day off. Greatest part of the job was when management posted how fast you picked; I liked seeing how many items I picked per hour.
good,In all Fastenal is a great company to work for. You start out above minimum wage and there are many opportunities to move within the company. It all depends on where you work on what hours you will get. The management is great and is always listening to what you think they should do to make it a better work environment.

good,Awesome place to work with great management. If you work hard and come in everyday there is always room for improvement and growth. Getting in management is very beneficial.
good,The work is sometimes hard. They train you for the position you apply for.  The orders for you area comes thru on a hand held device or computer.  The company also likes to hire from within and promote their own workers.
good,lo que aprendí: me capacitaron amplia mente para el uso de la herramienta SAP el acomodo del material en almacén y en como ser un líder dentro de la empresa
good,I learned a lot at Fastenal and wish that things would have lasted longer.  It was never meant to be permanent though because full time positions were too hard to come by.  I really enjoyed the work and pay.
good,Great Company that is invested in developing it's employees. Supports employees participating in training and will cover expenses. Great company to work for if you want to feel like you own your business.
good,"Sales positions are paid partially on commission, delivery drivers are hourly, everyone works towards the store sales goal, if goal is met then non-comission employees get a bonus each month. We haven't missed goal in years so I think everyone is doing quite well on their pay"
good,This is a flexible and understanding environment with great diversity and where you can grow and connect with other professionals. I love my job and aim to make it a career.
good,"Great management, fast paced, ability to move up in career quickly.  Wonderful workplace, what you put in is what you can expect in return.  Enjoyable place to work."
good,"The fastanal family was great. "

good,Entry level sales people will find a good experience here.  The commission is not as high as other sales roles but you do less work than other sales roles.  You can get comfortable here if you lack ambition.
good,Fastenal is a great company to work for. They have outstanding training programs and room for advancement. The products they manufacture and carry are the best in the industry
good,"Good place to work as a first job or career. Lots of opportunities for advancement and transfer to anyplace in North America. Definitely recommend for trade careers, but college will help in advancement"
good,The typical work day goes by fast as indicated by the name fastenal. It is a very quick paced company with nice and set times for your hours. Everyone works together and it is very fun.
good,Fastebal DC is an amazing workplace environment that allows you to work at your own pace to accomplish tasks.  I learned new skills at this corporation that I will carry with me into my future careers and endeavors.  The hardest part of the job was sustaining the energy desired to be productive over the course of long shifts.  Management is great because they allow for flexible hours which works well for college students.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Fastenal. It is a good company for a starter job or someone going through school and doesn't have a lot of bills. The pay is OK but don't expect raises, Those come through increased sales in the form of commission. The work style is laid back and easy going but there is little to no recognition from management for a job well done. Everyone I have met were really nice and helpful."
good,"Was always on my feet, sold inside the store and had to do outside sales. The best thing was getting to meet new customers and them being happy with fastenal"
good,They are a good place to work with great benefits. They have very good work to home life balance and you are normally only expected to work the shift that you are scheduled for.
good,great place to work and even better place to develop skills in a warehouse setting. The people i met there made the workplace more relaxed and taught me teamwork is of essence.
good,"There were a lot of great people, both internally and externally, that made Fastenal a great place to work. They provide both terminal and hands-on training to get you started, if you drive, they provide a company truck, and it's easy to advance. Only reason I left was because the economy was down and there was no budget room for another full-time employee."
good,Daily review of what need's to be complete for the day and the amount of production and goals that were made before your shift. Grab equipment fill out safety check list load trucks maintain conveyor.
good,Our days start early and are filled with customer orders and deliveries. The most enjoyable part of the day would be going onto all the different sites and meeting everyone. The hardest part would be lifting some of the deliveries on your own.
good,"No complaints about the company, staff, coworkers, organization, management, business practices, compensation, paid time off, benefits, or company leaders."
good,"Take care of incoming and outgoing parts, internet and telephone orders,"
good,"The rep for Atlantic Canada is one that will try to get colleges to fight amongst themselves over useless rivalries. Rather than work as a team, as the company says, he prefers to divide and conquer to get ahead. It will only be a matter of time before his boomerang that he unleashed will turn and cut him to ribbons."
good,"Great job, Love the culture and sales as well as building relationships with  customers. Learning new technology implements was another great experience with this company."

good,Wonderful company to work for the training provided is exceptional and customers are friendly . Management is helpful with the learning process.

good,My workload kept me busy. Though I enjoyed the business and the smooth workflow. Management was understanding and helpful. I learned to use the point of sale system and Peoplesoft which was very fun. The hardest part was the drive.
good,Learned about people and Machines .Expectaions Deadlines.Teamwork .
good,While I worked for the National Guard I was able to better myself with learning all the phases of the Military and it made me proud to have served my Country and then my State. I served in the US air Force from 1964 - 1968 as a Inventory control Specialist both State side and overseas in Thialand and Viet Nam. Co workers were great and I learned a lot about doing parts inventory from them. Hardest psrt of the job was getting the tires to the Aircraft on time when working weekends by myself due to the size of the tires. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I had friends from different units on base who would aid me with problems that came up because I treated them with respect.
good,"This was my favorite career. I came in the door at 18 hours a week at $9.00 a hour and within 3 week was full time at $12.50 an hour. Within 3 months I was offered a management position with after bonus making upwards of $60,000 a year. The job was fulfilling and gave me a chance to shine in my role and improve the entire business."
good,"On any given day I would be placing sales orders for oil rig companies, delivering product to the companies waiting for them, taking new orders, and opening new accounts. My job was to sell product to oil rigs and I was in charge of up to 50 different accounts most of which I opened personally. The biggest challenge was staying organized. With so many things to keep track of at once it proved challenging to keep it prioritized."
good,"Although a typical day at work can be extremely physically exhausting, the friendly environment set by my managers makes up for it. At Fastenal, working as a team with co-workers greatly helps ease the work load. The key to that team work however, is good communication and holding true to your word, two things that Fastenal has helped me becoming better at. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work in such as professional yet friendly environment."
good,"Excellent management, learn great skills, awesome coworkers"
good,Fastenal is a great company to work for. They are very dedicated to their employees. It was a pleasure to work for them. I had an awesome supervisor and coworker.
good,sales and deliveries. as well as customer service. also receiving and sourcing of product..
good,"I worked for Fastenal, in some capacity, for 14 years. 4 years part time and 10 years full time. I did utside sales for an industrial supply company. I also managed a branch for 5 years. While I managed the store- I was in charge of everything from driving sales numbers, to inventory, to labor, to running the store front."
good,"I get the deliveries out the door as soon as possible in the morning. Once that is done I generally help out around the store with stock, customers, and anything else the manager or salespeople need. I enjoy being around my co-workers and upper management. They are all helpful and for the most part appreciative. The hardest part of the job is being at the store and getting things going at the break of dawn by myself, other than that the job is easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around co-workers and customers that are social and friendly."
good,Worked here while in school and promoted to GM within two years. The store’s location makes a difference in how Fastenal is viewed as the company is very decentralized.
good,opportunities new products sale were every month made it easy to serve all types of customers on a daily basis. The company really cared about keeping customers happy with the services we offer.  New vehical was used and maintained at all locations meant a good impression was given each time a sales person would stop at a customer location.
good,"Each employee shares a responsibility.  As a part time worker, you can drive the company truck to make deliveries to various customers.  This is a great company to be employed at.  What every team member does is significant to getting  the store fully operational."
good,"I stocked shelves, Counted inventory, worked cash register, made deliverys to other companies. I made sure all of the bathrooms and work areas were cleaned at all times. I also received in products"
good,I had an amazing experience working in the marketing department at Fastenal. You really feel as though you are apart of a team dedicated to making Fastenal better.
good,"Fastenal only chooses people from within the company to promote, which makes it easy to work your way up the corporate ladder. Salary starts off on the low side but after proving your worth you'll move up."
good,As a part time employee and full time student the hours were very flexible.  They are very motivated to transition part time employees to full time after the completion of a college degree.
good,"This is a very welcoming organization. They ensure that all who partake in projects are aided in any way they need. If you need additional instruction or time (within reason), there will be someone there to guided you in the right direction."
good,I like the company. But I think it could be Better and the truck route could be done in the day time.And the reason why I say that the truck routes could be done in the day time is that more people would your trucks because you truck is a big bill board that can draw more business.
good,If you're looking for a easy fun job then this job is for you the supervisors are cool the people you work with are cool it's just a cool place to work in its great if you're looking for part-time work.
good,Same work performed each day. I learned how to perform internal inventory counts. Great management who are willing to work with staff. Workplace culture was laid back.
good,"Fastenal is a great company to work for in Atlanta, Georgia.  Unfortunately, I did not know that I would need more than part-time to survive.  But, it is still an exciting environment."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company as a part-time driver. The managers were true professionals and appeared to have received  leadership training. They were attentive to employee concerns and were proactive in getting to know their employees. My only concern as a night-shift driver, is that I would deliver goods to stores, and sometimes the forklift to download my van was inoperable. Lucky for me that the shipment of goods often times wasn't difficulty to off load by hand if necessary."
good,"Having been with Fastenal since early May of 2016, I have had the privilege to work with some extraordinary individuals. My coworkers help to keep the work environment fun, loose and as a result, productive. I have made good friends with my coworkers and others within the company. I really enjoy my time at work."
good,"I have been working with Fastenal for about 8 months. it may be busy at times but it is a very good job. i work mon-fri im out by 5pm my co-workers are amazing. they are supportive, great teachers, understanding and are great people over all. "
good,"I Love going to work at my branch. My typical day consist of helping walk-in customers, answer phone calls as they come in, taking messages for sales reps or management, or place orders for existing customer accounts.  I would say the hardest part about the job was becoming familiar with how to measure certain parts (such as screws-nuts & bolts) but in due time I became a pro, all thanks to my amazing coworkers.   The most enjoyable part about the job for me was organizing/ rearranging the work place. I love doing that sort of task, I always a lot of pride in the finishing result."
good,"I enjoyed working at Fastenal and the great employees also."
good,"From the time you arrive to the time you leave, there is always something to do. It is good work in a great environment but can feel overwhelming or monotonous if you are not passionate about the product."
good,"Fastenal was a very good job that was fun, had a fast paced environment, and my coworkers were very motivated to succeed."
good,I would arrive at work at 7:30am where I would open the store and unload our daily truck containing all the merchandise that needed to be delivered that day. Throughout the morning I would put stock away and run the inside of the store helping customers find their desired merchandise and check them out when they were ready. After stock cart had been put away I would gather the merchandise that needed to be delivered and deliver it to all of our customers. In the afternoon I would work on the stores over all accounts by collecting past due payments from customers and making sure the store was up to date on paying the bills and taxes. I would generally leave around 5:00pm after locking up and closing the store. I worked three full days a week. The hardest part of the job was having to multitask by answering phone calls and helping customers at the same time when I was the only one in the store for that day. After a few weeks I found a great balance and managed multitasking very well. I only had four coworkers and they were all very nice and supportive people to work for and with. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping the customers get exactly what they need in a timely manner and observing how happy they were. I learned a lot about management watching my manager work on a daily basis and viewing how he handled running the store and certain situations he would receive.
good,Management was always there to answer your questions and willing to teach you things that were not part of your job
good,Everyone within the company is amazing. So many of them started in a part-time position and advanced through the company. They have all of the employees best interest in mind.

Pay is decent, and they make sure you get your hours one way or another, which at times can either be a blessing or a curse. The work is fast paced, but competitive and not necessarily difficult You pretty much clock in, get a tow motor, get your trailer reports, and start loading.

I would acknowledge anyone to apply to this great career opportunity with the Fastenal Company."
good,"this was by far my favorite place to work. I loved everything about this job. the people, my manager. It was a very fast paced environment with challenging duties.

good,I would go in and receive the truck and start the day off with dropping product off to the customers. Then i would start doing cold calls and make sure the store is clean. I would be able to take my lunches when ever it was slow. Hardest part of the job for me was going to get new business. Its easy for others but was very difficult for me.
