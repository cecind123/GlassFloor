rating,review
bad,"Shocking company to work for. Very poor salary. Salary is not in line with the cost of living. Salary increases can be less than E2K. Management are terrible. Take little interest in the development of employees. If you raise a query about salary, you just get ignored. Employees treated like dirt. There is nepotism and politics ongoing in terms of promotions offered. Everything about the company is miserly. Don't go near the place unless you are badly stuck for a job."
bad,"Northern Trust does not value people, it is not an inclusive environment. Management does not support people and career growth. Too much concentration on off shoring."
bad,"Being an IT Project Manager at NTB will surely make the IT PM appreciate working a similar role at ANY other company; the grass is greener at any other company. Managers are only there to advance their career, they do not support the PMs but rather use PMs to throw under the bus when others do not pull their own weight. Work loads are crazy busy and unrealistic. You will be treated as a work horse and expected to work crazy hours; someone sends you and email at 2am then you better have all work required to reply to it and apply to it by 8am, same day. Do not work here, at least not as a PM in IT, if you have any self respect."
bad,Poor Management team in IMLG. This department was very political. Never recognize for hard work or dedication. The Department manager has less than a High School education. The team leader has a job history working in BEST BUY on the sale floor. They have no management skills or people skills. The Northern Trust Company needs to revemp the staff. Upper manager walks right by you and do not speak. This is not a good department to work in. Work load is extremely HIGH sometimes you have to eat at your desk due to high demand. No work life balance.
bad,Bad turn overs always worry about being fired each day because management plays favorites WORSE Hob ever! All they do each day is find something to yell at you and treat you like a dog.
bad,Terrible experience here. I was taken on for Co-op education and I received no training and very little help during my time here. It was my first role in a accounting firm and it completely turned me off the line of work I was studying for.
bad,"Cultural environment is spectacular, but is merely a facade hiding the result of NT reaping the benefits of the low pay scale that certain demographics are willing to accept. Unfortunately I am one of them (but not for much longer). Negotiate your salary as high as you can on the way in because that's as good as it will ever get at NT."
bad,Great foot in the door. Didnt see long term with the company but it helped transition into better position. Company wok culure is very outdated. Great entry level.
bad,"Management is flimsy, pay and benefits non-competitive and hours are long because departments are understaffed. Expectations are high but rewards are low."
bad,"Horrible working conditions, horrible tax planning. Upper level management incapable of following through on continuous improvements and rewarding employees for developing more efficient ways of working. Would not work here again and do not advise any one with experience to work here..."
bad,Stay clear of this company as the culture there is to work all hours even through lunch breaks to meet deadlines which are overwhelming at times ;no appreciation for working long hours and hard work and  where career advancement is non existent. Weak management that look their nose down on you and offer no support whatsoever . No wonder there is a very high turnover of staff
bad,"Probably the worst company I've have ever worked for in regards to Foreign exchange department. It is so unorganized, there is little to no room for career advancement. IF YOU HAVE 5-7 PLUS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE NORTHERN IT MAYBE MORE ATTRACTIVE BUT if you are looking to start your career in finance this is not the place. managers get inferior to those who can do there job at a faster and more efficient rate. There is a lack of willingness to learn in this department. They are beyond sensitive in cash ops. and are very emotional where to be completely honest you need to leave your emotions at the door when your dealing in such a volatile and time sensitive market. Pay is horrendous, at all levels in foreign exchange operations... severely under paid. a bit embarrassing to say the least. This department does not embrace change very well and has a horrible learning curve issue. It;s said when some parts of management have no clue how to do your own job and is not really willing to learn."
bad,Poor pay .massive staff turnover.seriously overworked till stressed and you leave.poor training and severe constant monitoring.Management culture dismissive of staff turnover as a employers market at the minute.
bad,"50 years behind in technology and management, no more to sat than that it is a place out of time. You think you are on another planet that is all I have to say for the place called NT"
bad,"Archaic place to work at. Company culture was poor; not much room for advancement. However, operations was a good way to learn the business from the ground up."
bad,"When you are smart and can handle an impressive workload, they will work you until you can no longer maintain motivation. I was ahead of my managers in terms of knowlege of the area. Disappointing place."
bad,I really enjoy working for Northern Trust Company. I got a chance to learn alot about the company. I would really like to work for this company again.
bad,Good start in banking. Worked through from being an intern until jointing the front office as a FX dealer.
bad,Its a very nice company and the most enjoyable part of the job is Friday fun.
bad,"There are many opportunities within Northern Trust.  Management, however, could improve how they support their employees.  Some SVP's lack management training and this hurts the culture and employee morale."
bad,“We don’t micromanage. You took 7 minutes longer at lunch and you should text or call to let me know when you’ll be back”.... wasting “valuable“ time searching for .05 cent cashier check for ungrateful management that tell you to log into your laptop for FREE on a weekend to “test” their process. Glad i was able to barely pay rent while briefly employed there. If you want a job like the Harry Potters bankers... this is the place for you
bad,"Racism, sexism, and the good old boys club."
bad,"When I was offered a position at Northern my gut told me to say no, but I said yes. Big mistake. Those were the unhappiest days of my life. Boring work, unpleasant offices, out of touch management, no meaningful education and little to no advancement. My manager stayed out of sight, rarely spoke to the team and was hard to respect because of it. The only people who like working at Northern are the few remaining employees who’ve been there forever, and the sons and daughters of employees. Northern is a cold-blooded dinosaur."
bad,"Norther Trust outsources their IT so  you will be working for an outsourcing company.  Ask any recruiter in Chicago and they will tell you that  they have people dieing to get out of there."
bad,I am amazed that this company is still in business.  They follow no policies and human resources are the worst I have ever worked with.  Managers are allowed to lie and treat you however they wish. They will low ball you on offer and raises are a joke.  They are going to let their second building stay empty for the next year so be wary if you are looking for room to grow as the Tempe office is going downhill fast
bad,NT is an admirable company with great values. Company offers many growth opportunities worldwide. Job Culture and work life balance needs improvement.
bad,"This company raves about advancement, and on the outside seems to have it together. They already know who they want to hire. They relocated from Chicago and favor only those who do the same. They act like if you participate in certain activities and show leadership that will get you ahead. I was told ""they will come to you when they want to promote you"" by HR. "
bad,Worked as a pricing analyst in Northern Trust. Most miserable job I ever had. No team spirit between different departments. It felt like we were working for different companies. Interview process takes half a day and very little training offered apart from reading the company policies handbook.
bad,"Come in and do what you're allocated. If this means you work late/through lunch then so be it. You will not be rewarded for these efforts in the long term."
bad,"Fear of change and complete aversion of risk drive the decision or lack of decision making process. Too many managers with total lack of appropriate experience, and cronyism, are the ""leaders"".  Ha Ha!"
bad,"This place pushed the importance of work life balance so much while I was interviewing and they actually don't care about it at all and work you like a dog. If you try to have some type of balance you are scolded for not putting ""the business"" first. I like the actual job just not the management or the culture of the company."
bad,"Stop hiring 'diversity' if your culture refuses to promote them. Focus on unprofessional staff, managers and HR personnel that continue the disrespectful treatment of others."
bad,"Managers know for months on end whether a project is going to end, and they do not disclose the information until the week of. Unprofessional. If you do have a contract with them, start looking for jobs way before the perspective end date given."
bad,The culture promotes white supremists.  There are a lot of bias and prejudices towards minorities.  The management are unchanging and lack up to date training and understanding on how to be progressive in the workplace.  That is a bit challenging for the company
bad,Very stressful environment and management can make it worse. Promotion is about eye service. Not fair to minorities at all . Not family oriented. Less room for advancement
bad,"Don't treat staff well, looked down on my management with a ""just get the job done at any cost"" culture. Didn't appreciate hard work  or effort. Easily the worst place I have ever worked and most staff talk openly about leaving. No work life balance, pay was poor and no office atmosphere. Advancement nonexistent here"
bad,"This place is very much about the kool aid. Cliques and whose rear you kiss. A complete toxic wasteland, where kissing up is worth more over hard work. Culture there lacked experience as most hires are college grads with huge egos."
bad,It was really boring.  We did the same thing every day.  The only good thing was that they didn't keep track how long we took for lunch or went to the bathroom.
bad,"How you treat others says everything about you as a person, and if your goal is to hold others back.... Alas most of us need income, so as an employee you have to tolerate. I worked for a miserable woman, every time I went the extra mile to assist others, she would say ""why did you do that!' - why not help others if you can if it costs you nothing and makes work life easier? Holding others down and back doesn't make you higher. It says you had a life of disappointment that you now wish to take out on others. Most likely she will now make a big fuss of my replacement, having learned you can't continuously criticize your support staff and not be found out. In my last week, a coworker said ""oh you don't know, the difference in the atmosphere since you started here, it's like night and day"" - the manager did Not want to hear that I was well liked and very capable. The only thing i learned at NT is that there are more people who would hold you back in life than anyone who would want you to succeed, with no nod to teamwork at all. Don't you get tired of having to lie for bad managers, going forward? I have. there was nothing wrong with my work, she just didn't want anyone to shine more brightly, which wasn't hard to do....because at work, I'm not a miserable tard. Great company generally, dimn shame."
bad,"Management and lack of strong leadership are the biggest issues at Northern.  They talk a good game of integrity and ethics, but the leadership is dishonest, untrustworthy, and does not empower their employees.  The leadership lacks gravitas. Management's tendency is to exert authority through bully tactics rather than demonstrating strong leadership.  If you compare their leadership with other financial institutions, it is several steps below.  In addition they are not competitive on the pay scale and would rather lose good people than pay them if they are doing a good job.  Turnover is heavy and reflective of this ongoing strategy.  They are not willing to invest in their people!"
bad,"Without a doubt the worse job I've had in my +20 years working."
bad,"I came in during the Great Recession & was low-balled on my salary but I was glad to at least get a job. I was there for 8 years & only got a small raise once & insulting bonuses (if any). My accomplishments were ignored and my whole team was micromanaged to such an extreme that no adult with real responsibilities like a mortgage & children should ever have to endure."
bad,"I'm sure Northern is a great place to work, but unfortunately because of my manager my experience there was poor. She unprofessional and honestly took pleasure on talking down on me and scheduling weekly meetings just to make herself feel better about herself while everyone in the department disliked her and believed she brought no value to the department."
bad,"They need more training for their managers. Mangers don’t want you to have a voice even though they say they want suggestion, they really don’t! Manager don’t treat all teammates the same."
bad,"If your interest is Human Resources, stay away from Northern Trust. The Human Resources function is being moved from Chicago to Arizona and the roles that remain in Chicago remain in a precariously uncertain place."
bad,it is satisfactory for freshers.It has good  working environment
bad,"Like a cult, you get no respect unless you sell your soul to the organization. And you’ve been there 25 years. Never in my career have I witnessed the backstabbing, the deception, the lies and the employee disrespect I experienced at Northern Trust. My manager, and her manager, went out of their way to create a hostile environment in marketing. HR and employee relations turned a blind eye .."
bad,"Northern Trust is a non cutting edge place to work.  Managers are friendly but have no idea how to incentivize performance.  As such when top people do go above and beyond they are not rewarded. "
bad,The company is a progressive yet personal company to work for.  They care about their employees and their life.   They provide guide lines to succeed.
bad,"Job security here seems be most common priority for employees, instead of being concerned about what's best for the company.  Many employees are entrenched in their positions and are not willing to improve and/or make changes to benefit the company."
bad,The job market is changing very drastically. Professional people that have worked for several years are being laid off. Large corporations are taking advantage of this and refuse to pay people with experience. This company is on its last leg they use experienced people then let them go. All functions are moving out of this country I won't be surprised to hear on the news that it has been bought out.
bad,"Learned a lot, good Management."
bad,The management promotes white females at a very high rate. This makes their diversity numbers look a lot better.  HR is totally ineffective when dealing with reports of racism.
bad,"Nothing in management, I don't like culture in northern trust, too much work pressure, no activity only work, nothing they will not provide, cab facility worst"
bad,"Top heavy management structure in what can be a hostile work environment with no recourse, and plenty of mean spirited, tantrum prone managers."
bad,"High pressure, inadequate manager, Sr Management did not  pay attention to lower management. Very small raises if any. Too busy to take all vacation time. A lot of layoffs."
bad,"A good starter position that will help you develop time management skills, gain access to multiple IT systems, develop client relationship(s)."
bad,Northern Trust is a good place to learn and develop various skills as there are continuous training that is carried out by professionals in the company.
bad,"NT is a very conservative company that has a unique culture. You either adapt or don't. They claim a good work/life balance but in reality if you are part of their operations staff, there isn't much flexibility.  There is significant differences in policy, all depending on the manager and it is subject to change without notice. Advancement is very difficult and outside of 90 minute mini-training modules, there is little provided."
bad,"A typical day at work at northern trust is extremely tiring, usually end up stretching for more than 2-3 hours in a day! Poor team leaders and ops managers in terms of maintaining a healthy relationship with their teams!"
bad,There are no job security at Northern Trust.  Promotion is based on being liked the most and with limited opening.  Openings to employee ratio is very slim.
bad,"Northern Trust has a great foundation as far as providing tools that promote inclusion and employee participation, but the management team cannot seem to get on the same page which hurts the Company. Turnover is high due to low moral, and out-dated business systems. Northern Trust should work harder to improve these areas to remain competitive within the job market."
bad,"work environment is good."
bad,The pay was excellent for the position. They used me to catch up on their work and then left me high and dry. Not a lot of people conversing and enjoying their job.
bad,"A good company to work but management has to value employee's grievances and make work life easy for married women."
bad,I did enjoy a lot working with Northern Trust. It provides a work place environment which focuses more on a diversified couture & it recognizes the talents and encourages the right individuals to climb up on the different job levels.
bad,"If you ever find any serious issues, be careful who you raise them to.  Even if you hold the company's best interest in mind, raising issues to people may backfire."
bad,Not an upbeat place to work.  They seem to promote/foster/embrace individual accomplishments even at the expense of the whole.  Found too many two faced people there.
bad,i dont want to write so many times . i would like to appy for the job. its wasting my time over here. cannot spend so much time to write reviews. people can find out themselves.
bad,"Good work/life balance. Management does not effectively communicate with employees.  Lack of job security.  They are flexible with your start time however, changes need to be made to management.  Politics."
bad,I worked with all women management did not support family life while I was working for them
bad,Long days every week intense workload. No good work life balance.
bad,"Northern Trust has recently changed its emblem from a heavy, firm anchor to a much lighter, smaller one.  This is appropriate as the firm appears lost and doesn't really know where it is headed or what it is doing.  The lighter anchor allows the bank to shift direction when recently implemented changes/products are not working.  Additionally, a smaller, lighter anchor is needed as there are fewer employees now at Northern Trust and the bigger, steadying anchor could not be lifted."
bad,"Depending on the department, there is no room for advancement and management is not in tune with employees who want to become better and learn in order to be productive.  My team has not had a meeting in 3 years and management is deficient in managing people."
bad,"Pro: Culture was friendly as management was always willing to help."
bad,Challenging environment to work in due to numerous reorganizations and realignments.  Introducing change to the betterment of the company is a lengthy process.
bad,"This company now places expenses/costs above anything else in the work place.  You are now asked to do more than your fair share of work, usually more, and not be compensated for it.  Northern is making a push to rid it of older (expensive) employees that have been there with experience and nice salary to hire new personnel at 1/4 the salary.  This company once was a great place to work for, but for the last 5 years it's culture has changed dramatically."
bad,"Northern Trust suffers from a significant culture problem. Despite what the branding says, innovation and risk taking are not in the company's DNA and are, in many cases, actively discouraged. Technology lags 5-10 years behind the curve, even within the industry. There is no drive for or importance placed on excellence in any arena - ""just okay"" is often the norm. Again, despite the platitudes offered by the company's branding, the corporate culture almost disincentivizes working outside of defined job roles to improve the enterprise."
bad,I met some very sincere and nice people at Northern Trust company. I continued to keep in contact with some of my co-workers and managers. It was nice working at Northern Trust the 11 years I was there.
bad,Management are not very supportive and their expectation is very high. Opportunity to grow isn't very well. Office location is good and work life balance is good.
bad,Worked for the company for 8 years. When they let me go I applied for unemployment.  They told many untruths about me to keep me from receiving unemployment benefits. The person from unemployment who determined if I get benefits didn't believe them.
bad,depend on what your role is it ok for me but not a lot of chance to move around within the company....................................................
bad,"I enjoyed the 4 weeks vacation time and corporate discounts. The work can be busy and stressful at times. However, there are down times and slow times that occur frequently."
bad,"This was a great experience for me to develop and learn about the industry of banking and investing.  However, northern has sent some of the jobs here in Chicago to Tempe Arizona as well as India."
bad,"I do not wish to provide a review at this time.  I worked at Northern for almost five years.  I started as an associate accountant and am currently a senior, or technical coordinator."
bad,"Very good working hours, pay and benefits. Not much room for creativity or input into expectations. also not team work oriented, everyone out for themselves."
bad,"Northern is Ok. Nothing special, just Ok. The business wants to succeed. The IT infrastructure teams are holding the entire corporation back. Absolutely no talent on the infrastructure side."
bad,"Great Company to work for, unfortunately very limited for career advancement."
bad,"I really enjoyed my tenure there. And I had to quit as I was relocation to San Jose from Bangalore."
good,"My experience was quite awful."
good,No transparency in the management. No work life balance. Hardly trainings were provided for the beginners. Stakeholder management was good. Rapport building dint work much.
good,"I was blocked from an opportunity by my manager.  I was selected by my exec VP, but my manager NEEDED me to stay in my current role indefinitely.  Reviews included surprises even after a chagne in management occurred."
good,My experience with Northern Trust was not a good one.   The hours were very long and the manager I worked under was not a good leader of subordinates.  A typical work day lasted about 10 to 11 hours daily.  The hardest part of the job was completing tasks in a timely manner.  There was no team work within the corporate actions unit in the hedge fund division of the bank.
good,"NT is a good company overall, and the company pays fairly well. But if you can avoid working in Alternative Investments, I would strongly suggest you do so. The managers in that dept are the absolutely worst! They are very rude and ill mannered. The on the job training was the terrible, and the role is extremely complicated and manual. Very high stress environment, and you can forget about ever leaving work on time. The manager does not care about her employees, and it's evident in her bad attitude. I would recommend looking for jobs in other departments."
good,"Northern trust is always a wonderful company to work in, but the reputation of the company is just spoilt due to the people invovled in management, favouritism, gender inequality is all common here in few teams, before promoting a female partner they consider these points - if married/unmarried they take more leaves, they go on maternity leav for 6months,etc..."
good,"3 stars only because the main offices in Chicago are substantially better than Tempe as far as overall culture, relationships and  management. "
good,Running different reports and reconciling them to ensure everything is accurate before running the Net Asset Value (NAV) report at the end of day. The hardest part of the job is definitely putting in more than 40 hours and the ability to catch on to the material as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable aspect is your assigned clients that challenge your accounting skills.
good,The working environment at my location HIGHLAND PARK TEXAS 5540 Preston Rd. Dallas Tx 75205 has the worst working environment i've ever been apart of.
good,Management was not clear on expectations and failed to provide proper feedback and support leading to unknown issues.
good,"Management favoritism, management immaturity, very political, hard to advance even laterally. Very structured, rules are easy to abide by, great networking place of employment, retirement benefits are good."
good,I never really felt there were teams. there is little to No training for all the antiquated programs they still use.  The pay is so low that everyone is looking to under cut each other.
good,"When I first worked for Northern Trust-Chicago as a consultant, the workplace culture was challenging and a very enjoyable place to be.  When I returned years later, the environment has greatly changed.  A huge amount of IT related work has been offshored.  In many cases,  employee benefits are being slashed and many employees are just hoping to make it to retirement.  Scary place to work."
good,"Northern Trust was a top rated company that cared for their employees and clients.  The culture was inclusive, promoted work/life balance and they worked with their employees to ensure they were in the right positions. There were many employees staying with the company for 25+ years.  However, the culture is changing.  Managers are not buying into the culture of supporting their employees.  It is now about the bottom line. NT is perceived as removing the seasoned employees and replacing them with new college graduates; Thereby, creating job insecurities for long term dedicated employees."
good,"it is a very corporate environment, which means you can only advance whenever somebody else leaves. Promotional opportunity is not based on performance but rather based on corporate ladders. pay is very low compare to other firms."
good,"Horrible, lazy and unproductive management. Toxic environment. Nobody helps each other. Coworkers who are afraid t speak up. Please stay away if you want to have a good career path."
good,"Business is business I guess. They sold you dreams, and then cut the rug from under you. I understand that jobs were better to send offshore, but don't promise nothing is going anywhere only to have them leave"
good,Eight hour a day on average. Great Employee engagement program. Management is routine.  Great Employee engagement program.  Being diverse is challenging. Great training opportunities.
good,"This is not a good place for a Human Resources professional to work.  The focus is only on cost cutting.  HR employees receive little training or development, and many of the jobs are being moved from major metropolitan areas to far flung areas of the globe so job security does not exist."
good,"I've been with the company for over 18 years. I've learned and gained excellent experience in Securities Industry, Accounting and Financial principles. As fund accountant, the job was very stressful, fast pace environment and high risk management. Working hours is usually long, hard to balance work and family life."
good,"Organization's founding principles still severe Clients and employees alike after over 125 years.  Paternal, collaborative culture where decision making authority is difficult to ascertain.  Ethical, hard-working employees who are zealous Client advocates."
good,Good Place to work as an entry level analyst. Great place to learn.
good,Learn Accounting and Finance with training manuals. But Office politics is what was lacking!
good,overall people generally go to Northern to start or finish their careers.  it's a bank so the atmosphere isn't too stressful however pay is not impressive and working you way up the ranks will keep you under the market rate for pay
good,Management is very disconnected from their employees and progress or change implemented by them does not usually improve working conditions. It would add more problems than solutions since they just want to get the technology on the floor without properly testing it and responding to their employees if it works or not.
good,NT encourages employees to have a work/life balance and prides the company's reputation of volunteering and giving back to the community. The culture is open and friendly.
good,Difficult promotions small bonuses low salary nice office . Very easy to get stuck and not grow. Nice people
good,"Overall, fun place to work. However, bad management is killing teams moral. Compensation and benefits are really low as well. The work/life balance is given to some employees but not all."
good,Not much room to advance in certain departments. Opportunities are limited. Work life balance can also be improved upon. Management needs to be trained on activities of their respective teams daily duties.
good,"Culture is good and finding time off is not hard. Benefits are not that great and they Under pay certain departments of the bank. Not a bad place to work, but not a good one."
good,"Nice place to work, people are very friendly. Nice Home and Work balance. Free Buses. Systems need to be up-graded. To many jobs are leaving Chicago.."
good,Company needs to offer better career opportunities and more training. Growth advancement is tiered and restructuring is ongoing.
good,Nothing good to say about the company besides their donations to different foundations and charities.
good,"from process I learnt a lot."
good,"As a consultant I get to advise many different partner areas regarding things like Risk & Compliance matters, Investments & Accounting, Client Reporting or internal audit, technical requirements and solutions.  Every day brings a new challenge which keeps me engaged and on task.  I must stay on top of all new developments and information in order to provide partners with the best deliverable.  My team is small which means we rely on each other for support."
good,"working hard "
good,"normal corporate environment, nice friendly people, computer systems a bit outdated but overall a good place to start your career and learn the ins and outs."
good,Northern is a diverse workplace. Learned to work with many types of people in different areas. Compensation compared to other companies in the same field is severely lacking. Loved the people.
good,"salary is fine, but need to establish work life balance and good corporate work culture.It also depends on the management and area of expertise and department you work for."
good,The company is a good company to work for.  However they need a lot of work with their management team in all groups.  The opportunities for growth is minimal.
good,"I previously worked for Northern for almost 7 years. Overall it’s a decent place to work- gracious vacation and personal time off. The people are pleasant to work with (most days), but management is lacking ambition and drive to actually manage. They have a continuing issue with exclusion & lack of diversity and there are definitely clicks within the office. Northern has a tendency to put the longest tenured person in charge without making sure they’re actually management material. My compensation was also drastically below market-which seems to be an ongoing issue with this company."
good,"Had an interesting career here.  I did get a chance to support several different business units which drove my personal growth in business but pretty much held the same or similar job for most of my career.  I always wanted to be a manager but was never provided the chance.  Also, I was not allowed to go to professional conferences.  I did attend one in my home town but I had to beg and plead for the conference admission funds.  I knew (for a fact) I was not being compensated equally compared to my peers and once I finally caught up, I enjoyed that for only one year.  Then in an effort to save money, my position was eliminated.  This was a few years prior to my being eligible to retire.  Ironically, after being home about 3 months I received two items in the mail that I earned in an employee points system.  Consistently being rated a 4/5 here is no easy task and I did so for 11 of 12 years.  I guess I just got too expensive.  However, the executive above me made more in their BONUS that year than the salaries of me and all my peers who were let go at the same time.  That pretty much sums it up.  It's great if you're an executive."
good,"Professional environment,           good company to work for for mature employees. decent benefits.          Not recomended for       recent graduates"
good,Lots of changes have occurred without much transparency from the top. No to low promotion within and jobs are being sent to Manila. Career paths are not clear and success is determined by who likes you.
good,"Get the experience and leave! Trained by a lackluster trainer who was friends with the manager. Never stood a chance.Trained on what to do, not why!HATED IT!"
good,"Tends to become a stressful work environment. Difficulty in transferring to other business areas. Firm advocate of NETWORKING. Great company resources - tuition reimbursement, discounts, etc"
good,Good for fresher to learn kill. Employee has to learn skills or add skills at over a period of time to achieve great in the company. Have to adjust for management changes .
good,"Some has too much work, some has none, Management remains unaware and follows perception mainly to rate an employee. Paywise good but highly unorganised."
good,"A good company to work for. The company has changed a bit.  However, good people to work with. Managers need improvement not all, however majority can benefit with extensive training. Upper and lower management should be professional, Meaning language used on the floor.  "
good,Management is self focus and out of touch with headquarter. No room for advancement or growth. Nice group off people very laid back atmosphere.
good,"Northern manages to hire amazing people; everyone I've worked with has been amazing. However, there's little to no compensation for promotions and complaints are very rarely addressed."
good,"Co-workers are great, but no work/life balance.  Deliverables to the client are scheduled as such that employees have to be at the office between 10-12 hours every day even when there are no delays in the process"
good,Management are very helpful and give lots of positive remarks about co-workers
good,"A very good place for freshers to start their career."
good,"Productive, challenging and extremely busy. Interact with business leaders throughout Chicago."
good,This job has a lot of culture and ambience. Managers are pretty uppity but they have good structure.
good,"The company is good in terms of opportunities and growth internally where there is an opportunity to move laterally as well as vertically within the same team and also by moving to another team."
good,Very good training classes for employees. Whenever a new product or process was introduced they made sure you were completely trained and knowledgeable of the process.
good,I was lucky enough to work for a great and powerful department where I was given the opportunity to learn new skills and be guided for great managers.
good,"I would still be at Northern Trust if they offered more advancement. Unfortunately, they tend to pigeon-hole their employees in certain roles, offering little to no advancement."
good,"Like at most companies, the experience working at Northern Trust is dependent on which group/ manager you're with. Some are wonderful; some are horrible."
good,As soon as you walk in the door your day starts.  Being there are about 9 years I loved working there and I built not only friends but family.  This is a very fast paced environment where you have to be hands on willing to learn.  You will learn something new everyday.
good,"It's a nice place to start your career. Less benefits , too much work pressure no work life balance . No perks very little encouragement from management."
good,"NT is not a bad place to work. However, it all depends on what type of manager you are under. Sometimes managers will say one thing and do another...."
good,"Overall good experience working in NT."
good,"This company is great for someone coming straight out of college."
good,"Very conservative company and stable career.  Compensation is extremely sub par.  Great networking opportunities.  It was ok, some leadership is fine, but in operations a lot of micromanagement"
good,Lack of compensation for advancement. Northern tries to cut costs at all corners (compensation and technology investment)
good,"I was hired as a contractor in October 2015. I was hired to be a tech writer, but found myself taking minutes during my stay. The people in the Trwasury Department are great. My manager worked in the MRP&A department. At first, we had a good working relationship. But after about two months, things declined. We never had face to face time, expectations and goals were never communicated to me, he only answered questions on IM. I was even verbally abused. This is no place for contractors. They promise your contract will last on the agreed terms, but mine never was. Just be careful working here."
good,Daily process bill payment request for the west region which could be as much as150 payments for both trust and real estate clients. The most rewarding aspect was client satisfaction.
good,I worked in the Middle Office for the Private Equity and Hedge Funds of Funds team. Northern Trust is an old company with it's management and employees not fans of change. It's great if you want a secure job and are willing to be a yes man. In my opinion there are better companies out there to work for.
good,"We work on exception reports like recon breaks, price fluctuation, trade discrepancies, derivatives, fund calculations etc.  At NT we learn about custody business, investment banking, performance reporting and client communication."
good,"Preparing annual and semi-annual financial statements & reports (both excel and word doc) for mutual funds and hedge funds (which include preparation of extended Trial Balances, Profit and Loss account, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows and linking them to the final word document)."
good,"I had a UK shift, so it was a bit hectic at nights as we had over load of work and we had to stretch till late nights. Management always pointed out the negatives and never appreciated the positive side of the employees. The best part of working at Northern Trust was the subordinates , their was unity and understanding, hence it made much easier to work."
good, 
good,Good place to work for the freshers. The work life balance is good. But the salary is not something to talk about.
good,The company provides decent work life balance. Salaries tend to be on the lower side for the industry but the trade off is reduced work hours.
good,"Good company, great people on teams but let down by management"
good,"Great team environment, my co-workers are great."
good,Good ambience and and good work and diversity in this company
good,"I was part of London Rec Process of Custody Reconciliation Team.  Reconciliation is a process where we reconcile own records (the ledgers) to the records of the agent/ sub custodian (the statement).  And, if any outstanding entry (exceptions) Ledger or Statement is created in TLM, then investigate and allocate to the right owners i.e. various departments such as FX team, Derivatives, Income team."
good,The people make it worthwhile. The job itself isn't for me but I did learn a lot of stuff about derivatives. Worked a lot with futures. A lot of emailing back and forth with clients and brokers.
good,"Wonderful company to work, learn, and grow. I started at Northern Trust right out of high and was able to stay long enough to raise my children and return to college through the companies reimbursement program."
good,The Private Passport (online servicing) department has flexible hours. It services clients seven (7) days a week with shorter hours on the weekends. The members of the team are very supportive and have good chemistry. Management is very approachable and accomodating. However they should be better trained so that they can be a better source of information.
good,Nice people to work with  but very low pay for the amount of work required on a day to day basis.  Northern asks employees to do  multiple jobs across the Bank but are not compensated appropriately.
good,A typical day was to make sure all the work came in on time  and sort it out process it  and compare that the address is correct and then fed /ex  or US Mail. the hardest part is when the system went down and we had to manually process all the work.
good,"Northern Trust was a decent company to work for.  However, the pay for Analysts I don't believe was equal to the work that was expected.  I had an excellent manager."
good,Average place to work with very few management opportunities for minorities. Offshore consultants brought in to reduce expenses in spite of the language differences.
good,Management was not helpful. There was hardly any training at this company. You pretty much have to figure it out as you go along. Not a friendly workplace.
good,"Working hours were usually 7 am - 6 pm"
good,one of the big positives of working at northern trust is the job security. depending on the department you are in you can be in the steady 9-5 if that is what you are looking for good place.
good,"I love the culture of the company, it has been great working there. I am just ready for something else. the position that I am in there is no advancement. I would like to advance in my job."
good,"A typical day consisted of strict time management. I learned risk management and mitigation for global and domestic trades. I resolved daily overdrafts and liaised between bank and investment managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to attend classes from outside vendors. The hardest part of the job was learning internal systems, and ensuring errors were resolved before market close. The workplace culture was very structured."
good,"I was recruited by Northern Trust as a Regulation E expert. This was an excellent opportunity at the time, however I am currently seeking other opportunities for career growth which Northern Trust does not currently offer."
good,Employed at Northern Trust Corporation for over 21 years.  The day to day was fast paced.  There is an abundance of work and I had the opportunity to move throughout the organization.
good,"Good place to work, you learn a lot and are exposed to of different things.  A few full time employees didn't treat some of the contractors as their peers.  I might go back, not sure."
good,"Great company to work for. The company is stuck in the olden days, but overall good company. They pride itself on family and their values, which helps promote work life balance."
good,"Good company to get exposure into the finance world. There are many departments and divisions, and with simple networking fairly easy to move around and gain experience in different sectors."
good,The culture is very mild mannered and minimal. Outside of work events are far and few between. The technology is 20 years behind today's standards. There are very good benefits and a yearly raise. People are generally nice but very reserved. There are opportunities for some advancement but you really have to work for them and network well. By no means is working there flashy and there are few perks but it is a place you can earn a steady living with great benefits.
good,Fast paced work environment where team collaboration is strongly encouraged.  Since starting I feel that I have grown in many ways because of leadership and how they show an interest in their staff and seeing growth opportunities.
good,"	Assisted in the conversion of new and terminated personal trust accounts"
good,"Do More with Less, management drives the work of 2 or 3 people into one position and expects the work to be performed in the same amount of time if 2-3 were doing the job."
good,"Great work life balance and culture, but you will sacrifice pay.  I also ran into headway in career growth opportunities.  There is a very old school culture and the company is too conservative."
good,Took great care of their people. At the time the pay was good and benefits were as well. Would have stayed with the company was at a location that was closed
good,Good work culture with some amazing people. You do have a work life balance here. You get to learn a lot of things and you do get to grow as a person professionally as well as personally.

good,"Long hours worked in role "
good,"It is a great place to learn, employee friendly. Place to grow. Management needs to be better in assessing work. Needs to motivate employees when required."

good,"Learnt different processes and had a great time in different teams."
good,"Once again, do not remember my working at Northern Trust other than what is on my resume.  If a miracle happens and I am able to obtain an actual position with pay it will be because I witnessed a miracle."
good,"Northern Trust is primarily a Mainframe shop, but is (slowly) moving to a distributed environment. Projects can move slowly mostly due to budget and resource limitations. "
good,Setting up multiple Fixed Income and Equity securities and maintaining different aspects of securities. Workplace is pretty flexible. Hardest part of the job is working with unmotivated people. Most enjoyable part of my current job is learning something new every day and dealing with passionate people.
good,It's a stable company to work for which is why I've been there for 25 years.  The benefits are great and is another reason why I work for Northern Trust.
good,I did enjoy my time at TNT and all of the peers I was surrounded by while there.  A solid company that is slow to make decisions based on the best interest of share holders and employee.
good,"A slow paced project with limited ability subject matter experts."
good,"The company is good to work for family people, as it provides a good work/life balance. Good people, management is also fair."
good,"Your experience really depends on the department you are working in. I have worked in two different areas of the bank and they are completely different. One department was very smooth operating and had people you could get along with, managers included. Everyone was always willing to help out each other. "
good,Great organization to work for with a number of opportunities to further your career. Compensation could be better to align with the industry standards.

good,"Nice organization ,they provide  good training and nice benefits."
good,"It is a good place to work, the Company endeavours to look after its employees."
good,"In my most recent role I do not have a typical day. The most occurring duty for me would be client inquiries. These are queries from my existing clients, they usually consist of reporting questions, or valuations related issues. My clients also reach out when they are going to try and get into something that they have not performed in the past and want a walk through of what the process involves (steps, documentation, time line and parties involved)."
good,A period of my career which saw progression in a stable environment
good,"Historically, a highly conservative blue blood finanical institution with an impressive high net worth clientele.   The Northern Trust is all about where you went to school and which side of the tracks you grew up on.   There is no ""middle class"" within this company...it's the haves and the have-nots.   But it is what has made this place tick for many years.   If you grew up on the North Shore and went to school at Notre Dame, then this place is Nirvana and your professional career ticket is officially punched for life.   They could of filmed portions of Caddyshack at the Northern Trust. "

good,This company limited growth potential for employees as one was not able to expand knowledge base.
good,"No bonuses, Bad management, soak some experience and move on."

good,I worked with NT for many years.  In my Control position I had contact with many aspects of the business and I found that It is the people no matter where you go who make the experience for you
good,"Great organization but upward is very limited. Very relationship oriented organization. However, solid, steady and very conservative. Changes are being implemented but that is coming way too slow. It also varies what part of the organization you are in."
good,a typical day is typically robotic depending on what division you are working in. The benefits they do offer are really decent in the industry standard.
good,"Finally, this old-school Chicago bank is getting the message. New CEO, new CTO (still searching) catching up to the industry after being behind by AT LEAST a decade.  It can be a very comfortable place to work (although boring) if you manage to find a nice manager (hint: avoid their HFS team).  I was unlucky to transfer to a different group and the management was terrible which forced my decision."
good,It's a great company (stable and solid) but the corporate culture is challenging. You are expected to work after hours and tackle multiple tasks and responsibilities.
good,"Northern Trust is an employee-friendly company; employees (or ""partners"") are well treated. Compensation, however, is not nearly as strong as competitors within the financial services industry."
good,"Northern Trust is a very well-known Custodian in USA. Northern Trust is a good p-lace to work in as there are many profiles, interesting in nature. Thanks."
good,"I have learned a lot since my employment at Northern Trust.  But, hours are sometimes unbearable during the audit season from January through April.  The bonus structure does not compensate for the hours worked during this period."
good,The organisation as a whole was not too bad. The problem was with the management of our process. Most of the times hard work was not appreciated and the management's control over the process was disheartening. They lacked professionalism.
good,"Good entry level company internal moves only apply less than 10 percent pay increase. It is an old school company with old school ways. The way you dress has an impact in your career path, not so much on the quality of work being delivered."
good,"Learning opportunities. Good work culture."
good,"Northern is currently in a period of expansion within the asset servicing/administration sector. Traditional lines of business are steady. Salaries are lower than average for the Chicago market, while benefits are higher than average."

good,Management needs to move faster to enable change management in this highly competitive financial services and technology driven industry

good,The Northern trust provides very well designed wealth management portfolio to the high end customers.

Few opportunities to work remotely, no company wide policy, decision left to your manager."

good,"Not a bad job to have, don't expect to make a lot of money. This company does not keep up with other financial corporations in the industry. People are friendly and your job is secure as long as you do what you are told."
good,The bank is very stuck in their legacy ways.  They are not the most technically savvy.  Many of the people you will work with have grown up at this organization.  New people have to break into the structure and relationships.  If your not up for the challenge this is not the place for you.

Dispatching medical and emergency situations if need be, help preventing bank robberies in progress, conducting safety guide lines for the company. The hardest part of that job in the beginning was to learn the computer system and how to respond to the alarms that were set off, but after sometime and training it became very easy.

good,"Northern Trust is a great place to start a career in the financial services industry. The hours are long which can be a good and bad thing. Training is often done informally, and you must take a lot of initiative to get the most out of the job or to learn new skills on the job. However, there is a lot to learn and its a great place to get experience if you are starting out. The only problem is that at times it feels like you are not given all the tools to succeed."

good,"HR Function is highly specialised to the point that discrete departments working on the same project will show animosity towards one another due to the prevalence of 'us and them' culture. "
good,"The company is known for its excellence in client services, which is true.  The employees consistently go above and beyond to make sure the clients are happy.  The company itself has a great work life balance, where a typical workday starts at 8:30/9 and ends around 5/5:30 (as many employees have children to tend to).  However, with the phenomenal growth that the company has experienced lately, It would be more appropriate to have larger incentive bonuses paid out.  Other banks and financial services companies pay out 2-3X what Northern Trust does.  Now, money doesn't always translate to having a great experience with a company, however the company ends up losing great staff as employees on your team search externally with competitors for those attractive compensation packages.  Typical excellent workers need to be paid 40-50% of their base salary as their yearly bonus to keep them attached to the company for the long run."
good,"High pressure and challenging role which makes the job very rewarding. Highly recommend for individuals who want to be challenged on daily basis and develop their personal skills and professional career.

The clients are nice to you until you tell them no or you can't do that. That's when you see how they really are. Pay and benefits are really good. Just make sure you have a really good manager if not get out. Also don't think about moving up or to another position. HR will give you push back even though you meet all the requirements. They will hire someone else!!! The teller are awesome to work with. Private bankers 50/50.
good,A politically motivated individual will do quite well at Northern Trust. The overall benefits are ok but not as high as other financial services firms. Stuck in the old ways and has a hard time with new marketing challenges such as moving beyond regular tv advertisements. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people on many of the teams but they are so nice that nobody will be honest about what needs to be fixed. The hardest part of the job is the constant politics that have to be played in order to stay relevant within the organization.

good,Northern is a great company if you are looking for a great work life balance.  The environment is good and the people are great to work with.  The pay is not industry average so that is a concern.
good,"Diversity and inclusion, open door policy, CSR responsibilities, employee mandatory off and learning something new everyday was just a brief summary of my time at Northern Trust. Good professional environment and employees were valued."
good,I was a consultant there. It was a nice place to be a Permanent employee. I don't think it quite as nice to be a contractor. The pay is good and the people are great.
good,"NTHFS is a great place to work for individuals who want exposure to a blue chip firm, and have a reasonable work-life balance. That said, the career paths available are frequently obfuscating and the compensation is not strong. Given the brand name and the success of the firm, you would likely expect better."
good,There was a great variety of projects to work on and I was able to interact with several departments that were needed to get the project successfully completed.
good,"Northern Trust is a good place to work peacefully and enjoy the balanced life at the same time. However, as we know no companies will be called as perfect, i have noticed that the company need a good HR structure and effectiveness in review of salary structure over time."
good,Day at work was good.All were very helpful and the management was super. Got a opportunity to work in such a grateful company awesome.
good,"My last few years at Northern(NT), were challenging; never a dull moment. No days were typical work days; learned many new tasks; some training and a few tasks were learned among co-workers. Management wasn't a big factor; being a team player was significant, which proved to be the hardest part of this position for me...Many years of my career at NT were spent supporting management in different areas and departments on a more personal basis.  The most enjoyable were the most rewarding times when knowing that my time and efforts spent on any assignments/projects were acknowledged and appreciated."
good,"For most working professionals, job performances reviews are frightening. You have to sit down with your boss in a one-on-one setting behind closed doors, and your job security feels like it’s hanging on a balance. In reality, performance reviews can be a breeze."
good,"Good place to be , However needs lots of restructuring  &  improvement . Pace is slow. Decision making is slow. No opportunities to advance career"
good,Its a day when your database is need maintenance. Daily checks  and creating roles and previlages to users. Installation  and configuration of databases.

In this role what I learned is the importance of teamwork to benefit the team as well as for the division to meet established goals."

IOO will be the primary point of contact for custodians & Fund Administration."
good,"Every day is typically very busy and sometimes rather hectice with account loads. This position has allowed me to effectively implement communication, organization and time management skills. My peers within the work environment are all great to be around and learn from as everyone brings unique personality and skills that help contribute to personal and professional growth. For the most part this place offers a lax environment, where management wants everyone to feel comfotable expressing their opinions, concerns and suggestions. The most difficult part of this position is probably the amount of information we have to keep up to date with and follow along within the ever changing procedures and responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity for educational and professional growth. Even though I am in an entry level position, the amount and nature of my responsibilities allows me to portray my role through many aspects. I am a client auditor in operations; however in learning our entire process I am able to achieve a sense of technical procedure, review through auditing, and a sense of a supervisory skills in that of ensuring correct procedures take place among the various steps in the audit process, implementing them, making decisions, and taking initiative in relsolving issues and maintaining client satisfaction."

good,Excellent place to grow and learn new
good,"A typical work day was about moving money from one account to another per clients request. I managed a staff of 8 in which I had to ensure that all work received by the unit deadline was completed by end of the day. I ensured that the system was in balance by the debits and credits that was received and processed into the system. I learned as a manager that you are not only there to watch your staff work but, you have to sit down and do the work. Staff repected me more and was willing to go the extra mile when needed. I would say the hardest part of my job was, me, I wanted everything to be perfect, and it was when I did it myself but, we dont live in a perfect world. I took my job to heart where others did not. I would say working with people is very enjoyable for me. I worked in a area were others depended on my department to move money and ensure it met their deadline without delay. I found it to be very enjoyable to assist people on every level."

The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with all the clients that came into the bank, as I love people and got to know all the regulars. I worked with 40 co-workers, who I helped them with juggling all their meetings with their clients that came in, at times having to order catering for these events. No matter what I was asked to do, if I did not know how to do it, they would explain to me and let me do it on my own. I did all their mass mailers, through Microsoft Word Mail Merge; sending out birthday cards or invitations to special events. I was held responsible for opening and closing the bank, keeping track of 40 employees and documenting when they come in or leave the building, whether it be for lunch or meeting a client. Accountable for everyone and the security of the bank during office hours, keeping alert at all times for anyone or anything suspicious. Got to also do expenses for some of the workers that had expense accounts. Assisted in invoicing and keeping track of all bills. A/R and A/P. The hardest part of my job was having to say good bye to all the employees that I loved working with at the end of my two month assignment."
