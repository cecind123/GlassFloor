bad,"Bad management and hours. You are just a number. Corporate is worthless and dont recognize good work ethic. Poorly pay their employees. Cut a lot of corners too save money, such as not hiring associates too cover hours and tasks so onlu get one day off and work you night and day. So work a lot of crazy hours."
bad,"This was not a pleasant experience,  mangers treated u horrible there, and we barely got time with are family's, it was like being in high school all over again"
bad,"he sleeps in pharmacy area thats like a closet and behind starbucks at bar stools always on a laptop yelling at it   uses staff break room he puts carts away and puts food away  he DOESNT WORK THERE. not the best hygiene dont like some1 with bad hygiene touching food i might buy."
bad,They will fire you over hearsay if you are non union. They favor other employees over others.. pay depends on who you are. Very unfair company to work for. They allow a hostile work environment.
bad,"I was a meat department manager. I was not given near enough labor hours to do anything. But when some VIPs were coming to the store I would get all kinds of help from other stores. So my department would look great. Then back to normal. Then store management would get on my case and wonder why everything look bad. Then I was fired while I was in the hospital, still fighting them in court."
bad,Place is a joke!! The management is a joke.  The union is a joke.  They fire your for medical reasons that's holy can't control. I would never recommend anyone to work here!!
bad,I will never go back to work for this company..However I have this company 9 years of employment...Now that I’m no longer there and found another job I wish I would have been left
bad,"No senior leadership.   No training.  High priced, minimal staffing.   Expect you to do work of 3 people.   Hours are often evening late shifts.  There is no support.  Computer systems are outdated, always off line.  New programs not explained"
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked at. Very bad management. Hostile, sexist, and racist. The benifits are extremely high and they only want non educated men to work there."
bad,Managment sucks it's not the cleanest warehouse around. Most of the equip (pallet Jack's and forklift ) dont work. Would have to work alot of 12 hour days due to the fact of not having enough staff to effectively pull the volume for the day the turnover rate is high and theres not chance for career advancement I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,This company made me feel as if my hard work was never enough. I felt disrespected as a human being because of management and other authoritative figures. I do not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,Management does not care about their employees or even know anything about one employee. Other employees don't care what you do and bring up false accusations to make you loose your job. It is a cut throat world and are expected to perform at a certain level after your second week of employment. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Management don't care what type of work higher seniority people do. So much time and money wasted. Don't shop anyspartan storepperhigher sen
bad,Horrible company to work for!! I wouldn't even suggest my enemies to work there!! Management caters only to the employees that suck up. Corporate is just as bad! They say they care but don't do anything to fix the problems. It should tell you something when the senior person there had been there less than 5 years.
bad,Lazy workers. I started working there and within a month everyone started to slack. I wasn’t about to keep busting my back for no 10 an hour. I’ll find way better.
bad,"Work you to the point that you end up having chest pains. They don't care about people who have disabilities, and lot of people are so negative to the point that they will tell you if you don't like it quit without giving you advise and how they do the job. It's everyone for themselves. Nobody cares"
bad,"The management at the Lakeland facility is a joke. Employees come and go as they please and the other more skillful employees are left to pick up the slack. When they hire new employees it’s almost like they don’t even care about experience they just hire who comes in through the door first. Good luck make any kind of real money or advancing in this company as all of the management are all buddy buddy sitting comfy doing close to nothing in there office. Also, it’s  the only place I’ve ever worked where the management will leave early for what ever reason and leave you to count on other employees to do there job without any supervision. It’s not a bad stepping stone but not a place you would want to stay for a long period of time. Unless of course you’re Hispanic and a max pay of $15 IF you’re lucky is what you want to do for the rest of your life."
bad,never knew what time I was getting off work was the biggest problem I had here. The work it self was easy all I had to do was pick cigarettes and put them on a cart where they belonged.
bad,"things have gotten very bad for employees . We are expected to do 2+ peoples amount of work in less amount of time . The atmosphere has deteriated since i started 10 years ago. No hors how do you tell a parent that needs money to care for their family that they can only have 20 hours and no benefits."
bad,It was good till company decided to break the union.After they did that pay went down and then they moved the company out of Appleton Wi. Everyone lost their jobs.
bad,"They will get what they can out of you then cut you loose. I was mentally drained after my first month working for them but stayed for 1 year but then enough was enough. If your a female, be careful because its the good ole boys running the show. They don't believe in equal work/equal pay, they treat females like dirt."
bad,Words really cant describe the injustice this place is... and anyone who has ever worked at this location for any amount of time can concur... there team of management is a joke... nothing good can be said about this place... one might think I'm over reacting... but trust me.. all it would take is for 1 higher up individual from management to come to bluefield.. and speak to the workers... not the team of management... the people who are actually doing the work... and then maybe... just maybe something might change.. but as for me ... I dont see that happening anytime soon.
bad,"If you want to work for a company that does NOT value you as an employee, this is it.  Forced to join a union that doesn't do anything for you except take your money.  Management is a joke.  There is a reason they have such a high turnover rate."
bad,"This company couldn't care less about you. Get paid same as everyone regardless of experience or how long you've been with the company. No vacation time or sick pay. The management only approaches you when they think you do something wrong, which is all the time. They will always call you in. They think you owe everything to them. Your suggestions or concerns will get you nowhere. They will never back you up if a customer is giving you an issue. You're just a number to the company and are not valued at all. If you're expecting to be able to advance in this company, you won't. Don't waste your time"
bad,"Even expecting that I would be at the bottom of the totem pole coming into this job I was blown away with how little respect there was. Co-workers, managers, customers, everybody looked down on you. Even after proving yourself as a valuable part of the ""team"" there, you still are shown little respect and basically have to beg for hours and to move up positions. Would not recommend this to anybody."
bad,"Do not work for this company. They have no direction, do not stick to any of their values and operate a fortune 500 company like it is the family business. They will use you and then throw you away."
bad,"If you can not find a job anywhere else and need to pay your bills, this is a last resort job for you. Do not plan on staying long, unless you can not find another job."
bad,"No manager was on duty in my dept....ever.  Store managers rarely assisted and rules were never followed.  When I tried to discuss solutions for some of the problem areas, I was told, by management, that they didn’t need help.  Problem was, the managers/gm had no plans on fixing internal issues therefore were unable to keep positions staffed and could keep or find a manager for the dept I worked for.  Surprised no one has been ill from food and that no employee has been injured."
bad,"The pay is bad, Management is irresponsible, it's extremely stressful since we're always understaffed and being overworked. They'll have you working full time hours but have you as part time so you don't get the benefits."
bad,You have to work in a -30 degree freezer no option management is nonhelpful in any situation and do not listen to employee concerns and is unfair on employee complaints
bad,Will do everything possible to ruin up your career. 15 hr days with no breaks is common. Management (and i use that term very loosely here) is clueless as to how to run a business and deal with people.
bad,"Spartan was a horrible place to work. The upper management cares nothing about the people under them, looking only at the numbers that they report in order to get their bonus."
bad,Spartans gnash is a joke they have manger by know means has any ideal what's going on u better off looking else where for job. They are rude to drivers if you speak up for your self. They will make up stuff to let u go
bad,Very rude and demanding won't listen if it's not there way it's no way! I was hired to make cakes never got to touch a cake.. I was yelled at a lot because I was only trained for a few days and didn't have it down to a tee within the first week
bad,"This was not a very good work environment.  The employee moral was very low.  The management was hardly seen and not supportive at all.  There were not decent benefits or incentives.  I would not recommend working here to anyone.  The only thing that I enjoyed working there was some of the people I worked with.  My supervisor was the only reason that I stayed there as long as I did."
bad,"Hypocritical management, under staffing, over scheduling, minimal training, managers won't help, computer interfaces outdated and terrible, left alone as only cashier constantly, guilted into covering shifts, your life doesn't matter"
bad,"I was being pushed out the door as soon as we got our new Store Director. He wanted to bring his friends from his old store. We had a lot of management and long time employees quit because of him. He will outright lie to get what he wants. I've been to HR and that was a waste of time. They just made excuses for him. This place does not care about the ""underlings"", which in my opinion are the ones who keep the store running"
bad,They promise a lot raises promotion clothing reimbursement. But never see any of it. Management is rude and demeaning.
bad,"nice environment  "
bad,They said your work is based on insensitive based the harder you work the more you earn.  But what they doesn't tell you is that the timer is twicked so you have to work as 3x harder to get incentive. And if you don't get 100% every night you is subject to be terminated. How is that possible if you new to a company and you are trying your best. All they care about is their order being out on time.  And their numbers & stats. But not you the employee &people
bad,"Director is incompetent"
bad,I didn’t like working there the managers would stick one in one spot and if the freezer needed help they’d take you out of the place with the least people to make you help the freezer
bad,Poor MANAGEMENT. You have to be a favorite to advance. The culture is the workers verses the bosses. If you're liked you're fine if one dislike you all go against you. I was in management and it's a sad culture. Overworked and under paid. Hardly any breaks and no compassion. Needs revamping BAD. If only corporate knew ththings
bad,"If you have a chance to go drive for someone else do it. Don't waste your time on this bunch, you can do better. This job will give you more stress then anyone can handle. If your not on high blood pressure medicine when you start then you will be when you leave."
bad,"I worked at the Albion MI location for a month and it was the most stressful job I've had. I've worked retail for over 5 years. Working at Meijer, Walmart and Kroger. For $10 we were forced to work three different departments and we were treated rather poorly by management there. We are not allowed to leave until the jobs done either. Low pay, rude management, too much work."
bad,SpartanNash is led by a boys club. You have to be part of it to be promoted and recognized. They do not adhere to their values or mission. The only good benefit is their salary short disability that pays 100% while on leave. The Talent and Training department is inconsistent with its practices and inadequate for the organizations needs. Leaders do do not listen team members needs.
bad,Poor leadership from upper management.  Losing the hometown feel and becoming a chain store that just doesn't care about their customers.  Long hard work days with a short 15 minute break.
bad,This place is nuts! I wouldn’t recommend this place to a dog if they could work! Management SUCKS and all they want is the money! They could careless of their employees and no one is held accountable for anything in this ZOO!
bad,"I was hired to work on the service counter, which involved taking care of faxes, incoming phone calls, lottery, western union, bill pay and customer service. When Family Fare took over I was given another register to operate plus I was responsible for the above tasks, which was not only stressful but was not fair to the customers waiting in line at one register while I was servicing customers at another register."
bad,Management are clueless about what goes on. The company it self does nothing for there employee's. Most of the work is easy except for the upstream department. It's run by the teamsters union they are horrible.
bad,There are never enough stockers. There is poor management in all departments. Not enough is being ordered to stock for sales floor. Turnover is high. Good employees let go for speaking up on issues. Staff is not cohesive throughout departments. Budget is based on managements bonus.
bad,"This company treats everyone like trash. Upper management is horrible, and only cares about themselves. Ever since Nash came into the picture, it has gone down hill even more. Nash has final say on everything, even though Spartan supposedly took them over."
bad,"There is very little positive about this organization. The industry is changing faster than ever, but the majority of the work is done on a series of non-interconnected systems that have not been updated since the 1990s. Career development is nonexistent, pay is below industry standard and flexibility entails policies that most companies adopted in the middle 2000s."
bad,Just walk away unless you are truly desperate for a meager paycheck. There is no on training other than when they tell say you did it wrong. And on a good day you are expected to do the work of only three people.
bad,"Didn't give our facility a chance to shine, never tried to get us better business, never invested any time to try and keep us open"
bad,"Don't work there, unless you are black an just out of jail, company will only pay you just enough to stay off well fare. "
bad,"I have worked at this location for 20 years and this year will be my last. I am in a position to get a bonus every year, which never happens. We were told that we met all the hoop jumping criteria this year to get our full bonuses. Then they add something new. They tell us to reduce store inventory by a hundred thousand dollars. From what I was told this was done. Now it's the end of the year and guess what. Yep...no bonus again.  Apparently the company made some bad investments and for that reason we get squat. Maybe someone should tell them that their best investments are those of loyal employees who actually thrive to make things better.The last time I missed work was 9 years ago. I have 20 years experience and what is my reward for such loyalty and hard work you may ask? I get my hours cut.  I am leaving this year because I am too good for this company.  They do not appreciate or deserve my work experience for another year."
bad,The worse place ever. To the equipment all the way to the building itself. The managers are horrible and there is favoritism everywhere in that company. I pray that hard workers don’t involve themselves with this company. It will kill you mentally and physically. It so bad in there that that have a trainer that trains order selectors everyday because so many people quit weekly. Be my guest to apply.
bad,Job sucks.1 stars is too many in my book.This is completely a dead end job.No real company is too disorganized for me. Great job for someone with no drive in life.
bad,"This company doesn’t care about the employees, they claim they do but then they change your schedule and have you work 6-7 days a week because they can.  Some of the managers are actually pretty good but the bad ones like the perishable supervisor make the entire company look bad.  He acts like he’s looking out for everybody’s best interest but then sits there and talks about other managers behind their backs, and god forbid you call in.  He’s definitely talking about your female problems or your personal life.  And don’t bother applying here if you have a felony, they only allow those in management.  They could careless about the employees, they claim they do because “who else spends money on steak lunches for employees”.  Well maybe if you treated employees right you wouldn’t have to bribe them with steak lunches and don’t pretend like you bought anything for the employees.  You simply wrote off some steaks from inside the warehouse and cooked them.  This company could be a decent place if they would replace some of the managers/supervisors and the shady unethical leads that bring down morale and stop letting HR brush things under the rug.  If you ever have any issues don’t bother going to HR, just call the ethics line and go over HR’s head, otherwise they will downplay it and make you feel like your feelings or experience is invalid.  And speaking of HR, god forbid you ever decide to resign or give notice.  She will give you dirty looks and close doors in your face because your quitting so why should she pretend to care even a little.  And to sum it up.  Don’t work here."
bad,RUN...RUN..RUN.. Management is poor. Most of the supervisors are dating or having fun time with one of their employees. If you upset one by asking a valid question they run to their mate or fun time buddy and make your life a living nightmare.There a a couple of supervisors that do care about the employees but the other supervisors talk bad about them to the associates.  The human resource people are wonderful but again supervisors bash the.them threaten you if you want to speak with HR. They play favorites and often go after the non faves. The female supervisor cussed at me I asked to leave her office and speak with HR. She said HR was ignorant and she was in charge. The whole place is Jacked up. I would recommend you run for the hills.
bad,"Don't work here if you ever expect to make enough money to live on. After 6 years I was making less than a dollar over base pay and three dollars less than starting pay at one of our competitors. Store management is fine, but upper management are don't care about anything but the columns of numbers in their reports and constantly make decisions that make no sense at the store level. My last year working here I got a 1.4% raise (less than 20 cents), while the President and CFO got a $540,000 bonus."
bad,"I had a terrible 8 month experience at this company. Not organized, short staffed all the time, unbalanced work schedule. Overall not a good company to work for."
bad,"I worked at Spartan for less than a month.  My first week they would force me out by 830pm every night after a few short hours of what they called training.  Weeks 2 though 4 however I was scheduled to be off by 10pm, I was fortunate to be out of there by 130-2AM. "
bad,Management does not do a very good job managing. They need to learn to do their jobs and not single people out and make them feel like they don’t Corporate is a joke and expects unrealistic expectations. I would never work there again.
bad,"Very bad communication,  very bad store manager. Employees were treated very bad, never getting there breaks. Training was the worst, if asking for help every one was just to busy.  There is only a select few that would have to follow store polices. As a department manager we were made to work if call in on our day off. Got calls from store director to tell us things we did wrong on holidays and days off, not to mention got in trouble from store director on sales floor in front of our customer's. Never got a thank you for going above what was expected of us. But heard about it if they thought we weren't good enough. This job was so very stress full even on a day off there is worry that we would get a call. I would love to be able to talk with a corporate person to express how the store i worked in was so very unfair. I worked at this store for 4 plus years had 3 store directors and the 1st ones were enpressed with my work but then came #3 and there wasnt a thing i could do right didnt matter how much I put into my job. I loved my job till i was targeted, my customer's loved me and I worked very hard at my job and team work. You as a company have know idea what this has done to one employee of yours. How does a company decide to get rid of a total dedicated employee?"
bad,"At the beginning of when I was hired with Spartannash it was great, my store director gave me many opportunities to move into new positions and learn more. Although Spartannash had closed the first locations in which I worked I was able to transfer to another location & able to do everything I could at the first. It wasn't until I became the Receiving lead that things went downhill, I went through 3 different store directors within 3-4 months & the last two had actually gotten to the point where if I voiced my concerns to them I was ignored."
bad,"work , life balance non existent - No communication or organization between departments or shifts. Horrible experience working here, There is no training programs in place , this is not a family environment , no one wants to help anyone"
bad,"Company did not care about employees, had a do more with less mentality, would fire, hire, train and fire employee after employee."
bad,"Hostile work environment. POOR LEADERSHIP. long hours, racism, prejudice, worst manager ever GUY GROSS. Drivers are vulgar and racial. LIARS and CHEATS"
bad,"The Grocery Store I used to work for used to be owned by a family oriented business that I enjoyed working for thoroughly. They knew everyone by name and genuinely cared about us all .Once Spartan bought it and took over they made promises to try to keep things the same or close to it but it quickly turned to all business no Fun. The caring or compassion that used to be there was replaced by rules and regulations ....You can't do this you can't do that ...can't can't can't..The employees started nitpicking at each other due to high pressure from above and the benefits and pay scale went downhill.Our feeling of family was replaced by whos going to tell on who first and angry/tense people. I will never work for another Spartan store again. They are more about optimizing dollars for their higher up higher paid Associates aKa Big Dogs. They do not  care for the little guy who spends many of their own hours trying to be as successful as possible and puts in a dedicated 14 years of their life on the field and off the field .I finally decided to let go and move on and wasn't even given a thank you for your 14 years of service from any boss except 1. SHE was the only reason I held on for so long because she still tried to bestow the same values as the original owners. I HIGHLY recommend one seriously avoid any position with SpartanNash. It is too high of expectation for little pay , benefits, or recognition. My pay grade went up $1.50 an hour to switch from a Cake Decorator to Manager for MANY more responsibilities."
bad,Poorly managed. Management tend to look for blame rather than solutions and progress.
bad,As a former produce manager I found that the company was in a state of indecision and very very poor store management. Our Albertsons store was bought out by Nash Finch and within two years the store had lost well over half the business that Albertsons had. If you would like to work for a company that has very bad internal structure you should go for it.
bad,Was suppose to work 4 10hr shifts but worked 5 10 hr plus shifts.They were always changing my days off when I told them that I had stated that I couldn't work them before hand.The management could careless about u and ur family.After u work from 7am to 11pm or later u still have to clean the warehouse for another 2hrs.They will stop the whole shift to clean something up that someone else did.They are rude about it as well. I started out making 14.00hr and within 3 months they dropped my pay to 12.00hr
bad,"Would highly not recommend this company to work for. "
bad,"Spartan Nash is a great company, but the Columbus division is the worst it's full of corruption and bad management.This company makes you go through to much for some benefits. The police are constantly coming to this division. The management is horrible here the turnover rate is off the charts. I've literally seen a handful people start here stay for two days then leave. The transportation manager needs to be replaced every driver has made a complaint but nothing happens. The dispatchers are horrible when calling back if its a crisis while doing a run. So many of Spartan Nash trucks/trailer need to be out of service but dispatch forces the drivers to take them. If your a driver with kids they won't be seeing much of mommy/daddy you only have a 10 hour break. The payroll NEVER gets the pay right and dispatch NEVER has an answer for it. Not to mention the company gave all drivers a well deserved pay raise then took it back. My pay went up after my 3 month probation period then went right back to my starting pay. One year later still the same pay and the same pay problems. I wish i wouldn't have wasted time at this division."
bad,The bluefield va warehouse is a joke. The only reason the pay is good is because they will work you 16 or 18 hours a day. Management splits tickets at the end of the night and the favorites hardly get any work while the ones that have worked there selves to death get loaded down. If you like to get treated terribly  and literally work until you cant harldy walk then this is the place for you. They got more stores to cover then they hav e employees to get the work done. The boss dont even care about that warehouse because he is putting that place in his rearview. Your always walking on egg shells because they dont care to fire you for any reason especially if they dont like you or youre not a favorite. You will work from 2 pm in the day until 5 in the morning and you may as well forget youre holidays because you can garuntee you will spend it in the warehouse and not with youre family. If you plan on working there good luck to you i promise youre gonna need it.
bad,"The management purposely fired their best employees, a woman there didn't get a promotion within 15 years. Many employees who had paid time off were fired. It's disgusting the way SpartanNash treated employees."
bad,"If you like you ideas not being heard, and management not listening, this is for you.   The culture is very siloed and secretive.  Turnover is very high.  Financial outlook for retail is abysmal."
bad,The job is set up for young athletic men. Intense labor standards for little pay. You Rarely get a weekend day off and mainly work 2nd shift. Not a great job for family life.
bad,"once Spartan came into the picture, every day was absolute CHAOS."
bad,"This company expects an incredible amount of work with very little/skilled help or time. They pull bodies off the street just to fill positions and dont really care whether they are a good fit. Then if you dont want to be a part of the ""click"" they find a way to get rid of you,  even if it's for something very small and stupid. They act like they care and they act like you are part of there ""family"" but the truth is they will have your job listed before your obituary makes the paper!!"
bad,Forced to work 20 days straight 10-12hrs a day and it doesn’t look as if anyone besides high senority will ever get a day off. Work all holidays and weekends. Heavy lifting and hard work. Cold environment. Great place for someone thats alone in the world.
bad,I worked there for 2 years nothing but thieving pirates there everyone steals for management to workers janitors an all. long breaks people leave an go when they want ppl walks off job
bad,"SpartanNash is a terrible negitive place. All the supervisors care about is your proformance, your co-workers are rude and you work long physically and mentally draining hours. Can't even take breaks anymore due to fear of being written up. Find work somewhere else, this job is dangerously stressful."
bad,The two managers at the store in Sterling Colorado have to be two of the worst ones I've ever met. They do not care for their employees well beings and make a lot of empty promises. They work their people into the ground while sit of their a**** in their office all day.
bad,Poor management and training.  No one is held accountable.  Too many times only a few people are actually doing work.  Managers turn blind eye to those not doing their jobs in the department.  Management style is basically putting out fires/reactive and not proactive.  No real day to day or long term plans.  Employees feel under appreciated and the department is understaffed for customer service.
bad,"No thanks.no training and you work way harder then ur paid for.  I'd recommend to someone fresh out of high school learning about why you should go to college. ""HR"" was really nice but has no clue what it's like working on the floor.felons and no hs diploma needed."
bad,"The pharmacy is so small, yet amazingly enough no one can communicate effectively. There are favorites as well.. Management is way to relaxed and focused on talking versus doing. Other than that, great place to work, i loved that i got the experience. Very rare job!"
bad,"If you want to be over worked and highly unappreciated, this job is perfect for you. "
bad,"While this place has a long history in the grocery industry supplying small to medium stores, it certainly isn't a solid career choice in today's economy as the smaller stores are being acquired/eliminated by the likes of Walmart and Amazon's ventures."
bad,"They really don't care if you make it or not. Their night shift supervisor in the grocery warehouse is suppose to meet with you one a week till your probationary period, but he doesn't even do that simple task. If you are really in need of a job then apply here, otherwise don't even bother"
bad,"I have been with this company since it was MDV, new management team do not listen to the employees. I have seen people work 16 hours straight and still cant go home. We now have to work all holidays that we use to have off. No profit sharing or raises this year. We have people that have been here 10 and 30 years but they go outside the company to hire supervisors who we have to train then they leave with the experience. If they don't like you, you will not advance."
bad,"Management is terrible..got the work loaded on me and I went to my boss several times expressing how stressed/ overloaded I was and I got absolutely nowhere...everyday walking on eggshells hoping I didn't screw anything up because the system of doing things was such a mess..terrible lack of communication between departments. No positive reinforcement, just the delightful ruthless business of the corporate world. "
bad,Very fast paced but very low hours scheduling . Good training quality but the management is very limited and communication between managements is very lacking.
bad,If you like to work hard and get little credit this the company for you. Some of the people are great to work with but there is a lot to be said about the management and lack of it. This company struggles with trying to decide if they should be a retailer or a wholesaler.
bad,A typical day consists of getting work orders picked and shipped out to customers per their requests. One of the many things I liked about Nash Finch was that I was able to work on my own with very little or no supervision at all. Although management could have done better in some instances they did make it an okay place to work. The hardest part of my job was having to pick orders that needed assistants (such as over 75lbs or more boxes) because I always had to wait on that assistant.
bad,Just another big name that does not care about the little guy. You do not get paid enough to spend so many hours inside of a freezer with no windows. worse place ever.
bad,"It is favoritetism, very dangerous place to work ,everyone on ther phones not paying attention at all.damage product all over.this company been bought three times.very poor management, the workers are lazy and very slow, and most of all they do not have nothing organized at all."
bad,"Upper management hasn't a clue.  No support is given to floor supervisors."
bad,"I started working 7am to 3pm easy 8 hours but easily was having to work 10 to 12 hours a day. As I got hired straight through after being a temp, they were changing everything. They took out third shift and brought them all to first. I was going to have 3 day weekends and work 6to4 every Tuesday through Friday. The first day attempting that, I realised they were going to make us to 15 hours at the most that day and I couldn't do it. It was ridiculous!"
bad,"Worst place I’ve ever worked at, worked 3rd shift only had to deal with them not so bad but the store director  is the worst got yelled at for only waving at her when she hollered good morning"
bad,"It work long days, and hour. I honestly didn't enjoy this job! The co-workers were, management was bad. Overall not a great place to work for!! I"
bad,"Unfortunally I was disapointed in the company as they allow horse play and nasty jokes to be told on the clock, They also will not honor hours of avalability. They also play favortisim, for example one person can have a visible body piercing while another person may not. "
bad,"Selfish general manager who cuts the budgets for everything back so he can receive bonuses riduculous scheduling no equipment gm refuses to get them fixed everything gets ignored by gm but wants workers to do the job still and is aware of all the errors goin on "
bad,"This company was by far the worst place I've ever worked! The mangment had no clue what was going on, I reported a employee taking product's from the warehouse and was repremanded for it. Never work here, the parking lot is a pot smoking spot for the employees, there is no safety process while I was there a kid had his leg broken in 3 places. The top shelf in full of unwrapped heavy products that fall all the time. This place is a fatality waiting to happen. These people take pill get all kinds of high then run around on forklifts and pallet Jacks all day."
bad,"Enjoyed my job and people I worked with very much. Nash Finch bought company in 2010 and as a result they went from 300 people to 35. I loved the challenge of my job had to wear many hats. I would have three teams of workers on the dock to unload trucks I would makes sure drivers paper work matched up with the product received and signed bills. Was in contact with the guards at gate to see what drivers needed to be received and who showed up or not, would call there company and see where they were. I also took all the appointments for first and second shift. would let buyers know what products had been received. Drivers had to pay a fee to unload I would receive cash and checks and write receipts."
bad,"a typical day consist of me on the sweeper/scrubber cleanng,it was negative energy in there all the time the poeple that worked there act like little kids and the management was only good when someone was visting."
bad,"At first I thought it would be a great place to work. I was so wrong! They are a horrible company to work for. Management doesn't value your hard work as an employee. You're just there to meet their high expectations & make them money, other than that you don't matter. I told my manager multiple times that I needed to change my hours and she didn't care or try to work with me at all & refused to let me work a different shift. They don't have proper equipment to do tasks as quickly as they prefer. Everyone is stressed most of the time due to them being understaffed. Not paid well enough for the job requirements."
bad,It is not a easy job and it is hard to secure the job you after worry about losing it the first 3 months of work and you will not have much of a life outside of work with this job.
bad,"People are not friendly , no one will help , plant manager and human resorces dont know anything , no clear raises you are lucky to get a day off , i wish i never would have taken the job  to sum it up you are just a number to this place"
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. The management is a joke and they lie to you about little things. They went from some overtime. To working 12 hours everyday all week and some.
bad,Wear heavy clothing get lots of rest stressful long wlork hour didnt know what time you would be going home call for overtime during shift expect you to make 90% rate everyday not possible boos come to you daily asking you to perform superman status while working in a below zero environment reall the jobs has good pay but no family time
bad,"No communication, nice co-workers, manager was a moron...mean and anxious to work with!!! Always on edge you might do something wrong for the pay you get. Want you to work multiple positions for your pathetic hourly rate!"
bad,Long work days with unhappy employees and no compensation from management.  Terrible schedules with no concern to life outside the company.  Must be willing to work weekends and not be compensated in your reviews or financially.
bad,"I worked for Spartan nash for several months and found the work environment very poor and stressful management would rather go on vacation all the time or smoke cigarettes all day, the pay for the work was hardly anything one cannot support themselves working for this company unless you are in a management position the hours were okay the treatment of employees male to be specific was bias and not healthy and acceptable for a good work environment"
bad,"Nash just got gobbled up by Spartan with a public announcement of a ""merger"" but it's a total takeover by Spartan. Everything is moving to Grand Rapids - Minneapolis will be a shell of its former self in the next 6-12 months."
bad,"worked there for 10 months and it stated out good but went downhill fast. there was no communication between management and employees. employees are expected to be mind readers. even if you do your job, if the managers don't like you, you will not last long. poor excuse for a company that is supposed to take care of veterans and military. all they want is bottom dollar"
bad,A typical day included running order management reports for 2 distribution centers and 12 warehouses.  Auditing the management reports and all new order entries.  The hardest part of the job was being dumped after 3 days of training on a totally new software program and expected to learn it  all in 2 months and NOT make mistakes.  Management was poor.
bad,Its definitely not a team job after your training is up which usually last 2-3 days then its every man for themself 12-16 hr shifts & only 2 days off.
bad,"Pay is Awful, expectations high, no one is held accountable so the ones who work hard have to work harder and are not appreciated. So disorganized and employees are taken for granted"
bad,"Management sucked and the benefits weren't worth it. 10% of all groceries, working over 10 hour shifts, but barely making over minimum wage? Not worth it."
bad,High turnover rate...high absentee rate for employees...lack of heat in the pharmacy...often wore a winter coat and gloves while working.  Lack of communication between corporate office and individual pharmacies.
bad,"Union-run shop. A badly ran Union shop. Part-time casual workers equals 60 hours a week. Low wages, daily overtime. Extremely hard to get full-time and accepted by the Union."
bad,"Worked in a deadline based atmosphere that could be hectic, but fun. I was there to simply do my job, but often times, people's personal lives were the driven force behind nearly everything. I thoroughly enjoyed working in the art department creating new and interesting logos each day."
bad,I've worked here for almost two years and you are literally just a number to them. Management sucks and if you get on the bad side of the warehouse director you might as well kiss your job goodbye. They don't treat their employees like humans beings and sometimes you work up to 20 hours a day with no time compensation for long hours so one long bad day can destroy your check for the week. None of the employees work together unless they're friends and this place is full of drama. They physically mentally and emotionally destroy you. The pay sounds great but you have to kill yourself and put others safety in danger just to make good money.  If you're looking for a job that doesn't make you want to kill yourself everyday you show up this is definitely not the place for you.
bad,"Work and life balance isn’t even at all. Work really hard and no recognition. Pay is good, which is the only good thing about this company. Turnover is bad, no one wants to come to work."
bad,"This company keeps most of its workers under 30 hours a week so they don’t have to give them benefits. They are constantly worried about their labor budget and pressure the managers greatly about it. Overall I feel it is unfair but might work for some people. In my opinion, many parts of the job don’t work and they need to improve how they do things."
bad,"I don't know where to start, let's see poor management, horrible organization and communication amongst staff, they like to play with your money so if you don't save all your trip sheets and paysheets you will miss the mistakes they make on your pay and get screwed over!!! Union Representation is the worst ever, all the Transportation Manager cares about is saving money for the company so he can get a big bonus even if it means screwing the driver's over by any means necessary!!!"
bad,I am not going to go into detail as it is not professional.  Lets just say I would not go back there to work for any reason.  To go any further would not per right for me at this time.  I left the company on my own terms.
bad,"If you don't mind hard work, then this isn't a bad place to work. Upper management, especially the ops manager, plays favorites big time and those people can basically do whatever they want. HR is nice but clueless. A couple good supervisors who actually care and try, a couple who are burned out and don't seem like they care and one who doesn't know what they are doing (and half the time doesn't do their job) but gets special treatment because of the Ops manager. If you aspire to become a supervisor, or move up, avoid this place."
bad,"Cash out customers. Learned how to oversee self check out.Management not so friendly. Work place culture ok. Hardest part of the job to many managers with different policies. Most enjoyable"
bad,"The only thing I enjoyed about working for them was my coworkers. They unfairly paid me, paid the new employees more than me and didn't plan on raising me up to them after I had been there for over a year. Once I got the raise to what they made, they got paid even more. I was a very good worker and I still was told I wasn't good enough. No, I would not recommend working for them."
bad,"I have been working here as a barista for about 5 years. I enjoy the work, but the management is terrible. And the pay is even worse. It seems like every time I get a raise--it is because they have raised minimum wage. You do not get the benefits of working for a Corporate Starbucks, but they have flexible scheduling conducive to putting yourself through college."
bad,"I have been an employee of SpartanNash since the two companies merged.  It seems like more work is added to the in-store employees' plates all the time.  Due to the ever increasing work load, staff members are leaving in groups.  The in-store management so what they can with what little resources they have.  Employees are burnt out and exhausted.  The remaining staff are mainly those who cannot leave due to finances.  This company is sure to fail if things do not change."
bad,"Great place if you need a minimum wage job, horrible place if you're attempting to get a decent paying job or move up the chain."
bad,Poor management... Only worried about covering thier own butt. Warehouse and the way the trucks are loaded is sorry at best. Some of the older dispatchers act like they are your boss... Union is worthless... No problem taking your dues though.... Looking for a constant headache.. You found the place.
bad,"Tough job, pay is ok. But you dont her treated like you are appreciated at all here. Schedules differ and everything is by seniority and not how well you do"
bad,I was harassed by the store managers and other employees to the point I had to quit. They don’t help people with disabilities such as mine and they never provide enough hours.
bad,Too much command and control from the top has emasculated the front line's ability to operate profitably. Burning through cash as well as talented and dedicated people.
bad,"Never seems to be much communication throughout the entire company. At the store level, there is never enough hours to give associates which means we are short staffed and cannot provide the customer service like before."
bad,"Collaboration is poor. People are surface in relationships. IT is good but leading edge thought is only applied when ""war for talent"" becomes an issue."
bad,Most supervisors are horrible except for 2 that are very good and keep the place running well on the receiving side I was on. Often mandated to work 1-3 hours after scheduled and to work your 6th day.
bad,incompetent management makes for a stressful environment. other than that pay is good if you work as it is incentive based. high turnover rate due to management's inability to take initiatives without playing to their favorite employees
bad,The manager has her favorite 5. Go against them and you will feel the pressure she is going to put on you. You are ok if you smoke. You can take as many smoke breaks as you like. Most smokers take at least 10. Just don't take too many bathroom breaks. The pay is awful. Not enough to get by with.
bad,Very little appreciation for the workers. being told your working overtime of 2 hours plus with an hour left in the day. Always told youre never doing enough. would never receive a thank if you went above and beyond your job title or specifications.
bad,"When I first started as Transportation Dispatcher I was told by management to trust no one. That was an understatement. Management was the worst with gossip and stirring the pot. H R was always telling you they are working on issues and do nothing. Ever. Very fast paced operation with favoritism abound. Very sad such a big operation and the troublemakers are rewarded while the honest associates are bullied and harassed! Always short handed as they do not schedule enough associates to cover volume!"
bad,"I did this job and the management was absolutely horrible, benefits were non-existent, and I always ended up doing more than my job constantly."
bad,"I worked at D&W 15 years (before it was bought by Spartan). I worked in several positions and frequently helped out in other stores. Getting raises or promotions were very hard to come by. I was passed over multiple times for promotions, but told by managers that I deserved to be promoted.  And the corporate employees are treated far better than any store employee. And the people working in the store serving the customers are what keeps the company in business! Definitely not anywhere that I would recommend for anyone to work,  unless you don't mind the horrible pay, lots of work, and zero appreciation."
bad,"Position was posted out of Michigan where head quarters and all support staff were located.  My position was stationed out of Edina, MN.   Very challenging to get proper support or training."
bad,Very Poor management. Not truthful. i will never recommend my pig to work for the company. I thing upper management is racist.
bad,You don’t get 10 hours of down time because they expect you to be back to run another load at exactly the 10 hour mark. They expect you to be on call even during your time off or reset. The pay and benefits are good .
bad,"The job is grueling, you won't even see benefits unless you pass your trial period, there is little room for improvement or promotion, and it is highly unlikely that you will be hired in full-time. Of the group of 50 or so people in my group, only 1 person got a full time job."
bad,"Slower paced, relaxed atmosphere. Flexible hours. Pay not very competitive with surrounding retailers. Distinct differences between Family Fare and D&W."
bad,"I’ve been with this company for 5 years now. Everything started alright by over the course of the past 3 years or so things have been declining drastically. While I enjoy the department that I work in and my fellow employees there I have little to no respect for the head store managers we currently have. They are inattentive, fail to communicate with their workers, and don’t resolve problems that occur. "
bad,"Imagine having yourself put into a oven for 30 minutes, and in that oven is not burning coils but instead the insensate bull honky you could possible hear or see at any workplace. Most of the staff should've been drug tested as all are most likely on something. Everyone there is wack. The toxic environment doesn't help as everyone who has a somewhat ""higher"" paying job thinks they are the boss of everyone else. Everyone there talks behind everyone else's backs. I don't know how I've stayed there longer than five months."
bad,"Prior to the merger with Spartan Foods, Nash Finch was a good place to work.  The Edina office was focused on improving culture and providing work-life balance.  Post-merger the focus shifted to siphoning jobs from Edina and moving to Grand Rapids, MI.  The company spoke a lot about culture, but the reality was there were two cultures, the Grand Rapids culture (positive) and the Edina culture (waiting for the ax to drop).  I do not recommend accepting employment with SpartanNash in Edina, MN as I don't believe it will be in your long-term best interests."
bad,"Typical day at Spartan Nash would be a 5 hour to 7 hour work day very slow and very dirty break rooms, nats flying around your food and around break room and bathrooms so dirty you would rather wait till you got home to use. 32 hours a week not enough to maintain a good life style"
bad,"The work was great.  I greatly enjoyed my job.  The pay and benefits were awesome.  Management is terrible.  One person says one thing, then someone else comes along ans says another."
bad,"Worked there for 5 years....made a whopping $.75 more than when I started. No benefits for part time. Very hard to advance unless you had an ""in"" with someone."
bad,"MDV, originally Military Distributors of Virginia, is the military commissary food distribution business that the former Nash Finch Company bought and grew. It hasn't changed much since SpartanNash was formed. Hallmarks of the warehouse operations are poor management, high employee turnover rate, negative employee morale, lack of advancement opportunities and a surreal sense of WTF in hiring decisions."
bad,"I worked at D&W for almost 5 years. I started at 7.25, and by the end of all those years, I was making 8.18. They do not give big enough raises, or show appreciation for how hard you work. Some of the people there are great, but don't expect to be treated like you're more than the work you do. If they had better benefits and a better pay raise system, it wouldn't be so bad"
bad,job was ok but supervisor had know clue what they was doing because had to lesson and follow the GM way. if they didn't they got demoted and/or fired.
bad,I have experienced a lot of racism at the store I am working at.
bad,Do not work here unless you really need a job. You never know what time you are going to get off. There is no time for your family. The physical demands of this job declares war on your body. The most enjoyable part of this job is finally going home.
bad,If you apply for this job ask yourself if you are willing to work 40+ hours a week and extra days out of nowhere. Pay is good if you can keep up a lot of heavy lifting. Fast pace environment with 2 20 minute breaks.
bad,I worked there for over a decade and though my immediate supervisor for pharmacy was amazing as was several other pharmacists I worked for the corporate doesn't even know you exist. No advancement opportunity low pay even when you have been there for years and are in a leadership position.
bad,"Open, run reports to pull old scripts not picked up, call on scripts that need to be picked up. Run new scripts that came in overnight/early morning. Answer phones, help customers, accept order and check each piece into inventory. Physically fill scripts. One pharmacist and if you were lucky two techs to handle five phones, two windows and a drive up while filling between 400-450 scripts per day. Learned to multitask, be patient, efficient and thorough. Was responsible for training many new techs, as I was one of the only certified techs."
bad,"If you have no wife no kids and your friends have no kids then this is the perfect place to work if you drive, and you're at the mercy of the worst routes possible if you're at the bottom of the seniority list."
bad,"Multitasking daily with overseeing the receiving department along with the inventory control functions and systems admin for the warehouse.  Hands on in both areas as I fill in for receiving clerks when vacations come around and serve as main contact for all inventory issue in the distribution center.  "
bad,"Supervised, worked right along side employees, Okay company to work for, no room for advancement"
bad,management was terrible the co workers were awesome!what i learned there was to never let your gard down the most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every week
bad,"- Top-down Management changes causing major transitions"
bad,"Bakery manager would come in 1 to 5 hours late, expect you to get her cought up. Then she would leave early. Store manager never did anything about it. It was a joke. I hear they have a really good manager now though."
bad,"At Spartan Nash, we take initiative and problem solve. I feel like it is becoming too focused on the numbers and having a body to fill a position instead of a quality employee and putting the customers first. They have some really really great employees and leaders but they are burnt out from lack of proper staffing and quality employees. They have the tools and capabilities and leaders to be REALLY great, but they have to get back to what makes them different. Our Family needs to be more than an idea or a brand. I'm excited to see what they will be doing there in the future."
bad,"I worked at a busy store, and the workers and customers were all SUPER friendly. I had 2 amazing managers, but the other like 4 were terrible. There was no communication. After working there for months, a manager insisted I be retrained because she thought it was my first day. Sometimes I'd be on the schedule, and the next day I wouldn't be on it anymore, as if they just erased my name. The communication overall is just really really bad. On my first day, I found out ten people had quit together, and now I know why."
bad,Way too many cliques. Expected to do work of 3 people but get 'coached' for any overtime. Too many Chiefs not enough Indians...conflicting management styles/directions. More stress than pay is worth.
bad,"I entered into contractual work with Nash Finch Company in 2002.  At the time the company was undergoing a change of leadership as well as a Securities & Exchange investigation of vendor practices.  Ron Marshall was CEO, the executor of company-wide initiatives. Employees had little to no interaction with the executive leadership, as is typical with corporations in America today, and when granted an opportunity, were given little material with which to build an intelligible conversation that held relevance to company projects. For the last 16 years I have spent the majority of my time in a small cubicle testing applications and providing routine minimalistic changes to applications as per leadership directive, with little or no interaction between myself and anyone outside the team in which I was assigned.  Unfortunately, I cannot say I was pleased with the conciseness of application architecture on the AS/400   Emerging technologies enabled some modernization of applications, however, the fundamental programming approach was all too often left to the intellectually cluttered devices of development staff in years past and standards of development were sketchy & sometimes even frowned upon by technical staff.  It was fortunate the programming languages were configured to allow application development within the construct of the language's architecture, as developers rarely took the time to simply tidy up the organizational placement of new logic in the applications and merge it with existent language stricture to visual benefit.  During my tenure with the company, I was granted"
bad,could be called at anytime and if not answered within ten minutes no matter what then you were wrote up.
bad,They do not care about you and treat you like a slave. They are opposite of what they portray themselves in the community. It is very sad. Some people have been here 30+ years and get let go out of nowhere. Due to our jobs being shipped to another state.
bad,"Managemen at Spartannash do not care about workers. Workers there work 8 to 10 hours with atleast 5 or 6 hours of mandated overtime. Workers there barley get any sleep, breaks on the job, time with family after 7 madated overtime so frequently to the point where it is out of control"
bad,I been there a year now I have no complaints at this time other than that I need more money for what I do for them and that I could have a better schedule with more communication
bad,"Based out of Michigan, Minnesota & Wisconsin didn't seem to be priority locations. Cap on salaries caused many to move on for growth, financially . Benefit package was good"
bad,"Fellow employees are like family, but corporate doesn't care about there dedicated employees, they just care about the bottom line and spend there money stupidly."
good,"SpartanNash only cares about making money. They do not care about their employees. They don't give you the recognition you deserve. I've been with the company for almost 3 years and do 5 different jobs all together (cashier, customer service, cash office, scanning and I'm trained in the deli) and they use in me all of those areas without upgrading my pay. I'm a part time associate but they give me 40+ hours a week but won't give me any of the benefits."
good,Great place to work but is not for the people. Great pay but benefits can better. Management can do a better job for the people. Job training can be better for the workers
good,The first year in the work place is the most difficult. They go by seniority numbers which means you basically don't have a chance to move up in the company unless someone else has either left the company and retired or someone has quit. starting off you get the hardest job and very little sick time which makes it hard to work there because they will force you overtime all week on a time schedule with expectations very high for a job that doesn't pay as much as they should for their expectations the work was vary demanding.
good,"Your pay is based on how fast you can pick. So between the physical labor, temperature extremes, as in work in 90+ degrees to working in the freezer and management has kinda tanked."
good,"The number of hours you work is determined by how many people show for work and how many cases there are."
good,"I worked early in the morning until we were done unloading & putting product away. Sometimes I worked 5 hours a day, other times I would work 10-13 hours."
good,I liked working at Spartan Nash because of the customers but i just had a problem with the management and some co workers. There was a lot of favoritism.The managers gossip a lot and kept conflict between the employees then there was no communication. The job i applied for was not what i was working...so my work experience was unpleasant and difficult at times due to me having health issues. The pay you get is not acceptable for the duties you do. And the turn around was terrible. There could be a lit of changes done to satisfy your employees.
good,Hot long hot long hot long tiring tiring. Old equipment. Dirty. Mgmt poor. I learned why they are always hiring. Coworkers always gone.
good,No job security and poor management. Working long hours never knowing what time you are getting off.
good,Everyday you go in you never know what time you're going to be able to leave. You're locked behind a gated fence away from your car and cannot by any means go out to your car. If you want hours they have all of them.
good,Pay attention to loads you deliver make sure your getting paid correctly. Loads change constantly if your not on assigned route. Problem with getting paid on loads delivered if you don't catch mistakes when they happen or before turning paperwork in at end of day
good,"What can I say, overall the company has amazing potential, the mission and design are amazing at the top.  However finding that effect trickle down to the bottom is challenging.  The daily management team tried however there seems to not be the support needed to ensure a good work to life balance that is needed to keep happy employees, the whole point of working is to enjoy life, not for work to become your life."
good,the management needs a serious makeover.. It would be a good place to work if the didn't allow so many non experience people to have a lot of say  bout thing they know nothing about
good,Did not give required raise after first 3 months. Co workers would constantly make you do their work. Very cut throat environment. The manager would complain but never get off her butt
good,"I was told in the beginning that there would be some overtime, but what I did not expect was working 10+ hours each day. It's really hard to have a life outside of work with the amount of overtime. The job overall isn't hard just becomes tiring after working so much overtime."
good,"Hate the management. Work long hours. Really don't have time to be with family and friends on holidays,work on Sundays. Very dangerous place to work.place really needs updating."
good,"Company was bought out."
good,"When I began working at this company, it was owned by a local family. The culture was one of a family. The chain went through several corporate owners. The culture shifted to one of employees being numbers rather than people."
good,You have no life outside of work! If you do get a day off 9×out of 10 they will force you to work! And if you want the day off you have to use a personal day! I once went 36days in a row with out a day off!! You can count on working 7 days a week and all holidays when things are busy! And don't think about getting vacation at a good time because you won't be able to unless you have been working there for 25yrs !The only good thing about this is you can make lots of money.
good,"Typical retail job. The management definitely could have been better, communication was constantly lacking between the managers as well as the supervisors."
good,I would rather not enter in a summary about this job at this time. I would rather keep it personal and professional. I would not work at this place again I can say that!
good,"Its not a terrible company to work for , for the most part just definitely dont pay their employees the way they should nor give the hours it takes to do the job the way they want it done."
good,"Long hours, no feed back from management, pretty much on your own. Incentive system only benefited certain employees. constant shift changes, worked 7 different shift start times in 13 years at this location. The only thing enjoyable about this job was when we punched out for the day"
good,The environment has become much more relaxed since I first started two years ago. Everyone is fine to work with. The managers are pretty nice. I would recommend working there if you can get hired in.
good,"unfair work environment, management does not acknowledge good work in their employees or employee needs. They are really good with customer service and making sure customers are happy."
good,"On a typical day, merchandise stores, check sales, return calls to stores and resolve personnel issues. organize and execute catering info for the week, double check all labor cost and staffing. I have learned all phases of an operational deli, and grocery operation."
good,"communication needs allot of improvement, benefits were great, hours were great"
good,"Good place to learn every aspect of a warehouse and it's functions; excellent place to become an expert forklift driver due to having to maneuver in such cramped areas. Due to poor management job security did not exist. Poor employee utilization resulted in infinite mandatory overtime, taking you away from your family every day."
good,"A culture of mediocrity pervades with many people now retiring from jobs supporting way outdated proprietary IT platforms. Many changes are needed to give the company some semblance of being ""modern""."
good,You never know what time you’re getting off ..No set schedule besides you have to come to work when they tell you..Long days.Management never hires the right people to help the job be more proficient. It’s people who have experience in doing the job that can help make the job easier but they won’t hire them. If you trying to make money and willing to work a lot of days and hours this is for yo
good,"Its an ok job. Friendly people, not the best pay though. They don't give you breaks. Scheduling is ok when you're fully staffed, if not you have to work a lot of over time which sucks, especially if you have kids"
good,"The work place was ok and not a bad place to work at the pay was good but the pace and how the management and breaks was just not it. Short breaks, high risks of incidents happening!"
good,"Work fast, stay focus, stay safe , listen carfully. Stay moving, and u will make performance . Also if u are coming out of school this is perfect for u."
good,It was okay. I felt like they was playing with my money. I would love to work their again just wish I got paid more than 9.00 because I’m trying to do things with my life and 9.00 you can’t.
good,"If you want a job that doesn't require any sort of schooling and decent pay, this is your place.  It was very hard to see that they actually appreciate what you do for the company other than saying it.  Even with the employee discount it didn't feel like you got anything other than paid for the hard work you did.  The production rate is constantly getting increasingly difficult and therefore your quality of work is what you have to sacrifice.  Limited training makes the turnover rate for new hires through the roof.  Overall decent pay if you come in as full time, but high expectations from management."
good,"It was a good place to work. It was a long time ago. I was able to work on some special assignments there. I worked with a great group there, that is rare."
good,Worked well with my schedule when I had young children in school to work around. I learned a lot and was able to use this time as a career builder moving forward.
good,"The manager was really good at telling us what the rules were, but she had absolutely no backbone for enforcing those rules.  For instance she would call a staff meeting, and tell us that we are not allowed to be on our cell phones while we are on the clock.  When the meeting was over, people would go back out on the floor and be on their cell phones at the register while assisting customers.  And she did nothing about it."
good,Good place to work if you want to lose weight. Basically the faster you move and get your assignments done the more you got paid. work hours were basically you clock in at 7;30 and get off when the work is done.
good,"Spartan is a solid place to work, like every job it has its pros and cons. Pros include flexible hours and decent benefits. Cons: Stores tend to be short staffed."
good,"We constantly work , we get breaks every two hours. It’s easy work honestly , the hardest part about the job is maintaining you’re percentage but as long as you push yourself you can do it."
good,"No training, compensation is not good for the work you do, great co workers, work hard for the company but you're not rewarded well, medical benefits are horrible, a lot of out of pocket expenses. short staffed, overworked, and underpaid"
good,"It's difficult to balance work and home life when the company is so short on help. Expecting to have a day off without getting phone calls is difficult."
good,"future with became uncertain when the announcement of merger."
good,"Frequently changing protocol, recent merge of 2 grocery companies, unclear what the new, combined company will be."
good,You never get off at the same time. Have worked 20 hour days and expected to be back in 4 hours. Management does not hold people accountable for anything. People go over the attendance policy and nothing happens. not good for a production job. The pay although is great for the area.
good,Working with fellow associates is always a good day. However if you have a real problem with a manager and go to your store director they won't do anything about it. Even H.R. won't do anything about bad managers. They had a sexist manager working in their gas stations for years and did nothing about it.
good,"good company to work for but work ethics, management, and communication in work place is lacking.."
good,"I enjoyed working there until I found out exactly how the company was.  I can't speak on every Nash Finch in the country, but for the one where I worked was terrible with their management."
good,The people I worked with in the distribution center were great. The issue was with the corporate culture - which has had some major changes since I left.
good,great job security overall they are alright. i liked what i did being in the cash office. it was always something new with the cash handling and banking aspect of the finances and sales side of the company
good,Management is friendly. The hardest issue is some bad apples for staff. They can ruin your day with the attitudes. Some of feel there on top of the world because of there seniority number. They don't treat new union guys the same. They act like there stupid or dont know what there doing because they dont. Instead of jumping in to help them most higher guys will just laugh on. Pay could be better for supervisors.  Its pretty low for amount of work and stress they put on you
good,"Long hours, 8 am to 6 pm.  You work until all the orders have been filled.  Some days we got off at our regular time, other days we had to stay until 10 finishing orders.  Most of the people were nice, though there's a few people there who have no plans for the future/retirement and can be really mouthy.  I felt bad for those guys because they're going to work until they die."
good,Managers are allowed to treat employees poorly and are disrespectful towards them. Discipline actions are not followed through with either. Would be a great place to work if managers were replaced with respectful qualified people.
good,"As a Grocery Selector, you drive around a pallet jack through the warehouse, receiving and fulfilling orders of grocery product. Each order could be conceptualized as a list warehouse coordinates which represent different products locations. These coordinates are delivered to you through a headset which tells you where the the next product is. You drive your pallet jack to these coordinates and fill your pallet with the products. After an order is complete, you rap the pallet and deliver it to the cargo bay, where it is loaded onto trucks, and then delivered to various grocery stores. "
good,"I did enjoy working through, everybody welcomed me on, and the managers were okay to me, it was also nice to work with my big brother, it was a good job for that moment"
good,The staff within at the store level are what makes this company a good place to work. But the Managment at the Cororate Office makes it difficult to make a living. Constantly cutting hours and un-willing to give a proper wage increase to those that recieve specialized training. Often one has to work two different deartments just to make hours for the week. This is what the Corporate Office sets unfortunately and this is what leads to issues in multiple deparments but the staff does their best to make it work with the support of other departments.
good,Day begins at 8 A.M. and is done when there are no more orders to fill. Most days are 10 hours but it would not be unusual to stay until 9 or 10 P.M. Work is incentive driven which added a fun self competitive element.
good,"I have worked at D&W breton village for about 3 months, and I have to say, I know why they are always short on staff. This place is defiantly a high school job. The management treats you as if you are a child. They didn't take my unexpected change in availability seriously for weeks. I was given a verbal ""talking-to"" for absences, and threatened to be released. I only called in if I was ill, or in the hospital due to asthma problems and sciatica (caused from standing for 8 hours with no mat under my feet). I was forced to come into work with the stomach flu. Plus they pay minimum wage and expect us to smile and do virtually all the manual labor (and deal with customers). McDonald's employees get paid more.I just feel that if they wanted better customers service and a more successful business all-around, they would pay their more valuable asset a little bit more."
good,This is a well managed operation and a good place to work. The organization services the Military bases as well as location overseas. They also do a lot of work for our veterans that return home as well as active duty members. Overall organization is upbeat and positive.
good,Nash has recently merged with Spartan Foods so as the title says there are quite a bit of unknowns as to the direction of the company.
good,My day typically includes unloading trucks and checking in pallets. Most rewarding is  the trust management has in getting tasks  done. I oversee the paperwork on all receiving for the produce department.
good,There was not much appreciation for associates. The advancement opportunity is good but promises are not always kept and pay is not always fair for the work put in.
good,I didn't like the atmosphere that I worked in.  Management was dysfunctional and the warehouse always leaked. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. Stay away.
good,"The corporate side of Spartan took over my previous employer and once that happened the job climate declined. The jobs I was doing as an employee were good, hard working jobs and my co-workers were all good people. The suoervisors did what they could to keep up employee morale but once the corportate side took over all eployees felt cuts in their respective departments."
good,"The job was fast paced,very stressful, you must meet quota, equipment sometimes didn’t work, very hot inside the building, short breaks, long hours, decent pay."
good,I learned a lot working here but at the same time I felt like I was back in high school. majority of the time we were not allow to talk to each other especially those in other departments
good,Average place to work.  Management encourages feedback but rarely follows through. Associates are nice but know that the office cannot sustain itself.
good,"Really easy job for someone but the pay is not that good at all. You can make money there BUT that is not until the union hires you in, until then you get a $1 pay raise after one year and that's it. You wait on the union which could be 2 years or longer!!"
good,My dad and brothers worked there so when it came time to work i knew where I would find a job. Co-workers are cool and it was good money at the time. I give this place a B-
good,After arriving in the shop I would find out how heavy the production schedule was and whether everyone was going to show up for work that day.  I learned to make the best of every situation and to get as many of my associates on board for the completion of the days production.  The most difficult part of the job was to deal with negative attitudes but the most enjoyable aspect was turning bad attitudes around.
good,A job where you are constantly working against the clock. the incentives provide you with extra motivation to complete your work in a timely manner. Accuracy is important.
good,"Somewhat stressful environment given the lack of growth in military sales.  Frequently receive ""bad news"" about the military division, although the company as a whole is strong."
good,"fast paced environment with good management staff, physical and worked in all types of atmospheres/temps, focused on speed and accuracy and above all safety"
good,No room for growth and less encouragement to grow.Low energy work environment and low  morals. benefits was not that great and no opportunity for advancement
good,Good atmosphere and great people but very physical and fast pace and have to make rate .benifits are great work os hard and will work you forty plus hours a week
good,"Overall decent place to work at, the team was great and the people that i I worked with were great associates and the team were always willing to help you out."
good,"a typical day at work. Didn't learn much; however, there was no chance of advancement and no raises as much as expected rather told.  Management was very unfair and thoughtless. They only cared about themselves not staff as a whole. The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with coworkers and the company picnics"
good,"A lot of favoritism in the management positions. worked the almost 15 years and got screwed over time and time again on my promotions, even though i was well qualified. they seam to pick we they like over who was qualified.i really miss alot of the employees i worked with because we were like family and would have done anything for anyone."
good,it doesn't matter how many years you have with the company if you have the day off you are getting forced in no matter what. the company cant keep employees.
good,"I liked working for this company. My only complaint would be that they didn't give you the computer clearance needed to do your job properly. People were nice, and management was fair."
good,"I liked Spartan Nash, but I feel the location I was employed wasn't very well  organized. I enjoyed the work, but the inconsistency is what really made me resign."
good,"It went well until corporate changed, and so the entire store changed, but it is still a well put together store, but the need to keep up with the tightly dated products like the dairy department because I once found a cart load of stuff that is was expired and I was only a part time worker"
good,They are decent to work for some of the management should not be management they only care for them selves and are rude to employees but overall it's a great place.
good,Always check forklifts learned order all management were some what fair co-workers were hard workers no hard part no enjoyable part always on time
good,Everyone worked as a team.  Easy to advance to higher positions. Management was on your side when u needed them. An enjoyable place to work with excellent benefits.
good,"Efficiently assembled pallets using a pallet jack, utilized computer for order selection, Met and exceeded daily production goals"
good,"Nash Finch merged with Spartan Foods to create the newly formed SpartanNash in 2013.  The culture of both companies appear to very closely matched, making the transition with most employees very smooth.  I have worked in many areas of the company and would say compensation is average or slightly better than average for all of the positions I am familiar with.  As the business continues to evolve, it appears adavancement opportunities are slowly diminishing. My co-workers have always been excellent, which says a lot about the culture, and many have stayed loyal for 20, 30, or 40+ years."
good,I have learned a lot there and I will apply my new skills In everything that I do from this day foreward.  There was always a new adventure each week.  You never knew what the day would hold for you.  It was all exciting to be able to talk to people from across the country was great.
good,Very busy place.  Hardest part was not being able to be social.  The grocery business is always changing and is very competitive.
good,"Check tractor and route sheet, make route plan then do route. Learned that everyday is difference. They work just as hard as I do. Getting usual to the difference times to start your day. Been able to be home every night."
good,If you like retail this is the company for you. Not all Family Fares are created equal the on that I worked for was customer service ordinate and I love the people that I worked with it was like family.
good,"A typical day consist of creating ad for a grocery store to use."
good,"At Nash Finch, I routed trucks and dispatched the routes to drivers on a daily basis.  I learned how to route trucks within the state of Michigan, and different use of computer systems."
good,"I have been trained in many different areas along the front end ie: cashier, manager, customer service desk, and bookkeeper. This was a fast paced environment and I believe that I have thrived very well."
good,"With the small IT shop in Minneapolis, there is never a shortage of project work or tasks.  But with the minimal IT budget and less than realistic planning on the part of management, completion of these tasks is more date driven than true, successful accomplishments.  Too bad, as the folks here do, generally, work well together."
good,I am currently the manager of a West Michigan Family Fare Store and have a new crew and am actively training them as technicians. I work with the public daily and help them with their doctor and insurance problems. I think that is my favorite part of the job.  Over the years I have learned the Retail Pharmacist job very well and have learned how to manage one or more stores.
good,Being an Advertising Designer was a very enjoyable position. I loved exploring my creative side by designing ads and coming up with catchy slogans. My job consisted of working one on one with buyers each week and ensuring every circular that went out was exactly what each client wanted. I worked with great people and always felt I was being challenged in a positive way.
good,"Enjoyed 33 years of sevice there. As the last few years unfolded and the company began to shrink in Cedar Rapids, it became a lot less fulfilling to work there."
good,Ended up being short term assignment as a contractor.  Work was lower level.
good,"Typical day at work is starting your morning at 5:30 AM to 4 PM. In which we would receive orders from various commissaries in the area and wave (enter orders into the computer) their orders into the system which our order selectors will pick the product and cases that the commissary has ordered through their vocollect talkman system. I also management the inventory in the system for any product that the system thinks we have in stock or currently out of stock. The most enjoyable part about the job is the people, we work odd hours and ten hour days but we all try to keep each other entertained by laughing, joking and through various activities throughout the company but maintaining a very healthy, safe and professional environment."
good,I was only a temp and working there was okay; the work was repetitious and unchallenging. Jobs there lack variety. The office environment was good; coworkers were cliquish.
good,good job while attending local college. flexible schedule. good atmosphere. easy people to work with. friendly client base with many regular shoppers.
good,I was told trust nobody by supervisors keep your mouth shut & do your job‼️ I loved my job too many back stabbing associate to deal with‼️ Good pay & benefits too many Chiefs not enough Indians‼️
good,"Check and Answers emails "
good,I was pressured wayyyy too much to work multiple days when my schedule didnt work around it. I worked in the deli alone at night and was asked to do many things in an allotted time period by myself. annoying.
good,"trying to see how fast we can pick a order ticket,beacuse if you finished a ticket before the allotted time that would be called an incentive which meant extra money on your pay check."
good,"Tend to customers needs, keep store fresh, clean, and appealing.  Worked in varoius areas as needed for the daily operations of a retail store. Location that I worked at most full-time associates had been there an extended period of time.  We were like family."
good,"Basically this job will get you on your feet financially, but long term you wear your body down. Your going to lose sleep a lot, probably develop an addiction to caffeine or some kind of stimulant, miss out on things in your personal life due to long hours and poor scheduling. I could name a long list of cons but if you've worked in warehousing before you probably get the idea. Like I said though you can pay your bills here, they pay weekly and you almost always get overtime. Do it if you need to but proceed with caution.."
good,"Workers were always busy either busy helping keep the store in top shape or were always helping customers whether it was taking groceries to cars, finding specific items, and etc. Hardest part of the job is the lack of workers, every time the place would hire a person they would quit before they would even train. The customers were the best part of the job, having a friendly face to talk to everyday felt pretty nice and those type of customer and employee connection makes the work place more enjoyable."
good,"While working there you'll notice that it's great at first, but they'll call you in frequently. You'll need to have a flexible schedule recommend you don't play sports while working here as they will be very unhappy if you call off for a big meet you have."
good,This company needed a change and the last CEO they hired drove this company into the dirt. There were several really good up executive branch officials but some bad ones too. I really wished they would of talked to us store managers on what could be improved. Never the less this company got bought out.
good,Job was a steady income but with little upside.but did have good benefits.vactions ect.
good,"Just need the opportunity to make more money. We deliver groceries to local grocery stores, sometimes by hand. Good benefits, home daily, good boss."
good,We had a great assortment of co-workers that did there well.It was a great place to work
good,Good company to work for.
good,"Depending on what your position is, you generally have a good time. Management is okay, as were other coworkers. Customers can be daunting, but if you do what's asked, it's okay."
good,"But if you don't network, they don't care about you. There is a lot of favoritism. The hardest part of the job is the customers. The best part of the job is working with people you like."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Physically demanding. Hard working people, unstable hours, forced overtime and compulsed overtime on days off. Ability to work holidays. Ability to gain seniority and move up."
good,little support from coworkers. Honestly it was fun working there in the beginning but after a while it got bad to the point where I didn't want tot work there again
good,"This job was busy phone work and customer service.  Taking and placing customer orders. There were four of us in the office and we had a great time working together, we all worked together as a team and it was very enjoyable."
good,This location has benefits that are ok but cost a lot. The management at the time I worked there was ok and willing to try to work with the associates.
good,"Is a very good job to be at and the people are incredible. I thank them for giving me the opportunity to be multi-task and the job is not limited to one person. If you are willing to learn, they were willing to teach."
good,This is an up and coming company going through many changes.  I enjoyed my co-workers and learned many things.  I do believe that they will continue to grow.
good,Fast pace place to work. It’s more important to work at a face pace then skills. Smile and help costumers even if they’re annoying. Quality is a big part of Family Fare
good,Productive and fast paced. I enjoyed the people who worked there. I did not enjoy the long hours very much. I have children sne the work - to - home ratio wasnt pleasant.
good,I new what was my job and how to carry it out.  There was a lot of  stress when it came to audits but I always did well.  There was really no benefit or reward to doing well.
good,"All in all it is a great company as far as pay and insurance are concerned. It will provide money to pay for the bills."
good,"My review for this job that's okay, the hours are long and you never know when you're going to get off. The pay is decent. All day you ride around and take orders for customers."
good,This company is great to work for but unfortunately is closing its doors. I would stay employed there if it were possible.
good,"Working for MDV Spartannash was enjoyable. I was constantly learning new duties. My management team worked very well with the employees and our coworkers. we worked very well together as a team. I think the hardest thing about my job was making sure the vendors, the drivers and the buyers keep a good repore .I think the most enjoyable part of my job was working together as a team."
good,Nash Finch Company and Spartan Stores merged in 2013 and has been going through the merging of two very large companies which is a long and difficult process. I'm sure SpartanNash will be an okay place to work after the merger is complete but it has been tough on many people to go through the merger.
good,Good pay and benefits.have to work in extreme temperatures.Pretty good management team
good,"friendly environment with more than average positive people."
good,"Working for the SPCA"
good,"I had a fun time there, my crew was pretty personal and friendly, they helped me out when I needed it, and then I was able to work on my own. I didn't have too many screw-ups, but I did get pretty strained once the hours piled on. I do not recommend this job for people who have injuries or are overweight, physically unfit. It is a social job, so you have to be loud and heard to get customers in your lane, don't be shy! But this builds up charisma and social interaction more."
good,Mostly family oriented but they don't provide many hours. The pay is competitive with other store and retailers in the area. The Store Director is a very nice person to work for
good,Working at Nash Finch requires great attention to detail to make sure an order is on correct and on time. This job is very physical and is demanding on your legs and back. The shifts are long and require working awkward hours during the week and weekend. The hardest part of the job is to be efficient doing your job while not getting hurt.
good,"Again I liked this job for the most part. I like how they gave me an opportunity to work for them, but they can seem dysfunctional at times, or un-organized. I was a custodian for them for the most part, but someone kept trying to argue with me and they'd have me work with him every other day so I got tired of that part pretty quickly. Whenever I didn't have to work with him I enjoyed it though,"
good,I really enjoyed my time there. I had the opportunity to meet many people and I really liked the working environment I was in.
good,Long hours but good pay. Most days are at least 12 hours with two breaks and a 30 minute lunch most days I went in at 2 got off around 5/6. After training I had more than 10 hours a day
good,Terrifici learning experience fresh out of college. Entry level management position was great to get my feed wet in a million dollar retail establishment.
good,"Worked for NF/ econofoods for nearly 28 years and in many different retail stores. My duties included: Assistant Store Manager, Store Manager, Bakery Manager, Produce Assistant Manager. "
good,"SpartanNash is one of the biggest food distributors in the work. Logistics is fast-paced. Finding transportation needs on short notice can be stressful, but rewarding. My customer is our procurement dept. Getting product when and where they need it."
good,"Overall SN offers job security and flexibility in work life balance. They are not passionate in ensuring talent has growth opportunities. They do not compensate based on performance. "
good,"Day to Day task are extreme, I learned to use an inventory database,"
good,"The company provided stable work hours. And amazing customers that were dedicated to the store and fond of its location. It was a great experience to work with other employees there, due to their excitement and happiness the environment provided."
good,Very unorganized you can work for years before getting higher in completely to get raises and benifits but you start working more hours then the full time until your full time I was there over a year and never got full time bc you have to take bids and move jobs and hours that are hard to have kids and work or any life and work there if you can't work 12 to 16 hour days and find out last second you'll be working over this isn't the job for you it is a union job so it makes it very hard on new people to start the people who have been there for 5 years plus treat the new people horrible and most don't work and don't get into trouble for it bc there jobs are covered by the union if the company tries to fire them most workers who have been there less then 5 years are amazing people and helpful they do not train you on any job you are asked to do there training is having someone who just stared the day before you to walk behind you and tell you what to do if you need help the manegment won't help bc they art allowed to there is a lot of bad and good at this place but over a year and there was more bad with no benifits to even stay sad bc it could be the best job ever if they just worked on some things
good,It was nice to work there while in highschool. It was a great learning experience. Tasks never felt too tough. It was fast-paced and busy. It was a lotnof responsibilities and not enough pay.
good,Going full time is a stressful situatiin where you can still get called in on your days off and pointed if you are unable to do so. Raises are only once per year as well.
good,Family fare is a nice store with a good work culture. Managment is willing to work with their associates and provide understanding when it comes to personal issues.
good,"They do all standard food warehouse jobs. Day shift includes order slectors, forklift drivers, loaders, Inventory control clerks, shipping clerks, maintenance, and transportation dispatchers. Night shift includes Lumpers, Receivers, Forklift, Inventory control clerks, Receiving clerks, Maintenance, and Transportation dispatchers."
good,"this comany struggles with an identity crisis between ""are we a wholesaler or a retailer?"". clearly a wholesaler. the retail management has enormous turnover resulting in no focused direction that is sustainable. I was always in a state of job insecurity"
good,It was a great company I work for good benefits I love the hours I liked my coworkers and environment I was comfortable it was a great learning experienceIt could be a great career move for anybody very very good hours pay rate and overall a good company
good,"It was a great place to work. The company has change a lot over the last 5 years. It's not fun anymore. And work needs to fun too. "
good,"It was a pleasant place to work. The leadership was good and very kind. I wish I had been given more hours to work, but while I was there it was good."
good,"Management was tough but fair. Working here consist of 8 to12 hours of work(loading/Unloading Product) with a fair amount of breaks. most enjoyable part of the day is going home. Home work Balance is crazy as management never tells you wether your looking at a 12 plus hour day or longer prior to the day starting, causing and unrealistic home work culture."
good,"SpartanNash is an extremely quick paced job. You expend a lot of energy and you WILL sweat. If you aren't ready to do some serious labor then don't think about it. I worked there for 2 years and I will tell you that you won't have much time for anything else. The Pay is great and the potential to move up is too. Management kindve sucks, but you can work around it by doing your own thing and just getting your work done."
good,Ever had a job where some management could be better educated? Is an example of a boss coming to the staff for answers I assumed they should know. Mostly a friendly environment.
good,Spartan Nash is a great Job for those who has the physicality to maintain the pace and time requirement long term to fulfill daily duties. the Job has plenty of overtime and great paid benefits.
good,It was a good temporary job but there were no benefits or any other improvements in the work field. The duties of this job were very simple and not what i was looking for.
good,Almost every store I worked at for this company has been a great time. They choose their employees wisely because it feels like one big family. Everybody helps each other out
good,"Typical night stocking shelves starts at 11pm and goes till about 7 or 8 in the morning. The culture is fine but you don't necessarily interact with co-workers on a steady basis. It's more of stocking your own shelves and making sure the shelves are all ""faced"" at the end of the shift."
good,Spartannash as you know it now is a very large supplier to grocery stores and military commissaries.  The Statesboro location was a very small group of employees which allowed the crew to become very familiar with each other even management.  The only hard part was the actual labor involved in order fulfillment.
good,"SpartanNash is a good place to work. The atmosphere is generally relaxed. I have had some really good associates to work with during my time here. If you have a good, honest work ethic you will be treated fairly and with respect."
good,I learned a lot working at SpartanNash.  I take everything that I have learned and apply it to my next place of employment.
good,A productive and efficient work team support the demands of this Fortune 500 company.  A big influence within the community
good,Kmart used to be a nice store.  They performed some layoffs and I was one of them.  This was so long ago that it is really hard to right a review about this.
good,"Looking to relocate back to Texas. Manage 7 maintenance associates in a 500,000 square foot building. Maintenance takes care of all equipment and the building within our scope of work."
good,"The people in I.T. I worked with on project or issues. Typical day, checking on open issues in my department, that they are getting handles and answering questions from my staff. The enjoyable, learning new things, network, hardware."
good,"I no longer work here but a typical day here would be working in a produce department, meat depart and grocery department.  I have learned so much from this company its where I had my first job when I was 16 over the years I worked in book keeping, grocery department, meat, dairy and produce department.  I started off as a baggier then went to cashier and moved myself up over the years."
good,"Getting hours is pretty difficult for me sometimes, but I have to admit my availability isn't the best, either. I've had other coworkers agree that managers do not treat workers fairly."
good,"i was working night shift, right there is the hardest part of the job for me."
good,I've found with this or any job there are going to be ups and downs. But for the most part it's a great place to work. Your treated fairly and given opportunities to advance in the company if your willing to put in the work. They treat everyone equally no matter what your personal style. It's the only place I've ever worked that didn't have a problem with visible tattoos or piercings. And doesn't mind your hair being colored outside of the natural hair colors.
good,Work with a good group of very underpaid guys.  I think the company takes advantage of the rural area we live in and we are severely underpaid compared to other warehouses. Management is good.  I enjoy the work. But nowhere  for advancement .  And the pay just is ok for the area.  But we do a different type of job then most industries here.  It’s really physical and takes a lot  for someone to make it .
good,Good benefits and pay. Great days off with seniority. The worst thing about the job was never knowing what time you were going to clock out. Some of the managers did not deserve their positions due to bad decision making.. My co-workers were good people and I miss them.
good,Overall great company that recently merged with Spartan Stores.
good,"Great Company to work for over all. 4 days a week 10 hours day. 2 personal days and two week paid vacation and health benefits Sundays through friday. But, The Columbus, Ga location needs improvement, Very Inexperienced Managers, long hours , poor training, and very High turn over rate."
good,The company pays above average and has good benefits. The management shows too much favoritism. There isn't much home time. Stops are continually being added to my runs.
good,The most enjoyable part of working here is the people. Every one is helpful and available to answer questions or assist when needed.  The only negative was the compensation that was lower than the average.
good,The company is so different now so it would not be fair to rate this job. I am sure that many parts of the operation have change dramatically in the past 15 years.
good,"I highly recommended this job for people with a high powered work ethic. Rewards for going above and beyond are evident, and all the staff are very helpful."
good,The days were short for me as i only worked 4 hour shifts but there was always something and the costumers were always in need of your help with something
good,"The people that work here all great people to work with. I really enjoyed my time with the costumers as well as my co-workers. I learned a lot about the grocery business working here, and to be honest I was kind of sad that I left after a while of not being there."
good,MDV is a fast pace environment with amazing management but grueling hours. Hours began @ 9am and sometimes wouldn't end until midnight maybe 1am. They do however offer competitive pay
good,"Worked at this company for 22 years, it was sold 2 times, once Nash Finch took over there was a downward decline and the job started to not be enjoyable. Nash Finch didn't understand the customer base and eventually the closed the division due to lack of sales."
good,I love interacting with people and helping them problem solve. I also enjoy helping folks find the right product and saving them money in the process.
good,"work life balance"
good,"A typical day would consist of customer service; filling new/ refill medications, calling insurance companies for clarification of benefits and contacting medical staff for authorization of medication refills. I learned about different uses for many medications. My co-worker were a delight to work with. I enjoyed sharing in their life experiences. The hardest part of the job was having a line of customers waiting as the telephone rang continuously. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and getting to know the customers."
good,"I grew from an every day employee to become a department manager with an excellent company. I learned how to manage people, situations and overall needs of a company. I grew as a person and employee."
good,Room for growth with this company if this was the type of career you really wanted.
good,"25% Customer Service/Training"
good,productive and a fun place to work when it was in licoln ne. The management was not as good in lincon.I work with some of the best co-workers I have ever work with in the end was driving to Omaha was the hardest part of the job.
good,During my years working for Nash I learned a great deal managing other employees in the data entry and computer room envirorment.
good,"When work orders would come in through the head sets, we as order selectors would have the tasks of filling those orders by a certain time by stacking those items with assistance of palette jacks. These palettes would then be wrapped and stacked to be sent and placed on the waiting truck to be sent to its waiting retailing grocery outlet. We also picked and selected Amazon orders for Amazon customers."
good,In my time of being here it was a great company to work for. I would recommend this job to anyone who would like to work in retail. I will say it's a great experience.
good,"Working at MDV Nash/Finch was a fast pacing job, we worked on percentage. Mostly everything I did with the company, I learned in the Navy. I met some great people."
good,"fill orders for our customers and insure accuracy along with speed, provided with the proper clothing to withstand the subzero temperatures while working in the freezer"
good,MDV is and was a pretty good area to work at. The truck drivers were very helpful and good to get along with. I didn't have a permanent supervisor that would stay at the warehouse long enough to get along with.
good,"It was a great company to work for.  The employees enjoyed volunteering for all the different charities. During the holidays the company would provide meals, cookouts, and other fun activities that were well attended my the employees. "
good,"On a typical day, I'm cleaning, bagging and carrying out groceries, working in the bottle room, or helping out generally around the store. Some managers and/or people in charge are not the best fit for the job, but overall a good place to build experience."
good,"It's not a bad place to work. My managers are respectful, responsible and understand that we also have lives outside of the job."
good,You start your morning at 1am. Once you clock in you have certain amount of time to suit up. Certain time to inspect forklift and once you log in you are timed on every pallet you put away. You are giving block time for breaks and lunches. If you not doing your job or slow they will come and find you. It's called an incentive program.
good,Everyday is fast past from start to finish order selectors and lift drivers all are on percentage . I've learn that a company must have a strong culture to be successful meaning supervisors and associates must respect each other communicate and work together. My hardest time every day was start of shift for loading . But the people made I worked with made it easy to return to work every day.
good,Great people there but isn't open at all and the pay is on the low end for the West Michigan area. On the bright side most of the people there are old so advancement should be easy.
good,"I enjoyed my time here for the most part. Our store is a small community store and I liked that environment. Most of the employees of this store have been here for years; however, there was quite a turnover with cashiers."
good,work hard and very long hours you have a chance to grow with the company
good,decent pay with a guaranteed 40 hour work week.  Good people to work with and the work is pretty laid back.  not a very physically demanding job but yet many challenges.
good,"Great company great management - team environment and documentation is lacking.  Co workers are very cooperative - We were all the hats from design, programming, quality assurance and technical documentation."
good,"Enjoyed the fast pace working environment. Worked in warehouse environment, liked the hands on, physical work. Operating machinery and forklifts on a regular basis."
good,It is an organization that believes in customer service and doing things well!! They take customer satisfaction to a whole new level and do what they can to make sure things are done right the first time
good,Would love to work right away. I took culinary in high school/ collage. It would be awesome to work at this place. I need to fine a job to keep my bills up to date.
good,A typical day begins with daily tasks.  Following a checklist.  Working on projects together as well as individually.  Workplace culture is good.  Management is Ok.
good,This is a very stressful position but company works at making it fun.  They are really into culture.  Many things are beyond your control but management will work with you to succeed.
good,When beginning work for the night/day your day ended when all orders were filled/completed. I enjoyed working there because I could work alone if I wanted to and the guys would hep each other complete orders.
good,Overall a good company to work for with good benefits and reasonable work expectations.  Lack of growth opportunities is my main reason for leaving.  Nationally they are a strong company but the Lumberton DC is fairly small.
good,"At Family Fare, I was a cashier; so at the beginning of all my shifts I would start on the cash register. I would greet customers and do whatever I could to meet their needs. I enjoyed working with the people there and the management was understanding and able to work with a schedule."
good,"always greeted with a smile, great people to work with and around love the customers, easy job fast paced fun environment not stressful boss is fun to be around"
good,"Nash Finch was a good company to work for. They provided a safe, clean and relaxed work environment for their entire staff. In my position I was able to work with other employees to benefit the entire company."
good,"It fully depends on your job, If you are a selector you can fully expect to work very hard and sometimes quite possibly more than 40 hrs per week, however overtime money sure is nice. Also its a great feeling working hard and earning your money treats you to learn respect and to be modest. Spartan-Nash also donates a lot of food to organizations that help people who cant afford food eat to stay alive one of the great things as Americans we should all do."
good,"At my last job, Quick Stop Manager I had a lot of job duties to fill, but the main one was customer service...I had a lot of regular customers that came in several times a week, I miss that the most about my job.  "
good,"Great Leadership Team in place. The Director is a great P/L guy who has clear cut directives. Overall, great benefits and compensation packages also."
good,I worked for SpartanNash for 31 years. The majority of my career at this company I had positive experiences. The one big negative aspect of my association with this company was the decision by upper management to close two distribution centers that I worked at.
good,"A typical day at work is basically doing my job, on top of helping others out. My co-workers are great, they make coming to work very enjoyable. We are always taking our job serious, while having fun doing it. There was never really anything hard about my job. I always did what i was asked to do and i didn't mind. I never had a problem multi-tasking, or helping customers find what they needed. The most enjoyable part about my job is seeing my customers happy when they leave the store."
good,"Throughout my career with SpartanNash I have excelled with learning customer service skills. I've learned how to manage my time throughout the day to ensure each day was productive. I managed 30 people while as a Customer Service Manager, most of which I hired and trained myself. I enjoyed creating a fun and friendly work environment for myself and fellow employees, that would show through to our customers to ensure they would enjoy their shopping experience."
good,"I would work on established priority stores as well as the day to day monitoring of store metrics."
good,"Great opportunity starting out in the grocery business, allowing you to learn many facets of the business.."
good,A typical day at work would consist of me recieving orders from various military bases.I was required to pick the orders using either pallet jacks or reach lifts....occasionally cherry pickers and turret trucks. It was required that i keep written and electronic logs as i also had to load it onto overseas containers. I learned the basics of data entry and how to work accuratly on a time sensitive scale while working at nash/finch.The hardest part of the job was making sure my work was done accurately while keeping the pre-determined deadlines.The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction in knowing i had one.
good,Overall I did not mind my job here. I was let go because I was unable to meet the productivity requirements by the end of my 90 days due to some incredible foot pain.
good,Just the workload and work hours are crazy on oneself. And I hated the part of working on a Sunday though. Just know when you go to this job just be ready to work is all I have to say.
good,Loved my job very great at giving v appropriate times for runs and benefits were great treated employees fairly was an equal opportunity employer gave good incentives
good,"A typical day is processing customer grocery transactions and stock small grocery items. The enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I have learned to accommodate the customer's expectations and have pleasant conversations. The workplace culture was upheld by management as an interactive circle of beliefs, attitudes, and values."
good,Great place to work until the changed the hours to overnight. I was a Lead Loader and loaded pallets and totes on a truck. When i worked there the employees I worked with were friendly and easy to get along with.
good,Wonderful company to work for. This was a new opportunity for me and they did all possible to make sure I prospered. The general manager worked with me when time off was needed as I also was assisting my elderly mother.
good,"Great place to work but hard work could be expected at times, its a truck company. You would be working holidays and weekends. The job could be completive because your work is rated by production each day."
good,Nice place to work good pay. . Everyone is a team player 30 minutes for lunch 15 minutes breaks clean warehouse different position to choose from if you're not good at one
good,"It was an amazing place to work,i loved everyone that i worked with, the only reasoned why i left was because i just had a baby and i couldn't be away from her that long when they switched to 12 hr days..."
good,If your looking for a high paced placed to work where there is great culture and great people the SpartanNash is the place for you.  Competitive wages and competitive benefits.
good,Great company to work at. Provide many benefits. Days off and sick time. Company lunch and dinners are normal at this location. Knowledge of forklift and automated system.
good,"A typical day consisted of: Daily Communication with customers, Quoting equipment, placing orders, reconciling invoices, receiving orders, tracking orders, and meeting with vendors on a monthly basis to discuss pricing contracts. The department I worked in was very team oriented, however my direct manager was located in the corporate office, in Grand Rapids, MI. There would be monthly staff conference calls to keep communication lines open. I would say the best part of my job was communicating with the customers and the people that I worked with"
good,I enjoyed working there but the ours are to long at sometimes and the expectations are really high and its a great work experience and good work environment
good,Culture is a big thing at SpartanNash. I worked in Procurement. The VP over the department was very eager to establish a culture of accountability and linking it to the eagerness to perform.
good,It was a good place to work but as many companies it became very stressful as the work load increased.  I also became concerned about doing the best things for my customers.
good,"Overall I would have to say that the job was decent.  Although I worked alone, I did have the chance to work with some interesting people.  If I had the chance  I might work again if the hours were increased."
good,"As usual, bookkeeping can be challenging due to the fact you have to be dependent on other personal (checkers), there accuracy makes the job a lot easier."
good,"My job as a selector is to supplies cold products to military commissaries located on the Eastern Coast of the United States. This includes picking frozen and chill products using a Vocollect headset and a battery operated riding pallet jack, this system would call out the product to be pick. Once the product is received, it is inspected, packed and loading on trailers for deliveries. Some of the products get put in the wrong locations; it is then put in frustrated status. I would use a handheld scanner to scan the barcode labels for the correct location. After working in the freezer for (8) years it took a toll on body, I took a ((6) months break between jobs for health reasons."
good,A normal day consisted of clocking in and immediately grabbing an order from case. We sorted the pics out based on whether it was dairy or freezer. After that we chose ordered items from shelves and placed them on pallets and wrapped them for shipment.
good,It was a very nice place to work.The benefits were good and they had a luncheon once a monty.Advancment was kind of slow but they pay was good and health benefits were a big plus.
good,"While the job is monotonous and physically demanding, it pays really well and the workers are very courteous and will help you learn the tools of the trade."
good,Challenging every day.  No day is the same.  Get the opportunity to interact with customers on a daily basis.  Company supports the military in all aspects of live.
good,"Production, loading, dealing with products sold, working closely with co-workers, good benefits and employee satisfaction, would work there again if given the opportunity"
good,Fast paced work environment with many challenges.  Ability to work with numerous individuals at once to achieve a common goal is a must.  Ability to react professionally to multiple customer/employee situations.
good,"Unload Storage/Food Supply Truck"
good,"SpartanNash is going through a major restructuring. The decision to consolidate all operations has affected many positions, including mine. I was given the opportunity to experience every department such as shipping, receiving, inventory control, loading and unloading. Customer satisfaction was important to all associates and was the core of our work ethic. SpartanNash provided several appreciation days and cared about the moral of all employees. Impromptu dinners, contests, and fund raising for the needy kept the work days enjoyable and meaningful. I am very proud of the contributions I have made to my company during my employment years, however I am looking forward to new opportunities where I can benefit a company by putting my experience and knowledge to work."
good,"Good learning possibilities. Dealing with vendors and deliveries. Good, fun working environment. Open door policy. Great safety standards."
good,"Everyone here works hard, and makes the store look amazing. My day included filling and maintaining the produce department, and making it look fantastic, as that was the first thing customers saw when they walked in. Management was helpful and active. The hardest part of my job was meeting deadlines. There were not enough people to work in produce, so there was generally too much to do in too little time. But I loved it. I loved feeling accomplished on the days I did meet my deadlines. I also loved providing people with good, fresh, healthy food. I learned how to work hard at that job. I have never had to work for much because school was easy for me. But there, at Family Fare (SpartanNash), I had to persevere every day, and push myself to be better than I could be. Otherwise, when I left, the department would be a mess and I would not be able to do anything about it."
good,Both the pharmacists and techs are easy to work with and hard workers. I enjoy working for SpartanNash and will continue to support the company.
good,"Overall I would say Family Fare and by extension, Spartan Nash, is a good company with work opportunities for employees from all different walks of life. My store I currently work at has friendly co-workers and understanding supervisors which is more than one can ask for in a lower level, customer service job. "

good,"This company will find a place for you. Opportunity is there if your willing to work for it. The health benifit program is well worth it."
good,I wish they didn’t close our branch of the company. We had a great crew and very good benefits. No regrets about working there. Our warehouse ended up on the chopping block and everything comes from Omaha now. But they offered to transfer anyone who would move and paid a fair severance package.
good,"Improved overall productivity levels by x% or in the following key performance areas."
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  There was a lot of employee turnover - as there usually is in a retail grocery store.  Depending on the department you work in, your day could be an early start or a late start.  Generally floating shifts work for most employees there."

Everything I learned at SpartanNash and the people that I met have greatly affected what I want in a future career. It was very quick paced and deadline oriented, but I thrive in that environment."
good,Like most large business they merged with another company and this merge caused the original company to lose some of the work ethic and security that it previously provided to its employees.

good,Nash Finch has a great culture for work life balance. I worked 100 percent virtual while there. It was a very production driver job. In which I had to produce results each week for candidates placed and report this information to my manager. My manager was very hands off but supportive when I needed her. She seemed to be focused on the results I produced opposed to how they were produced. I learned a lot about food distribution and the transportation industry while working there.

good,"Local management lacking in some areas, but overall a good place to work. Was originally promised part time status with full time hours and rarely ever went over 34 hours, that was disappointing. Store was severely understaffed at all times, but hours were never given to  the store to properly staff the store so there were a lot of things that were unable to get done because of this, and this was out of the hands on a local level."
good,Assign jobs to very knowledgeable fork truck drivers and keep the work in front of them until daily workload is complete.

I was presented with projects and tasks that made a direct impact on my department.

SpartanNash invests in the professional development of their interns and I am grateful for all the learning opportunities I had.  They have an excellent program with a remarkable intern coordinator.  I gained new skills and knowledge during my time at SpartanNash."

good,"Family Fare (cashier), West Fargo, ND "
good,"Typical day at work entails meeting for project initiatives, application development for service requests, and employee interaction for development tasks.  I enjoyed the clean, comfortable environment and the acceptable level of challenge for applications development.  Coworkers can be angry or evasive, but leadership does the job well of managing personnel and bringing in new talent and also providing incentives for current talent to grow their careers within the company.  People can sometimes be perpetually disgruntled which makes the job less engaging.  The most enjoyable day on the job has one or two meetings for project efforts included and development work in between.  Good people overall, though people are sometimes critical to a fault without just consideration of the effort peers contribute to a collective development goal."
