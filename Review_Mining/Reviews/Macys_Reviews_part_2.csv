good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Every day is unpredictable. You have to outline the must complete daily and know to be flexible as things change. You interact daily with team members and customers. Being an active leader on the floor leading by example and teaching how to. "
good,"Okay for a seasonal position, I moved up quickly and the money was good for a part-time position. Comfortable clean work envrionment"
good,"Worked multiple shifts, asked a lot of employees for the pay. Lots of on-boarding of new employees,  Store management changes a lot.  Not a good work environment"
good,Macy's is constantly cutting hours and not providing time to get the merchandise to the floor. The hours are not controlled at the store level and are arbitrary by upper management who are not at the store to review the decisions that are being made.
good,"macys is a good place to work at if you need a flexible schedule, also they teach you how to deal with customers in a difficult situation  and put them first"
good,"typical day starts early.  worked in the cash office department."
good,Being a security guard at Macy's is great even though anything could happen at any given moment. For example our job is to keep a look out for potential shop lifters. Shop lifters could be anyone from a customer to even Macy's own associates. But the good thing is that your not alone in a situation of going after a potential shop lifter. You got people up stairs working the camera detective walking on the floor and other security guards spread throughout the Macy's.
good,This wasn't my favorite place to work for various reasons. Its a good place holder in between job hunting. The managers always accuse you for the bad and never the customers for which they know the associates always give the best choices.
good,"I been with the company for almost 10 yrs. this year and I personally think it can be a great place to work for if you are passionate and sales driven. I have been a former sales associate, vendor special, holiday sales supervisor, and  a cosmetic counter manager so I feel like I have a lot of issues that I'm conflicted with and is related to everyone who has worked for the company.   I think the benefits are great and that we have one of the greatest coupons and deals for our costumers. The only things that I am displeased about this company is their lack or recognition for their employers your fellow sales associates. On the management side of things feed back and one on one training with associates should be more engaging and more celebratory with successes more appreciative maybe with bonuses , or raises anything better then just a simple magic complimenting card would be nice.   Management lacks good judgment abilities when it comes to accommodating  costumers who are abusing store coupons."
good,"Communicate with customers throughout the day"
good,"-Worked at a highly organized office with engaged associates"
good,I work in sales for three years I have good experience I know what its like two work well under presser and make good reliable dissection and im a good team player
good,Typical retail job. Nothing really exciting. Basic training. Goals are put in place for you and you are expected to reach them. Great for people who love sales.
good,Macys does a pretty good job taking care of its associates. There are a few things that are puzzling about scheduling and being open on all but 2 days out of the year. Then during the holidays the extended hours are crazy.
good,"During the holidays, the workplace at Macy's is very fast paced. You need to be quick and have to possess a lot of patience."
good,"They trained their workers pretty well and they were understanding when help was needed. Most people are fun to work with and easy to get along with. Working in the Fine Jewelry department, you are expected to stay later and arrive earlier and have a few more responsibilities than people who work in other departments."
good,I learned a lot from working at Macy's. It is a crazy busy store that you learn to work harder each and everyday. I worked in Shoes so it was always insanely busy but everyday for a year I managed to get through the tough times. I wish they could hire more people for shifts though.
good,"A typical a day at work is helping customers find what they need and having good communication with customers and everyone. The hardest part is sometimes trying to help customers and they get mad when you don""t find what they need."
good,I enjoyed the weekly pay and employee discount along with the workplace I was in. I was great with the customers and I was very liked by my coworkers.
good,"as a beauty advisor in mens fragrances, a typical day is spent helping customers chose a fragrance based on what the like and what notes are in each individual fragrance. also some of the day is spent calling and texting clients to let them know of any upcoming sales or promotions.  really like this job with the exception of Macys always cutting positions. there is not much growth within the company."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My typical day at Macy's included clocking in and usually taking over for someone at the register. I would provide customer service by asking about my customers day or if they had found everything they came for. As I am ringing my customers items, I am taking the sensors off and double checking I have done so correctly. I then take their payment and continue on to the next customer. If there is no one present in line, I will clear the counters of items that don't belong there, walk around my work station area to clean up items from off the floor and check the fitting rooms. Sometimes I would size women for accurate bra sizes and get the bra type and size they asked for."
good,good company to grow with they offer good benefits and offer a good pay depending on the position you take on..they are a good understanding company that looks out for their employees
good,"I have worked at Macy's for seven years.  Three times I have been offered a management position, only to have the offer rescinded due to ""corporate cost decisions"".  I now work there simply to have a job and provide for my family until a better job is available."
good,Great place to work! I have enjoyed my time learning about this amazing company. The people I work with are so helpful and wonderful. I feel so grateful to be a part of such a successful company!
good,The company itself isn't the greatest but my coworkers are wonderful. My team and I have had to overcome many obstacles as far as trying to get shrink down and we've achieved that with flying colors.
good,Fun easy going work place. My work schedule can be a little crazy. Because I only worked during game the holidays. Sometimes it can get crazy and busy.
good,"working stock at macy's was a learning process."
good,It is very hard to grow within a company that has mass layoffs annually. Your work/life balance heavily depends on what team you work on.
good,Work life balance could be better for managers. Over all a good place to work. Good atmosphere and up beat employees. Food is supplied every few months and more often during the holidays.
good,i learned so much about skin care and makeup from macys. the 17 months i spent behind the counter thought me so many things. i am happy to have worked there.
good,okay the atmosphere was fun around the holidays the mangers was helpful every body was nice i love the place the clothes and different people meeting everyday
good,it was a great job in the early 90's had its ups and downs at a point of time but overall good place to learn from have a lot of experience there over time.
good,"Lots of what I have expedienced at Macy's was good.  The company's way to deal with work load was to throw money at the problem but with lack of employees, it was difficult to get the work with limited staff. All in all it was a great place to develop skills for the future."
good,"shifts are usually 10 or 12 hours long and you are standing on your feet for all of it unless you're on light duty; so make sure you're wearing comfortable shoes. it a very repetitive job, no matter what department you are going to. I didn't mind too much because it was only for 3 days (12 hour shifts./ weekends) which also went well with my school schedule but it did mean i couldn't do anything on the weekends. you get paid every Friday which is a plus though too. I didn't get to get tuition reimbursement because i believe it only is for certain schools or something of that nature."
good,"Typically very busy and and non stop working."
good,Trying to move up in this retail store is very difficult. There is a lot of favoritism. There is constant pressure about opening credit card accounts.
good,Macy's is a good place to work at the management level but is going through a tremendous reorganization period at the present time.. job security is not at a high level.
good,The employees were a bit unorganized and didn't have the store as clean as it should. The managers were not the best people to work with but overall it was an ok job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A good establishment to learn how a department retail store functions in the United States, how the flux of customers is variable during the seasons  and how the store needs goals have to be reached"
good,"All my coworkers and I were of the same age and we were all starting off college. We understood each other. Most of us had school in the mornings and afternoons and we would come into work for the closing shift. After closing, after a long day of school and work, we would go out for a late night meal and dance."
good,customer service and team work sums it up ! Work different departments . But was really good with customers services on the phone or in person .
good,"Although I was only there for a brief period, I enjoyed my job. Unfortunately the pay was not worth it. $12/hr does not suffice when you are apprehending potentially dangerous individuals. Veteran detectives complained about their pay as well, and were extremely disappointed in 30 cent raise they received after being with the company for about a year."
good,"Great place to learn and start career. Every day was relatively structured, and included a meeting in the morning and afternoon with the other management."
good,I am sad to see Macys is closing multiple stores around the US. Great place to make a few extra dollars and even better place to shop especially during the holidays.
good,"stocking merchandise, ringing customer payments, signing area keeping floor clean and presentable, cash drops and various administrative duties"
good,"typical work day is busy and many customers. i learned how to use the cashier system and inventory."
good,"Management is horrible, they play favoritism. Favorite part of my job is doing the new set ups & the worst was taking on too many tasks. some co workers don't know how to work as a team."
good,"Once achieving a level of management, the expectations are increased.  The security of the positions begin to be less solid."
good,I work closely with the external and internal theft in the store. employees are good but management not to good the hardest part of the job is working with the management.
good,The money is good at Macy's. It's quite a big warehouse and most of the people are pretty friendly. You'll definitely feel it at the end of the week .
good,I went to Macy's to help supplement my income while my daughter was involved in cheer competitions. The hours were very flexible and that's what I needed at the time.
good,"Macy's store in Waikiki is small, you get to know everyone faster. You get to interact with the guests a lot. But there are late nights and crazy sales. Watch out for those fitting rooms!"
good,"the management here was incredible, helping you every step of the way extremely nice. as well customers are very nice. it does get busy but you are rewarded for your actions."
good,"This job requires you to play many different parts. As part of my job, I had to great guests, help figure out their wants and needs, retrieve their selected items from the stockroom, and ring them up."
good,I was on call and management was a bit unorganized. I was a sales associate and more training would have been beneficial to our productivity. Didn't get much hours so therefore I can't give a thorough review this company
good,It's a very good environment with associates but the management is not that great. Needs more improvement with communication skills to their associates.
good,i don't know bout you but i don't really like the trail jobs i like using my hands and getting stuff done to go home and sleep at nigth so with that being said it might work for you it didn't for me
good,if retail work is your thing maybe consider Macy's. there is plenty to do there. Everyday there will be racks and racks of clothes that need to be returned to the sales floor. just as any job you work with people you either find a connection with or you dont. there are also cliques throughout the company.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This was a seasonal job. I learn a few things about retail and enjoyed the process. I liked the people I worked with and the customers were funny. The youth did a lot of stealing every week end
good,"Keeping the store well maintained, Greeting every customer that walks and out of the store, Meeting daily sales goals."
good,It was a good warehouse job. They had a system to inspect returned furniture then we re wrapped it and shipped it back out or restocked it.The coworkers were nice and all did there part so the day would go smoothly. Management did a good job constantly checking on workers and how they were feeling.However the pay was not equal to the labor.
good,"Working with other to fill online orders learned to work well wit others "
good,"A typical day at Macy's. Dealing with public and their issues. The co-workers were easy to work with.Everyday you will be in a different department, so it was never boring."
good,"It is a typical retail environment. Everything that you see happen when you shop is typically what you will be dealing with. Cashiers, helping customers, and putting product away."
good,A good retail company to work for. I worked in a non-commission department.  I enjoyed working with and learning merchandising from department managers and other assocites.
good,My first day working here was actually black Friday. I was so nervous but the fact that I have a lot of cash register experience it actually went great. I got the hold of things quickly and all of my co workers were great to work with.
good,"Benefits were unaffordable"
good,I learned about the online customer service part of the company. It provided the opportunity to better my communication skills. I worked with some wonderful people. The wages could be better.
good,Great Experience but horrible pay and benefits. Management seems to be all over the place at times. You get some holidays off.
good,"if you're not willing to go out and work for sales, stay out of cosmetics. The most successfull people you see in this industry are commision hungry. If you're not, you will likely not do very well in the long term."
good,"I did not like the way my job ended here. There was no notification from my manager in person, just a message on the scheduling thing that my employment would be ending because I was seasonal. With the closing of Cortana Mall's Macy's, their employees transferred, while I was replaced by a fulltime employee from Cortana."
good,Good working environment can be boring at times.  But very fun to be around and interact with different people. And it can be good cause you can develop your people skills.
good,"I really liked this job, it was fast paced and fun. Training was shaky in terms of information distribution but the job is simple enough for you to throw yourself in and enjoy whatever is thrown at you and it helps that there was always someone who was more than willing to assist in any question I had during the first weeks I was there"
good,I really didn't care for working at Macy's due to me having to constantly clean up big piles of close for a little bit of pay and also short hours. I was grateful to have a job at the time but retail did not fit me or my interest.
good,If you work at macys especially as a part time or temporary employee you may be stressed out. Training is quick but you mainly learn on the job.
good,Sales associate doesn't do much on their job besides selling bc when it is not busy they just stay around and do nothing and just chat. Place is always a mess and unorganize.
good,"Training all employees the steps of Magic sale's. Customer service, open credit. Make goals and reach them. Product placement, window  setting, update marketing."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This was a good place to work as they care about the people that work here and take time to get to know you and what you want overall in life.
good,Macy's was a chaotic work environment. It was always hard to find a manager when you really needed one. Most of the time you had to try to resolve problems by yourself even if you were unsure of the answer.
good,got a lot to learn in terms of HR software and applications as well as administrative processes. over all good experience
good,"Very diverse place to work. A typical day at work is pretty busy, and through the course of a month I've learned patience. The management team is pretty easy to talk to, and my coworkers are all team players."
good,This job is a Fast work environment and  heavy lifting. The starting time for this work place is 4 am. The closing changes and is determined by the amount of product is received.
good,n/a - why do I have to review a company that I do not wish to do so?  Shouldn't this be optional? It seems unnecessary to involve such a process when trying to apply for a position that chooses to use your site as a means to gain potential employees.
good,It was a part time job. I was able to take every other weekend for my child. The Manager was welling to help me with my scheduled.
good,"I have been at Macy's for 3 year and have seen a lot of changes. Some for the good, some that still needed improvement. In the past year, however, the changes have been for the worse. Senior leadership have been interfering with how operations managers are running their departments. Some of these managers have been in place for years. They're coming between managers and supervisors, as well as between supervisors and associates. This has been creating a lack of trust and morale is at an all-time low. Productivity and employee satisfaction have dropped. The supervisors are being blamed without any investigation being done."
good,A typical pawn shop day. Management was very friendly. It was a small business. Not too difficult of work. Didn't feel i had real interest in the work
good,"As a small store , you get to know your fellow workers pretty well and the resulting friendships made it a fun place to work at"
good,The people were friendly and the management was glad to help new employee at any time. The work mentality was very team-oriented and reward employees that used team work in their day to day routine.
good,Great place great experience great people adaptable job fast pace environment good managers easy to find equipment ....................................
good,"As I have worked a number of positions for Macy's I constantly felt like I was underpaid and over worked. During the holidays I worked 60 hour to 70 hour weeks and wouldn't even get a quarter raise. The  most anyone one has received working as hard as I have is $0.17. The hardest part was keeping a good mind set while working the holidays and having to watch internal and external thefts. Co-workers that were young didn't have any respect and the older ones had their mindset the way they wanted and no one could tell them otherwise. Management was either under qualified and didn't like confrontation and were intimidated my their associates or were over qualified and would transfer to another store ad think there is only 1 way to teach things. Overall, there are some pros and a ton of cons but there are good employees at the business and there are not so good ones. Definitely a good place to start working to gain real world knowledge and to learn how to work with different types of people and adults. If you don't like people telling you what to do then this is not the place for you. Weak skin, not for you. These are people who have no shame and almost no class depending on the location that you work at. Not the  best place to have a career unless you like it and don't plan on going to college."
good,this job was great. i have learned about cleaning places and keeping it very clean. the greatest part of this job is cleaning the store. the co workers were okay.
good,It was alright working there. Didn't get very many hours all the training on how to sell credit cards was online so for me wasn't very productive. Management was good and the employees were great.
good,Good company to work for.  Low wages but take care of employees if you do your job.  If you do not have any issues than work will be great for you.  Do not bring personal life into work.
good,"When I was hired my position different than what it has become.  They asked me to go in management but I was not interested.  Every year given more duties with no change in compensation.  I had top sales but really want to decrease hours, especially during season"
good,I've learned that  when you have good customer service it make it easier to interact with customer.When i was employed at Macys for the holiday when  some of the vendors were haven difficulties getting the customer to buy their product i was able to help them. i make customers interested and what the vendors were offering them which was perfume.
good,I learned how to work the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers while I helped with their transaction.
good,I loved this job at first but after my manager Maria on the 4th floor I hated this job. Managers take up for managers even if they are wrong and that's what I could not stand so therefore I left. Not all floors are bad but if you're stuck with a bad manager it will be a living nightmare for you.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's was a nice place to work.  I would have liked to have been able to stay on in a full time position, but none were available. Therefore having to leave to find a full time job."
good,"I had good working experience with some fun and energetic people. "
good,"Macys changed the way the work schedules are created so a computer sets your hours, not a human who knows your preferences. My manager agreed before I accepted the position that I would not have to work during church on Sunday Mornings. The computer schedule could not be changed so I had to give away my shift or miss church. "
good,it was a very good working experience. I worked as a full time and they were very flexible. got a long with co-worker very friendly environment.
good,"There was a large part of the job that I loved, my coworkers were fun and great to work with. But it was poorly managed, made it difficult to maintain good relationships with higher ups. The managers treated both the employees and customers badly."
good,"Great job for someone who needs to do alot of shopping at Macy for themselves, kids, family, etc. Don't expect what they promise you in commissions.  They have too many sales people just so they have you stocking and doing things that you can't make commission on.  Managers run and hide when the floor gets busy, instead of helping associates meet they goals.  Then come around after customers leave and expect cleaning, stocking and ship online orders that you don't get paid commissin on.  Stay away from flex vs commission, or you will likely own Macys money."
good,one of my best jobs i ever had good workers great organization. the most important customers was nice some of them will try to get under your skin if you let them
good,"Macy's is a good place to work. You just have to work hard for everything.  There is a lot of favoritism within management, not too much recognition if you are not someone's favorite. The management is too lenient, no repercussions are given."
good,it was a good experience. got to learn how it is to work in retail. i got to work on my customer service skills. on a typical day it wasn't a lot of people and i got the job done on time
good,Very fast paced environment with room to grow. A lot of potential to move up and learn different aspects of the Macy's behind the scenes environment as far as online orders and tracking products
good,"i enjoyed working in retail because it was easy to make connections with customers which resulted in good sales and macs credit card applications. in two days time i had 10 credit card applications, which resulted in a coffee gift card!"
good,"go into work we have to go through security, show them our badges. The next thing we do is have a brief meeting in the morning of whats going to go through the day."
good,"Never had experience with retail, working at Macy's was interesting.  Sales people are some of the best people you can work with - they are fun, charming, and helpful.  Management on the other hand are quite different.  I'm sure they need to focus on numbers, and that leads to some unhappy workers who are overworked and a constant turnover of employees. I wasn't looking to work on the sales floor but when asked to work as a sales associate while the store was short handed wasn't agreeable with me.  Why would the store manager have people who aren't trained to be sales work on the sales floor at all is beyond me.  Some managers are understanding and are great mentors, so it all depends on the manager."
good,"I've learned so much and still learning on a day to day bases. Love working with my co-workers. Can be challenging, but i enjoy it. Great experience!!"
good,"Macy's, like any other retail store, is a good place to start out when finding a job to get by. By no means should it become a permanent place that you decide to work unless you can rise in the ranks fast enough to make a career out of it, and the percentage on that is very low. The best part of this job can be the people you work with. You basically com win every day knowing that you.re going to be working with your friends and you guys will tackle the day together. Customers are generally the negative/hardest part of this job because no matter how nice or helpful you are, theres always some that just ruin it for you, and I also believe it can be based on the location. Advancement opportunities are scarce, and if you do manage to rise just a little bit, it really doesn't feel like it because there isn't as much of a pay raise as you'd think, but your responsibilities are doubled. Overall, it's a decent place to start, but don't get stuck."
good,"for the most part everyone is friendly and open to helping with things you dont understand"
good,"A typical day was getting much of the merchandise folded, colorized, sized and more.  I began working as Christmas help and moved throughout many departments of the store.  The final department I worked in was the Men's Dept. as the Men's Specialist.  It was a great job and I loved it a lot!  I really enjoyed seeing Men dress in suits, jackets, shirts and tie combinations.  There were even times when some of the Men told me I picked out a great combination for them.  I enjoyed working with a lot of my co-workers.   There were times I was told to tell other sales employees what to do and that was very hard for me to do.  The most enjoyable part of the day was probably lunchtype were you got to talk to other associates that did not work near you.  It was really hard to leave the store when it closed after all the years I had worked there."
good,Didn't really like the management or the style of work that I had to do. I was on the dock and things were very redundant and the weather depicted a lot.
good,"Great company to start your career with. However, in advancement/ promotion the timeline is too antiquated and vague. Also, they emphasize the millennial spending power, but are reactive instead of proactive in attracting such audience."
good,"I don't think that there's a ""typical day at work"" when you work in retail and Macy's is no different.  Each customer's needs are unique and require on your feet problem solving.  I learned how to manage the credit program as well as the multiple Give Back Campaigns Macy's participates in year round."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The best part about working here is making friends. The pay could've been way more when I worked there. The breaks aren't long enough because of he lines in the food court.
good,Macy's was my first retail job working other than working at Piggly Wiggly. They provided a fresh and friendly atmosphere and we made sure that all the customer's needs well met and we went b=above and beyond to give them the best customer service experience available.
good,I loved working for Macys. They really show you how important it is to work for the name and to respresent the company well. I felt proud to be apart of the team. I worked very hard and never had any complaints. They however are very strict with the schedule and the attendace point system is outrageous and overboard.
good,"Scan merchandise and set prices daily "
good,"overall it is not bad at all, everyone is friendly and fun. Fulfilment and receiving are the best departments"
good,I don't remember too much about working at Macy's. I remember I stopped working there because they kept scheduling me when I had school. It wasn't a bad place to work though. I didn't have any problems working there.
good,I worked in a store that didn't have much traffic. The pay was horrible and no real way to move up in the company.  The commute was great.
good,"Decent company to work for. Not very personal to their employees or their needs. No real stabalized management to counteract with, or rely on. Don't make a career out of it."
good,"A typical day at work would be very linear and repetitive, however, I would always have a task to complete which made the day go by faster. I learned how to effectively work with others when needed, and work efficiently on my own. The management was fair. The management team was solid and kind, even the manage of the entire warehouse knew my name and would always greet me. Most of the time I did work alone, but on rare occasions group tasks were assigned and my co-workers were well-rounded and fairly nice people. The part I enjoyed most about my job was that I would always have a task to do, which made the 12 hour shifts fly by."
good,"it is   good company to  work for but i don t like the   hours and the cheaper merchandise we are carrying , it is a different macys,  the hardest part of the job is going to the stock room and climbing the ladder and  no light to get the suit for the customer so i can sell it, i am friendly with co workers i respect theire customers and they respect my customers, and the most enjoyable part of my job is making a big sale"
good,"I worked nights in the Macy's warehouse. Nice atmosphere, pleasant coworkers, opportunities for growth. Open door policy. Managers helpful"
good,"There are workers who have been at Macy's for 15+ years, and while I will not knock their way of making a living, I will question their ability to not be vicious. They are very territorial and are selfish and determined when it comes to making their sales goal for the day. So much so that they're willing to lie to managers about your actions (or lack thereof) or attempt to relegate the physical returns to you as to gain large ticket customers in your absence. "
good,The job was very demanding. Management needs a lot of help that they don't get. My co-workers worked really hard and helped me get through my work days. Enjoyable part of the job was serving up coffee to people who needed it.
good,ok place to work just wasn't enough money for me they offer great benefits just 8$hr too low so I found another job. it is a production based job also
good,Macy's was my first retail job. It had a fun atmosphere and my coworkers were really nice. This was a great starter job for me
good,"worked in sales. customer service. cashier checking customers out for their purchases. men's, womens, childrens, jewelry, and home department."
good,Everyday at work was always different than the one before. That kept me on my toes and allowed me to learn new things all the time. I loved how all of the associates worked together and made each one feel like family.
good,"Typical retail store.  Open on all holidays, last of the remaining brick and mortar stores."
good,A huge lack of communication among management and all the heads of the departments. The benefits are great and the customers are even better. But with a large amount of co workers as they have it sometimes makes it an uncomfortable atmosphere. Its either overcrowded with too many employees or they all call off on the same day.
good,"Macy's offers ample amounts of opportunities to grow and expand as a professional. Employees can change positions and locations within the company with much ease. The company invests in its employees, especially in the managerial/executive levels."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I had a good time working with my co-workers and supervisor. and learned how to manage people in different levels. I like the training process it allowed me to develop my communication skills which made me a better team members and the training involved management team from each department from the initial training throughout the whole process I was able to Learn 3 things my discipline my engagement with my Superior and also my operational skills
good,"helping and assisting customers with inquiries, help order various items online and assisting with other departments if needed."
good,What girl doesn't want to work in the fashion industry? Enjoyed seeing all the new trends and styles. Had lots of fun helping customers into that 'just right' outfit from weddings to proms to graduations.
good,i worked as a registry consultant here in Boston when they actually had a wedding registry. i made great friends here and loved most of the staff. though the work enviorment was rigid and demanding
good,Macys is a customer focused company and I liked that. A typical day was helping customers and driving sales. My co workers were easy to get along with.
good,Tough place to work because of the lack of communication and the management. I was often left alone to handle a busy department.
good,"My co-workers were the best part of the job. I had worked there for almost two years and towards the end before I had resigned, there was a ton of changes and miscommunication. The managers had switched departments, which threw many of us out of whack, but for the most part the new changes were improvements."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Pros:"
good,A fun and great place to work. Employee general are passionate about their job. Schedule is often flexible to meet employees needs. Management is very easy to work with. An overall great place to work.
good,"Macy's is not a place to work for long term and if you work in a certain location the business simply isn't there to make a commission based wage. Our typical day at work was faced paced and constantly changing with something to do at all times. Management was sadly inept and did little to support associates instead choosing to drill about numbers and failing to lead by example, choosing to delegate all tasks and not helping with side projects when it became busy in high volume days."
good,"it was nice to work there everyone was friendly. management was nice, we received nice bonuses as well. hardest part was peak season but other then that, everyone was nice and got along with each other, definitely miss it there sometimes."
good,"A typical day I enjoyed was serving Macy's customers"
good,"when i come into work, my manager would tell me what is my task for the day. ive learned how to take inventory and how to process merchandise to be shipped out. the management is very easy to work with. my co workers were always around if i find myself having difficulty with work"
good,Good place to work as a sales associate and to make good commission. Working for Macy's is exactly what you think it is. Good co-workers and a job you can look gorward
good,Everyone was nice and the managers were nice as well. I personally wasn't here long but other than working weekends it was a great place to move up if thats what someone desired.
good,It is a great place to work. Advancement in position is possible but its determined by how much management like you rather than what you bring to the table for the advancement of the company.
good,Very good staff to work with. I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The only problem I had was the compensation in relation to the job and the constant under scheduling for fear of going into even one minute of overtime.
good,"It was a good start to Sales as a young man. I found that I am both great at sales and enjoy it while working at Macy's. "
good,"The environment is pretty nice, but the managers seem a little unprofessional.  But the events they throw are fun to be a apart of, and the discounts are pretty good."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,Good company and Good management love the employees makes your job a lot easier hardest part of job apprehension of offenders
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Macy's.  I learned many skills over the years that I can bring to my next position.  I am thankful for my mentors, team, and opportunities that was given to me."
good,"Great place to start off, the place is fair you will learn a lot and meet a lot of great people.  Its what you put into the work place that you get out of it, if you want to learn and succeed you definitely will and this is a great place to go."
good,i learned a lot working here as a sales associate. at times it would get boring. the management team wasn't the most approachable.
good,"my typical day at macys would be sorting and organizing boxes,clothing,ect. ive learned that how too interact with many of people and managers.management was picky.hardest part was standing up 12hrs of day.most enjoyable part $$$$."
good,Macy's is a great place to work.  Although I only worked there part-time it was great.  Policies and procedures that were in place allowed day to day operations to run smooth.
good,good place to learn about the business but the hierarchy and bureaucracy make it difficult to get things done. lots of people in upper management are old fashioned.
good,"I would go in to work clock in, the go to the philosophy counter and wait for customers to approach the counter and ask about products."
good,"A typical day at work includes taking pictures of cars,financing and printing paperwork,taking deals to the bank,training new employees"
good,"getting merchendise floor ready."
good,"starting your day to get tasks and extra things done."
good,"you start and finish your daily tasks."
good,It was fun to sell shoes and learn a new experience and I met some great people even though management was always changing.
good,"A typical day at work wasn't too hectic, I would make sure the store was prepared for customers before the store opened. Always was trusted to accomplish task on my own. Managament was friendly and helpful when it came down to anything. Good company to work for."
good,It was a great experience to deal with customers. Make sure that they are happy. Build thrust between customers and our department by providing reliable items.
good,"ok place to work was fast paced, busy, and stressful but worth it due to customer satisfaction. rooms are always busy and full of clothes ready to be taken to sorting."
good,This is a nice place to work. The people you have the opportunity to work alongside make each day fun. You learn something new everyday.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This is a nice place to work. The best part of everyday is being able to work with customers. This keeps the job exciting as every interaction teaches you something new.
good,The co workers have a good  time with each other.  We would help were needed.  The some of the  management could be more helpful in there departments.
good,"had the best opportunity to grow as a person"
good,checked inventory. made sure all orders were fulfilled correctly. Set out fedex and ups packages. akn afioofo rfeof erwf oerng nnoi wenk fe 34k o jp'0-e 9  3 vfin  rlox ojrfslks
good,"decent place to work, very flexible with balancing life and work. easy and fun environment. lots of oportunity for advancement depending on manager."
good,"My typical work day consists of pulling my numbers, servicing clients and motivating my staff to drive sales up. I learned to always have a plan and never take anything personal. I enjoyed working as a leader and a team player. The hardest part of the job was keeping my staff motivated to keep my counter the number one in sales and customer service."
good,My experience at Macy's was a good one. The staff was friendly and the work environment was safe. I enjoyed working part-time as well as full-time. The only reason that I left was because when I started working full-time my work schedule began to conflict with my school schedule.
good,A typical day at work consists of me reviewing the sale for the day setting up my work station and cleaning the sales floor. I then start the process of scanning every shoe on the floor and placing and sales ticket on the items that are on sale and removing the clearance items.
good,"A good start into a career with security as well as retail, and getting to be around customers in a totally different dynamic"
good,I love working with people and you definitely do that here but on a daily basis you have to be ready for people yelling at you and doing what you do not feel right doing. What I mean is giving them the coupon even though you know that item does not work with the coupon but the managers tell you to honor it so that the customer leaves happy but if you do it then you make everyone behind that one customer want the same deal but you cannot. I really did not like how you cannot request vacation days or time off more than 48 days in advance.
good,Working at Macy's was my worst job . I never got off on time. The main managers were mean and kind of racist. we were always rushed and they always assumed we weren't working.
good,"I have learned to be very patient with others and no matter what, keep a smile on my face. That smile could go a long way in making someone's day!"
good,"apprehend external shoplifters failing to pay for merchandise."
good,The typical day at work always flew by because there was always something to do and keep busy. The employees were always friendly and willing to help.
good,"The job was OK, management were rude and hard to work with. The customers were great though. if you worked in certain departments you would receive commission."
good,A typical day at work includes unloading the truck and putting out merchandise. I learned what it takes to work in a warehouse and how to think on my feet quickly.
good,"There are so many associates have been demoted from full-time to part-time. If you are looking for a place to build your career, avoid it."
good,My experience there was okay. They where too worried about the wrong things there. They fire you for petty things like being an employee and saving too much money when purchasing items.
good,The work place was very comfortable and somewhere you could be very successful in and move up to a better position. The bonus you can receive it amazing also.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,great place to work only downfall was hours never really got a chance to work and show my qualified skills. management always felt absent when needed help
good,"The management of Macy's tries very hard.  The store manager is relatively new and still has a lot to figure out.  Communication throughout the store and to employees could use great improvement.  Working and making customers happy is such a great feeling, but sometimes they can be hard to please.  We always strive to make each customer have an enjoyable experience. I noticed, while working with other, most were not happy with their jobs."
good,"Retail hours are getting more demanding around the hoildays, ok for someone in school as a part time job.  Human resources in this store was not very helpful.  This store closed and left many people without jobs."
good,This was just a seasonal job around Christmas time to earn some extra cash. My employment with this company did not last long due to the unorganized department.
good,"I had the pleasure to worked with great people. This is a great place to start your career. I was fortunate to work in both, print and the digital side of Macy's."
good,i loved working here and helping out people if they had a question about any fragrence i picked up all the fragent names and smells fast.
good,"typical day at work is price checking merchandises / re-stock merchandises"
good,Very busy and the section where I worked was very busy. Sometimes we were understaffed and a lot of call offs. The management  put a lot of pressure to open up credits.
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in and count the registers, set up the displays around the store, and continuously rearrange shelves and merchandise."
good,A typical day at work would consist of a truck that culd have 800 peices to process one day a nd 1500 the next. There is never a certain aount of hours that are given each shift and some days the team doesn't always work as a team. There are weeks of 12 hours at the most and then weeks of 40 hours plus over-time. the biggest frustration at macy's was being unsure if I would get enough hours to pay bills. When My work schedule had me busy I would learn so much from my managers and veteran co-workers. My managers would try to teach me so much so that I could move up in position. It's most enjoyable when eveyone has good hours and are in good moods because we work well together when we're all in good moods.
good,"react with customers, and offer them the best customer service, and professional environment, and great teamwork, flexible hours"
good,"The women were great to work with,   Retail is not for everyone I didnt enjoy the retail hours.   The work was rewarding.   The discounts to employee were minuium"
good,"Most of my life i have done sales and designing jobs,  its an challenging job,"
good,Working in this company is always a typical day. because everyday u dealing with different king of people but in the good way. Because i can  use my experience as a Customer Service. U always a challenge but i enjoy it.
good,"really good place to work, very flexiable hours accomidates their employees.I was very happy there but a very long commute and i went back to school"
good,"Good salary plus bonus structure.  Poor work life balance, as hours and days could be very long.  Strong support structure.  many of the systems used were antiquated"
good,"Drove sales and profit of ""shop within a shop"" lease businesses. Managed all aspects of business, including launch and multi-store rollout, including vendor and internal team subject head collaboration to ensure seamless operations. Responsible for financial planning."
good,it was ok if you like being watched everyday like you were going to steel from them all the time. but the people were ok. but will i work there again no
good,"Learning and development our new hires and current associates is rewarding because we all understand at the end of the day, its our job for making our customer happier before they came in."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great company to work for but pay is not so great. I did learn a lot during my time here. Macy's is a risk taker which makes it exciting.
good,I meet new people from all over the world as well as corporate. I want to pursue my career as a buyer and i get to connect with different buyers for different companies as much as i can because they are normally on the selling floor.
good,It was a decent work environment but I feel that the pay was too low for what the job required. I also felt a little out of place working with people that were working to be professional sales people when I was only there for a part time job.
good,packing customers all night by using paper voice. The hard part about this job was really nothing. I had experience in this type industry. I like working with my supervisor
good,"I don't think there is a typical day at Macy's i could walk into a perfectly clean department or a department that looked like a tornado ran through it, but what i learned was to expect the unexpected. The management at Macy's was very supportive especially when it came to irate customers, and to customer satisfaction. My co-workers and i all worked together as a team and we all managed to get things done in a professional and orderly fashion. The hardest part pf this job would be around the holidays when the fitting rooms would be out of control with clothes and customers leaving their garbage behind, but that was over ridden by the joy that i got out of being able to give  outstanding customer service to all the customers that came to my department as well as forming relationships with the regular customers."
good,Macys could be a great place to work if they could work toward consistent goals instead of changing their plan every six months to one year.
good,"As an employee of Macy's inc., there are factors that will contribute to your satisfaction and success as an active associate within the store. Being able to manage the several department tasks are easily done, as long as there are hours set in the schedule for such tasks. When the easy tasks become difficult to finish, because the lack of time allocated for the tasks, the impact is shown in the ability to provide full sales service to customers. Specially when you hold a commissions position, such as myself."
good,The job was very easy and repetitive. There was a lot of organization and tagging... it was a job. I really don't have much to say about it. Pretty straightforward and easy to understand.
good,"There is always allot to get done.  So you are never bored or just standing around.  Always some project to get done. "
good,Different experience. liked working there for my time i was there due to seasonal position. Very fast paced environment but not that bad
good,"Macy's was a very fun workplace were learning was an everyday occurrence. Though work/life balance was not there, I was willing to put up more work hours to place myself into opportunities and groups for elite managers. The one thing I could not withstand was the excessive micro-management. At times it felt as if we were treated and expected to treat our employees like kids."
good,As a seasonal employee schedule is always in the busiest time of the days. I've learned to deal with irate customers and solve the issue. The fun part is dealing with different people every day.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of counting my register at the start and end of every shift. Collect clothing from the fitting room and putting them back in the correct areas of my department. Also maintaining a clean and organized sales floor. I learned how to make sales tags for merchandise and how to use the computer to locate and order items for the customer. The coworkers where very nice and helpful whenever I had any questions on anything. The hardest part of my job was organizing the stock room. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help assist the customer with finding a certain item they saw online, or in another store."
good,"Seasonal Recovery Supervisor – Inventory Management, Plan and recover according to business needs, I enjoyed the company the second time around."
good,Answering phones is the main part of this job to do it correctly the phone and computers should work properly. I learned that you have to know people in management or be a very good suck up to move up in this job.The co- workers are the best part of the job because everyone helps each other since management thinks you should hit the floor running. The hardest part of this job is the constant computer glitches and learning what the policies and procedures are. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home after your shift and relaxing.
good,"-Assisting customers in all aspects of service fulfillment by demonstrating proficient use of proprietary devices and applications; proactively create enhanced shopping experiences through the heightened use of tools, technology and collaboration (In store and/or on the phone)"
good,I think that my co-workers are wonderful people and they are driven. I think that some of the management is very good and they are going through some much needed changes. I do think that the head management can be a little better at caring for their employees. Too many of my co-workers are over worked and under payed for their services. We work hard because we have a passion for what we do. The customers deserve a good experience and it is hard to make that happen when all the pieces to the puzzle are not all there.
good,"•    Elaboration du cahier de charges des fournisseurs selon les besoins   ( Sur + de 3000 références )"
good,it was fun getting to know customers as weel as co-workers. I learned customer service skills. I enjoyed getting to work in the junior's department.
good,"It was nice in the beginning, but then hours started to get cut and I was only working one day a week. I appreciate everything I've learned while working there, but they simply aren't making the sales that they're supposed to. It's sad, cause I do want the store to succeed but I think the location plays a big role in how well a business does. This Macy's isn't really located near anything special and it needs updating. There is also too much stock coming in and nowhere to put it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Good place to work fair but not great, benefits and sub par compensation. Work life balance was a struggle because of daily workload and under staffed facility."
good,"it was a okay place to work. communication there was an mess, which made doing my job a bit complicated. supervisors would all be doing something different and telling people to do things other than what the other said for us to do."
good,"Was a seasonal job, loved it for the season, wouldn't mind working full time if the job offered more salary! Would work again"
good,The job was unsupervised. I would work in different departments each day. I assisted customers in their shopping and rung customers up as well as restocking merchandise.
good,"i love meeting the people from around the world, I gained life long friendships, the work is satisfying, not hard. everyone gets along."
good,"Typical day was long a few makeovers, and busy."
good,first day i learned how to put clothes back i also leaned the cash register i learned that when you start a conversation with the customers and get to know a little bout what they like it easier to find what they want or looking for the hardest part was not knowing the person it was good at the end what i enjoyed most was making the customers happy in finding what they need/wanted
good,"My experience working at Macy's was quite interesting. I had to call to see when I could start working and I had to make my own schedule for the first two weeks. I feel as if they are unorganized, employees are under trained, and under paid for all that they do for the company"
good,But as soon as they dont need you they give you the boot. Couul not advance when wanted only if they need it but as long as you stay quiet and reach your goals you have a job.
good,Great places to work and works well with my school schedule. Easy work flow nothing crazy. Some rude customers but other then that this job was great.
good,"It was a decent place to work, i worked her over 8 years ago so i'm sure much has changed. When i worked here it was an easy going environment, schedule was pretty flexible and management was relaxed."
good,"Macy's is a great place for  a person seeking work experience. Macy's has a dynamic work environment, everyday can be different, even though you might have one title there are many opportunities for you to be a helping hand in many departments of the company. Working together is extremely important for customer satisfaction, so whilst working in a team you become very close to your co-workers which makes working at Macy's enjoyable. Management at Macy's is always helpful and always open to new ideas.The hardest part of the job would be consistency with company policies, which is often a problem and many large company's. The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's is being able to meet and connect with many different people."
good,"Inbound call center for Macy's and Bloomingdale's, allowing me provides sales and customers service to current and potential customers."
good,"Some days are fast paced and other days slow. I learned how patient I can really be with customers who are irate, and not sure what they are looking for, and finding exactly what they are looking for. Management is always available. My co-workers were like family and we had fun outside of work. Hardest part of job is explaining to customers that the coupon does not apply to fragrances and cosmetics. Most enjoyable part is helping customers find just what they wanted."
good,macys is pretty decent . management is pretty wishy washy but that is basically the only negitive thing i have to say about it.other than that its awesome
good,I work a five hour shift. Three days a week. Part Time. The Merchandise is unloaded from the trailer on a conveyor belt. I take the merchandise out of the box. Place it in the assigned area. I do not take the merchandise out on the sales floor. That is another department.
good,"Good company culture but poor training which led to high turnover rate. Not too much opportunity for upward mobility, mainly for temporary work."
good,"fast paced environment. many different scenarios, problems and challenges however, senior management staff and senior sales associates are  responsive, knowledgeable and customer focused. Nice place to work."
good,Nice company just beware of all managers and the people that lie in wait to get your spot. Otherwise nice company to work for.
good,"On any given day you may be required to perform several task that will enable to company to have a productive day in sales, customer service, credit results and overall standards of the store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was a seasonal hire in one of the human resources departments. It was a great opportunity for me to get experience in HR interviewing candidates who were applying for seasonal positions. The duties of the job were not extremely difficult, however in the peak of the season the work load was constant and kept me tied to my desk all day. The management was extremely understanding in regards to the volume of work that came through our department and I never felt pressure to move or work at a rate that was faster than what I was capable of in order to properly do my job. I was able to keep up with the volume and eventually get things accomplished that were expected of me. "
good,"Solid retailer with great people, experts in brick and mortar.  Solid work life balance, benefits and store discount.  Classic department store internal environment."
good,"I worked at macy's for almost a year and it was an awesome year i loved working there but its time for me to move on. try to find a better paying job to support my family, they don't pay very well but thats expected i was only a sales associate."
good,This job was good if you want a job to work nights and weekends. Good work experience. Lots of different departments to work for.
good,"Good company. The work however is very repetitive and gets boring fairly easily. You are hardly challenged, but i guess that is the nature of the job itself. The pay is extremely low (personally, I don't think it's worth it). There is also no special employee discount. You only get ""discount' associated with your Macy's Card which is not different from any Macy's customer who has a Macy's Card."
good,"Relatively simple working in stock. Co-workers were enjoyable people, which would probably be my favorite part of the job.I learned that there are different types of stores which makes me conscious of what types of stores I shop at. I think the hardest part of the job would be trying to put full clothe racks into stock rooms especially during the holiday season."
good,Had lots of fun working there people were great. i learned a lot and it is a great place to work. a very very friendly environment.
good,salary positions require lots of extra hours and weekends but great for retail. able to advance quickly if work hard you will need to be flexible
good,Would have been a better place to work if the store manager wasn't working there. Overall I did enjoy the coworkers and regular sales managers that I worked with
good,"Although the job doesn't provide much in the way of monetary benefits, it does give the strong chance of instilling a sense of team-work to every single employee, during the course of the workday. Many related assignments at the retail store were accomplished with the help of another team player, and probably would not be accomplished as readily, without this pertinent aspect, during the busier holiday season."
good,While working at Macy's I've come to find out that they are all about money and care very little about employee relations. They always pit employees against each other which causes so much division between them. When one employee feels that their job is threatened by a new person they will do what it takes to get you out of there. Management is very bias towards certain people and don't give you a fair chance.
good,"awesome management great coworkers. fun to work if you like hard work, behind the scenes work is better than on the sales floor. great lunch hour,"
good,Productive workplace where team building exercises are key to getting ahead and key to taking initiative when working on solo projects salary was good environment was good hours not so good
good,"At this job you are in control of your advancement and growth. The work environment can be full of pressure to achieve certain expectations that make you look good, but make your managers look great. Their(management's) relationship with you ultimately depends on how good you can make them look in the eyes of their managers. You must have the ability to remain calm and level headed under pressure and to multitask in a semi chaotic environment. The co workers for the most part are nice and great to work with."
good,"best part getting paid every week"
good,"Working at Macy's was always interesting, never a boring day. Always had something to do and customers always kept you entertained."
good,good work environment. Though co-workers are not that friendly. helping costumers is enjoyable part .there is no good benefits for associates.
good,"nice place to work, lots of meal based incentives.  bosses are tough but fair  will work around schedule conflicts with other"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Communication was very poor. There was no sense of direction and it seemed like everyone had a chip on their shoulder. The people made the job not so enjoyable.
good,Job was fine for a seasonal job nothing stands out co workers were fine as were the mangers. Small hours had to be very flexible and sell the credit line
good,"The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with customers"
good,"This company is great to work for, compensation is better than other retail stores. This company hires you for a certain job and then you end up doing a million other things. I was hired on as merch, within two months I was helping with signing and sales. "
good,"Macy's is a big Retail store that sells anything from Clothing, Jewelries, Shoes, Coats. During the Seasonal time it gets very busy and Customers come in to get what they want before they leave the store and it's your job as a Sales Associate to help them with that. Sometimes it gets less busy but after a certain hour or so , the pace starts to pick up and more customers comes in the store, you can see yourself helping up to four customers at once maybe because no other Associate is in site. I enjoy my job because the customers are quite nice and when they come in and their needs are met , they feel more relax and most time I try to engage in talking to the customers which I find fun at times and I enjoy that aspect."
good,"I liked working at Macys because it taught me to be very organized myself, whether its with my clothing or in my everyday life. The job scene was very busy and I love working under pressure because its challenging and it brings out the best of me."
good,"the hours were long and the managers didnt want to listen to what you had to say if you had a problem, they were rude as well as my coworkers,"
good,"I was hired at the same time as the seasonals, they call me part time.. still not sure if they plan on letting me go at the end of the year. I heard they do that to a bunch of people. I have been asking them to switch departments after this quarter but they have been avoiding answering me. They train you on how to ring people up but no info on what your department is. That is my issue with where I am now."
good,"In this organization you will have to learn how to deal with customers from all backgrounds. "
good,It is a good job with wonderful pay rates. The only issue was that chances of advancement and growth within the company is just not there. It really is only a temporary job.
good,Working during the holiday season at a retail store you are faced with many challenges. Keeping a clean work area is a must but you also have to be able to multitask and help customers while keeping an eye on your area making sure everything is presentable.
good,"the management team was horrible. Everyday i would come into work and placed in a completely different area in which i was not trained. I like the fact of learning on the spot but If things got backed up it would automatically be my fault. There was never any organization and I feel everything I learned, such as resistance, customer service and diligence were self taught. I did most of my learning on the floor, It helped me become a better listener and became more diligent. The only way for me to succeed there was to learn in my own."
good,"Very fast pace environment, always new products to learn about and show your customers. Helps you stay up to date on all the newest cosmetics trends."
good,"good place to work, the sales team I worked with were rude and called me names. managers did nothing. I enjoyed the customers and provided good customer service."
good,"with my amazing co workers life at macys would have been horrible. the customers are rude and expect what's beyond your job duties, but its customer service so its not surprising. depending on what manager and department you work with the job COULD be pleasant but after a year I couldn't stand the place. overall an ok place to work if you don't mind customer service which I love, but the job gets really boring after a while."
good,"The job was simple, but tiring at times. It was hard to keep up on where things went when they changed the floors so often. The people were nice to work with and I also went out of my way to learn how to do the register so I could help in different departments when they needed me."
good,"Good company to work for great discounts, great work/home balance. not bad. this is good for a part-time job. Great co-workers and lot of working with out supervision."
good,Macys is a good place to work. They have a lot of fun celebrating the different holidays. They are a little strict depending on which area you work in...
good,"i've worked here twice and it's consistently the same big hiring during the holiday and such. it's usually standard minimum wage."
good,I worked there and was instantly asked to stay on after a holiday position was where I started. I was moved to a different department where I would have risen higher up but was offered other employment because I was starting college.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Environment was too competitive between departments and I did not enjoy being on the phones all day. My trainer was great, answered my questions, but overall it was not the place for me."
good,"Life as a Sale's Associate for Macy's; long work hours, constant supervision, client sales and very goal oriented associates and mangers."
good,"Macy's is good for college students because they definitely work around your schedule. If you like to stay busy, work in the women's department or even men's. If you just like selling , I'd definitely get a job in center core."
good,Too many task to do not enough help. NOT helpful management. Teamwork is ok a lot still cant be accomplished because its so much to do.
good,Diverse enviroment.  Good employee benefits.  Fun place to work.  good employee discounts and sales.  Opportunities for growth
good,"They don't pay on time but the pay is great"
good,a great company to work for............. hard workers Ive learned to make sure customer are always happy. there's nothing more to say about this company at this time
good,Worked with great people and learned about the fashion culture. Did this job because I wanted to try something for the holiday season.
good,I made alot of lifelong friends. My over all experience was good for a job right out of school but definitely not a job I would hold as a career. Standards were extremely high and caused a lot of anxiety on workers. I enjoyed my experience with coworkers and customers as you create friends and clientele.
good,An overall fun place to work.  Local senior level management was enjoyable to work for and with.  The best part of my job here was meeting and engaging my team on the floor of the distribution center.  The hardest part of my job was learning to navigate the normal politics that you would expect from a company this size.
good,"My typical work day is about8-10 hours long. I work the dock where we receive the trucks weekly. I am also responsible for making sure that the dock is neat, clean and organized."
good,"Macy's keeps a pretty positive attitude and likes to give back to the world but employees are sometimes left in the dark. There are always new sales that entice you. They offer full benefits and 401k and also have a charitable program that allows employees the option to donate any amount to any charity of choice through their paychecks which is a beautiful thing."
good,"Company does a good job of trying to stay relevant in an ever changing environment.  Overall a good experience.  Fast paced, good benefits, great discount.  Worked with passionate, talented group of people."
good,"Obtaining the role of an Lancome Beauty Advisor, I assisted clientele with luxury cosmetics and skin care along with make up application."
good,"Fast pace environment, challenging yet very humbling. The hardest part was trying to help every one during the holiday season."
good,i like to work at macys because its very flexible and friendly area to work in and the team work is nice but the management have some problem with the employees and its hard to work with them
good,great job.  nice place to work.  had a pleasurable experience working for Macys.  Great work life balance for executives but very demanding at times especially during holiday season.
good,Good management. Solid business practices. Overall good place to work. Low potential for advancement and it is tough to have good work-life balance at times.
good,"I was originally employed as a call center representative in Brooklyn, NY for about two years. During that time I got to talk by phone to store personnel in different parts of the country. I was also able to use my Spanish skills to help store customers with their various issues. I was laid off but was able to get re-hired at Herald Square because of all the networking I did over the phone as a rep. At Herald Square I worked in the building operations office as an admin. clerk. I worked with all the different shop people that also worked in the store: electricians, painters, plumbers, carpenters etc. and I dispatched them as needed to make repairs in the store. I loved that there was never a dull moment. The job was always busy."
good,"A lot of great people to work with, nice selection of merchandise, training is okay, not a large enough store, and schedule is flexible."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,My most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers always so happy and cheerful to help anyone that needed any type of help
good,"As a excited worker, this job provided me with a chance to interact with customers. I was able to provide customers with things that fit there every needs."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but the pay is low, there are no benefits, and the way the schedule works, it's hard to plan anything in advance.  However, the co-workers are mostly very nice, management is mostly pleasant and helpful, and there is quite a bit of flexibility in changing shifts if needed."
good,easy job that pay rate sucks. Long hours on your feet. The good thing is your little bonus you get. Other wise unless your 16 or 60 this job sucks.
good,Macy's is a great place to learn and grow but the company ideals were not always put into place. Long hours and little benefits from them.
good,"Workplace is very organized and very friendly. Customer service is a must. Enviroment is a fast pace and team work was a must. No complaints, job was fun but at the same loved to work."
good,I have to reserve my comments due to the fact that I still have friends who are still employed there. I do not regret working for this company I was able to move up.
good,"Macy's could be worse, and your work experience will directly correlate to the talent of your manager. A bad manager can ruin your experience. A good one can make your day."
good,"My experience from my location could vary greatly from the next location. At the location that I worked, the management was full of micromanagers that made you feel very uncomfortable when they came around. The atmosphere and rapport I maintained with the other associates was the bearable aspect of the job. My coworkers were generally very nice and I liked coming to work to be around them. The pay as a commissioned shoe sales professional was decent for a college student."
good,A lot of people to answer to. Policy kept changing. Love working with cosmetics. Hours were very long. Great discount.Love my coworkers.Good experience with client cultivating.
good,A typical day at work would consist of dealing with all the new hire paper work and inputting it into the system. I would also run a couple of errands or help where ever they needed extra help. I learned about leadership skills and problem solving.
good,"Depending at what time you come in to work, your day may be a fast day or a really slow day. But when days are really busy the time fly bye.You'll learned how to fold clothes and a lot about certain brands.And most of your co-worker will be friendly and willing to help you out."
good,I enjoy working at macys. I communicate with customers helping them find the right shoes to make them happy.Everyday i learn something new that makes me become a better sales associate.
good,the jobs they had you do was fair and understanding but the managers are not good they discuss your personal info with others and dont listen to your problems nor take action when needed
good,"Typical day at work: Maintain a clean area, making sure clothes were hung up on the correct display racks. Rang up customers purchases, signed up for credit if desired. Drop cash registers deposit at customer service nightly"
good,Great employee discount. A decent place to gain retail experience and product knowledge. Flexible hours. Good point system in regards to attendance. Questionable PTO and credit account incentives that management pushes on the employees.
good,Lots of great opportunities for new entries in global health. Fast paced but management can be understanding. The pay is not great but the network makes up for it.
good,A typical day consisted of many customer interactions. Opening shift required daily job duties also knowing what events for the day are going on. If people called out it's really on you to handle several customers or problems at once. I was challenged but handled stressful situations very well as I can think out of the box when a manager was not around. I really enjoyed selling MEN'S Suits and accessories with the interaction with clients. My co workers were always enjoyable to work besides and most of them looked out for each other on the selling floor. Management was fair most of the time and my best department manager was very good at recognizing any accomplishment on the selling floor. I learned how to prioritize time so I could benefit on more commissions. The most enjoyable part of this job was client interactions with the selling of MEN'S Suits and accessories that created lasting return business relationships.
good,I really enjoyed this job because it allowed me to interact with customers on a daily basis. Day in and day out I was able to establish connections with customers to help them with their needs.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I don't like how a lot of employees really didn't have any cosmetics experience. Lack of communication employees not trying to approach customers. Some employees being unprofessional on the clock and around customers. Overall the only good thing is customers really nice and talkative.
good,At work everyday everything is in a fast pace. I like that i switch to different areas certain days because it helps me not think about the time
good,"There are no typical days. Every day is very different. A lot of meetings, not always productive. A lot of opportunities to learn through HR facilitated management classes to educational workshops in excel or illustrator. Very talented design teams which are not always given the respect they deserve. Support teams are not given the support or recognition they deserve. Overall a good work life balance. Attempts to encourage team engagement. Because of multiple internal brands with different identities and price points there are a lot of challenges in design and sourcing. Opportunities to work with many different people. Big organization that does not always know or appreciate the work you do."
good,Macys is a company that strives for excellence and exceptional customer service with MAGIC selling. You must be assertive and resourceful to be successful.
good,Terrible management team who did not communicate with associates in department and felt like they didn't want to be around
good,"very interactive  proactive and fun place good environment  to work at and provided good co management and cool meeting new people everyday,"
good,"The team changes on a regular basis but it is generally due to promotions. This company does offer a lot of opportunity to grow. "
good,i had a great time working at macys  the staff was great all the way up to the top i learned alot about customer service and how to deal with people during an purches
good,"My day began with rally meetings.  Starting the day with accuracy count in cash registers responsible for, greeting customers, directing customers to purpose for visits, stylist, meeting proprietary promotion of products' goals, assisting customers with their purchases, finalizing customers' purchases.  Retrieving and restocking products' locations."
good,It's a good place overall. It's a stepping stone in the department store field. You have to have plenty patience and love working with the public.
good,great retirement job for the golden years if you can handle standing on your feet all day. great benefit package to add to medicare
good,"Great company for advancement however for new hirees in the field of Loss Prevention Management and up could use a little more  organization in terms of training. However once the ""ball gets rolling"" the opportunity is there."
good,Good people one of the best loss prevention jobs I had. We had apprehend someone with a gun one time it was crazy. But after everything we go through we only got paid 10 - 11 bucks not worth getting shot for that much money (Antioch CA)
good,"A great pleasure to be helpful and get whatever the customer needs to make them happy.  The hours can be crazy, especially at the holidays, but expected when you work retail.  I do with some great people that I would call friends for life."
good,"fast paced most of the time."
good,"Come in the morning, clean up.  Get ready for customers and making sure all dressing rooms are clean. I ahve worked in many depts. Thre and on my other jobs."
good,I enjoy helping my customers with shoes that will fit their needs and wants. I enjoy hearing their stories of what they will be wearing their shoes for and what outfits they will wear the shoes with.
good,able to pick your own shifts and switch with other associates with ease with online shift scheduling. wide variety of coworkers. standing for long hours. lots of down time with no customers in section.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,it was overall a cool job it was very relaxing and i had no problems with the job but im glad i got out sooner than i had planned
good,"Managers dont really take time to really get to know their employees and theres little to no communications with fellow co-workers. other than that, the place runs efficient and can be a great place to start."
good,"I wasn't there for to long, just long enough for seasonal work. All I did was clean the store by picking up all the clothes on the ground and folding the disturbed clothes on the shelf while helping the usual  customer with there needs."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal part-time worker, but found difficulties with this job as soon as I started it. It was difficult to do availability for scheduling because it was automated, and since it was the seasonal hiring time, there were 120 extra employees for the managers to deal with, and I almost never had hours that didn't coincide with my college classes. During a typical day at work, I would ring up customers, assist customers around the home wares section to find products, and I would make sure that the displays were organized and clean, which mostly involved folding towels. I learned how to use a Point of Sale system, how to empty the cash register at the end of the day, look up items for customers in the data-base and the company website, and how to ring customers up, as well as the different procedures for different forms of payment. The management was almost impossible to find most of the time, but they were pretty friendly, when customers were around. My co-workers were fellow students and we would usually be overstaffed so we would talk during lulls in the crowd. The hardest part of the job was trying to get hours that worked with my school schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find products to furnish their homes, and when nice customers would comment on your hard work."
good,"Sales goals, make connection with customers, ask open-ended questions, maintain sales floor, open and close cash registers, open credit card applications and process payments"
good,It helps me how to manage my time and deal to every different people. be patience and do costumer service as a priority.  Good workplace that I am able to grow and learn.
good,Routine job just to make some money while i was still in college. I worked helping customers. I worked in the womens shoes department.
good,macy's is ok but they need to be able to work with scheduling according to ones availability. they also need to give better incentives to their employees
good,"	Coordinated with company reps for product purchasing and floor displays"
good,"Growing customer-centic company"
good,"Makes good numbers. Most of the sales associates does not clean up after themselves"
good,Macy's was a good place to work. I learned a lot of cash handling skills and customer service skills. I also had the opportunity to better understand the importance of organization and accurate inventories in a retail environment.
good,"typical day sucks"
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time in retail, especially women shoes, management was fine and co-workers were great.. shoes now that was just pure heaven"
good,I have learned that in order to provide good customer service you have to be patient and have good communication skills. Working in retail has helped me learn to multitask.The hardest part of the job is working fast and efficiently during big sales days in order to provide quality customer service.
good,"There are not opportunity to grow and there are not increase or there are too small amount"
good,"A typical day working with kids would consist of making sure there work was done, taking them to the bathroom, making sure their work area was clean, and making sure all their work was complete."
good,Great experience not to much opportunity for grow company is overall a good place to work. I met my goals daily. I loved to have the opportunity to work with the public.
good,was a season hire in the cosmetic and fragrances department . Floated from different areas of the store to aid in any assistance needed from me while I was employed for the holiday
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Hours were not the greatest. Wasn't very much organization as to what was going on. Typical day was waiting for the managers to tell us what needed to go where and how they wanted things set up.
good,In charge of the entire look of the department store. Lead a visual team but also oversaw merchandising team and selling team. I learned not to take things personally and that we're all in it for the same results. The hardest part of the job is inconsistencies with upper management and keeping everyone happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching customers respond to my setups.
good,"Pretty flexible scheduling, you pick up most of your own shifts, however sometimes very few are available to pick up. Hours vary a lot - some weeks you'll get 30 and some weeks you'll get 7 as part time."
good,"Days at work were good, lots to do. Mostly good customers."
good,"A good first sales position for me. But, sometimes i felt more like a slave with demands place on us from management. I did enjoy the 20% employee discount."
good,Macys is such a great fun place to work. Compensation wasn't the greatest but that's to be expected in retail. Especially in a large department store.
good,do not wish to provide.  They support the Christmas season.  they have a wonderful parade. they have cookouts and a firework display every year.
good,"ok, not enough hours. the cons of being a flex associate is that you never really know when work will be available. You have to log on to the company website to check for shifts. which they never have!!"
good,"Busy store to work in specially in the middle of Herald Square, I meet a lot of individuals and friends working in this company."
good,"A typical Day at Macy's is bringing out new merchandise and fit it in with older merchandise, making new merchandise prominent. I learned about visual factors on how fixtures match and have same height to achieve a flow throughout the department. I also learned how to manage my time working with several projects a day on my own and with a partner. My co-workers are very hard working, responsible people who care about each other. We are almost like family. If any of us are finished with a project, we help one another with theirs. The hardest part of this job was obtaining  more hours on a weekly basis. The most enjoyable part of this job was to work in a fun, up-beat environment with enjoyable people."
good,"fast paced"
good,"Working at Macy's can be both fun and not fun. On the one hand, you could have a great day where the customers are friendly, business is steady, and you manage to make your sales goal. On the other hand, business could be slow and managers come down to check on you, and try to motivate you to sell to... no one. So a day at Macy's can be a fun, fast-paced experience, or, it can be a slow grind with impossible expectations that you, personally, are expected to be responsible for."
good,"some of the management wasn't so good, the job was very stressful, they pushed us a lot when we couldn't make sells knowing the day was slow"
good,A typical day at this workplace would start by unloading the first delivery truck and followed by wrapping furniture thats set to be delivered.Following those task there's about 75-100 pieces of furniture to be located and sorted out.This task allowed me to learn how to use a scan gun for the first time.You really don't get involved with co-workers unless physical help is needed everyone is focus on their assignment.The hardest part of the job would be wrapping fragile pieces of merchandise and the most enjoyable would be the management.
good,I had to help customers find what they want and open/work the registers. I also helped keep merchandise clean and help meet sales goals.
good,"its a good job for people who looking for first time or part time"
good,Nice and safe environment to work at with good staff. Working for a nation wide company recognize department with high quality item and equipments for any customer needs makes it a better place to work at. While working there I've learned to adopt at to a fast pace working environment. Providing great customer service with the variety of items in the store from home department to office department to customers is the best part of the job.
good,"it was an okay job, you help sales associate strive to meet their goal and basically run around trying to help the employees or the customers."
good,This job requires you to be proactive and a people person. Commission is the only way you will make any real money in retail.
good,lovely place to work. very work friendly atmosphere. Nice company they care about their employees. Learned to have patient with customers and how to satisfy the costumers
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I would walk in @ 6am would greet the Receiving Team @630am would gather the team to go over weekly forecast of workload and any issues pending then i would walk with each one to ensure they understood the objective of what we need to complete that day. 630am -11am we unloaded a 53ft 13inch merchandise trailer then from 11am - 2pm we would process and bounce back the dock to have it organized and ready for the next day staff also helped in delivering supplies to the store or mail and as well as helping ship merchandise to customers.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Macy's. My coworkers were welcoming and supportive. I felt like I was trained very well. I do wish that the breaks were a little longer.
good,typical day at work is cleaning and making sure we are meeting the customers needs. i learned how to look up things for a customer and show them how they can order things themselves and pick it up from the store sometimes the same day. my co workers are very helpful and we are a team. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting the department clean and meeting our goals.
good,Overall Macy's is a decent work place. On a busy day it is sometimes overwhelming but for the most part it is not too much to handle.
good,"Macy's was my first job and it has given me a lot of experience and I feel as though I've learned a lot. I have enjoy working with the associates that I do, and I am extremely grateful to have a job that while not always enjoyable, it still can be fun and I can look forward to going in to work."
good,I enjoyed the time that I worked here. I learned a lot about credit cards and customer service. However I had to end my employment because they were not flexible with scheduling.
good,"frantically running about on a daily basis trying to meet company goals (its all about the numbers) though very stressful at times there is never a dull moment.  Everyday I learn something new in regards as to how this 3 story machine maintains functionality and what all the numbers stand for. with over 200 employees all working in the same fashion you never feel on your own, the essence of ""teamwork"" has never been so exemplified in any other job i have held. working here you really do feel like you matter. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is meeting company percentage goals on a daily basis but at the same time its what drives me to be the best everyday, there is no feelings of ""i give up"" when everyone around you is pushing just as hard or harder"
good,"days at work could vary depending on the holiday. i learned that you need to keep moving even on slow days. Management was ok the leads tried too hard to ""lead"". co-workers are very diverse, super cool and easy to work with. hardest part was trying to get as much shoes as you could to deliver ( I worked stock in women's shoes dept) most enjoyable was the days we could dress up out of uniform on holidays."
good,"The managers are friendly, however they struggle in giving their employees hours. On-call employees will not receive benefits due to them not being full-time. I am not sure about part-time employees."
good,Program focused on sales associate development. Would have liked to learn more about the business in general. Get exposure to higher level senior executives.
good,I enjoy working in Cosmetics and Fragrances the rest if the departments are blah! Mangament was nice compensation was not equal to job responisblities.
good,"Assisting customers with certain shoes. Once a customer would like a specific shoe(s), I would cash them out at the cash register."
good,You have to learn things quickly or be left behind and they thrown you into duties you may nto be prepared for and have to think quick on your feet.
good,Fun workplace with supportive coworkers and managers. Loved interacting with customers and being able to assist them with their shopping needs.
good,"Macy's is a good company to work for. Especially for individuals looking for a flexable schedule. The three areas to work are; Sales, Support, and executive Office. Each division has it own benefits and issues."
good,"A typical day at Macy's was nice and easy. I learned how department store run their business , for example their holiday pre sales and how their Macy's credit card works. During holiday pre sales it's very business from the holiday rush and recovery. You have to have a lot of patience's and be willing to stand for a long pre of hours while satisfying the customer's as well. I met a lot of humble people while working at Macy's. My co-workers made me feel welcome and that help me learn new things about the department. The hardest part about working at Macy's was Recovery. Recovery is when you place items in different departments and making sure that you don't get lost in the stock room while doing recovery. The most enjoyable day about working at Macy's was getting to know my co-workers better."
good,"Working at Macys is very demanding and stressful.   Daily goals are set and high expectations by management.  Co-workers are immature which adds to the stress.  Hardest part of the job is working with associates who does not have good work ethics. "
good,I hated working there because of the people. They weren't friendly. They don' t know how to treat there employees. They made me feel so uncomortable.
good,"MACY*S is a solid retail giant. Having worked here during an impacted holiday season, I learned the need to provide accurate, speedy, and reliable customer service in a calm, friendly manner. While working in the gift wrap department, I received adequate training to work in a demanding environment. I experienced patient and uncompromising customers and was reminded to follow the company's business practice. I learned the value of communication, eye-contact, and that every sale is a reflection of good service provided as well as trusted merchandise."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Nice first job. Nice way to interact with a lot of people being that Macy's is attached to a mall. Fun environment and just like any retail job it can be a bit overwhelming/stressful. Management can be a bit much at times (micromanagement).
good,"Even though I only worked for Macy's for only three months, the job was very fun. I was able to help customer pick out clothes and make them feel better about themselves."
good,You get what you put into it. I was one of the regional top sellers. A lot of hard work and you must work many weekends. Flexible hours are great
good,"A typical day at work is unloading stock trucks, pricing and tagging merchandise to be ready to be put on the sales floor. I learned how to use their updated scanning devices to search and find prices for merchandise. It was a lack off communication with their management system and me , because I expressed that I needed more hours but my feelings and thought was not even acknowledged . My co-workers were willing to work with me to get out work task done . There was not any hard part of the it was all memory and basic knowledge. The most enjoyable part was helping assist customer."
good,"Macy's does not pay well but it was close to the college.  It worked out well with my schedule in school. New management need a lot of improvement.  They have favoritism and drama in every department.  The down side is having customers to apply for credit. This island is small, most of them already have Macy's credit card. Enjoyable part about working at Macy's, working with nice people."
good,delivered furniture all day. made great moneys including tips but worked to many hours. i resigned from where because of the work hours.
good,"The best part about this job is that the shifts in the morning are fast paced and after you clock out you got the rest of the day for yourself."
good,"At first I thought it was complicated but as i got used to it I started to enjoy it. A typical day would always be busy because we were on 34th street. So yeah, no down time for me but its alright. Time passed fast. Management was cool. They were'nt pushovers and they weren't super bossy. They were perfect."
good,"I mean to each its own. I dont hate retail, macy's just wasnt it. My manager hardly ever showed up. I was stuck doing visual merchandising and this had been my first job ever. Its tough maybe a different retail store for beginners."
good,It was a challenging job with a little too much politics.  My coworkers were great but sometime management left a little to be desired
good,"Macy's stayed very busy, and there was always work to be done. At times you could get over whelmed working one or two departments on your on , and also have a hard time finding help. I learned that you just have to be prepared on whats to come because you never know if someone decides not to come to work or to call off. Management was a little harsh , they expected more than even themselves could produce."
good,My day consisted of unpacking clothing tagging them and taking them up to the sales floor. My co-workers made work more fun.It was an easy job but difficult to get more hours.
good,"Working for Macys has taught me the value of great communication skills and what its like to work in retail.  Interacting with customers on a daily basis has taught me to be a better listener, to be more patient, and understanding.  Management always pushes you to do your best. They push us to aim for sales goals on a daily basis, while upholding Mays' standards of customer service.  Co-workers are welcoming and trained to know their product knowledge."
good,it was fun helping customers find what they need. I love fashion so I was very good at that. also letting them know about the great deals macys have and seeing their smiles. it was very productive also.
good,"If you start off as an associate your will have to commit time, effort and learn your way into store politics. MUST have drive and show full interest in department assigned."
good,"Macys  is all over the place, constantly changing and job security is rare, there are certain people there that are nice and very helpful others are worse"
good,I appreciate all the skills that I have acquired and respect the experience that Macy's provided. It truly makes me an irreplaceable asset.
good,Started off with morning meeting before 6 am and from there immediately on the floor changing signs for the current sale. there are many signs and fixtures that must be changed and if there is no proper must be printed and changed before the opening of the store. mostly part time work 12 hours a week unless there was help need on the dock unloading trucks and moving stock to the floor and stock rooms. hardest part of the job was getting the entire home goods section signed correctly within 4 hours solo.
good,"Waited on customers, stocked shelves, rang up sales.  Very busy at times at Tyson's Corner Mall.  Only seasonal employment so worked long hours but only for 2 1/2 months job."
good,"worked in a friendly, fun environment with staff members and customers. I looked forward to going to work. I learned how to multi-task in a fast paced environment."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is growing fast and doing exciting things to become omnichannel. We are in the midst of connect the ""bricks and clicks"" and it's a very exciting to be a part of the company. It is very fast paced but there is always a new challenge or something new to learn."
good,"I had a great management experience working for Macy's. It's a fast paced environment that requires you to be able to think and react quickly. I find that this is a typical environment with sales and retail as these environments change quickly. If sales is your thing, this might be an excellent position for you!"
good,"Working at Macv's was full of fun. If you worked in the morning you get to experience the morning rallies that they provide. Macy's helped me with professionalism and learning that having patients is a virtue. My co-workers were diverse and some were older co workers, that gave me even more excitement to all my work days."
good,It was a very nice working environment. I enjoyed interacting with my co-workers and customers. Every once in a while i would get an upset customer but i would always find a way to fix the situation in such a way that was satisfactory to the store and to the customer  Overall it was a pleasant experience
good,"i honestly have to say my co-workers are really nice, polite, fun and helpful associates. but unfortunately our business is slow and the mall seems to close."
good,"A typical day at work consists of being friendly to customers, promoting sales, helping customers find what they are looking for, and making sure they leave happy. I learned how to deal with a  variety of human emotion and that good management is essential in tough situations.The hardest part of the job is keeping your head up after dealing with a tough customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is human interaction, and the feeling you get when you successfully help a customer and make them happy, as well as making that connection with them on a personal level."
good,"My usual day working part time consisted of short 3 or 4 hours shifts.This was helpful while still going to school. I learned a lot about retail and business as well interpersonal skills. Management was one of the reasons why I left. There was not enough communication between the associates and the manager. Holiday time, Thanksgiving and Christmas, were the worst. I did meet some great people while working at Macy's and I got experience in a new field of work."
good,"Working as a team and productivity is very important. There is a time frame that the work has to be completed due to fast changing sales, customer needs, and seasons. Overall, enjoy the fast moving work environment."
good,"Is a good company to work for to get sales experience. People, co-workers, and management were nice learned a lot from them."
good,Great place for part-time work and for someone who loves cosmetics. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with diverse public. The hardest part of the job is advancing in career.
good,alot of people think it is fun to work in retail . well when it comes to macys work work and work. It is so stressful the amount of work you are given
good,I needed a summer job once I graduated high school and got the job. Hiring process is very easy and are always looking for part time work.
good,"Working with Macy's was an interesting experience. Co-workers were welcoming and offered their assistance whenever I needed it. The days were quite hectic with customers, from which I developed a face pace work ethic, flexibility, patience, and the ability to improvise when needed."
good,Macys allows me the flexibility I need to attend school to acquire a job in my field of interest. I enjoy my co-workers and the department and managers.
good,"- management team is horrible; counter manger loves took our sales;abuse manger power"
good,very boring place to work The management was great my hours were great a typical day was folding clothes and helping customers
good,Macy's is a huge cooperate company and acts like it. The other associates and daily interactions are great and very satisfying. Managers can either be extremely easy going or too strict to work with.
good,"My job was based on retail sales, customer services, cashier, and products inventory. Touch base every day about new products with my manager."
good,it was ok to work but too much people on the floor it was hard to reach your quota because to many people were working I did not like the pay rate I felt I worked to hard and sold to much for the pay rate
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Seasonal Position"
good,"Assisting customers in finding fun fashion and fine jewelry for a special someone, occasion or themselves.  Fitting their desires, tastes and needs in finding the perfect piece or pieces to put together that perfect ensemble.  I learned to sense the customers style combined with what I observed and heard.  Management was supportive in increasing sales and opening credit accounts. The hardest part, there wasn't any.  The most enjoyable was making the customers really happy with their selections, especially when they came back to thank me for helping them and what a success their choice was."
good,I enjoyed this job very much aside from my pay. The co-workers treated everyone fairly and showed appreciation towards all co-workers and bosses.
good,Macy's was a good company to work for but there were some things i did not approve of. they were unOrganize in the excutive office.
good,I got more people skills from working at Macy's. I got along with a lot with my co-workers. The hardest park of the job as to get up on early in the morning to work on Black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job was my break with my Co-workers.
good,"Overall the job was good, especially for a first job. The coworkers were fine and got to interact with them constantly. What I most enjoyed about the job was how flexible it was in regards to the hours and days an employee worked. I also enjoyed dealing with customers."
good,"While I'm sure there are plenty that can make a career out of Macy's, my particular location is not one of those prone to advancement. The pay recently got raised for all new hires, but associates who have been with the company for years have not been raised in pay on an equal level, at all. The scheduling system is crazy. Full time is scheduled 28 hours a week with the option to pick up a shift, if it's available. If not then you are full time working 28 hours a week, like I am currently. There is no set schedule, but this is retail so that shouldn't surprise anyone. My particular store does not follow policy, at least in most cases, when it comes to...most things actually. Any smidgeon of complaint or doubt and we are supposed to give the customer whatever they want, regardless of how they treat us. Management does not talk to each other, lunch breaks are always a gamble, and there are no excused absences from work (you have to use attendance points you earn even if it is a medical emergency or you live in the country and cannot navigate roads in bad weather like I do)."
good,"This is your basic retail position.  Fold clothes, greet customers, operate cash register, weekly sales goals and credit account goals."
good,I enjoyed my time with the Macy's company. I had the opportunity to learn many things from Macy's as a whole. I wouldn't trade in my experience with Macy's for anything in the world.
good,My experience working in retail as a sales associate was to make it my mission to always provide outstanding customer service as well as managing my work area.
good,Surrounded by a very productive team who lent helping hands. Also manger would work with me in regards to my schedule if there were issues.
good,Work hours are tolerable when wearing proper shoes. I learned how to put on the face and voice of a top class salesman. Management is tough to deal with as well as co workers because they only think about themselves. Your word means nothing to them. The hardest part of the job was making sure I pleased both customers and other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sales goals.
good,Everyday I did about the same thing. Learned a lot about warehouse operations. My co-workers were nice and I enjoyed working with them. I scanned a lot of incoming packages and also boxed a lot of packages for then to be shipped out.
good,Management could be better.  Pay isn't the best.  It's hard to make a living off of their salary.  A typical day at work for me consists of walking the sales floor and apprehending shoplifters.
good,I would recommend Macy's for people who are very young and may not care too much about the pay. For the most part I had fun and met a lot of new people.
good,Best part was the flexible schedule the work environment was ok and management was ok. Learned how to operate cash register and how to stock
good,There is no room for advancement unless someone retires. I couldn't work there with people who didn't want to be team players. Everyone is out to get everyone. No trust.
good,"overall macys is a good place to work & get experience. management sometimes can ask for too much but if you work with them then you can get a better understanding for what needs to be done. A normal work day includes customer assistance , refilling merchandise & maintaining a neat stockroom. The hardest part about the job is getting a task done without the proper material."
good,My major responsibility was to make sure that the customer was satisfied with their experience at Macy's. I had to work the register and solicit credit. I also had to make sure the sales floor was neat and orderly. My management was very helpful when it came to hard things like promoting sales or getting them to open Macy's credit cards. This job enhanced my organizational and customer service skills. The most enjoyable aspect of working at Macy's was seeing the customer happy with their purchase.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a good place to work but it isn't my passion. My passion is writing and that's what I hope be doing for a living in the very near future.
good,"•	Provide great product knowledge to make shopping more convenient for customers."
good,A typical day at work for me is getting done what ever task is at hand. I'm at work to work not find reasons not to work. I enjoyed what I was doing and most of the people I worked with.
good,Macy's kept me on my feet. The store was always busy and I love that. I would clean the fitting room and make sure the floor was clean. The rack of clothes was on the hanger right and clothes on the table folded neatly.
good,"Hard work"
good,Good workplace environment and very useful for creating great personnel skills.  The managers were very accommodating and I worked with a plethora of unique individuals.
good,"Lack of Advancement, limited Job Security, Poor Job Culture, Management, lack of training, too much time on the phone with lack of time between calls"
good,"Some managers are ok, their customer services on some days are poor. They are very successful in meeting their district goals."
good,I work many different departments. I like my job. I just didn't like how the place was run. I did many different jobs day to day. Which was nice cause you were not stuck doing the same stuff every day.
good,I don't really have much to say about Macy's but hats they try to stay up to date and have quality products and always have surveys and find a way to improve on their services.
good,Currently the meal and break position and i just cover my coworkers meal and breaks. the most enjoyable thing about working at Macy's is the customer interaction and friendly service i provide
good,A typical day at work would include me delivering food from the cooks to the servers and sweeping floors when asked.  It was a very fast-paced environment and I had to be quick on my feet.  I learned the importance of paying attention to detail and communication.  My co-workers were helpful but there were also some who were not so helpful so I also learned how to deal with people of all types of working habits.  The hardest part of the job was remembering all of the table numbers and the locations of those tables.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to meet new people everyday.
good,"customer service , manager was disrespectful , I know customers are always right but your employer needs to trust their employees"
good,"good shifts"
good,"Very little to say. I worked there for a few months as I waited to join the Navy. It was a nice place to work, and it was seasonal work."
good,"Macys has great core of associates that are driven to maintaining the best customer experience. Management is tasked with establishing or mirroring e-commerce process. The warehouse is a constant balancing act of associate hours to achieve required results. The best part of the job is exceeding daily goals and advancement of team members, Macys has a great mix of diversity and culture which made my daily interactions enjoyable."
good,"A lot of busy work required when things aren't busy, even if things are already clean and in order. Fellow workers are kind of helpful, but are very competitive since it is a commission based job and the head sellers often had arguments. Management was fair, but commission was very hard hard to achieve since the return policies were very lax."
good,"Customer Service, Commission sales, Cashiering, Rearranging, Tagging and Resorting. Co-Workers seem to mind their own. Managers are not as nice as possible"
good,"help customers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"it is what you think it is.  long days, poor compensation, worse benefits and having to dig through lies to try to figure out what manager is telling truths."
good,Macys your super sale department store i've truely learned how to multitask and be able to adjust to taking on multiple positions in different departments from training new associates on how to ring up and return different items to how to process a hold and one day sale or honor a friend and family coupon the day it was always something new to learn how to register a brides gift registry to the how to process inventory in the scanner gun on inventory days. My hardest part to my job was at times being the only person that want to work on the weekend but that taught me how to manage and be more independent and truly work under pressure. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satifaction at the end of me ringing up the customers purchae or during the purchase the customer always got to have a plesant experience.
good,"I love being a support associate. It allows me to utilize my organizing skills and develop my managing skills. My team is in charge of keeping the stock room filled and make sure new merchandises are processed in a timely manner. "
good,It's a learning experience to say the least. The time spent there gave a better insight on how the company cares for their customers and employees. It was pleasant but hard.
good,"•	Acts as a liaison to the District’s Human Resource office for all HR issues and initiatives."
good,This job was fun and I learned a lot to help me springboard to my latest work opportunities.I worked in many stores and in the divisional office as well.
good,"Macys provides very flexible hours for those who want look for a part-time job, a continue study for your career. Although Macys, provide very low advancement, for those who wan to climb the corporate ladder."
good,"It's a great company to work for, always have deals, you learn a lot about customers service and retail, everyone is friendly and there to help."
good,A typical day at work consists of engaging and interacting with customers finding out their needs and providing excellent customer service. My co-workers are awesome. We work very well together and help each other the best we can. The hardest part of the job is not always being able to complete all the tasks that need to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers experience amazing and worthwhile.
good,a normal day at work is going to see what new stcok came in and bring it back to the stock room to be sorted my name brand . after the sorting check the sales floor to see what needs to be added to each section. stock yeah section and clean the floor.
good,"Cashiered, folded clothes, assisted customers with basic retail needs. I'm a people person and I love interacting with people that was a big part of why I liked working there. It was a seasonal position."
good,Loved to exceed goals. Upbeat management always there to energize the staff.  Good team.  We felt like we were a family.  Store was busy.
good,"There was a constant lock of communication between employees and management, there were those who felt that they were above others.  The experience was different."
good,"A typical day at work is mostly with customers helping them finding what they are looking for, opening Macys Credits , Placing order in store or online. Helping co-workers and managers. Handling cash Registers."
good,"Usual expectations for retail, load/unload, receiving, fulfillment duties."
good,I worked for the company for many years. It is a ok business but I just wished I felt that the company cared more about their employee's.
good,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company , I enjoyed the customers as well as the co-workers it was a fun place to work and I learned a lot about management and sales with this company"
good,"The best part of Macy's is your co-workers and the occasional managers that treat you with decency and respect. Hardest part is dealing with so many attitudes from customers, being at the front-line of a rapidly escalating problem and trying to diffuse the problem before a manager gets involved."
good,I enjoyed working for Macys for the time that I was there but there was a few problems. I was a counter manager for Estee Lauder and absolutely loved and breathed my position even outside of work. In my time working for the company I would have to not only follow Macys rules and regulations but meet sales quotas for Estee Lauder and attend there training seminars. I would go to my above supervisors with problems and they would never follow through with fixing the issue nor addressing it with the sales teams. My above cosmetic manager was known for partying and coming into work looking sloppy with no makeup on. Me being a counter manager I was held to a higher standard than my sales associates and things fell on me when they went wrong but having people under me that had been there longer and would not listen to my direction caused a lot of friction of which was NEVER handled correctly. I lost my job at Macys due to not having attendance credits because I had sick family members of which they were made aware of but never understanding to the situation. I tried fighting the attendance credits due to coming in on my days off and making up time but the company did not keep track of those times and I wrongfully lost my position and have tried to reapply with no response.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I would come and help my visual team, and be able to connect with other teams such as the merchandising team to help set up the store."
good,"I did everything possible to stay at Macy's because I wanted a change and a job of course.  It seemed like others that did get to stay were asked to stay and offered positions and I didn't.  A typical day was helping customers find the products that they needed.  If I was in perfumes, I would ask what kind of scent were they looking for.  If I was in cosmetics, I would help them find their right shade of makeup and I even did a lady's makeup.  There really was no hard part of the job except for building your own client list.  Of course, I don't have to worry about that because they didn't keep me.  The managers are supposed to look at how many credit applications you filled out, but it seemed like they didn't care that I met my goal for December while I was there.  So to sum it up, if the manager of the department you are working in likes you, you are in."
good,I like the cosmetics environment is so fun to work with make up and skin care. Flexible schedules and they train you about the brand so you can do a better job.
good,"macys is a place to shop and work, competition is big since there is a lot of people who work there for 30 years and still working, and know a lot of  customers"
good,"Macy's is a legendary company with many incentive programs for its employees. It is a company dedicated to customer service and its incentive program for its customer. One of the flaws of the company however is the seasonal period/inventory. In all retail companies the fourth quarter/seasonal period is a grind, unfortunately at Macy's they go from fourth quarter, inventory preparation, major sale and then inventory. Each is right after each other without a down period. Additonally, the season/ fourth quarter is a 6 day work week. It is a good company for discounts and learning all factions of customer service. Ensure that you avoid the Queens Center or Kings Plaza store as they are the two toughest store to work in the company."
good,"The work day is usually ok, with a few headache adjustments. It's a reasonable workplace that pays ok. I would say this job is recommended for a part timer."
good,"""What you see is what you get.""  Macy's is a massive retailer, so it is exactly what you would expect.  You work most nights, weekends and holidays.  When I was hourly I made more than I would have made at similar companies; however, when I was salaried management, I made just as much as I would have at any other retailer.  Upper-level management really was not bad at all.  They seemed better than most other upper-level management teams that I have worked for.  Again, like most other retailers, there is little job security.  There were numerous positions while I was there, especially salaried management, that were cut because the company wanted to restructure.  There was one woman who had been with the company 15+ years and was still doing the job well, and they let her go just like that because they were changing the position.  It is unfortunate, but it is the current corporate mindset.  Overall, they are the best retailer that I have worked for, but it is still a retail company in Corporate America so do not expect much."
good,"As a sales associate specialist, a little more will be required of you because you are a specialist. Overall, it's a good sales job with the holidays being the busiest season. As a specialist, you offer a more personalized sales experience to the customer and have the opportunity to build a clientele base with customers and you have more manager-like respect and privileges."
good,This is a retail job where you are expected to offer Macy's credit cards to every customer and to always be productive.  You meet a lot of interesting people and make a lot of great connections.
good,I did enjoyed my job at Macy's. They provided great skills and information to help you learn new ways to sale their items. My management team was always up to par by checking on the department to see if employees were goood to go and  store sales goals were made. The hardest part about working at Macy's was making sure your sales goal was made throughout your shift. It made it slightly hard because working retail could be slow at moments. Our main objective was to make sure customers were satisfied and happy with their purchase. And to always make sure they left with a smile !
good,If you like clothing and helping people this is the place to work.it is hard work standing most of the day but if you enjoy talking and helping this is a good job for you
good,Working for Clarins was a great sales experience and it build my communications skills and sales skills to a greater lever.
good,"I worked at Macy's for a short period of time during the Holidays. I caught on very quickly without the need of a supervisor for very long., but felt was pressured with a lot of work at a very fast pace for my first time working in a department store."
good,"Overall, my time at Macy's was pleasant. My co-workers were the best part of my job. Then we got a new manager and everybody started dropping like flies."
good,A typical day consist of helping clients find the right brands and sizes. Making sales and opening up credit cards. Folding cloths and keeping your area clean.
good,Macys Inc. is a dynamic institution that each individual enjoys working there. The relationship between Management and Associates is amicable as each individual ensures that external customers as well as internal customers are left feeling satisfied.
good,"It's a nice environment to work with great coworkers that work as a team. A typical day is opening the registars, greeting customers that comes to the fine jewelry department, assisting customers  in making decisions on products, being friendly, and building that relationship with the customer to be an client in our department to come back and become a Macys card holder."
good,"A typical day at Macy's would be a minimum 10 hour day which would involve managing the entire store, solving customer issues, covering open shifts as well as call offs, training and redirecting associates to drive credit sales, conducting interviews, reviewing schedules, developing counter managers to achieve sales goals and driving results in home department of Cosmetics. "
good,Co workers are very close and work well together.  They make the company a pleasant atmosphere for assisting guests with their shopping needs.
good,I have a few friends who love their department and I've been in a few good ones. Overall it really depends. I would come in on time but that was frowned upon. I had to come in early in order to be acknowledged.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Managers dont care about your schedule or any family emergencies that you have. Zero job security. Its like a high school, tons of drama with the amount of kids that just graduated high school being there."
good,I have been working with the public for at least twenty-five years. I found the most rewarding thing about all people is that the whole world is a stage and everybody is playing a part.  I just wanted my part to be in helping people.
good,recovered the floor worked the registers helped customers find their items supervisor was barely there but worked great with co workers anyway
good,"Complete sales. Change prices in shoes, clothing, kitchen and home wear departments when needed.Advertised and displayed new products.Discount old products. Organized and restock sales floor. Other Duties as needed."
good,"You get to meet a lot of different people in the business like tourists, people looking for everyday things. Being attentive is very important for this position because there will be times that a customer will need your undivided attention. I appreciated the knowledge I gained working in macy's because it helped me grow into a better customer service provider."
good,assisting customers in store and on phone multitasking  giving them the best customer service.I make sure to help them out as best as i can they have to leave with a smile on there face. working at Macy you get to learn about different things as fashion shoes clothes. learning how every customer is different. an having to get something that fits  them .
good,A typical day was mostly boring unless you worked a Saturday day shift.  I learned some stuff about fine jewelry and some watches.  Management was okay.  They didn't exactly treat everybody fairly.  The hardest part was closing alone.  The most enjoyable part was trying on the beautiful rings and presenting them to customers.
good,"Work was manageable, holidays are a bit of a headache if you don't manage your energy properly. Great for learning how to deal with people."
good,"The management style varied by department, it gave reason for development."
good,"Working at Macys, in the retail sector, has been a ""cushion"" for me, after the worst economic meltdown Ive experienced."

good,Fast environment.  Worked long hours serving people. I learned new skills and is able to use in any of my future jobs.
good,"Is a fun place to work, Great to interact with people. Very busy, dynamic atmosphere."
good,Nothing special.  Good Co-workers.  Decent work life balance for some.  Diverse culture.
good,"The work wasn't hard but it wasn't exciting either. I was switched and worked between different managers and there were sometimes I was taken out of my comfort zone and placed in an area I wasn't familiar with. I didn't particularly learn anything I wouldn't know, like putting coats on hangars and then on racks. Most of my co-workers were friendly, it a friendly environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping someone out, even though it was part of the job, I was always happy to assist."
good,The schedule is very flexible. Gives you a chance to have experience with customer service.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's is having a great supportive team. I started the HR Admin position with no experience; however, the company offered paid training. Today I have gained new productive skills. I am proficient in Oracle and Taleo scheduling for HR information systmes."
good,The company caters too much to the customers. If there is an issue with a customer that is not protected under their agreements Macy's will overlook their employees and fully agree with the customer. This makes the communication between employees look bad and allows the customer to come back and do the same thing again.
good,"A typical day at Macy's consisted of making sales in the department which you are assigned to while also keeping the sales floor neat and clean to avoid a messy work space, as well as occasionally doing inventory for your department."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,The Management was nice and the co-worker were mature and hardworking people
good,You have to have an enormous amount of patience in working there. The managers emphasize selling. As long as you sell and keep customers happy you are ok.
good,"The company doesn't pay well and requires you to work every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The hours are long and the work is overwhelming"
good,"Unloaded trucks everyday, arrange stockrooms, nice people"
good,"Macys is a good place to work. Nice people every where, schedule flexibility is nice, and the pay is ok."

good,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs."
good,Macys was alrite you have to be independent often. Management can often be no where to be found. You pick your own schedule for 3 weeks. Sometimes can be with no hours
good,A fast paced call center with an excellent 5 week training program. The part I enjoyed the most was learning to do live chat and international calling.  The hardest part of the job was the limitations in helping the customer.
good,The work environment at Macy's was a little bit heavy. Every sales associate has a lot of work.
good,"Best group of people I've ever worked with. Everyone worked together as a team to make sure the job was done. Serving guest, ensuring orders were rang up. Closing and opening daily shift requirements were met"

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was making women happy with their shoe purchase.
good,"A typical day at work is usually fast paced, always on your feet greeting customers and helping them find whatever it is they need. Constant organizing and cleaning making sure your department is well kept because sometimes your the only one working. I've learned a lot about integrity and always putting the customers first, because their experience and reviews are all based on our performance and weather or not the company will grow. There wasn't anything hard about the job, everything was about customer service following the policies and always being aware of the constant sales every week. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so much different people, working in the store itself was enjoyable."
good,Macys is a really diverse community every body is different and everyone is happy to be there the energy is great. The pay is good. the surroundings are great. have a comfortable break room.
good,"Very busy work place, stand on feet for long period of time. lots of recovery and fitting room. Working the cash register and handling money."
good,"finding clients in the store to try on and demo different products in my department, makeup applications, stocking and cleaning the area, opening credit cards."
good,"You are thrown out in the water right away even when you're not ready. Management is not always there to help If you're lucky, coworkers will help. They only give you a good review mostly based on sales. In turn would make the associates very greedy and not willing to help new associates. They also pay you minimum wage. Most employees complain about Macy's no matter how long they've been there. You really are paid too little for the amount of work they expect out of you. Especially if you are not one of the top sellers. Top sellers almost never get in trouble. The only enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting people at work. I was a friend of almost everyone in my store. I think you're better off applying elsewhere unless Macy's is the only to contact you."
good,working at macy's I met many different people from across the world. I enjoyed hearing the stories about how they love shopping at the store. I really loved being able to help someone find the perfect outfit to match their personality.
good,"Nothing too fantastic or terrible. Management is hit or miss. I did advance while with the company, but only after being paid minimum wage for the first year of employment. It's sort of like any other retail setting."
good,"I worked here as a teenager. I had a blast most of the time. After I finished high school it was hard to get them to work around my college schedule. So I had to wait to go to college. The GM had great intentions when he selected about 6 of his most valuable associates to promote to trainers. When we all got promoted we were given different responsibilities. I was happy to get the promotion, but they never gave me the pay raise I was supposed to receive. "
good,"Sell and  Service to the customers   needs and  wants."
good,"I would come in start folding clothes if needed be, then help people that needed to be check out of the store."
good,I developed a very strong customer service and to deal with different kind of people professionally. I work with minimum supervision since I have a broad knowledge of our products in store because I've been working there for more than 4years now. I've undergone a lot of trainings too. I love the people I work with. I always deal with customer issue since I am one of the few people that the company chose to give empowerment to do so.

good,Its a good job to start working at if u in to fashion. I enjoy it most of the time
good,"Macys Call Center is a fast pace working environment. Co-workers and managers are friendly and easy to get along with. Sometimes this job can be stressful, but overall a fun place to work at."
good,"Macy's typically places new employees on their sales floor with little to no training and very high sales goals. Loss prevention for Macy's is more concern with watching employees instead of customers. Management doesn't care about it's employees, only sales. Co-workers don't have a chance to build a good work relationship because of the pressure of sales on the floor. The hardest part of the day is meeting your sales goals."
good,I have never worked in retail so this was my first retail job. It was very tiring and rough on the feet. It was still a fun job but I'd never go back.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,learned how to measure women for bras and varies other things. assisted customers with children's clothes as well. you got incentives with meeting your goals
good,Some days you'll get good/easy customers and others days you'll get the rude customers. Don't take it personal. You'll learn customer service and patience. Getting along with your co-workers makes the day go by smoother and faster. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are rude and have an attitude for no reason.
good,My day at Macy usually began with assisting the customer with their purchases. Most of my duties involves customer service.
good,the hardest part of this job was trying to sell perfumes to different people of all ages
good,"Nice mix of employees with a varying degree of experience."

good,"Macys is a good company to work for, they offer flexible schedules and employee discount. I had a great time. The pay is low."
good,The coworkers are great management is okay at times.  Hardest part of the job is when management wants you to open credits everyday.
good,it was okay.  Poor management and not enough hours. Not a good place
good,"Fun, fast paced work place. Flexible hours. Good Benifits, Managment is well."
good,I didn't enjoy this job at all... it sucked. management sucked.
good,"Stocking merch, handling customers.  Much as what you would expect in this field. Stocking stuff and long hours for Christmas season holiday. You get to see what is new before it hits the floor."
good,This job kept me busy which I love.  Never a dull moment.  Would have loved to stayed full time.
good,"help all customers"

good,"ok place to work, great co-workers and clean environment. need to be able to get more working hours though"
good,I enjoyed meeting new people each day. I really enjoyed the change-overs for the seasons and getting a first look at new styles coming and going.
good,very tiring and long hours standing on feet. Although helping assist customers was pleasant.
good,A very good experience working with Macy's. A very professional  and technology focused environment.
good,"Macy's is supportive, provides career development, and encourages employees to volunteer and give back."
good,"I usually do recover and ring at the cash register. I learned have better communication skills. My manager was nice and understanding and my co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is standing for hours. I liked being able to help people. Having to get people to open the Macy's cards is annoying, because the people want them already have them and no one wants to open one. Some people try to haggle the price or argue with what works with the coupons. Other people are very friendly and talk to while I ring things up, they make my day better."
good,"I always describe the happy Macy's employee as being someone who is working just for Chardonnay money. They are going to be a woman, who has either a separate full time job, is a student or is the wife/daughter of a husband/family who makes enough money but she wants to contribute enough to the household income to be able to buy what she wants without financial stress. If you don't fit into those three categories, you will be unhappy. Even as a full time specialist, you will not make enough money to be a healthy, thriving adult. You will be compensated for reaching sales goals with ""Macy's money"" which is basically a half off discount. But its only a reward if you can afford anything in the store ( the entire time I worked there I could not.). Even as a full time person, you don't get benefits until the sixth month of employment. However, managers are usually great, positive people. Its retail."
good,"Friendly co-workers. Management can be better. Multiple scheduling conflicts, not very flexible with schedule, a lot of required key dates."
good,"Implements best practices to rationalize talent management strategies, working with clients"
good,"was allowed to be me, met alot of different people and also maintained great relationships with customers."
good,"Overall it's an okay job. Typically your out on the hunt for customers or behind the register ringing up customers. The managers walk the floor daily so we constantly interact with them and the other co workers. The hardest part of the job was just standing for your whole shift, you can't sit down at all while on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and really being able to help customers with their shopping needs."

good,I enjoyed coming to work to see my co-workers. I also enjoyed my customers who came to me for customer service. My manager was also a nice person.
good,"Macy's is very focused on customer service, which is great. However, the sales associates are not treated with the same level of respect. I never felt appreciated as an employee and although I had wonderful customer reviews and strong sales numbers, the only feedback I ever received was negative. I often felt that the management steered me in a direction that was not beneficial to my advancement with the company."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a great clothing store. and while I worked there I cant say I didn't learned anything. my register skills got so much better. And my character as a person as well. it was a hectic environment but it was a great experiences for me.
good,"worked with a good enviorment, customer service, cash handling."
good,"I really do not have much to say about working for Macys, it was just horrid, horrible hours not to mention horrible pay."
good,The employees really make it a wonderful place to work. The Visual team is truly amazing.
good,"The hardest part of my job was opening credit lines. The act of opening the credit lines wasn't the hard part, it was actually getting customers who either didn't already have one or actually wanted to open one. For the most part I enjoyed the management and my co-workers. I learned a lot about what goes on in stores like that."
good,typical day at work is having fun with team and customers. selling sunglasses is an easy and fun job. managers and coworkers laid back.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and how to please the customer and to diffuse a tense situation.

good,Love interacting with customer and co workers. Listening to other requests and being able to help.
good,A typical day for me I start by getting merchandise from receiving and bring them ether to the stockroom or the selling floor.I learned a few key skills like how to process items and locate them as well.Also I learned how to train fellow associates.I enjoy my co-workers I really like working with them they help my day to be enjoyable and somewhat reasonable.The hardest part of my job would be dealing with un-reasonable requirements not obtainable by one person..The best part of my job would be when I finish all of my work
good,"•	Responsible for making monthly sale figures "
good,Couldnt advance in a company like that. Management dont treat you right nor do they appreciate you.
good,not enough pay not enough hours and the management don't care about the employees they only care about the customers.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working at Macy's was alright. I worked in the dock area and my hours would be unpredictable. It all depends on the trucks and I was a part timer. The managers in the dock area were too negative. They would always get on our case about being behind and hardly ever give us constructive criticism or positive feed back. Often times we would stay later then scheduled. Sometimes the truck was not large enough and I would not get to work a day that I thought I would get to work"
good,"I started out my day by managing my cash registers, cleaning fitting rooms, and sending clothes back to their assigned departments. I've learned a lot  about different types of customer service and how to sell products to different types of people. I worked by myself most days and had a sales goal to achieve every day which was sometimes hard, but i always exceeded my goal. The hardest part of working at Macy's was working for a corporation that has too many employees and doesn't have personal compassion for people in needed situations for example, being sick. The managers were great but because they had to follow the guidelines of Macy's Inc. they could not ever give you proper treatment. I enjoyed working for them none the less, there was a great group of people I worked with and I had a lot of fun challenging myself in different ways."
good,"Perform area duties related to department, then perform sales."

good,I gained a lot of knowledge and experience working for the visual department.
good,They did not give a physical work schedule everything was done online to which you had to pick up shifts on your own time
good,"We would have to unload the trucks, take out the boxes and fold the clothes. We would also have to put price tags on everything and fold the clothes. I would have to stock the store when it was closing time."
good,"-cross selling"
good,contact me directly for this information. I do not wish to put my personal opinions on my resume.
good,"A typical day here consists of ringing up customers, answering phones, clearing out fitting rooms, and recovering the sales floor.  I learned that clothing retail is EXTREMELY busy, but if you learn where every goes, your shift doesn't feel all that long."
good,"arrive at work, open register, clock-in, help arrange displays. help customers find items they are looking for, ring them out. thank and welcome them to come back."

good,"Macys is involved in many programs with the community. Ex. Bag Hunger, March of Dimes, American Red Cross just to name a few. Sales staff enjoyed getting our customers involved with donations, along with staff members, for such a great cause. Thats one of the things I enjoyed the most."

good,"A typical retail corporate setting. Some really great mentors and employees, while others were lacking in dedication to the work."
good,"1) Overall rating is beat  : Take my breath away by composer Dai   "
good,"Signing displays"
good,"Macy's follows massive amounts of company driven directives. There are endless business leaders visiting stores to ""ensure"" their family of business is set in the most productive way. However, visual is the guide for the store look and feel, and can have the final say on how the family business looks and lands. Visual if lead with people development and store goals in mind, can make a big difference with the business."
good,"It's a fun workplace. Really it's like any retail store, help customers, clean-up after words. There's days you have to deal with difficult customers. Overall the co-workers are great, very helpful when I first began. But then there's the managers, they just want everything to be done for them."
good,"Folding clothes, organizing tables. Teamwork was involved in much of the work. Customers would be the most enjoyable aspect of Macy's. The hardest part of this job is the holiday season."

good,"not the greatest place to work. took seasonal job, was offered more permanent position but at a lower pay rate. management was fine. daily tasks included stocking, facing, sales, etc"
good,"At my department, Michael Kors handbags, which I'm currently in is usually busy everyday. It's a fast paced environment and is rare that there are few customers shopping around. I learned how to work with a few customers at a time, how to make a customer not only want to buy our bags but take a second item with them such as a wallet or a cross body, and also how to be very patient. My co-workers are great I never had a problem with any of the as well as my managers. The hardest part of my job would have to be the sale days you have to be extremely prepared to deal with multiple people and the people who are very impatient. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I have gotten extremely comfortable with the kind of fast paced environment I work in and the bags that we sell."
good,I somewhat enjoyed my position at Macys.  The best part was working in the Fur Salon....that was so fun and educational at the same time.

good,"I enjoyed working as a floor manager for the holidays. People respected my decisions, I helped resolve customer issues,  and learned the ins and outs of retail. Worked with several other co-workers to help maintain selling floor work areas and the associates. The hardest part of this job was when we were understaffed. The best part of the job was how well we handled being understaffed."

good,"The co-workers in my department (Luggage and Mattresses) were excellent, we all worked well together. Our direct manager was also excellent and a pleasure to work for. With this job I was taught how to differentiate between the mattresses and the quality of different brands, as well as learning the different qualities of luggage. A typical day at work started with opening the register, turning on the lights, and making sure there was cash in the till. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the look on the faces of my customers after they'd purchased a bed."
good,"Overal not a great experience. Long hours, little pay, and no appreciation of the employees."
good,Review cameras.  Walk the floor.  Do checks.  Amazing co-workers.
good,"meet a different people .learning the best customer services and have "
good,Macy's provided an overall good work experience. My only true complaint was sometimes the work load for one person. There would typically be a lot of merchandise that needed to be restocked and put back in their correct place. The work load was sometimes a lot. However the job kept you busy so it seemed that your work day went by very fast. There wasn't much room for advancement though. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the customers walk away satisfied.
good,The worst place to work. Bad managements and long hours during holidays.
good,"open up register,count drawer and make sure it was balanced at start of shift and at end of shift, customer service-help clients find what they need"

good,The most enjoyable part of the job was staying ahead of the newest fashions. The employee discount is awesome also.
good,"I loved helping customers find what they were looking for and the register/department system was set up great. The main problem with working in this store was the managers allowing customers to walk all over the employees. When a customer wanted to break the rules we were told to call the managers and they always says ""Yes, but only this once"" which only goes so far. We would have repeat customers who knew if they pushed us they would get what they wanted and wouldn't treat us fairly."
good,all sales. wasn't happy with management. standing on your feet all day.
good,"Helping women find there right cup size. Finding the right bras for each women, because everyone like different things. Making sure it never hurt there back, side, nor under arm."

I learned how to deal with all kinds of people and how to deal with them the correct way. I also learned the value in having good workmanship with other co-workers, because before this I was a freelancer and a loner. The hardest part of the job was honestly the long slow days but I caught on to everything pretty quickly. The most enjoyable part is definitely receiving my check at the end of the week, because hard work pays off!"
good,"great place to work with advancement opportunities, bonuses and overtime"
good,Friendly environment and ability to develop work skills for the future.
good,"Fun and productive work environment. Hands on with most or all customers, which help me improve my customer service skills. Management was always available when you needed assistance. Everyone was very helpful and the co-workers were eager to help whenever we needed it. The hardest part of the job would be when their was an item that wasn't in stock anymore, the customers would be disappointed but we would try to fine a substitute item. The most enjoyable part would be the customers because you build a relationship when the regular people that come in and also with the new customers."
good,"the most enjoyable part at work was the close, you get a nice employee discount and get macys money everytime you get someone to open a macys card."
good,"Sales associate positing assisting customers, handling cash transactions and maintaining store appearance."

I learned several different techniques on how to talk to an individual and see which product(s) benefits them the most. Unfortunately, they let me go because I was often late or absent from work due to my mother's injuries and illness. I was very disappointed when this happened."
good,I enjoyed working in Macy s I worked for the Christmas  Holiday Season and I worked in the Childrens department It was exciting and the management staffed treated there Associates very nice
good,"In a commission based environment, you have to pay attention to every single minute of your shift. An employee would already have that customer and sometimes you would never know unless you asked. Sometimes it is so busy you don't have time. To prevent complications, identify who has that customer first until you approach for help. They were many instances where employees grew angry at one another for not ""doing their job correctly"" or making accusations that you are ""stealing their sale or commission"". When in fact, you just weren't paying attention."
good,As bridal consultant I was responsible for registering new couples for their wedding.

good,Typical day at work was dealing with customers helping them find what they need. I learned how to manage different types of customers due to higher volume of customers. The management was ok depending on the day and or event going on in the store. The hardest part of the job was putting up with some of the managers. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people out and make their day a whole lot easier.
good,"I enjoyed the work environment, but it was clear that the company is only worried about making money. Of course, this is all fine and well. Companies have to make money. But, the constant hounding of the management to meet and exceed sales goals was overbearing and made me hate going to work every day. However, the coworkers were friendly and made the experience more bearable."
good,it is a good company to work for and it isn't a bad place. you just work long hours and work with lots of different people
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Forward thinking, goal oriented, challenging, customer oriented"
good,"Just submitted my application without for this opportunity not realizing I would even be considered for a job there. I like assisting customers with their vision of style of shoes or clothes in the Men's department.  However, I now work in the Women's Shoes deparment now and I found it to be lot's of fun and I've learn things about women I never experience before. Not sure, If want to work during the xmas holidays again. Its just plain crazy in retail during that time."
good,"Working at Macy's surrounds you with a wide diversity of cultures, both within the work place as well as the customer base.  It is important not only to know the product(s) but how to present the knowledge in a way that will inspire the customer to buy.  To meet and greet people each day is an experience that broadens your horizon,  The challenging aspect as a Macys employee is to maintain a high and demanding score/evaluation when the sales are down."
good,good product good work environment great discount don't know what else to say
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and making sure they leave happy .
good,The lack of communication from management made it hard to be the best I could be at my job.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This company expects you to make their set goals everyday without complaint, you are given no formal training on your skills at selling."
good,I learned a lot on how to interact with different individuals !
good,"In a typical day at work, I would be expected to arrive, open registers, perform an inventory scan before the store opened, and place out any merchandise that wasn't visible. "
good,"Macy's is a good company to get your foot in the door for any business retail experience. If you want to gain experience in customer service, Macy's is your vehicle. They train and teach you the expectations of the every day customer so that you can provide outstanding customer service. You can grow within the company at your own pace or as quickly as you work for it. Nevertheless Macy's provides everyone with great opportunity"
good,I wish I stayed more because I kind of took the job for granted. But now looking back it isn't that bad of a place to work at it. It is actually rather appealing.
good,"Overall this is a good company, however, the pay is not that great and they don't give you as many hours."
good,"customers opinion is very important"
good,Macys in Aventura was a great place to meet people from all over the world. Lots of people constantly furnishing for rentals and vacation properties. The furniture department was located in Macys Home Store on the 3rd floor in Aventura Mall.
good,"It's a great place to work and most employees are helpful. Although I only cover lunches management would get my coverage schedule to late after the first few days and then I would be late to covering people, and then they's take extra time for lunch, and then I'd be late getting to the next person."
good,"Great place to start off in retail and to get established in how the industry truly operates. My typical day included POS, organizing clothing racks and tables, and educating/assisting customers with their purchases "
good,This was a very demanding retail store. My co-workers were very helpful and nice.

good,can make alot of money but got to bust your butt off love the co workers had plenty of laughs

good,"the pay is horrible, but the culture is nice it being Macy's. not a stable job since people are in and out of positions everyday."
good,nice interactions. good part time employment. No typical day in the retail industry is what i have learned. It can be hectic and/or quiet all in the same hour. I do enjoy working at Macy's Inc
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"-typical day was pretty easy only had to work when events were being held"
good,"Macy's is a pretty big place, and as such, gets a high volume of customers per day. Depending on which department you will be working in, it could either be a very productive day, or a very slow one. If you have an understanding with your fellow co-workers, then breaks come very easily. If you are scheduled for seven (7) hours or more, you get a full hour lunch, which I thought was pretty nice. The advancement opportunities are pretty scarce; unless you're in school, graduated, or have put in more than a few years' work with the company, you won't have much chance of promotion. Management doesn't really respond well with employee complaints the way they do with customer complaints. Sometimes you will feel unappreciated for the level of work they expect versus the rate of pay you receive. Definitely a good place to start, but not a good place to stay, unless you come in as a manager from the start."
good,"Busy seasonal activity, goal based sales, always moving and finding something to do"
good,"I think that this is a good place to work, however, as a temp, I was not given the same benefits as  a regular employee."
good,Can be a hostile environment however there was some good management.
good,"Through my time at Macy's I have grown up and learn a lot about myself.  I have learned what I want out of life and learned to be more goal orriented."
good,work usually goes by very smooth at work. what I have learned is working with the public you meet all kinds of people but you still have to treat them all the same. Management at Macys is like every other job they have to manage there employees. the co workers at Macys most of them are very down to earth and very nice.
good,"Good place to start your career, if you would like to be in retail and sales."
good,"Great work environment, very helpful management team. Learned a lot more about the field, co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers day in and day out."
good,"assisted with stock, floor plans, truck unload, loss prevention and damages. worked register and small customer service"
good,"While working at Macy's I have learned how to train and lead a team of employees, how to communicate with upper management in a polite effective manner, how to deal with conflict, and many other life skills.  A typical work day is going into work at 6:30 am, getting things ready for my team to set the sale for the day, checking and printing any ad retractions that are needed for that day, printing and prepping any signage needed for the upcoming sales for various departments, setting the sale and keeping my team on task, touching base with my manager before store opening, and making sure every thing is done to standard."
good,"Wonderful place to work hard working people"
good,the hardest part about my job was that i had to endure long hours standing but other than that my job was fairly okay.
good,"Macy's is a great place to work if you're a college student with a busy schedule, someone needed a part-time job or if its your first job."
good,I learned a lot about customer service in a busy retail environment.
good,Working at Macys was such an experience  I learned so much from Macys you can really learn a lot from Macys
good,"It was difficult to work there, because employees were very competitive and did not want help others"
good,Macys is a good environment to gain a new retail experience. Day to day functions for me were a routine. I learned many things about the selling and recieving and processing of merchandise to run the store. Management is not as fluent and thorough as it should be and lower entry level workers are not treated or compensated as well as they should be for the job they are doing. It was a good experience meeting new people and co-workers.It was not a great experience for me though because it is not an ethical corporation. Simply put the most important and hard working employees are not compensated how they should be.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Wonderful employee atmosphere, learned many different departments and became proficient in each,"
good,"I am actually a Sales Associate for Finishline.  However the Finishline is located within Macy's. I sale athletic and casual tennis shoes for both men and women. I was one of the first of four that were initially hired in March of 2013 to help being the opening of  Finishline inside of Macy's in Houston, Texas. Out of the four only two remain and I am one of the two. I enjoy working there but I am actually looking to venture out and explore other opportunities."
good,"We were Robinsons-May before we turned into Macy's. RM was interactive with its employees offering incentives and benefits. Macy's did not. My local store seemed to favor its ""friends and family"" over prospective employees and future employees. Management was very unexperienced and felt like if you weren't part of the clique, you were not recognized."
good,"I learned that when you work as a team, it makes the job better."
good,Help find and sell shoes on a commission-only basis. Management was poor and advancement opportunitys were scarce.
good,Great place to work. Wonderful and caring employees. THe hardest part of the job was the constant running around being told what to do by multiple people.
good,"Sales"
good,"Most of the time company had their shipments ran in order and on time. Plenty of space to complete assignment. Work always started and ended on time unless Voluntary Time Off became a option. I learned how to receive, replenish, pick, pack and ship merchandise. The management could have been more nice to the staff but had all the answers to most of our questions. My co-workers were very helpful and stayed in good spirits with one another. The hardest part of the job was the walking to and from certain areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching the daily quota. It was easy to reach our goal for the day which made the management extremely happy and treated the employees for jobs getting completed."
good,"I enjoyed my job, worked hard, had a good attendance record, exceeded sales goals and tried to make the most of myself there, in the end the decision came to leave when I discovered there wasn't going to be advancement unless I went part time. I wasn't able to do that. I felt I was talked up about my job performance and how good I was and that I had leadership potential, but when push came to shove and I applied for advancement, these same people clammed up. It wasn't the best of work environments in that sense."
good,"Hard Work"
good,For such a large company one would think that the pay would be higher.
good,Unload trucks as fast as possible and start to bin items. There are no management on duty or around to help the new hires. we were all just hired and put in the warehouse.
good,"A typical day at work for me was coming in at noon stripping off plastic from clothes, censoring and organizing apparel depending on manufacturer and design. I wouldn't say there was a hard part about the job, you just have to be quick on your feet and work at a fast pace."
good,"•	Assisting with unloading of merchandise deliveries."
good,flexible work place. decent compensation. friendly people
good,Did not enjoy working at Macy's. Typical day included folding massive piles of clothes. Meeting outrageous sales goals.
good,"I wasn't happy at this job, I had very little training, very few hours, and bad leadership."
good,"the hardest part of this job is dealing with high class customers and pleasing everyone's needs, the environment is small but proves to help multi tasking skills"
good,the company is all right better to dream about working here then actually working here
good,"enjoyed different and fast paced work, however was hired as part time and I ended up with 39.8 in a week,im retired thence I just wanted part time..my cowokers were great,fun loving,,interesting,,clean place to work. my manager was very frustrating and stressfull to all the workers and many have moved on to other jobs.."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Busy during sale dates, slow on non sale days a lot of restocking "
good,"everyone comes here to shop and they always provide jobs."
good,"Here is where I learned how to fully assess a customer's product needs and assist them in finding the perfect fragrance. I got along with management well, but sometimes they were impossible to get a hold of. My coworkers were great because even if I was having a difficult time or was short-handed, they would assist where they could and help me out. The best part of the job was being able to satisfy customers on a daily basis. The hardest part was making the sales goals when business was slow."
good,"I like Macy's for its culture and all its wonderful workers that worked there. It was a lot of work working overnight but, it was also very little pay that's why when i found a higher paying job I left."
good,Most of the job involves helping the customer and cleaning the displays.
good,"Good environment"
good,"-customer service"
good,"My typical day at work involves me arriving at work, once there I wait to receive the information for the day. Once I have the information I need I go to my area and begin to get to work. The hardest part f my job would be the days when you have to do many things at once to make sure it all gets done as specified and by the time given and sometimes its a lot to do in a short period of time. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and my manager they make my job more interesting and easier to handle."
good,"A lot of hours repeating the same thing but high paced work place.  A "
good,"Experience varies greatly by location and management.  Frequent changes in who your supervisor and area lead is can lead to radically different experiences.  One boss may be the kind to help out, who knows the area and the merchandise, and above all is willing to stand behind his/her associates.....another might hide in their office all day, not know how to do things, and cave to every customer who wants free stuff."
good,"The work was easy and very easy to catch on. Management was kind of to themselves, not easy to move up."
good,"I work security for Macy's. About 75% of my time watching camera monitors, observing shopping behaviors and catching shoplifters. The other 25% of my time is spent writing reports, maintaining safety procedures, helping sales associates resolve issues with customers, and making sure all other procedures are followed correctly. It's not a difficult job. "
good,"although I made minimum wage at Macy's, it was my first ever retail job and I was still in High School. It gave me a foundation for customer service skills and sales."
good,"folding clothes, helping customers when needed. Co worker were not much help to each other."
good,Macy's has a very nice positive culture.  My job is/was related to the Credit side of things and had nothing to do with the store.  The culture of Macy's seems to struggle with the previous owner May Company / Famous Barr.  Seasoned associates still remember the May Company days and long for that culture.  This causes a conflict of interest.  Upper management seems to be on board with Macy's mission.  Associates seem to be not so much on board with Macy's culture.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"My hours were arbitrarily cut and redistributed to a pending new associate, which forced me to find other employment."
good,"Not bad for college students or just for folks in need of extra cash flow. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"•	Responsible for maintaining all the company standards during and after closing customer transaction and general sales activities, merchandising and safe guarding company assets."
good,"cashiering"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was finding the perfect item to fit the customer's needs.
good,I love doing my job and the company my co-workers gave me made it all the more fun and relaxing.
good,I learned how to relate and handle face to face customers on a daily basis.
good,it was ok. If your young and don't have any bills its a good way to get customer services skills. But they don't pay enough.
good,"It was an ok place to work, was my first job. I learned my communication skills here. Met all types of customers. Learned how to work a register, and wrap gifts the fancy way."
good,I started out as a temp for Christmas and I was asked to stay on after the holidays. I worked up to a commission based job.
good,Good place to work though felt overworked at times.  Management was fair at times but I was not taken care of well when I was injured unloading a truck.
good,"Working at macy's was fun for me, I was always tired due to me being pregnant in a huge department store."
good,"The hardest part of the job was persuading customers to apply for store credit cards, the majority would decline."
good,"Talking with customers, making sales, stocking inventory, ordering product, working cash register."
good,"when I first started working for them I loved the job, then the changed the company and began heavy layoffs. After being laid off for the forth time, I did not return to the job."
good,"The mall that I worked in had very little business which made it difficult for a high end counter obtain new business. I actually would use my days off to attend networking events to try to bring in new clientele. I enjoyed working individual with each customer to provide skincare and cosmetics to fit their lifestyles. I found out that a few months after I left the counter was pulled from the store. I was maintaining around $180,000 in current sales but the counter need $300,000 to remain in the store."
good,"8 to 12 hr shifts."
good,Good people to work with.  The job is hard and stressful.  The pay is on the lesser side.
good,"A typical day would be arriving at the store at 6AM and put out the new merchandise out into the selling floor. Each brand has its own locations and each clothing item has to be fashinoably presentable. I had to make sure the Brand and and floor space i was giving to work with is presentable, neat and catches the consumers eyes."
good,great place to work if you like to be pressured into selling credit cards. and the whole months November-January you cannot request off.
good,The maanagers congradulated us and gave us a prize everytime we sold a credit card. Worked with a dynamic staff and management.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked in the Womens shoes department. The staff was ok but the changed managers often
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, only thing I would say is that everything is more political than it may seem, but that can be said about most companies."
good,Had the pleasure of working for Macy's as a Loss Prevention Detective for 3+years. Macy's is a very busy company when it comes to external and internal theft. Have made many trips to the local courthouse(as much as 2-3 times a week) to testify as an expert witness. Have had some of the best supervisors while working for this company.
good,The best and most enjoyable part about this job was the customers. I rarely had a difficult customer. My co-workers were very team oriented.
good,"All departments are enjoyable to work within! I worked in costume jewelry, watches, junior prom dresses, ladies suites and dresses. The hardest part of the job is the fitting room. Most enjoyable part is additional advertised discount coupons given to the customer and employees. I has a great boss in one department, and a boss that watched over your shoulder in another department. You never know..."
good,"Cashier, Help out customer, make sales, and inventory."
good,"Some co-workers were nicer than others. Management is okay, some are nicer and more helpful than others. The downfall of working there was mainly when it was a non-sales day because there aren't any customers. The system for hours was pretty easy to learn how to do. It was pretty convenient to pick up available shifts or swap shifts with someone"
good,Make small amount of money to do a lot of work. Don’t really get appreciated for it either
good,From the moment you walk through the door until the moment you go home it is non stop at Macy's. There is always an opportunity to learn something new as a sales manager. You are encouraged to learn other department aside from your own which makes for a well rounded and savvy sales manager. The hardest part for me is making the time to coach my associates but I always do make the time nonetheless. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all new people everyday. There is never a dull moment working in retail!!!
good,"Nice staff, I enjoy fashion: so this job was a good fit for me."
good,"I enjoy that here is always a task to be completed. The most challenging part is making sure every sales sign is either put up or taken down before the store opens, that is a daily goal that I set for my self and I rarely miss meeting that goal."
good,"A typical day at work included reviewing diaries, making three point contacts and daily communication with injured workers, vendors, doctors and attorneys."
good,"Great job, to gain customer service skill and great marketing experience"
good,"The work environment varied between a fast and slow pace. This is a pretty easy job overall, especially if you like sales and working with people."
good,I greet the customers when they walk in...ask them f they need any Help on finding a item.I learned how to be Patient with others.Management was okay..Co-workers was cool and Helpful when  needed Help.The hardest part of the Job was I always on my Feet.The most enjoyable part is Meeting New People
good,A typical day starts at 5:30 am. I figure out what department I'm working and get to it. I learn how to merchandise and how to do inventory. My manager is very nice as well as my co-workers. There are no hard parts to my job. It is relatively easy. I enjoy stocking shoes.
good,"Worked at Macy's while pregnant, twice.  Coworkers were enjoyable and accepted me as pregnant and still a solid worker"
good,"this is a good company to work for, I'm part time. I work in"
good,a typical day can be hectic since i work  in women shoes. since working here i have gained a lot of patience and product knowledge about shoes.
good,"I worked at Macy's on and off for several years. I enjoyed working there and loved the customers and made some really great friends there. The only thing i didn't like about working there was the hours, i didn't like working until midnight."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,My typical day is me going to work straight after school all tired but as soon as I clocked in and my co-workers greet me I felt an abundance of energy came to me and hours past working and laughing made it felt like minutes.
good,I worked 2 jobs and Macy's was the most flexible employer.  I often came to Macy's after working 8 hours at my other job.
good,It's been over ten years since I have worked at Macy's. I do not remember much. I do remember it is retail and customer service is very important.
good,Enjoyed working for Macy's it drives you to work hard and gives you the unique opportunity to build report with customers co workers at the time I worked there was great literally like A second family the hardest part of the job was driving yourself to work hard and make every customer experience with you A memorable one
good,"A typical day working in retail is normally quiet in the mornings, in which gives you time to clean and bring the store back together with go backs and fixing the floor. Everyday I learn something different whether it be talking and asking co-workers are simply helping a customer find what he/she is looking for. I haven't really found anything that difficult about my job, but one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the satisfaction you get from helping customers and seeing them leave the department store happy and having them come back to you for more merchandise."
good,"A typical day at work involves tracking daily sales and purchase order logs in the morning. Later in the day, projects will include sorting samples, creating buy sheets, creating product in order management software, writing purchase orders and attending strategy meetings with vendors. "
good,"Only worked here for a month or two for the Thanksgiving season. The people I worked with were nice, pay was good, and I stayed busy."
good,"Macys is great place for those who need part time work and arent really looking into staying. Management seems to be all over the place and co workers are either snotty or dont know anything about the product they are selling. The best part about working for macys was the the pay, only if you are in a commission position. The worst are the goals they have people try and reach sometimes its beyond reachable."
good,"greet customers , nice people to work with could use some manager training"
good,I overall enjoy working at macys wonderful customer service experiences
good,"Working at a clothing store can be very busy & fast paced at all times, you just have to have patience & you'll be fine. I've learned to always have my customers happy with what they're looking for. The hardest part about my job was to design a table, so it could attract our customers to buy the product. The most enjoyable part about my job was around the holidays (mainly Christmas)."
good,Not a bad place to work . Working at a flagship has its perks but it also comes with a lot of work with not great pay
good,Typical retail experience. The hardest part was getting my department back to normal and making sure everything was returned to its right full location
good,"Working at this company has greatly increased my communication skills. From dealing with many customers to also assisting my co-workers, this job has not only helped with the way I multitask, but it has also helped me to come out of my shell in ways I thought where not in my character. Holidays and sales events where sometimes challenging but believing in myself and absorbing the skills of my co-workers that came before me has allowed me to set aside my insecurities and do my job effectively."
good,Macys is a good company to work for. The scheduling makes it easy for you if u have upcoming events
good,If you enjoy being on your feet and talking then you will like working at Macy's.
good,Everyday I would check my stock and take special orders. I learned how to load and dock semis. The management was very uniforming.
good,"A typical work day at Macy's as a Price Adjuster consisted of reading inventory sheets, finding the item in the jewelry, women's accessories, clothing, and lingerie departments and adjusting the price for that item.  The hardest part of the job was placing clothes on new racks on after their prices were adjusted.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a friendly group of people.  I learned how to merchandise as well as read inventory sheets in order to adjust the prices on each item."
good,"i make sure all products are in tacted and in order, and i help customers with whatever they need help with or have any questions about"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Morning meetings, coaching and training before opening. Selling men's area open credit accounts, I did men's fitting for suits and pants. Worked with customers to complete outfits. I enjoyed the customer interacts the most."
good,"Working for Macy's is probably just like working for any other retail store in the country. I loved the people I worked with, and the work itself was enjoyable, but being part time means there isn't a lot of job security or a long list of benefits to make the job matter more than the paycheck it provides. There wasn't anything wrong with Macy's as an organization, and in fact I can't say anything negative about the company itself. Selling clothing teaches you a lot about human interaction and persuasion, especially around the holidays. Most days I was straightening racks and trying to keep myself busy until the end of my shift. I didn't work at a very big store, so unless it was the weekend or we had a big sale, there wasn't a lot of business to help me along in meeting my goals."
good,This was a great part time job while on summer break from school.
good,I love working with the people i worked with but the company should get a little bit better with how they tell the new hires anout the company policies.
good,"theres always alot of poeple"
good,ok people ok management ok customers working long hours never stopped complaining about everything
good,I worked as a seasonal sales associate. It was a good seasonal job during the holidays.
good,A typical day at work consist of opening the department.  Greeting all guest as they enter the store or your department. I don't usually learn anything unless a vendor come in that day.  Management is ok when you are able to find one.  I enjoy working with my co-works from my department.  The hardest part of my job was getting a manager to come take care of a customer that nee there assistance.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when I would have a customer come back ad let me know how much the enjoyed the item/s I assisted them in choosing.
good,"busy and a lot costumer service"
good,"I worked long hours  from 10 AM to 7 PM, so I had lots of time to accomplish my tasks.  A typical day was recovery, customer service, cashiering, merchandising and price changes. I learned how to be a bra fitter and excellent customer service skills.  Management was there if we needed them.  I met many fun hard workers at Macy's.  The hardest part of my job was seeing the disappointment on a customer's face if we were out of a size she needed.  The best part of my day was knowing that I really helped a customer find her correct size and that the customer was happy with my service."
good,"Clear goals for the day to complete."
good,nice place to meet different background of people. co workers are fine. management is great and understanding. the most enjoyable part is being able to help customers leave the store with things they didn't even realize they wanted.
good,"A typical day at work would include opening all registers, bringing in trash cans, and completing daily audits. We are required to restock any floor samples when needed, return merchandise brought from other departments back to where they belong to ensure an organized and presentable workplace. Greeting every customer, inspiring to buy, and celebrating each purchase is a must. My coworkers were the best part of the job, besides ensuring great customer service. Management always took care of any problem I was having. The hardest part of the job would have to be on sales days, most of the time we were packed and even with six other associates on the floor it is easy to get overwhelmed with juggling customers. All in all, though I enjoyed being on my feet and always working, talking to customers and making sure they had a wonderful shopping experience. I've never had a complaint against me, even on the busiest days of the year and was repeatedly marked as one of the top sellers in my department for the week."
good,"Every shift one is required to review their sales goal for the day, meet and exceed that goal and acquire a Macy's store account credit."
good,"it was ok job , management could have use some training . other then that i really enjoyed working at this company. i love to help people and this job allow me to"
good,Very busy especially during the holidays. A lot of tedious work.
good,Interactive and well established business. However pay rate does not compensate work load.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The management and co-workers were pleasant and caring. The work environment was hectic and demanding, especially around the holidays. It did though, give me experience on working in a high paced environment. The pay was lousy, but for what it is, it was fair."
good,"The shoe department was very fast paced, and interactive with customers, which was my ideal work place because I enjoy talking with people, and finding out there style."
good,"i spent most of my time working in the young men's dept."
good,"Being at Macy's was an exceptional learning experience. It allowed me to use skills that I have built over the years of being in retail and apply them to more personal interactions. I built many work/clientele relationships while I was there. That, in turn, allowed me to up my selling intake and build my daily sales goal. "
good,"Great working environment, I had great co-workers and the management did their best to manage us. The hardest part of the job was Standing in one spot for 8 hours."
good,"Macy's is a stable company that provides comfortable standards.  The pay is reasonable and can be negotiated.  However, the ability to convince customers to apply for store credit cards can be trying at times.  There is also a weekly score card that is strongly implemented to gauge your personal achievements/failures.  This includes the amount of store credit accounts activated per week, sales goal & improvement or loss, items per transaction, sale returns, adding customers to a store registry, amount of repeat customers.  If an employee is able to meet these expectations per week/month/year---it is celebrated with a paper certificate. These requirements are not unheard of when working in a retail corporate environment, but it can ""feel"" overwhelming.  Macy's does at times promote from within.  Healthcare is offered to full time employees."
good,"Management is extremely negative, not a solid team environment, not enjoyable."
good,"•	Assist Clientele as they enter office and via phone"
good,"My work experience at Macys overall was good. My job was a sales associate , cashier and greeter. Helping a customer find the perfect item  is a great feeling. Our goal is to make sure our customers walk out happy with everything they asked for."
good,okay place to work. pay is terrible. no home life. I did love my coworkers.
good,"The only time I made money was during the holidays because i was commission based employee in the men's dept. Any other seasons, I barely made money, no matter how hard I worked. But Overall, it was an ok job. I Met some pretty cool people."
good,"Working in customer service is always a challenge, and though I dealt with some difficult customers, I also was able to meet some very nice people and help them find what they were looking for. I felt at times like there was too much expected of us during a shift - for example, cleaning the fitting rooms, organizing and putting away merchandise from the fitting room racks, assisting customers, keeping the sales floor clean, and trying to make a sales goal on the register could often get overwhelming. But it even though it was a challenge, I did my best to rise to the occasion. It was also difficult because I was in my first trimester of a pregnancy when I worked here, and was unaware of it, so that had an effect on my work performance."
good," My experience at Macys was one of excitement and some anguish but over all I still have fond memories of the three years I was there."
good,this was a work place where they only worried about macys they did not have a value for emoloyees need working for them they did not honor my school schedule the was presented upon request to work for them 
good,"Macy's is a good place to work. If your someone who has a good eye for fashion, then this job is definitely a job for you."
good,"Not enough hours, black friday is mandatory which is ok for me but i was sick and was unable to make it on thanksgiving night so I lost my job. Which is unfair to me, I worked downstairs all alone in a section where no one came or anything. And for a major company the employee discount is horrible! "
good,my typical day at work is I stand on my feet for a long time cleaning and assisting customers. I have learned new concepts about the register everyday. Just recent I Have learn how to add a customer as my client on the register.With management I feel like they have favorite employees like the store manager Pam. Not only is the boss she has been acting unprofessional towards me and saying rude and smart comments towards me. My accomplishes at work is always oversees. I get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part about this job is that you are do not have time to act have a life because your always working open to close. The other apart about it is the one day sales and they schedule everyone and they would lock their shift in not know that we have other plans. The most enjoyable part of the job is you can work in different areas.
good,I have learned how to be more patient with other people and I am better in customer service. I mean there is always someone that comes in and is very rude but I have also learned how to keep a big smile and just continue to be friendly and not to let anything or anyone ruin my day. I just keep the day going by having a positive vibe. There are also coworkers that can be very nice one minute and than all of a sudden they turn on you but I don't let that get to me either. The hardest part is trying to keep up with the star rewards meaning trying to open up a credit when nearly half of the customers are tourist even than that doesn't stop me from asking because they can have a house out here and a passport for them to still be able to open up a card with Macys. I enjoy seeing my customers happy and just knowing that they came in the store and I made there day that just makes me so happy.
good,"Check cash crop for cleanliness, help all customers with questions and concerns. Walk floor in search for unorganiztion or curious customer. In courage style and using my opinion helps.Co workers are great we have great conversations during free time but the team work is what has helped me the most. My most enjoyable part is helping women with fashion sense I am great at that!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Clock in via employee number into telephone in cubicles. Answer calls to assist with order input and confirmations of payments and shipping addresses. Hardest part of job was being on telephone for 4 or more hours, not having any interpersonal contact. Enjoyable part was the full cafeteria, and the local fast food restaurants."
good,Great people to work with and the manager but it closed down!
good,"This job allowed me a sense of relaxation. It was not  demanding and in turn was not beneficial to my hunger for growth. It was an opportunity for retail experience, but not for initial progression."
good,"As I transitioned from one retail job to another, I felt really frustrated as I was not afforded the proper training, tools, etc. to fulfill my job requirements. I was a support associate who had to place new and existing merchandise on the sales floor from incoming freight as well as from the stockrooms. I had to back stock the excess merchandise the stockrooms neatly maintain them clean and accessible which was difficult as the sales floor team would enter them and misplace items frequently. The coworkers who had been there longest were difficult to get along, even new coworkers would make comments because they were so set in their ways. the new coworkers were friendly but did not last due to the latter statement as well as the job was very demanding with no help at times. The most enjoyable part was that if you are a fulltime or permanent part-time  are given paid holidays off, paid vacation, and other little added benefits."
good,"It's not all it's cracked up to be, but they make it easy to balance your time between work and life. This makes it feasible as a stepping stone between the job and your next move. There's no micro management but they only have eyes for your numbers if you work in sales in terms of growth. "
good,"They expect too much from their employees. If you don't sign up a certain amount of people for credit cards, you may get fired."
good,"Keept me busy, great people to work with. very high on going above and beyond for the customers "
good,"No customer is the same in the cosmetic departments. You must treat every customer as your first, even if you're at the end of your long shift or you're not feeling well, they need to feel that associates want them to be there. I learned more about retail in that there are many different positions but they all lead to customer is #1. You need different types of people and personalities on a team to balance and learn from each other. My job is surrounded with women, co-workers and customers. Women can be moody, harsh, and annoying. I always put emotions aside, and deal with the situation in front of me with the utmost respect for the other person and professionalism. However, working with makeup was the most joyous part of it. Women love makeup and will do a lot to keep skin looking young and they will listen to the professionals without a doubt. They trust me to give them the right skincare and makeup. We, associates, customize and tailor a skincare routine according to the customer's main concerns and skin type and they truly appreciate it."
good,A typical work day consisted of cash register duties along with fitting room maintenance and dealing one on one with customers and phone calls from other stores
good,Macy's was a very competitive work place that gave out lots of experience such as the value of a customer good treatment priority's although the company had good point it had flaws lots of favoritism and bad management but still very enjoyable place to work.
good,This position was very customer focused. I enjoyed merchandising and assisting customers. 
good,"Working for Macy's I have had to opportunity to challenge myself everyday. Every customer is different and has different needs and concerns to be met. I have been privileged to not only work with but also be educated by prestige cosmetic brands such as Urban Decay, Smashbox, Bare Minerals, Too-Faced, Stila, Philosophy, Stri-Vectin, Benefit etc.  Product knowledge can be challenging with so many different brands to choose from but it keeps you motivated to learn more. I love working with my fellow associates who also share the passion I have for the beauty industry. The most rewarding part of my  job is make my customers look and feel beautiful and walk away with an experience not just a product."
good,A typical day at work would be to help the customers find what their looking for. as for be hard it would have to be trying to make sure all the clothes are put back on the floor from big sale events so customers dont have hard trouble finding them. my co workers are team players and we get along.
good,its a ok paying job meant for college kids not adults  need something better not to struggle with
good,"handle cash register, clean dressing rooms, clean and organize display floor."
good,Co-workers are great. We manage to finish everything by working as a team.
good,"Working at Macy's originally started as a quick seasonal job for me to take on while I was going to school at NOVA. My position was as an On-Call Employee, which eventually met with inconvenient scheduling (which is to be expected of this type of position)."
good,its a great first time job or even something for a few months.
good,"Good company to work for if you need a part-time job.  "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Co-workers were friendly"
good,while at macys i was responsible for mannequins . I also was a part time sales associate .
good,"Run registers check in merchandise meet and greet customers,most managers were good although some were unqualified,great co-workers,simple easy job,and no part of my job duties were hard."
good,I changed prices on merchandise. I did recovery and organized merchandise. I helped with display. 
good,I usually stocked and assisted customers with their purchases. 
good,"This was a seasonal position.A typical shift would begin around 5-6 am and would usually end aound 10 am. Depending on how busy the store was, you may be asked to stay until 1 pm. As far as the work youre setting up new merchandise and putting away the old stuff. These things included clothes, accessories ,toys, and etc. Not a hard job to do it just requires a lot of lifting ,bending,kneeling and standing. It would be best to wear comfortable shoes. & your uniform consist of black pants and black shirt."
good,"Co operative and helpful staff, learnt many things from this company.had explore myself over here."
good,"-There is no typical day at work, everyday is a different and new day"
good,While working at Macy's I learned the importance of customer relations. I had a cool manager that told me what had to be done and how to do it then left me to do it. If I had question it was hard to find him because the store was so big but I always had employees that were usually willing to help me. The hardest part of my job was trying to find the manager when needed by a customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in such a big store and having the employee discount.
good,Its a decent job. I would recommend the job depends on the position. 
good,"Enjoy being busy time runs faster meeting new people with varied"
good,It was a fun place to work not to mention the discounts were great but they were very hard on meeting quotas. If you didn't meet your quota you had a deadline to meet it if not you had to start looking for another job.
good,"Customer oriented. Focus on customer, sales goals and daily up keep of store. Offered benefits.  "
good,"Customer service, Cashier, Help customers with merchandise, answered phone calls, keep department(juniors) clean, and organize"
good,"I love Macy's solely based on the fact of my coworkers and certain managers. Overall I think that Macy's needs to work out a few things, and should learn to appreciate their employees (managers included) a bit more. A typical day at work includes taking stock out of the stock room, completing the DIF (Destroy in Field) report, selling products to customers to make a sales goal, and opening ""Star Rewards"" (Macy's Credit Card). I learned that you just have to roll with the punches, because whether it be coworkers, customers, or management, your whole day will be made or broken by these peoples' actions and attitudes. I also learned that no matter how wrong the customer actually is, in Macy's eyes the customer is always right, even if they're borderline abusive to the associates. The hardest part of the job is opening credits, everyone and their mother has a macys charge. The easiest is making good connections with nice customers. Overall macys management needs to improve. I feel like some managers dont care about their employees like they should, but others are fantastic. And where I work in cosmetics i love just about everyone, which is very rare. One thing macys needs to change besides their hourly pay rate is their return policy. you can literally return just about anything without a problem which is so annoying to associates."
good,"i work with a great team. management is great, my manager is really helpful."
good,"o	Deal with customer problems and help come up with the best solutions as an empowered associate."
good,Great location at Firewheel Town Center. Enjoyed working with dedicated co-workers.
good,"Using the rules of ""Magic"" I was taught how to use product knowledge in order to inspire a purchase. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,They hire too many people and they don't know what to do with them so you are basically just walking around the store doing basically nothing. It was an unorganized place to work.
good,Plenty of work and during the holiday seasons very busy. Enough work to stay busy throughout the day!
good,"I am not a great sales person, so when I am required to sell credit cards I was not so great."
good,When you needed a supervisor or manger they were slow to respond which customers wait and get angry.
good,it was a great company it helped me increase my customer service skills and to better interact with people
good,Working at Macys was an interesting experience. I gained some valuable skills that i feel have been useful with other jobs and enjoyed working there. 
good,once i got to work i would speak to my supervisor see what i needed to do for the day. i would be with my coworkers joking around while working taking it easy. my supervisor was cool she was strict when she needed to be but laid back at the same time. the hardest part of the job was trying to fix an area while customers where looking at the clothes. 
good,At Macy's I became part of a family in the the department I worked in. I helped costumers find what they where looking for. I helped them find other sizes if needed. My Manager was a great team leader. I loved meeting new people.
good,"Worked on floor with clothes racks."
good,The environment is okay. Considering I've been there for a while I have seen the company shift to hiring more on-call associates which makes the jobs harder for full time and part time associates left. The job itself is not hard and if you are looking for some extra money it is not a bad place to work. 
good,"The typical day consist of cashiering and merchandising. I've learned the value of customer courtesy. The management was never really available unless needed by staff for serious issues. The hardest part of the job was keeping the money the company paid you, your money because there is always something to buy! The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount. "
good,"Options to try differnt jobs"
good,"A typical day at macys was fast pased and this was during the holiday season. I learned how to work their cashier machines, which were hard. the manager was strict but if you had a problem she would try her best to work things out with you. The hardest part of the job was working during rush hours. the most enjoyable part was the discounted lunch."
good,I do not have the desire to work for this company ever again. The management is unprofessional and belittling. Management tends to try to intimidate its employees. Co-workers were the best part of the job. 
good,"A typical day at Macys includes socializing with customers both old and new , helping out with fun in-store events as well as maintaining communicatiopn throughout the day with the team in which you work on the sales floor. The hardest part of the job would be obtaining credit card accounts from new customers , the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to guide the customer in making purchases and show your creative side when putting together outfits."
good,"challenging and sometimes overwhelming"
good,It is a great place to work. the engagement and a team atmosphere are awesome. There are individuals there that real go out of their way to help develop their associates to get the most effort out of them. I would recommend it a good place to work.
good,"Busy making goals."
good,Didn't work there long enough to have much to say about Macys but their employees were kind of rude at the start. I think they were just hesitant to except a newbee but they seemed to warm up eventually. Ok place to work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's isn't the worst or the best place to work at. For one thing, being completely on draw plus commission in Florida isn't always the best just because the amount of store traffic that correlates with the sales tend to be inconsistent. One week it can be busy, the next being very slow. It leads co-workers to being very sneaky when it comes to preying on customers and stealing sales. The idea and feeling of deficit is like depression and is never a fun thing to be in!"
good,my co-workers were the best got along and enjoyed working with them.
good,We wasn't just co workers we immediately became friends and work together always. when there was a problem we all work together to solve it and got the job done. I enjoyed working at macys.
good,"I definitely learned people skills, I disliked that I needed to make a quota each shift and persuade customers into buying more."
good,"Flexible schedule while as college student. "
good,Typical day included maintaining cleanliness of cosmetics counters and supplies.  Assist guests with finding the perfect cosmetics for their needs
good,"A bit demanding with the massive work load for little pay (minimum wage), managers work with your schedule"
good,"Learned alot about merchandising all depts. Co-workers were great. Alot of management turnover, some store managers were great to work for and learn new management skills."
good,Enjoy my job at Macys I've learned quite a bit about retail and people. Mostly enjoyed my coworkers and the interaction with them
good,Help customers find what they are looking for. Did customer service.
good,basically what i did was pack up merchandise and prepared it to be shipped to the customers. My the position was linked to the corporate office so we were like the corporate office inside of the store. I learned other tasks if others were absent. 
good,As much as I liked working there. I would hardly see the managers. workers there once off the clock didn't want to explain something to a new employee. Very unprofessional.
good,Learned how to be a cashier here. Very easy and simple job. Management were very easy to work with and very flexable. Most co-workers were very helpful and fun to work with.
good,i liked the job the people and the place i worked but it was for christmas time only
good,"Working with customers every day. Some customers may be pleasant others not so much. It does give you a chance to work with people from all over which gives you better people skills. Selling and Loyalty goals aren't to strict. However, it does indicate your performance. Co-workers can be lazy just like any other job. You get to meet new people and work with people of all ages."
good,"Interacting with customers on daily basis, selling cosmetics products quickly and efficiently, building customer connection by adding them to a client book and following with survey about customer satisfaction, meet the target set by the company, handling cash/ atm cards/checks, opening credit card accounts."
good,"Daily interaction with customers, providing excellent and knowledgable service help customers."
good,This was my 1st experience in retail and it was very different from any other work experience I've had. There was no typical at Macy's. Every day bought different challenges. Management there constantly stayed on edge which kept everyone on edge. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and very helpful in training me to be the best I could be in my short amount of time.
good,"Your typical work day at Macys consists of providing excellent customers service. At macys I learnt how to multi-task, listen and also how to have patience. The Management team is excellent. The team provides with all the information you need to move forward in the business, and also to assist you in your everday work experience."
good,"average work area, good people to work with constant work, flexible hours and great hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The managers were always helpful and understanding. Let you choose your own schedule and the best training before you work with customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to help customers find the clothing pieces that they were looking for and help make suggestions on alternate options. Oversee fitting room and put away clothing, cash register. The hardest part of the job was black Friday through the Christmas holiday. The work load was increased greatly during this period but I looked at it as a challenge to complete and maintain a clean fitting room and floor area."
good,i liked working here great employees but the company does not care about there people
good,A typical day at work is assisting customers with purchases and transactions metting daily goals and being friendly at all times.
good,Worked with a lot of customers all the time at a high paced volume.
good,"Interior Design has been a life passion, I'm very talented and great on a personal level with clients. Honest, hardworking, and self motivated."
good,Macys is all about customer service. Everyday managers review the the productivity from the previous day. Management is very helpful for the most part. The job is really easy so everyone IS replaceable and they make it obvious. Co worker are very friendly and helpful for the most part.
good,"Macy's as a whole, is an ok place to work. What I loved is there were plenty of room for advancement. What I didn't like, was that there's a lot of cliques as far as supervisor/employees. Those who follow behind the sups, were the first to advance within the company."
good,"Only there 3 months, but enjoyed time there.Would selling and speaking different ones daily was a highlight on every day."
good,"I worked over the phone, Internet Chat and E-Mails to work out a customers request about their Macy's or Bloomingdale's credit card account. I worked with confidential information. We had to have a certain amount of calls or E-Mails done by the end of the day. We had to say certain tags as well and got graded on how we handled the call, chat or E-Mail professionally. The hardest part of the job was making my calls shorter and more to the point. I am very talkative. I'm also not the fastest typist. The most enjoyable part of the job is how many different events the company has each year."
good,"I was usually working alone. I didnt really like the long hours working alone, i felt i needed aleast one person to talk to."
good,"At Macys, I learned to be patient with people, Management there are really nice and helpful when ever you have questions."
good,varied and fast paced retail. management was not efficient or supportive.
good,"good benefits,good discount,the Macys store in New York is amazing"
good,It was hectic but fun.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"-Hit the floor running! Preparing sales while working with teams, customers, management, and vendors."
good,Answered incoming calls from customers. How to be a operator. Management and co-workers were positive. The few rude customers were the hardest part of the job. The enjoyable part of this job was being able to help costumers.
good,"the hours that they had you scheduled for were extremely long and if they had overtime availbale that day it was mandatory that you stayed and completed the overtime, If you left early and did not work the overtime, you recieved an attendance point"
good,It was the perfect pace for me but if you cant sell not a very good job to have.
good,"Working for Macy's was a pleasure. If it wasn't for the closing of our regional buying office, I would've stayed with the company. Merchandising is fast-paced and can be stressful, but it is also exciting and rewarding. Seeing your assortment on the floor and seeing customers responding to them in a positive way gives a person a real sense of accomplishment. Buying trips to meet with vendors and preview upcoming seasons were also a great benefit of the job!"
good,"Great opportunity to meet new people everyday, make them feel comfortable with themselves and help them pick the best makeup and skin care product for their type of skin. I participated in the execution of special events/promotions to achieve personal selling and service goals; performed cash handling, arranged table displays, markdowns, inventory and organized sales merchandise. My favorite moment was, went we had a Girls Night Out and I was able to dance Flamenco!."
good,"Worked Independantly, flexible hours, enjoyed working through the holiday season, worked in all departments in the company."

good,"I stayed busy dealing with customers, organizing the merchandise and made it fun. I was inspired by the customer and my customer service skills. The customers would keep me on my toes with educating me on my products. Management and co- workers were always available to asist me and customers."
good,"A typical day at work, would be fun and productive."
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's during the holidays. It was fun and I learned a lot as well. The only thing that was on going was that there were never any discounts or sales on the cosmetics. I feel that it should be a good thing to have at least Christmas.
good,Working at Macy's offers lots of new and exciting challenges. Every day is a different day. I've worked with many different people in this company and it taught me how to collaborate across all teams. I've learned many skills here that I find quite valuable. Macys continues to be the Harvard of retail.
good,Macy's is an high end store and was always busy. My co-workers were nice as well as the supervisors.
good,I've loved my managers but not the mangers of surround departments.
good,The co-workers are likeable...Would prefer to get the day over and done with.
good,Consists of a fast pace
good,"cleaned entire building, garbage, moped, clean bathrooms"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,"A day at work in Macy's consists of, helping customers, maintaining the selling floor and encouraging customers to open Macy's Star reward cards"
good,Convenient with school or second job with online schedule maker
good,"When hiring on, it was difficult to get the necessary training scheduled and completed."
good,"While the company strives to create a friendly and enthusiastic work environment for its employees by implementing things like morning rallies to rev up for the day, the work environment remains dismal and the pressures high. The sales goals are generally impossibly high and if they are not met you can expect a stern talking to with your manager which includes and allusion to being let go. This creates friction among peers at the same cash register who compete for sales and results in a negative atmosphere. The sales goals also force sales associates to neglect the aesthetics of their department. There is also the pressure to open the Macys credit cards which I understand the necessity of pushing card openings but in my experience working there, to open an account you either need to get lucky or trick the clients into thinking it isn't a credit card. Most of my peers took advantage of the foreign or elderly to open accounts. In conclusion, if you have limited work experience it isn't a bad place to start however the toxic atmosphere and constant pressure will eventually weigh down on even the most enthusiastic employees."
good,"Working overnight was challenging, but very eventful. I would inbound and outbound all the trailers that came to the building. They carried all the merchandise for the store. I was responsible for knowing the stores needs and what all the department managers needed for there specific floors for either a sale or holiday event."
good,I had never worked retail prior to the holiday season 2011. Overall I was pleased. Very hands off organization. Ability to change pricing for customers is easy.
good,"Learned that appearance is everything, and my attitude can change a persons mood."
good,Working at Macy's was a great opportunity and I learned a lot in a short period of time...
good,I was an operations manager in the womens shoe department at Macys in Farmington Ct. It was a double door location and definately had alot of merchandise. I would oversee the process of the merchandise reciepts and making sure that they were being processed to the sales floor in a timely manor. I also would set up the selling floor with associates that worked for me and make sure that the stockroom was in order. I also assisted with being a manager in charge during my shifts for other departments that needed assistance from an executive. There was quite a bit of anxiety involved with this position because you didn't know when the position might be eliminated due to cuts every February. I enjoyed working with the sales associates and my fellow employees.
good,Loved the employees and customers just didn't enjoy the dis-organization of the company!
good,I learned to be patient with the general shopping public and to respect other co-workers work space. The managers were friendly and provided a lot of help when I had questions or concerns.

Being employed at this company help me to cope with other people, customers and as well as associates. I am very appreciated by my co-workers. They are very nice to me and willing to provide help whenever I need. For the hardest part of the job, I would say sometime customers' issues can be a little bit stressful , but for the most part we associates get that under control by providing necessaty help to fix that. Finally, the most enjoyable is when one meets his goal, and even higher than his/her goal, he or she is excited, sometimes we make some jokes, get the atmosphere vibrates..etc.."
good,left you to figure out what you were supposed to do. one or two days of training and then left to fend for yourself.
good,Your not their long enough to really know managers There is a reason they have been in business for over 100 years. Pay is better then min wage.
good,"very good cemployers treat us very good. always make sure that take you lunche break.They give you freedom to choose your own schedule so u can ballance work in life,"
good,"With the high turnover of employees in this environment there tends to be a young mindset and a continual desire to be hip. At initial glace one might think that its a ""great"" company but it does have its blemishes. With the recent changes ""so i heard"" of corporate level in which each Macys is ran entirely by one offices out east. The ways of doing things arent the same, needless to say some are very stuck in their ways"
good,Pulling and selling to clients in the immediate area
good,I enjoyed utilizing some of my talents in fashion and design.
good,"Restocking items, greeting and helping customers find what they need, answering product questions, and making sales goals."
good,"A typical day at work will be running to get shoes that comes up on the pick list,helping with shipment, recovering shoes from the floor. I learned how to run and get shoes, How to put away and make room for new stock inventory. The management is pretty much decent so are the co workers. Its really a nice place to work. The hardest part would be markdowns, Its not really hard just boring. I like to be active on the go thats why I would have to say running to get shoes is more enjoyable part."
good,I learned so much working at Macy's. I met great managers and coworkers that were so helpful to me and made it fun. I obtained great customer skills and learned how to communicate better with people.
good,"A typical day working at Macy's consists of a lot of responsibilities. Since I began working at Macy's I have only seen my manager twice. For about a month, I wasn't sure who my manager was. Management lacked communication in every possible way. My co-workers are great and they helped me learn a lot more about my position and my responsibilities such as: how to fold clothes properly, how to work the dock, how to organize a stock room, and how to properly maintain the facility. The hardest part of the job is dealing with extremely rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with other people out on the floor when they need assistance."
good,did different types of things and learned alot from this job. My co-workers were nice for the most part and got along with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday

good,"I was hired here to work stock and cashier a bit. This however only ended up being for two days. It was an enjoyable job. Not to hard, and part of it was talking to people, which I enjoyed."
good,"The work days were productive. During the time I was employed at Macy's I was able to learn the procedures used in the higher end retail store then that of a department store. The hardest part of the job was accepting the pay rate, despite the previous retail experience the pay was based on seasonal work and any pay increase that was promised was not given. The most enjoyable part of the job were the other associates and the ability to see merchandise prior to putting it on display for the customers."
good,Challenging and creative work environment that constantly pushes your problem solving and time management skills.

This position fosters leadership skills, requires a high level of organization, and communication between all team at the store and district level. It is beneficial to have a good relationship with the merchandising team manager, receiving, manager, and visual manager, the three key support management figures. There must also be excellent communication between the merchandise leads, signing lead, and markdown lead. The hardest part of the job is the limited amount of time allocated for the multiple projects that must be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating an enjoyable shopping environment for the customer with the placement of merchandise."
good,"Part time seasonal. Retail customer service, cashier associate."
good,i asked the management to give me full time but they never respond to me.
good,Rarely worked because it was hard to get hours. The job was fun when i got hours to work
good,"good. ok , well. awesome, great, outstanding, always new adventures. Well in their customer service."
good,worked from 6:00am to 3:00pm just stocking shelfs and stockroom
good,"The day begins by walking the sales floor with my assistant to make sure we are 'customer ready' for store opening.I would then go to my office to read emails,review sales reports and take appropriate actions to address business opportunities.At 7am I would meet with my support team members to lay out the day's workload."
good,Very good people. Flexible schedule. Very good part time job.
good,you can build a great foundation on your retail career while working here.hardest part of the job can be handling the many moods and customers.
good,Its always busy but were still doing our job well. My co-workers are kind to each other.
good,Helping customer's achieve they'er goal.Working with the public takes time and patience .It is rewarding to see a customer smile and say Thank You for your time.
good,Good workplace where you get to talk to different customer everyday.
good,Friendly atmosphere and fast pace. Always on your toes for what is going to come next. Takes value in the customer and providing them with the best service necessary.
good,I liked working at this place I was able to meet different people and learn new things.
good,It was rare to find good managment there.The human resource department was lacking.The biggest benefit of the job was being able to check your paycheck and schedule online.Also being able to swap shifts online.They put to much pressure on employee's to get customers to open credit cards with the store
good,"My duties at Macy's were as followed: I provided customer service by working in the fine Jewelry department by assisting each client with they're Jewelry purchase and offering them a Macy's credit card that would facilitate their purchase. My other duties also consisted with cashier handling by taking payments from customers for their purchase or for their credit card payments. Because I accomplished all my sales goals I was promoted to work for Macy's Furniture Department to continue with my customer service duties but with exclusiveness and more knowledgeable product sales associate experience. All my duties consisted with helping my clients to make a knowledgeable furniture purchase, placing the order in the computer and setting a convenient delivery date for them and taking their credit card payment of cash payment on the register."
good,"Meeting your sales goal every day is important. Getting to knkw the product is important. Looking out for new styles and trends is important. Management coukd be helpful, but found them to not care a lot about it's employees. I know it is business, but the employees are people too. Not a very difficult job, but does requireis a lot of patience. The people who work their are very nice and social. Your co-workers are very easy to get along with."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's recruited me straight out of College and developed me in a way that has allowed me to be extremely successful in my current role as a sales manager.
good,I started in 09/11 as a a seasonal. I was blessed enough to become a perm in 01/12 at the end of the season. The job started off pretty simple and cool. There are a lot of drastic changes here and if you are a person that doesn't like change this is not the job for you. Their schedules are not single mom or school friendly. If you want a decent pay this is a job but if the other things out weigh that then this not the job for you.
good,"Working in a fast-paced environment, there is always something changing within the company to enhance sales, which keeps you on your feet!"
good,"A typical day at work includes working with clients to choose skin care products and cosmetics to fit their personal needs and skin types. With a job such as this, time management and professionalism is everything. The environment is incredibly competitive because everyone works on commission and has challenging daily sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to teach clients how to apply makeup. The hardest part by far is the tension created between co-workers as we work to meet our goals without stepping all over each other."
good,it's always challenging and keeps me busy there's alot of team work
good,"Has been a stepping stone for me. Starting of as a support associate I appreciated the flexibility in schedule I was offered while finisihng up my Bachelor. Then I sought after the opportunity to be a sales associate as I was in my last semester of school and wanted some different experience as well as better pay. To this date I feel it was a good decision, however I am currently unpleased with the way things are handled/not handled. Management is fickle and changes quite often, lack of fundamental understanding of employee feelings. It has been a stepping stone, one I can not wait to depart."
good,working at Macys Inc was hard busy yet challenging which i appreciated. It was very busy being the main store Herald sqaure but nevertheless i better myself and was asked to return for another year
good,Ensure to meet and exceed all goals set for sales productivity and credit solicitations
good,Good job. Very flexible and understanding. Fun and fast paced but no work on off seasons.
good,"The customers needed assocoiates involvement from beginning to end in the housewares department, but they were easy to work with. Management and the company drives employees to open credit."
good,"all day standing up, NO sitting down, rude co-workers, had to meet a goal of a certain amount of sales, DISCOUNT!"
good,It was a pleasure working at Macy's. I meet great people and had a lot of fun. My managers created a great working and learning environment. I have improved on my customer service and learned how to multitask. The most enjoyable part of the job was meet people from all walks of life.
good,"Commmission position, learned to work as a team to meet sales goal and work in harmony"
good,"Mananging Business of Prestigious Brand,woking challenges day in n out with Goals.....Always giving up best results n Best customer Service with multi-Staff, n team work!"
good,The people I work with are great. A typical day at work would be assisting customer with their needs and resolving any issues that arise. Management is okay to work with. The hardest part of the job was the location and the most enjoyable job was the people.
good,A typical day at Macy's it was busy!
good,Sales orriented atmosphere working with clients in cosmetics.
good,"Everyday was a new experience for me. I learned many aspects of dealing with customers and my coworkers. Its all about team work and communication. If ever there was a co-worker who didn't finish their task on time we would all come together and help as a team to get everything done on time. The managers also tried their best to work together with the associates to help make things easier and less complicated like walking around the floor asking if we need help with the lines, customers, or even to get necessary items such as bags or more gift cards. Overall, this experience was like no other and helped me grow towards understanding multicultural customers and become more independent."
good,for such a busy and established department store you would think they pay employees much more than minimum wage..NOT!!!
good,"A typical day at Macy's was coming in counting money volt in the safe room, making deposits, assigning draws to associates out on sales floor, clean my area, check log for deliveries, assisting customers with exchanges or returns. I learned how to girt wrap in a seamless fashion also how to send off packages through UPS."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work included back stocking, taking care of all customers needs and running the register. I learned to listen to all customer comments to better serve their desires. Management was very friendly. My co-workers were some of the most fun people to be around. The hardest part of my job was the back stocking, some of the product could be quite heavy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with customers and taking care of all their needs. The best time was during holidays."
good,i only worked there for the christmas season and chose not to continue on. it seemed to be a mess as far as planning a schedule and knowing which department you would be in from day to day. with no training for specific departments. only how to work the register.
good,Macy's is a great place to work if your personal and daily life is usually busy or filled with other priorities. They have a flexible schedule to work with. The only thing I do not enjoy about Macy's is the high expectations they set of the employees with just the minimum wage we receive. I would feel a little more obligated to live up to those standards if I knew I was doing it for more than 8/hr. Sometimes I feel like I work at a bootcamp!
good,Learned about customer service and improving sales/ Skills..
good,"This job keeps you on your feet, literally. My co-workers were great as well as management. The hardest part was doing the recovery of clothes. I most enjoyed interacting with people."
good,team members are great! customer base is amazing. I've learned more about clothes. It's so much fun dressing up customers.

good,Macys was fun but I out grew it. I decided to move on.
good,Macy's was a good place to work for they had diversity and made sure everyone was comfortable. I made great friends with my co-workers and meet some great customers as well.
good,"Great place to work if it wasn't for store manager. A total nightmare! Poor up system, no splits on sales. Dog eat dog....especially one female.....always ripping you off! Again Management the worst!!!!!"
good,Unpredictable day
good,"A typical day at macys was pretty basic retail, management needed to work on informing imployees on current sales and events I often heard about events through word of mouth, which thanks to my co-workers saved me at times. the hardest part about workoing at Macys was dealing with the delayed management but besides that it overall was a pleasent job i really got to be myself and made afew long-term relationships!"
good,"I dont typically like retail, it changes too frequently for me. Great starter job though"
good,"Loved my job hate it ended, management was great , my co workers are still my close friends hardest part of the day was closing and the most enjoyable was opening"
good,"Same store just different position. In this position, I worked as a fragrance floater."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The world's largest store. With so many people coming in te the store everyday, it was fun just to be a part of it and to service those people was always fun and interseting. I definitely learned how to mulit task."
good,typical work day for me was stocking everything were they belong. making sure they were in there right section in the store. made sure the displays were maintain and clean and neat. clean all my work equipment. i learned how to be ORGSNIZED. management was helpful. co workers friendly. there were no hard parts. i like what i did.
good,"a typical day at Macy's morning meetings hate them,opening the register, setting a goal for yourself, coming up with a greeting for the day, setting a goal for how many accounts you will open and boy is management pushy about that there accounts is there top priority. The co-workers at Macy's are the reason you go to work."
good,The job was fast paced and productive. I didn't like the way they schedule things though.
good,I liked it it had plenty of diff flexible hours. Worked part time but instill liked it.
good,A typical day consist of unloading trucks and i learned working the hardest doesnt get you promoted.
good,The work space is great.You get ti interact and get to know the customers and you also begin to build a relationship with frequent customers that come in all the time.The customers begin to ask for you and only you; it lets you know that you have been doing your job
good,"Working with the company, was a very great experience for me. As being my first job I have to say I loved working at Macy's."
good,"Fun people to work with, amazing management. Very educational experience."
good,"Open register to process merchandise, assist customers with purchases, making decisions with what products go together to better help customets ."
good,"Open registers, straighten shirt and tie displays according to Macy's standards, assist customers with clothing choices, ring up purchases, process returns and address customer concerns."
good,"I stood all day long, making clients were well taken care of, it was important that clients had a great shopping experience. My co-workers were very nice. It was a fascinating experience to work in the largest department store in the world, this being my first real job."
good,Key holder opened and closed store in a fast paced environment.
good,"This job required a lot of standing, all day. I assisted customers with their shopping needs, and at the end of day, I balanced the register and restocked for next day. I was only part-time. My co-workers were a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was trying to be several places at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of this huge corporation."
good,"Every morning the day began with floor recover, followed by a business review with management. There was always tasks that needed to be completed, but there was never enough merchandisers scheduled for that particular day. A typical day at work included stocking the store, price changes on merchandise, setting up new projects, and sometimes rearranging an entire department. As a lead merchandiser, I learned how to merchandise product appropriately, and show leadership among my team. Hard labor was the hardest part of the job because most of the time there was moving heavy fixtures by yourself, as well as working in a hot building. The most enjoyable was getting recognized by management on hard work and dedication."
good,I had worked for Macy’s department store where I learn to meet customer needs and valuable teamwork skills. Macy’s has taught me to work with the public and to gain knowledge about different types of clothing.
good,Working at Macys was a different experience. I learned how everything worked in the business of retail and also picked up more customer service skills.
good,"I liked my job, liked the time of day I worked. Was only given 12hrs a week to work. I had to leave for more hours."
good,"Love working at Macy's. Co-workes are lovly people to work for and managers are wonderful to work with, just a fun place to work at."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Fun place to work. Employees are very friendly. Mangers are great and very helpful. Customers are very nice.
good,Went above and beyond my call of duty. Co-workers were friendly and very helpful. Was able to switch shifts to accomodate evening classes.
good,I learned a lot about this company while working here. I met a large amount of friendly people and wish i could gain more hours.
good,Pleasant managers always willing to help and never down your throat about anything.
good,I learned how to manage my time with each customer on busy days.
good,"A typical day would be going to my floor manager and seeing where I'm working that day. Helped customers with their purchases. Guided customers to the fitting rooms, handled cash registers, would put clothing to their sections."
good,A typical day consist of getting updates on busniess from the previous day and what needs to be acomplished today to execute a successful day. Co workers are great i've learned a lot from them and continuing to learn as I go. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to coach and train associates on what i've learned as a manager and whats expected of them. The hardest park of the job is the long hours you can work 12-15 hours a day
good,Assists Loss Prevention team in identiying and calling out potential shoplifters.
good,Learn more about your customers and people's values.
good,I have been exposed to another side of myself in executing this job. A typical day entailed investigation and prosecution of shoplifters. The hardest part of the job was knowing the longterm affect may have on an individual who for a moment had a lapse in judgement for whatever reason. I most enjoyed knowing that my co-workers on the sales floor an in the office expressed to me a sense of security and level of dependability in the job that I do.
good,"* Work with seven special event divisions, advertising, social media, direct mail and budgets."
good,"While working for this company you are constantly on the move to try and provide ""Macy's Magic"" for each customer. As a manager you must learn to balance a lot of aspects of your businesses, while providing outstanding customer service. During different times of the year you are required to work more than 40 hours a week and can have some long shifts."
good,fun place to work...management fair...pay: poor...co-workers ok...best benifit: I like working with people.
good,A typical day at work was to help the co-workers in questions and answers to tell the customers who called in at the call center for help. It was in the furniture and bedding departments.
good,"Could use better training for management, managers were spread thin due and ineffective to associates."
good,"Usually an end of the day closer on the job site; I would be responsible for maintenance and customer sales & service. While at the job, I learned how to work in groups of 4-9 (depending on the day, or amount of work needed to complete) to reach in store goals using a hand-held device called a PDA."
good,"A typical day at work consist of organizing, assisting and cashing out customersI've learned a great deal of customer service"
good,you meet a lot of new faces at work and it is a fast pace environment so you day goes by very fast.
good,"mostly fighting for sales, not appreciated by managers for work that is done. unless if they are looking at your sales performance."
good,"A typical day at work consist of organizing, assisting and cashing out customers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Learned alot about the company in a short period of time....They wanted everyone to be cross-trained in the department...Was a good idea but never fully implemented .Lack of inner company communication left lots of problems unresolved...
good,"This was a seasonal job , i worked 6-8 hour shifts in the accessory department, ringing up customers and keeping my department clean."
good,The managers here at Macy's can really care less about the associates as long as their selling over their goal and only then they will give you a pat on the back.
good,I Loved Macy's until they changed the way they scheduled. It became impossible to take time off and get the hours that I wanted.
good,Macy's Herald Square is a great place to work. It porvides a cultural atmosphere with a variety of customers from all over. Management makes sure the employees are taken care of so customer service is active and fun. Coworkers provide great support for their team memnbers and have a great rapport.
good,A typical day would include stocking merchandise and helping customers
good,"Assist customers at cash register, keep your area clean, keep the fitting room clean and organized, and assist with wardrobe."
good,"I use to work as a seasonal position. I put clothes away, organize clothes and the counter. Cleaned off the counter and did customer service by accepting return items and saling items. Most co-workers were very helpful but some were very competitive."
good,"The company micromanages a lot. I would be called 2 to 3 times a day by the regional manager and sometimes even by the regional trainer and even the store manager above me to check in on my sales. The job is not difficult but you can only control the sale of sunglasses so much, especially in Washington State in winter. However, I enjoyed talking with customers. If you are looking for a job that can supplement another job, or while you are in school, this is a perfect match."
good,"It was a great environment, just wasn't able to get the hours I needed."
good,i learned to work the register and help people find things they were looking for
good,"- Same..its an OK job, depends on boss, the DVP sets the tone."
good,Not so flexible with hours. Unable to take a day off if there was some sort of emergency.
good,your basic retail the people i worked with made it fun i actually enjoyed the discounts etc
good,"For the most part, working here was okay. This was an on-call postition but I was able to work my way on the schedule most weeks. The managers were friendly and helpful as well."
good,"I work with a team of signers, setting up a sale and take down the sale. Some co-workers are hard to get along with. That hardest part of the job is to follow their rules on how they like us to do the job and what not. I enjoy helping people."
good,This was one of my first jobs and I enjoyed it a lot. Very cool co-workers who were active in showing me how the business operated and how I could become the best associate I could be.
good,"My first Job. i learned how to use a register ,i learn great custom service skills. it gave me an idea of what i want to do for the future."
good,I had a lot of fun pretending like i was shopping and getting to know the associates
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Associates not very welcoming, job description asks for too much & does not match pay, scheduling sucks"
good,I enjoyed this job. I looked forward to be at work each day. The team with which I worked was all fun. There was much support for each other.
good,Working for Macy's began as a good start because I got to work around new and trending fashions.
good,The Macy's Company Is fine but the store i worked for was slow on business.
good,Macys is a fairly decent place to work. I do feel the compensation should be higher for the responsibility one is given.
good,"Macy's is a fairly good place to work. My only complaint on my part is that they did not work with my school hours very well. I attended school on Mondays/Wednesdays until about 5 pm & was expected to be at work by 6pm. If anyone lives in this area of Northern VA you'd know that the traffic on route 66 is crazy around this time! I had to go on-call for school purposes, but I don't get to pick up many hours unless someone gives them to me. I don't want to consider part-time again; however, if I cannot get hours I might have to do just that."
good,Nice place to work. Were flexible when it came to creating work schedules.
good,"The best part about working at Macys was that we got paid every week, and we got to pick the days and hurs that we wanted to work. Over all it was a real cool place to work"
good,"This Particular Macy's Wasn't My Best Experience, The Managers Had Attitude Problems, The Co- Workers Were Too Competitive And Rude..I Just Wish The Experience Was A Better One."
good,"i worked @ macy's for 6 years christmas help as a cashier, it was a seasonal position"
good,"Macy's is a great company, especially working in the Marshall Field's Building on State Street."
good,Friendly and helpful associates that are willing to train an feed the necessary information need to work in a certain department.
good,"I took this job during the holiday season. It paid well, however, it was difficult to pick up hours and I was continually moved to different departments based on which hours were available. Since I was unfamiliar with all the various departments I found it difficult to help customers as much as they needed."
good,I enjoyed working for Macy's Inc. I liked working closely with customers and I respected Macy's high customer service standards.
good,This company has great things to offer for those open to a flexible work week.
good,"I worked there for four years and they never bothered to advance me. I kept asking my manager and their excuse is always, sorry I forgot."
good,I enjoy working in retail. I'm open to new experiences now that my children are grown and gone.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,...I worked in this company for almost 4 years and i was dealing with some professional people in sales and product.
good,I was young and it was decent money while I attended college. The scheduling worked perfect with my school schedule.
good,"Schedule was done 2-3 weeks in advance, you were able to shift trade if needed, you can input your own vacation days. The hours per week were secure. Work environment was fun. Management was always changing."
good,"I believe in myself when I learn new thing I thought I could not to do it. I discovered myself in each new step in my life . I work now in cash office at Macy's, and its very different  job what I specialist."
good,"I like working for Macy’s but not enough hours to live on. Very short shifts, not fair hours. Macy’s can work in a lot of things to better there company.."
good,"They barely give you any hours and even when you speak to your manager about it they still don’t do much to help you out at all. The coworkers were nice though and overall pleasant and the work was easy but I was really disappointed and dissatisfied with how they run things there, very unprofessional."
good,"I loved the multicultural environment. Everybody was from somewhere, so we have so much in command. Also as a woman I liked the merchandise , was really cool to work in a store that women's department is so big."
good,"It started off smooth all the coworkers loved me and noticed i was a hard worker because i was always running back and forth, up and down and sweating which is ok with me, it kept me busy. But my boss quickly saw and came to abuse that, she started becoming disrespectful and rushing me to get my job done quicker because i am a male worker."
good,"Not much to it was seasonal job it didn't last long enough pay was okay,people were great long hours ,and also provide transportation to and from work"
good,"As the title says Macy's has a lot of pros and cons and you're decision to work there will really depend on whether those pros outweigh the cons. For example, you have the flexibility to create your own schedule. The con is that there are limited hours and unless you get there right when hours open up for the next week, you won't get many. Other examples include an hour lunch that you have no control over when you take, and paid training that doesn't cover what your job actually entails and then having your managers get mad at you for not knowing (or worse, take away your already some of your limited hours after one terrible day). "
good,"Not Available "
good,"I got along well with my coworkers and it was even often somewhat fun being at work. The managers can be helpful, but they can also be difficult with things like demands for more Macys card signups. You'll never keep your area clean for long, often playing catch-up. Customers are often difficult, but simply calling a manager often gets it settled."
good,Some days you might have a customer that is having a bad day and takes it out on you but you always know at the end of the day nothing is your fault. but excellent place to be
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys. I really wish I didnt havr to move away so I could continue my job with them and help grow myself. The people were cool, and everything."
good,"After looking for an evening part time job and finding this one, I was quite pleased.  The start hours worked great with what I need in order to be a full time employee during my 1st job.  The company hires a very diverse group of people from what I can see.  The receiving department is mostly comprised of Hispanics.  Other than the numerous Hispanics, there is a Vietnamese male, a single white male, 3 white women and a middle eastern woman.  What I like about it is that is shows diversity."
good,"great learning curve for anyone new or experienced. Great staff. Flexible schedule, as I was already working full time for the WV State Government and needed a second income. I was able to utilize my education in criminal justice as well as my work experience in Corrections in my specific role of security and asset protection."
good,I learned a lot at this position about recruiting.  There are plenty of opportunities at this company and you can grow in the company.  I recommend that you work here.
good,I worked as a stock associate as well as a visual merchandiser for MK. Great people and management. Def. don't get paid for the amount of work you do but its decent enough and like i said... room for career progression especially with all the departments. Just have to navigate to the one you fit in most.
good,It ha d great flexibility & you get to learn new things over there. They will train you & the breaks are good. It is a huge warehouse with many departments.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Fun job on certain days and easy work.  A relaxed environment. Just low pay, hours and lack of advancement. Good for a student or a single young adult with no bills."
good,do not feel this is appropriate while trying to apply for new employment. This should be requested in a different manner than attached to an application i am attempting to fill out
good,"Macys was a good place to work. I wish they would have had more than one person in a department."
good,I loved working at Macy’s in cosmetics. I loved it so much that I was there for 8 years. But I wanted to try healthcare and the opportunity was there so I took it. Unfortunately the doctor that I worked for was getting ready to retire. That’s when I realized that my passion was cosmetics.
good,A typical day was Slow-paced but expectation are high. You need to open one Macys rewards card a day and if there is a primary sale event then you need to make the daily presale goal. Management expects a lot from their associates even if there is little to no customers.
good,"Most days are the same: doing the same thing over and over again."
good,"The advancement of jobs can use some work, and have more of a clear direction for promotions. Have options in which a person can decide which path they want to take and not be directed for them."
good,"I just did a long day there, and I don't want to talk about it... Apparently you're going to make me because that was not enough characters. Most of the people are great, but it's a very corporate environment that I find toxic."
good,high energy workplace lots of emplyees diffrent departments with high unit  and product shipping recieving and put away demands competitive co workers with diffrent shifts
good,"As a sales person you are the lowest man on the totem pole. You will be treated accordingly. The pressure to get credit card applicants is extremely high.  For $12 an hour, a lot is expected of you."
good,"Is good place while at college. Need to love working on retails stores. Long hours standing, walkingng and setting up the store crazy in the holidays & sales events. Expect more from them."
good,"I worked in Ladies shoe's, I started in the stock room which was a lot of work on top of running shoes orders from the sales staff which is a good days work."
good,"Working at Macy's is a place that you can take your family members and find something for a afford price. Working for a retail company is always would have issues when coverage, but working together as a team helps us to manage keep the flow going and get through the day."
good,"I personally had a manager that had his favorites. There were rumors of intimate relationships with the store manager which didn't help me get ahead. But those involved were rewarded with things such as NBA/NFL tickets, invitations to company conferences, & invitations to networking events. During these events the store was managed by yours truly."
good,This place has sooo much turn around. The people that are left take back to back calls all day. They even had an issue w bed bugs in the office. The pay was ok for the job its self. The management is good if you are liked.
good,"Often disorganized or random work assignments. Often, there was not enough help in other departments, so it became necessary much of the time for those departments to  pull help from other departments that were often backed up as well. Also, when the cafeteria was open, they would charge for things such as ketchup packets and seasoning packets unless you made the purchase of a meal, even if you brought your own lunch."
good,"I hate that I was hired without being told gaining credit applications was the #1 priority. I never would have accepted this position. Stressful, favoritism, passive aggressive work environment."
good,"I really do like my job and the associates at this location BUT I do not like or agree with the path corporate is heading, and there could be MUCH better communication between immediate management and sales associates."
good,It was a good job if your coming out of high school or are in college. Only the Managers get full-time jobs the rest of the employees get part time jobs. If you want more hours or money coming in you have to pick up a shift from someone else.
good,"I work 3 12's a week, and get 4 days off, so I get plenty of home time, but anyone that works 12's knows that you don't really have time for much else before or after your shift. Overall most employees at Macy's are pretty nice, but the management can be lackluster. Some members stand out as incredible people, and will always be positive and friendly, follow up with you, answer questions, teach you new things, etc... but others I genuinely wonder how they're in the position they're in, because they're the exact opposite. Also, the chance for growth is there, but it's slim. Statistically it's just unlikely that you'd get the spot even if you apply, due to sheer numbers of other people applying as well. You must make yourself stand out in some way. Honestly the worst part of the job is that it's tedious and boring. You'll more than likely be doing the exact same task over, and over, and over, AND over again all day for the entirety of your 12 hour shift, which can really eat away at you."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Assisted clients in identifying items for bridal registries "
good,Fun place to work at times.  Good benefits after working there long enough.   The hardest part of the job in the stores is the lack of staffing since more and more of the company's focus is online every year.
good,"Although it did need lots of improvement when I worked there, I do think that this job is not for everyone. I was there for so long because I think I got comfortable with the way that Macys worked, but it wasn't necessarily because I enjoyed working at Macys rather I enjoyed being a cashier and helping customers."
good,"Co-workers and many managers are wonderful to work with and for.  However, the policies change often and if you get an incompetent or unprofessional manager, he or she is left in the position for far too long, without address.  Workers are told to do conflicting things, and then called out on either one they pick, depending on the whim of the manager or department.  Salary is good for the job, benefits are also decent.  Work culture is fun.  "
good,"A typical day at work involves receiving new merchandise and getting it ready on the floor for our customers to shop. While working here I have helped with inventory, sending and receiving merchandise. I enjoy the people I work with and helping customers find just the right thing."
good,"Decent pay, good coworkers. Some of the managers lack people skills, and are not given training on how to handle so many different types of people. Long hours."
good,"Macy's was the most professional, challenging, and enjoyable job training and overall excellent business to work for. I would Highly recommend working for Macy's."
good,"Don't get me wrong, Macy's is definitely an interesting place to work. You meet allot of nice people passing through and there is never a dull moment. "
good,"Macys gives a lot of opportunities for people with no experience. They really push for their associates to reach goals and do better for the store as a team. Moving up in Macys is not difficult, but there comes a time where you cannot advance further. Working for this company is great to gain the social skills you need to pursue elsewhere so its definitely not long term."
good,"A Temporary Job, Most definitely a launching pad into other careers. Teaches work discipline and how to handle stressful situations while on the job, and how to overcome the."
good,"I found the management of the store I worked in to be lacking.  Employees could come and go with what seemed to be little to no consequence for their actions.  Others were expected to stay and take up the slack for their no shows or leaving early with no complaint. If called in to work or asked to work extra days, employees were expected to agree.  There was no concern by management for plans they might have already made."
good,This job is only if you are going to school. Temporary or seasonal is best.  Do seek management quickly if you want to further your career experience. Be aggressive in advancement.
good,"Job security is pretty scary with them closing doors there's not much more to say they have great clothes, where I work the management staff was okay."
good,"Macy’s, Inc. is one of the nation’s premier omnichannel retailers.  Macy’s, Inc. operates approximately 680 department stores under the nameplates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s"
good,it's good place to know work wold . you will learn how to work with others but it's not a place to spend more than 6 mounth of course it denpend on what you are doing there (I was in stockroom)
good,"Setting up displays and dressing mannequins. Managers are always around so communication is easy. it is not a fast paced job, but it requires a lot customer service."
good,"Macys has provided me with the opportunity to further my call center and customer service focus.  We are an ever changing and challenging business.  I enjoy coaching my team to efficiently and effectively evaluate colleague calls, assisting with customer issues that can be a challenge to correct, as well as partner with colleagues whether they are on site or off site.  A typical day at work provides me with many different duties which is a great way for me to build my expertise of processes as well as share my experiences with others.  I enjoy the variety of work."
good,A few managers have been there for so long they are stuck in their old ways of management.  The company itself is pretty good.  Work/life was easy to manage as they were flexible.
good,"The people you work with will determine how you enjoy your time. Depending on the season it can be slow or hectic, but everyday will be a little different."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Typical workday would start at different times depending on when I was scheduled, but I'd say everything would always be somewhat set up when we get there in the morning."
good,"It was decent, I would recommend it but not as much. Fun moment depending on the manager and the people you around. There’s a lot of shady stuff that goes on that I dont Know and wouldn’t want to know."
good,I had a great experience working for Macys. Working at Macys made me happy to help customers. The work environment was safe and the staff was great to work with. I had a great time working there.
good,Macy does generally start their employees at minimum wage. I do remember when I started working at Macy's I start with the pay of $7.50 and 9 years later I left with the pay of $12.83. Some people would say that was a waste of my time but it was staff that made me feel welcome and appreciated.
good,it was ok could of been better the people or ok the area is ok the hours are ok the pay isnt very high but you could manage by the way if you work in westchester you have to pay both NY and westchester taxes.
good,"The pay rate for all positions in the store could be better, especially since employees are continuously asked to perform tasks outside of their job description."
good,You work 10 hours a day get 2 30 minutes bracks . They send you to work different department to support that area  . Peek time is the best time to work for the company.
good,"While being employed at Macy's it's a great experience to enhance my knowledge and expand my experience as a Dock Associate/Manager Assistant. While working as an Associate at Macy's I truly love the team that I'm working with. Yes there are high turn overs but for those that have hung in there and we have built a great relationship with one another, I wouldn't change at all."
good,typical day at work is helping customers find fragrances. i learned what people liked. management is decent. work place culture is decent. the hardest part of the job is sales
good,Learned to work using different devices. Macy’s warehouse is very cultured and full of different things to learn. I liked learning things the supervisors worked on. The hardest part was not being able to find locations for products
good,"I have nothing but my opinion to start off with macys"
good,"-Flexible work hours"
good,"As a retail corporate environment, could use some work. There is stability in the business but you have to adjust to a culture that may not be authentic to you."
good,Macys is a place where they favor the nose down no questions asked employee managers an supervisors often do nothing an are no where to be found unless numbers are poor
good,it is a good job for begineers and college students and part time.. GET paid less too much micro managing not enough people to help .. pressure to open credit cards
good,"I was just a seasonal employee, so I didn't work there long enough to really have an opinion about the place. I worked on my feet the hole 8 hours I was there except for when I went on my breaks."
good,Clocking in to work at macy's was always a little depressing. You're waiting in long lines to clock in or out but once you finally get to your station to work sometimes you wouldn't have the slightest idea how to do your job and it would take a few minutes to find a manager to help but the employees are pretty helpful if you find the veterans of the place.
good,Good place to work.  Expectations can be too high.  Anyone in management needs to learn to value themselves enough to work the 40 hours and no more.  If you work hard and become an expert you can move up.
good,"I loved working at Macys. It was a good start for me before heading to Nordstrom. Fast paced and a fun place to work. I received a few awards at Macys for my customer service, product knowledge and selling over my projected percentage."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Worked in the Shipping and Receiving department and unloaded freight. I also stocked this freight. This was hard work, but it taught me how to remained organize and remain patient while working in a fasted environment."
good,"I was able to work in all the family of businesses. Giving me the knowledge and skills to lead different teams. Yes, you have to be available holidays and weekends. Must be able to work and help all types of customers. Need to have some knowledge of technology or must be willing to learn."
good,"I feel that Macy's is an okay job to have. Unfortunately, I didn't have that much of a great experience. But it was mainly due to the environment, and those working there. I was employed there during the holiday season, and it was very hectic in the department(s) I was assigned to."
good,"extremely fast paced, low pay and a bit stressful environment, but workers are extremely friendly even the managers. "
good,"I did truck unloading, sensor tagging, stocking, markdowns, pricing changes, fulfillment, picking merchandise and packaging for mail"
good,Over all experience busy place to work.Had an area I was in charge of. Had to keep checking with area sales manager about changes in the floor. Working with management was trying at times.
good,"Overall it was a decent experience.  Work life balance is a struggle because, let's face it, it's retail.  But the people are generally friendly (because it's their job to be). "
good,"The other employees were not very friendly when first starting to work there, they didnt want to answer any questions and bunched themselves into a group away from new employees. The managers were much nicer and lot more helpful though."
good,"Not busy enough at this time of year.  Folded ties and folded shirts for hours.  Great people to work with.  Very busy seasonal workplace and glad to do it  All great supervisors.  Changed from wearing all black to colors If unable to keep your shift someone will always swap with you. Reasonable lunch hours and lunch room.  Plenty of parking spaces  All associates are friendly and always willing to help.  Too many coupons issued to customers (most are out of date) Pushing customers to open an account with a discount.  Very good quality of clothing.  I did all my Christmas shopping at Macy's  If you have a problem there is always a supervisor close by.  Store was close by so I never had a problem getting there."
good,"Macy's provides a great foundation for college graduates.  There's opportunity to move laterally across the company.  Recent changes in organizational design has limited management positions, so vertical career advancement is not always available.  Be prepared for your career advancement to be everything other than linear."
good,"I arrived at Macy*s at 6 am so that I may be able to comfortably work without the interference of the public. There's no growth for someone my age. Management they're all pleasant however, there's no structure and never available when needed. It's a diversity workplace. The hardest part of this job the public is RUDE and they LIE to get what they want(not everyone). The most enjoyable part of the when someone is thankful for your efforts. So little pay"
good,"Working for this company takes dedication, if you cannot stand on your feed for more then 5 hours do not work here, the standing is ridiculous, loving sales is a most to be happy working for this company."
good,"fast paced you need good costumer service and lots and lots of patients."
good,Macy's is an ok place to work. There are times when you have great customers and times when you have bad customers. It's the people that you work with that can either help you get through or make you hate your experience.
good,it was a basic temporary warehouse job I didn't really like the job because of the actual place and the work ethic because Its terrible on your feet and its very slow paced
good,It was fun working for a fast paced store like Macy's. I learned a lot. Being able to learn different aspects of the business was really good for my personal development.
good,Work at Macys can be challenging but with a good attitude and hard work you can get promoted quickly.  They are always looking for good employee's to fill roles.
good,"Employees, customers, managers are all very nice. Friendly work environment. Flexible schedule. Easy work. We get paid every week and I hold a supervisor position and STILL can not afford to live on that I had to get a second job! Sales associates make minimum wage or close to it. Supervisors and managers don’t make much more. Love everything about my job except the pay. I’ll most likely be leaving once something higher paying comes along"
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for.  They are the best and training and developing their executives.  I enjoyed my time at Macy's and the opportunities I was given to grow in my career.  It was difficult to continue to invest time, with the amount of store closings and layoffs every January."
good,At times it was very slow with lack of customers making the time go by slowly. But other than that it was an ok place to work. if you want extra money in your pocket you can work there.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a sales associate, your day starts with opening registers.  There would be morning meetings to provide any information for the day.  The hours varied day to day.  If closing, you cleaned up your area, and closed out register.  During the course of the day/night, help customers, run register and clean out fitting rooms.  Really enjoyed working with the customers and co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working part time. Pay could be better but employee discount is a bonus. Holidays can be overwhelming but that's to be expected with retail.
good,"Not all companies are perfect but this company was appropriate. It was a good way to enter the retail world and although there was tough times. Those tough times did teach me a lot. I did develop many skills such as multitasking, communications through phones, and the business of credit cards."
good,"learned a lot at Macys that has served me well in other jobs.."
good,"I was young ,new to the work force and a full time student. I will always be grateful for the opportunity given to learn. I only wish there was more of push to drive employees for not only company goals but for professional and personal growth . i enjoyed morning meetings and management interaction."
good,Everyone should be informed of changes not just a select few. The lack of communication is the worst.  They wonder why there is a high turnover rate. They do have surveys to complete but the managers tell you what to answer so they won't look bad.  Why have surveys if you can't answer truthfully.
good,"Over all a great place to work. Loved my co-workers and immediate supervisors. GM wasn't the friendliest. A lot of pressure to meet sales quotas. Job itself was good, although slow at times."
good,"For the position of customer service there are a lot of calls, back to back. Sometimes you have a time with no calls in between. You learned about how the credit industry works and the revolving accounts"
good,"A typical day at work is about engaging with customers, communication is a must on a daily basis. Helping customers as much as you can, because nevertheless your commission depends on the amount of products sold as well. I learned leadership skills, organization, time management, social skills, helped with my anxiety and you learn from people. The management is very understanding as it gives you a flexible schedule, although it may be difficult to contact them sometimes as they are all over the place, so you have to manage yourself. The workplace culture is cool as a lot of customers are the drive of the place, you get to have contact with a coworkers and is a nice adventure. The hardest part of the job could be to get out of your shell at first at engaging with customers but that is overcomed with time. The most enjoyable part of the job is taming the satisfaction of a sell and being able to sign a client up in your list of accountability. Also payday!!"
good,"Great for College students"
good,Flex positions aren't the best. Instead of hiring a few people to become part time...they'll hire 10 more people to become flex. FLex means PRN basically. so you'll have 30 different people working 0-6 hours per week.
good,"Macy's is really a great company to work for. It seems that employees are seen as an asset and treated pretty well. My only real complaint is management. While some managers are great, others are not."
good,"As far as the pay goes, many will feel unsatisfied due to the workload a single associate has to handle vs the hourly wage. Often times the employees Macy's hire are not enough to keep up with the influx of customers, leading to a shortage of manpower. The hardest part of the job is to learn the any products sold in Macy's to help the customers meet their needs. The enjoyable aspect is meeting other employees and developing friendships."
good,"since macy's closed a lot of stores, it became worse and worse. "
good,"A typical day involved helping customers and organizing work-space. I learned to fit bras, sell credit cards, and became more aware of fashion. Most of the managers were nice but they often did not communicate with each other on what the employees on the floor were doing. The people I worked with were usually very nice. However, corporate took over scheduling my second year and made my job more difficult. The hardest part of the job was finding a balance between selling and keeping the dept. organized. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers leave happy."
good,"The District Merchant position was demanding, challenging and creative.  The work environment is positive and collaborative.  The opportunity is work/life balance."
good,"I loved working in Northridge, I felt more respected there than Glendale given my race age and appearance. The company itself did not discriminate but the clients did. They train and prepare you very well for advancement but will almost always hire someone from the outside. I was led to believe that i would be promoted to a managers position and waited 2 years holding on to this promise. your passion for the products and clients don't always matter when working at Macys. I personally trained 5 managers hired from outside sources and received no recognition. Its great and horrible all at the same time. Its a good place to work if you don't take your job seriously."
good,Hardest part is keeping the energy levels high and inspiring sales associates to sell and have fun. A typical day is mostly composed of following up with associates about specific tasks and sales goals as well as helping resolve customer issues.
good,"I really liked the work environment. Issues were more personal in my situation. II liked the fast pace, people both customers and coworkers are fun and create an amazing environment."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The employees are very helpful and fun to w ork with. The hardest part of job is picking up loads of clothes from the dressing room. The best part of the job is working with great managers.
good,"I very much enjoy working at Macy's it was specially when I worked at the New York store, learn so much over the the years met so many wonderful people both famous and not so famous."
good,The only good about working at Macy's is they work around your schedule. Working with the clients is also enjoyable. The employee discount is good too.
good,"a typical day at work is sales and discussing business"
good,"Macy's work environment is a mixed bag from one department to another."
good,a typical work day you learn a lot  they some of the management is okay the workplace is very culture customer are okay. you meet some friendly co worker
good,"Only one Supervisor made it bearable to work there. Was unfortunate especially for those who love working in the brick and mortar retail environment, was sad it closed only because of said supervisor."
good,"*Producing design ideas for displays and developing floor"
good,Fun environment to work in. Not very good with paying benefits. I like the apprehension policies. I had a lot of fun working here. It just didn’t pay very well. I would probably still be there had I known how bad Wal Mart’s management team was. It was not worth the extra money to leave Macy’s and go to Walmart
good,Productive environment to work for a part time job. I work with people who we willing to help me. Only issue was the hours that I was given. I was not given a lot of hours.
good,the job is very productive it keeps a worker moving. A typical day at work consisted of 10 hours shift. so many people from different countries worked there. the best part about working at macy is team meetings and fun games and food on holidays.
good,"Macy's was a very competitive and challenging atmosphere to work in. However, it did offer great benefits.  During my tenure at Macy's i gained a lot of sales and management experience. After working for this company i feel confident about taking on other challenges with other major retail franchises within the industry."
good,"The job was folding and stock merchandise with fast process, help the customer anytime and help other brands, also organizing and cleaning with store need it ."
good,"Working as a seasonal employee at Memorial City Macy's is fast-paced and often demanding because of the extremely high traffic during the holiday season and because the location is especially popular for surrounding communities. The work can be monotonous and frustrating for employees due to pressure from customers and some team leaders, but the higher leadership is supportive and appreciative of those of us who continue to recover merchandise and pick up register skills."
good,"It was an easy going workplace, but there was a lot of work cleaning after others and putting back clothes. It was constantly unorganized and a lot to organize. The health benefits were okay, but it was an easy going job and I was there to work, so I did not mind the cleaning very much."
good,I wouldn’t mind working for them again just would change department and/or if I was to be in same department I would just ask for a change in position.
good,"I absolutely loved my job interviewing the couples and being with them throughout their registry process.  Helping them with all their registry problems (upgrading, deleting items and changing)."
good,"Less stressful if non comision and straight salary job,good benefits, good working shifts convenient off days. Not too far from home so relaxed transportation"
good,"Interesting, fun, management is not very well coordinated. Online scheduling is not working. Not able to pick up extra shifts. Understaffed in some departments and too many people in other. Low compensation"
good,Coming into work every day and getting the store ready. Merchandising the stock. Cleaning the work area making sure everything looks presentful. Taking care of clients from the moment they walk in. Welcome them ask what I can help them find today. Suggesting and closing the sale. Adding them to “my client” computer system. Later on following up with them and inviting them back.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"-Company:"
good,"Work was 12 hours/day"
good,I worked at this company as a 2nd job. It was just seasonal. It was fun. It was face paced because it was during the holiday season. I would work there again.
good,"Macy's was a great experience for me and I was always busy their during the season. The hours were very long. the managers did not always care about my needs and were not very patient with me when I first started.  Most of the customers that I had were pretty nice. However, there were some that I had that were really pushy and rude when they did not get the deals that they wanted. The most enjoyable part was getting to know other sales associates and helping customers find clothes that they needed. In some cases, Macy's was a good experience for me because I learned, different customers, and employees and the retail environment."
good,"could be stressful with the work load daily and there no teamwork, but if you work consistently you'll guarantee to get hours as much as 40 with weekly pay"
good,"My work day consisted of reaching daily goals, assisting customers,and directing my staff. Our department worked very harmoniously and  respectfully with each other. The most challenging part of my job was recruiting customers to open credit cards.  I enjoyed engaging with customers and helping to resolve their  concerns. As a manager, I learned how to direct and motivate my team to become successful in their selling skills and achieve their objectives."
good,A typical day at work in Macy's it doing markdowns. I would have to do markdown every single clothes in almost every department in the store. Sometimes re-tagged the merchandise if needed. Delivered packages to certain departments. It was a little difficult working there. I didn't get enough help that I need such as learning other things and using certain technologies to do orders.
good,There was a weekly meeting that the manager did to make sure all employees were aware of their progress. There was competition among the employees of who opens a certain amount of credits per week. It can be a busy store depending on the time of the year
good,working at Macy's was fun and exciting and meeting all types of ethic people from different background. It does have its challenges.  there is room for improvement.
good,"Multicultural environment ."
good,"It was a great place to work and that is mainly because of the interaction with the customers and getting them to feel comfortable with you. Although the management needs to be sought over. Especially for seasonal. While I worked there, I got along with the head of my department and the store manager but there is a lot of favoritism and favors done at Macy's and and they were not shy of making you feel so."
good,i was happy to have been able to work there but the familia theme between employees was weird and off putting it was also a weird time in my life so it whatever
good,"Macy's seemed like a great company from the outside looking in. Once we reached the sales floor, everything changed. Being a commissioned salesman meant that whoever you ring out at the register is added to your commission. Meaning, if you spent 20 minutes helping a customer and one of your co-workers rings the customer up then you spent 20 minutes helping the customer simply for the customer service and your commission was stolen. This would happen multiple times at every shift. Some co-workers would lie to your face and say they were logging the sale under your name only to log it under their own. The hours were okay but the management of the department store as a whole was chaotic."
good,"-Answering phone calls from customers"
good,"My average day of work would be spent either processing a shipment of new merchandise or signing/pricing/merchandising. I didn't really learn anything here. The management was decent, nothing to write home about. The workplace culture felt a little forced. They tried to make it competitive and inclusive, but nobody really believed in what they were saying. The hardest part of the job was getting up so early to have such a short shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the weekly pay."
good,My experience at macy was an ok one I worked there part time seasonal and during that time I managed to learn a few things in the retail field for my first time being there
good,its all grouped into a PTO .  Paid time off .  Vacation and sick days.  Credit system... earn credits as to go.  But if you use a credit that cycle you are unable to still earn credits.
good,"A typical say at work for Macy's Asset Protection would be having no expectations of leaving on time or on time for any pre-planned activities, if you are working any shift other than closing. Any alarm issues would result in an Asset Protection Detective having to possibly stay overnight until someone comes to rectify the issue."
good,"Retail as an industry is in a constant state of flux. While Macy's did a good job of remaining competitive in terms of work life balance and compensation compared to other competitors in the industry, the direction of the company is unclear, constantly changing, and with massive budget cuts job security becomes questionable. With all the restructuring and layoffs that have happened in the past 5 years, the confidence of the younger associates has been shattered. There needs to be more mobility upwards for the new wave of assistants/associates or they will find other companies to work for."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great management and coworkers who pushes you to achieve more and managers who wants you to go beyond your limits to advanced in such a competitive environment
good,"Whenever I use to open, first we turn on the registers and count how money is in the cash register and making sure the area was cleaned. management was somewhat under control since it was the holiday season and they would from one department to another. I learned that retail requires you to have a lot of patience and that is because anything can happen unexpectedly. The good part about the job is that you get to interact with co workers. The hardest part is to get through the day and trying to take care of customers first as a priority, especially during the holiday season"
good,"Job requires to mainly be checking customers out, keeping the department clean and providing great customer service. As a full-timer they expect you to open up macy's credit cards. There are some really nice people and on the other hand you can get some pretty nasty customers so it's hit or miss. Hours are pretty random as they are assigned by the system but there is always room to pick up hours if you are lacking. Overall decent workplace."
good,"Macy's is an ok place to work for a part time job, not something I would recommend as a full time career choice. Depending on the manager they are willing to work with your schedule."
good,"I like my co-workers, companies status is rocky but there feels like the new changes they are making in management may be good. My advise if you work here absorb as much as possible."
good,"I live in the Philippines and we work day shift. I learned that when you do your best in your job, you will be given a much harder task to see your potential. Management was not good since we did not get any salary increase from the promotion. The hardest part of my job was the language barrier, we needed to analyze thier email regarding thwir concerns. Especially when we talk to them over the phone. I also became a learning Specialist OIC and i enjoyed training new agents. I also beacame a team leader, it was also fun leading the team."
good,"Everyone should have the experience of working in such a large, corporate environment supported by partner offices allover the world and boasting a sophisticated learning center for developing and furthering future talent and leadership."
good,Macy’s is a company that has good values and beliefs. These however are not always executed. Sometime things or people can be overvalued leading to other feeling under appreciated. Currently it’s a company that seems to have no clear path as to where it want to go and is at time very slow to react to the changing customer dynamic. It’s tries to be too many things to to many people which causes it to lose focus on what can truly be important.
good,"Some of the associates are nice and work as a team, some are rude and don't help at all and leave everything to you. Many things has happened while I work there but no manager or store manager would try to solve it."
good,"Not for the weak at heart, must be a go-getter and like a challenge! Fun place to work ""The Magic of Macy's"" is real!  It's true what you make of it.   There is room for growth, just be sure to keep an eye on the areas where you'd like to work."
good,"average retail job. busy on holidays and slow on other times. usually part time only, minimum wage to start. work culture is typical of retail jobs, tahts for sure"
good,Everyday at work is pretty busy during the season. Learned patience and effective communication. Lot of drama and politics in management. Highly competitive with their full time positions. This store could use more employees and a better budget. Not enough security. Not a minimum wage position. Bad scheduling. Could tell that the regional manager didn't pay the appropriate attention to facilitate a progressive sales team and update both their system and technology. Potential for a great job if the corporate hand wasn't so influential to day to day decisions.
good,Great company to work for. Great work environment. Macy’s is very motivated about the company and making the customers happy and satisfied. Macy’s is like work for a big family
good,"You learn to pick customers orders. "
good,"Typical day at Macy's was working cashier"
good,"my time is macys was fun and i learned a lot from my elder co-workers. it was a great time to communicate with new people with almost every culture and language, i feel excited around them. customers with different regions teaches u so many new things,and that's fun . i like customer service field because its not work for me ,i enjoy my life."
good,"It's the normal retail experience, especially around the holidays. Expect long extended hours and very busy work days. The fulltime benefits are good."
good,Managers need to be more collaborative. They always made my work day a little stressful. They were never appreciative and are always complaining and putting all the stress on Associates.
good,"The job, to me, is limited. Long hours and very monotonous, not for a career oriented person desiring long term support. It’s good for the quick money. Overtime is great which makes the negative kind of worth it. I, personally feel like I can do more with myself. I feel like this is a settlement and complacency job."
good,Great place to work when they don't try to restructure the buying/digtal/planning teams without giving the employees any input. Great benefits with 20+ vacation days depending on your level.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Interacts with a company’s customers to provide them with information to address inquiries regarding products and services. In addition, deal with and help resolve any customer complaints. Services existing accounts, obtains orders, and establishes new accounts by planning and organizing daily work schedule to call on existing or potential sales outlets and other trade factors."
good,"While working at the Macy's fulfilment center I met alot allot of people along the way, overall everyone you come in contact with is respectful and nice at least from my experience."
good,"Macy's has more flexibility as an associate. As a manager of course there are certain duties that you cannot get around. Upper management within the building can be fickle and rude, playing favoritism among inner management and associates. Associates are allowed to generally do as they please and management is of course left to pick up the pieces. They do care about community events that drive sales and thus put out nice displays for the public. The culture among associates can be friendly but can also be filled with dissension when it comes to sales and perception about who leads the department. These experiences are possibly different throughout the company."
good,"A good internship if you want a management job. If not, it is not the best internship but it is a good experience. Management can be good or bad. Sometimes had to stay longer than expected."
good,The co workers and management was nice people to work around they give discounts the pay was fair environment was well kept just overall a great experience only thing it was seasonal and they didn’t let us know the last day
good,"Macy's is a good company, and really means to do well with it's employees. However, there are systemic challenges coming from the top that don't truly allow for innovation-- or at least not without having to battle for it. The company is stuck in it's ways, and while they are some strides being made, they are too small and not happening quickly enough. I think that there is great potential in it modernizing, but it's focus on fashion isn't first and foremost in my view, and i think it should, which doesn't it make it a place for me to work, specifically."
good,my work day at macy's was confusing it was a new way to do my job every day and no one was around to ask questions they would tell you to do one thing and walk away with out giving you a chance to ask a question
good,Good starter job; may lead to a higher position and better career. Great training and work ethics-culture. You will become a customer service professional!!!
good,"well i dont know where to start , this place is a great place to shop but when it comes to working you see how much work they have you do for less pay."
good,"Being in the shoe department is a very hard job. It's fun because of the workmates, but some of the days, you're just running aound, getting shoes for the customers, and putting them back in the stockroom. But overall, it's a good place to work. especially with my boss, he is very understanding about his employees. And most enjoyable part is, we have potlucks once in a while, so we have the chance to bond with each other."
good,"It has its down, but an awarding experience. Its an demanding job with a lot of labor. You need to be focused and upbeat to provide what is needed in my position."
good,A typical day at work would be servicing a customer and making sure their needs were met and that they left the store with a overall good experience. I've learned how to turn bad experiences into good ones and know how to deal with customer issues. Management at the time was pretty decent. Everyone was treated equal and there was no feel of favoritism while working there. The hardest part was having customer unsatisfied with their experience but having myself be there to turn that experience around.
good,"I learned how to visual merchandise, quite easy and fun. Awesome visual manager, made the job fun and exciting. My favorite job I ever had. Wish it was all year around."
good,"Very busy.  Learned retail is busy and time intensive biz and requires"
good,"The company having financial struggles, job security is insecure. Also lack of compensation for 35 years of experience in sales with over 11 of those years in sales management, makes a professional like me, being practical look for better opportunities."
good,"Hired as Estee Lauder Beauty Consultant. However worked in Lancôme, Clinique, Fragrances (men and women's) due to ability to be flexible and willingness to work wherever I was needed. "
good,"Management has recently put a huge focus on company culture, which sounds great, but often take small steps that don't actually impact the culture on a large scale. Dress code has become more casual and after  years of asking for it they decided to provide free coffee, but no other major changes have happened. I do believe the company has a competitive PTO policy. What was the most concerning is that the company seems to restructure the organization on an annual basis, constantly hurting morale and generating confusion as stress among the employees with potential  layoffs and job moves."
good,"There is an emphasis on customer services by making customer feel welcome when walk in the store. Co workers are helpful, there is a good working environment."
good,Working for Macy's isn't bad at all its just not the greatest. The people you will meet are great but the pay isn't worth it.   I have been working there for almost three years and i have had a great experience with the company.  Only recently has the companies management become unbearable.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working in Sales is very demanding because any given day you start on a level 10 and by the end of your shift you may not be close to that level.  However, you can brighten a customers day and that will be rewarding because you will then have made a customer into a returning client."
good,"i loved working at macy's and loved the scheduling online and how you could give away and also pick up shifts but hated how aggressively they push credit card applications, its almost impossible to meet their expectations!"
good,Very positive environment. Flexible hours and reliable. The customers are very friendly and easy to help. The sales associates are friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Worked as a part time sales associate, and as a part time stocker during and briefly after the holiday season. This was one of the most important work experiences of my life because I learned how to interact with people from all different walks of life."
good,"This job was short lived for me but daily I would open each register in whatever department I was in that day, fix clothes up around the area, help customers, wait on them at the register, etc. It wasn't a bad job, I enjoyed it."
good,"On a typical day, I come in to work and meet with my coworkers and manager. Our manager gives us our tasks for the day and the company's status in sales. We then go to our department and complete our tasks until the end of our shift. Management changes tasks in the middle of working on current and planned tasks. Also, often does not know who is scheduled/how long they are scheduled for. Hardest part of the job is moving heavy fixtures. Most enjoyable part of the job was organizing merchandise and assisting customers."
good,"I have worked for Macy's for over 10 years. I like the people I work with, and believe that it is a good job to have while in college or if you need something part time. However I would not recommend working for this company full time. If you are trying to make a living for yourself. The pay is to low, and your work life balance will suffer. 9 to 5 type hours do not exist at a place like this. I will admit that the benefits are good but you will have to wait till open enrollment In April before you can enroll."
good,"Plans and maintains all displays,mannequins,forms and cases,direct  proper assembling and installation of all fixuring in Storemanages fixturing ensuring best utilization and adherence to stadards including vendor installations,proper storage and maintenance."
good,"I love the culture!  However, I feel that I have reached the ceiling of my development within the company.  The direction of the business is clear from the store perspective.  The world of the call center is grey."
good,Very relaxing. Loved the people I worked with. the hours changed a lot Which was not good for me. The management was Awesome. I was treated like I mattered
good,"Expect to work nights, weekends, and holidays.  Yes, customers will yell at you, but Macy's gives you the opportunity to be empowered.  So, you can turn a negative situation around, if you want to."
good,"I have learned a lot which makes my job more worth it and my visual team is beyond amazing! BUT with the amount of physical work we have to do the pay is VERY low. And you are only allowed to work 37.5 hours a week, not the usual 40, but that's a company wide thing. The experience is great but for the money you are getting paid is something you can't make a living on."
good,The job is tiring and boring you stand on your feet for hours at a time you have short breaks and sometimes there is not enough work so you go home early which is nice and you don't get paid the same amount as everyone in your department
good,It was a pleasure working with the customers to ensure their shopping experience. The co-workers were very helpful in orchestrating team efforts and standards of the company.
good,"Fun job, meet a lot of people, get to see clothes fashions, air conditioned, covered parking.  Problem is pay is too low for the job and responsibility. Accuracy is required and management has their hands tied by corporate for giving raises."
good,"Great discounts. Flexible hours. Great for a second job, if needed. Management is not that great. The People change frequently. I worked in Asset Protection. There was great team work in this department."
good,"Slow during the summer. Very busy during holidays. Fast paced. The days are long, when there is work. Management is like any other place, some good, some bad."
good,Nice and fun coworkers but they expect too much out of associates for what they are being paid. Management is nice and tries to offer incentives but they are also quite demanding. Sales vs. support is obvious in preference amongst management. Support teams are not appreciated like the sales teams are.
good,Macy's is a great company to work for.  A typical day at work is always the customer's first.  Then there was the department to maintain.  The most important thing I learned there was how to master my emotions and how to defuse what could become a difficult situation.  I learned to treat people right even when they were rude. The management was professional and tried to be fair.  The workplace was wonderful and we were there for each other.  The hardest part about the job was when we were short staffed and extremely busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and the employee discount.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The night shift at the Macys warehouse was an experience. It was my first job and I learned valuable tips whilst working. The work culture was very strict. There was always a deadline that workers had to meet which kept us buy but there were also times where it was really slow. Overall I feel It was a good first job experience to have.
good,Working with Macy's was an overall good experience. They have good training processes. Great staff. Pay was good. Store was always busy and always new things to learn on a daily basis.
good,Great place to work however is very hard to move from one position to other .The most enjoyable part make lot of connections with different people from associates to mangers level.
good,"A great entry level organization higher ups are constantly being changed which is annoying, had 3 supervisors in less than a year. Decent company overall."
good,The managers were very unorganized nd unwilling to help associates who were trying to balance school and work. The managers picked favorites most of the time and were inconsiderate.
good,"Pros"
good,The pay was very low for a huge company like that. The turn over rate is high. Its good to work there if it is seasonal or it is your 1st or 2nd job. Then yes but not long term.
good,Macys is a  decent place to work. i dont see much room for advancement nor do i see much will to work there.its a good entry level job for people tht are trying to get into retail.
good,"When I worked for Macy's the first thing I did was unload the trucks, place the clothing on the hangers,unloaded the household appliances, placed the clothing along with the appliances on the sales floor, and lastly answer any questions the customers asked. The management wasn't so great since I had 20 to 25 hours, the workplace culture was great since I got to help assist people on the sales floor and get minimal experience from that. My most enjoyable part of the job was placing the clothing on the sales floor."
good,"great for your first job"
good,"Working at the home department section was great, I really like how the shifts are scheduled and they are understanding with your situation. The management is good but I didn't like the push for credit card sales. They made it such a top priority. I really don't believe in putting somebody in debt. But I was really great in customer service and helping with guests in what they need. I loved working in the bridal registry section"
good,It was a very productive working environment. The hardest part was dealing with customers getting upset with you because the coupons didn't work with some of their items.
good,Macy's has good benefits for its employees and rewards people who are willing to work toward goals for sales and store success. It is a demanding job for managers who oversee many employees and departments at the store at one time.
good,"Working in the women's shoe department we were paid with a draw style commission. Basically, you have to sell enough to cover your minimum wage and everything over that is yours to keep. The problem is that if you are working a slow season and get behind on your draw it is very difficult to get back to even and especially get over your draw so you can actually make money. Also, the share of sales is not fair. The senior sales associates are given the sales opportunities with the most value. It does not matter how well you sell or how you work with customers. If you have been there for a long time you get the better sales plain and simple."
good,"The benefits and flexible schedules are a plus, but management isn't. The confusion can sometimes make an easy work day very annoying depending on the department you're located."
good,"I think it is a hit or miss working for a large retail company. I've been with Macy's for almost 3 years and the first store I worked at was wonderful and had quick and rewarding advancements. They're big on open door policy with management and very diverse. On the other hand, there are stores that don't run properly or have poor management, which as a result leads to an unhappy work environment. Macy's is a good place to work and they have a lot of employees who have been with the company for 10+ years. If you like fast-paced, multi-tasking, customer-focused work, then Macy's is for you."
good,"All of the District Planner jobs were eliminated 2.5 years ago as Macy's thought they could achieve the same results from the NY office,  They were mistaken, and now Macy's is on a downward spiral."
good,"I improved on my customer service skills, the customers at Macy's loved me, especially in mens suits. I also learn how to stylize, and pick custom orders an easier way then just looking through the store. overall macy's just wasn't for me."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I only worked as a sales person, so not much room for advancement. It was good for a part time college/hs job for me. Hardest part of the job was having suggestions not be heard, but easiest part was it was good for a flexible schedule."
good,"It's tough to get anything done in this ""too big too fail"" company that can't move quickly enough in this changing retail environment to save itself. Management is too concerned about their livelihood to actually make decisions and communication within the company is a mess. The culture sucks, the pay isn't great, but summer fridays are dope and the company is making an effort to entice a younger staff."
good,Good balance of work/life. No micromanagement. Not easy to learn new knowledge set beyond daily responsibilities. Promotion do not depend on your performance.
good,"Local management almost always treated us well. I loved my direct supervisor and coworkers on the Merchandising team.  My jobs as a Support Associate were hard work, but a lot less stressful than sales."
good,"the customers where great the management wasnt so professional and eas always late with the check stubs , other then that it was a awesome place to work."
good,Retail work but the weekly pay makes it worth it. Just be good at customer service and flexible schedule. I worked in the shipping and had to receive the new product and transport them to the correct department.
good,"As a Sales Associate is fun to work in Macy's. They do a lot of fun activities to  motivate Sales Associates. It is sometimes stressful  when it comes to sales and credit goals. Compensations and benefits for hourly sales and support associates  are not really great, just average. Commissions plans are poor; you only make really good commission if you works in Cosmetics & Fragrances, Fine Jewelry  and sometimes Handbags, Ladies shoes and Men's dept. but you can go on deficit really easy in those   last  three."
good,Since I was seasonal all the sales commissions I earned were divided out to full time employees which angered me and gave me no incentive to effectively push product. Although my hard working nature typically won out in the end. Just wasn't great overall.
good,There is always a task to do if not it is possible to create a task to do. The facility is always nice and clean and the employees keep it that way. The managers are hardworking and dedicated to their jobs.
good,It was a good experience and it prepared me for a better work in retail. I don't have any bad experience and I was very well managed and work environment was easy to be a part of
good,"Macy's has made some great strides in the past few years, and there are ample opportunities like ERGs, a Diversity Council, volunteer groups if you want to get involved. However, I haven't seen a whole lot of mid level opportunities pop up and I have never been able to change departments. It might be a great place to start or gain some experience, but I don't know how valid it is as a long term career solution."
good,driving sales goals by executing the Macy's initiatives. Collaborating plans with District partners. Observing associates through formal observations. Creating work life balance for associates.
good,"I learned a lot about retail like customer service, merchandising, opening credit cards and relationships with clients.  While working at Macy's opening the credit cards and using the My Client system seemed annoying and there was too much pressure from management. Since I left, I realized doing these things are a necessity in high end retail and I'm glad Macy's prepared me for luxury brands. The scheduling system is very convenient and if you are full time you get benefits. "
good,"It was ok as long as you had the ""fit"". The people that worked there were pretty nice for the most part. Good thing about it was they let you float around to other departments so you got experience."
good,Literally half the customers that work at Macy's can't actually afford to shop there. They believe they're coupons will save them but the coupons don't apply to have of the brands they want. So then its your fault and everyone wants to talk to a manager. Plus huge department stores are impossible to keep clean and organized.
good,"A typical day at work was dropping off coats and bags at coat check then headed to your department. I worked in the Junior's shoe department. I was on the sales floor. I was responsible for helping the customers find footwear that was their perfect size and that reflected their personal style. I learned that many customers appreciated the little things such as inquiring about their day, or assisting them in finding the exits, elevators and multiple floors of the building. The workplace was welcoming and helpful; we all worked as a unit. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and making sure they had the best experience possible."
good,the typical work at macys is fast paced but very doable the work is not hard and co- workers give you help when you need it. ive learned hard work and patience pays off. sometimes the management can be a bit off due to it being so busy. even though theres nothing really hard about the job. there tends to be a lot of confusion and i would say thats would be the hardest part. the most enjoyable part about the job is the chance to meet new people and experince different customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A typical day would be helping customers and cleaning around your department. I was seasonal so that meant going where I was needed. The employee's were friendly. The pay wasn't great but again I was seasonal. The hardest part of the job for me was the fact that our store was slow so there weren't enough customers to make the quota they set. Otherwise would've been great job.
good,"Work hours were flexible"
good,"High Volume of customers, you need to be on your toes at all times."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, customers are needy, there's always a sale, if you can, work in a commissioned department!"
good,"Not too happy about the current state of the company nor how the management staff was treated when our store closed. Loved macy's before, now I'm on the fence about a lot of things."
good,"I worked at a small store, so take that as you will. My associates were (mostly) wonderful to with with, and management was decent. The company will work around your schedule if you're in school or have another job. Unfortunately, the pay is awful. Your yearly raise is the bare minimum. For standing on your feet all day, the pay is just not up to par- especially since you have to clean very messy fitting rooms, deal with awful customers at times, and are expected to work a lot of hours during the holidays/weekends (which I, personally, didn't mind). "
good,"Macy's was a good place for me to gain more experience  in regards to work ethic, Management skills and customer Service."
good,"Being a MyShop captain consists of whatever your store need you as. At my particular store, I was used as one of the managers. A typical day consists of knowing your sales goals, team and store credit goals, assisting associates with questions, transactions, supplies, and much more. It consists of opening and closing the store (depending on your schedule), counting the cash fund, communicating with your fellow leaders consistently, reporting performance, giving feedback to to associates (rewarding/redirecting) etc. You'll also assist customers and promote making M.A.G.I.C. with the customers (that just an acronym for giving the best customer service). The hardest part is recover and returns. You'll have to know how to be efficient with putting merchandise back to the floor efficiently and correctly to keep a great shopping environment, and you'll need to know what an acceptable return is. The return policy is very lenient, however, everything is NOT returnable. It's a plus to learn the brands and price points, but many associates get by without perfecting that knowledge. Don't be discouraged. My most enjoyable part is receiving the employee discount on top of all other coupons and sales."
good,"Sales positions are preferable.  Support positions esp. receiving or merchandising are hard physical work. Expect to work for your money, which won't be a lot.  There is a lot to be said for the work environment. Macys treats it's employees well, good benefits, respectful treatment by management."
good,The job was very good the production department was very friendly and dealing with vendors. I enjoyed working with  Federated  I left because I go a job in accounting.
good,"holiday are horrible, they use you when busy- cut hours when slow times, under paid, very little room for advancement takes a long time, but has a a good work family balance."
good,fun place to learn and develop knowledge. Good health benefits and great staff members. hardest part of this job was the change of weather would effect the performance.
good,Working at Macy's warehouse was a decent experience.The management is very lenient about the daily quotas you have to reach. It can a be a physically tough job and the pay is minimal.
good,"Depending on the time of year and what sales were available.  Each day was a new experience.  The day could be very busy without a break because of the sales available and the time of year.  There was a very diverse clientele and that made life interesting.  The workplace culture was very diverse and that was good because it made for a fun and productive environment."
good,Great place to work for older folks looking to get out of the house and stay busy and also for younger people to get their first job. Do not reccomend this job for someone that has legit bills to pay.
good,Seeing the end product of my work was gratifying. The gift wrap was decorative with beautiful colors. Everything you needed was at hand and customers were pleased.
good,Typical work day includes arriving to work at 9am. Interacting with various teams throughout the organization. You have to take 30 min lunch required by law but you can leave by 5:30pm if that is the case. Everyone is nice and there is a collaborative effort within the organization.
good,A day at work would consist of coming to the office and then preparing to go to the department. I would clean and organize the products in the departments and provide customer satisfaction when needed.
good,"Overall it is a fun work place. The number of people scheduled to work is perfect. It does get a little stressful on the weekends, but we have a well balanced team to do the job right."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Depending on my shift either opening or closing we count down the money. During the time of working we clean up the floors and tables and give customers our full attention when in our areas.
good,"As this wasn't my first job in retail, it was definitely better than other places I've been to/worked at.  The staff were friendly enough, and if you don't mind having to meet daily commissions and sales goals, this is good job.  Like any retail job, you are on your feet a lot, and you do have to have great people skills.  The only reason I didn't stay too long was a combination of distance (gas money and tolls killed a good chunk of my part-time paycheck), and getting a job closer to home."
good,Macy's was my first Retail Customer Service Job. It exposed me to new ideas. I picked up great new skills from the company.
good,A typical day of work was surveillance and catching shoplifters. I learned what behaviors shoplifters posses when they are shoplifting. A lot of hours if you have a family
good,Macy's offers comprehensive promotions and job growth opportunity. The company continues to strive to get in the forefront of the ever-changing customer shopping patterns. Creating a work life balance can be challenging in the retail industry.
good,"Macy's is an okay place to work, its perfect for a first time job as a seasonal worker. Other team members are friendly depending on the department you work in.  Macy's training is just videos, they don't really train you.  They basically throw you out on the floor and you learn from experience or other co workers. Overall its an okay job to work at. Registers are dated but its fine."
good,Walking the sales floors and partnering with merchandising team and fellow visual colleagues to prioritize outstanding projects to be completed and what is on the agenda for the day ahead. Communicate with sales managers on upcoming product directives and product knowledge.Ensure the store is visually pleasing and engaging to our customers
good,"A typical day at my job would be measuring groomsmen and booking tuxedo rentals for weddings, proms, and black tie events. I learn how to communicate and listen to customers desire's for these types of events. I inform the customers about our promotions and benefits of doing business with the tuxedo shop. I also alter tuxedo coats and pants. The hardest part of the job is the down time, especially in the morning because most people have work and won't be able to come in for a fitting until the evening. The most enjoyable part of my job is making people happy. I really focus on figuring out what the customers want and try to recommend the best of what our company has. I want them to leave very satisfied!"
good,"A typical day at work involved providing customers with any information they needed about the products we had for sale, specifically watches.  I learned the importance of providing excellent customer service.  Overall it was a pleasant work environment.  The hardest part of the position was meeting daily sales quotas. The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,"Work/ Life balance was flexible, but if you needed balance, your check naturally would be compromised. Management and business operations lacked professionalism. There appears to be limited opportunity for growth if you do not enter the company in a management level position."
good,"It's really easy work no matter what department you work at but you will be working for a lot of hours on your feet. The pay is good and there's always overtime approval during or near the holiday times which means its easy to get a lot of money during a week. You can easily work 16 hour days if you wanted to. Management is decent depending on department but everyone is usually pretty cool, its very easy to make friends since everyone is usually doing the same thing around you so at least you wont be bored and if you like using heavy machinery you'll eventually get the opportunity of learning how to work a pallet jack, stock picker, and a forklift."
good,"Provided customer service on shoe sales"
good,There clothing are of very great prices. The workers are very friendly and helpful. They have great offers and sales all the time.
good,It was a okay place to work at friendly people it was a fun place to work loved the people I worked with.. Managerment is great. Good pay
good,"dealing with multiple customers all at once, cashing out customers, returning clothes back to sales floor. you were constantly moving and always doing something."
good,"I really enjoyed my position. However, in December 2016, Macy's eliminated my position along with 10,000 other jobs. I would not recommend seeking employment in the retail industry at this time since it is struggling to keep up with online shopping."
good,i only worked here seasonally for a few months. the hours were short and it was minimum wage so i did not make a too much money. I enjoyed my coworkers though
good,"MACY'S had a pleasant working environment, but offered inadequate pay and benefits. Management was polite, but not willing to take suggestions on how to improve work production or increased sales."
good,I learn where everything was at.The co-workers was ok they was really help when  didn't know where anything was at the management they all liked me.They said i was a good worker. I like helping the cashiers when they needed me. I been doing cashier for 3 years because i was working for wendy's for 2 1/2 years so i got good customer service
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I took the job because of the amazing smart people I met in the interview process. I went from Sales Manager to HR manager in a year. Macy's supports career growth and promotion opportunities are great if you are relocatable. If not then promotion opportunities are very limited. Macy's has restructured every year for the past few years and I was part of a reduction in force due to seniority and now may be at risk again. Many people at the district level have lost their jobs a few years in a row too. Macy's however will do everything to keep their people as long as those people are willing to relocate and not on performance counseling. "
good,Ability to get the job done and spend time with your family. Macy's is investing a lot in technology and is moving from waterfall to agile. Must be motivated and a self starter.
good,"The company is a fun place to work. But can be hectic a typical"
good,"This started as a part-time job for me about a year ago.  About eight months ago, a full-time position became available. I was invited by one of the managers to apply for the job, which I did, and I was subsequently offered the job, so I took it. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was advancing and learning different tactics that would make me a better communicator when approaching customers in order to make a sale.
good,"computers shut down all the time. when applying, HR couldn't be responsible with online applications. training takes forever and it's all on computers. my boss is super kind and generous and understanding. co-workers are friendly, customers are mostly nice."
good,Everyone is very work oriented. They are there to do the job and go home. Very few full-time employees. Difficult to take breaks and lunches.
good,"The supervisors and. Coworkers were awesome ,the only con is no job security.very easy work packing and doing inventory"
good,"A typical day was always nice I learned a lot about the computer systems and how to use them better after from picking it up from being at Staples. Managing was ok, and co-workers were always respectful & a lot of people enjoyed being there. The hardest part I would have to say was when things we're busy and people we're trying to ask questions and I'd have 5 other things going on. But I always made it work. Most enjoyable part of my job was the whole job really."
good,Excellent place to work.  Great people and working environment. Love coming to work everyday! I wish that they would pay more...
good,"this was another great place to work if you love to shop, after hours shopping was the best . credit goals can be very pushy here tho. more than iv'e ever seen."
good,"when working with the right managers work shifts run very smoothly, Super Saturday sales can be stressful, overall easy work days, ok place to work for."
good,As a sales associate I was able to possibly earn commission plus an hourly wage but it usually did not come out to much. Working in the mall there was a lot of customers and often very busy. You also chose your hours each week.
good,"A typical day of work during the weekdays consists of lots of putting back clothing, cleaning, and, by some blessing, a customer. Many customers would complain about the lack of service on the floor they were at, when I know there are plenty of people working, making it appear as if coworkers were avoiding customers and shoving the work onto someone else which I find disrespectful to the customer, company and the person who now has twice the workload. Management also could have been more open to progressive ideas, and moving workers to desired locations; for instance I find I am more productive in the backroom, but it felt like my suggestions were not taken seriously. The hardest part of the job was standing still most of the day, as when its not busy there's not much to do and put back, etc. I am the type of worker who excels in a fast place environment where I'm able to move around and interact with customers in the front of house, or focus on the workload in the back and push through it with little interruptions. The most enjoyable part about this job, as with every job for me, are the people I'm working with and the customers I serve. When my coworkers or a customer is in a good mood then I'm in a good mood."
good,"Opportunity to learn about several aspects of department stores. Including fashion, bedding/furniture, jewelry, make-up/perfume, comissioned selling and incentives"
good,"Busy, interesting, built good lasting relationships with coworkers, excellent experience handling cash, working a register, and working within the retail atmosphere."
good,Macy's is big on considering its employees for growth opportunities within the company.  You can move up if you work smart and hard!
good,"I didnt particularly like the whole department store feel of not knowing your co workers. "
good,Worked in stride rite shoe store at macy enjoyed working with chidren store was nice clean management was good doing inventory was tiring dealing some kid was little difficult trying measure foot fit shoes etc.. got along with co workers love the employees discount
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Once a great place to work.  They used to have a great business model, listen to the customer and deliver superior customer service. Now they are trying to go after new demographics and ignoring their base.  They are reducing staff which makes customer service decrease.  They focus more on metrics than customers or associates."
good,The day is usually busy and there are never enough employees working in at least one of the departments. This causes employees to have to change departments throughout the day.
good,Coworkers were always supportive and helpful. The management would change frequently and jobs could be thought of as unstable. Customer service or Human Resources were hard to reach when necessary and not as helpful. Good for experience in customer service.
good,A typical day at work would be coming in handling the new merchandise that comes in an putting it out on the floor if needed. I've learned how to use time management an how to work smart an not hard. along with that how to co operate with my co workers an team leaders. also how to multitask when it comes to doing projects an my normal work duties. the management was good but the overall store needed work due to things being unoraganized which then cause for more work.. i.e working hard instead of smart. my co-workers were great.. the hardest part was adjusting too being put in different areas every other day an not being put on the schedule to work for 3 to 4 days sometimes only one day. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning about different designers an what they made an how they got to where they are today.
good,"A typical morning at work would be to open all registers, clean counters and get ready to open the store."
good,"This company allows for placement in different departments to ensure overall understanding of a functional department environments.  Learning products and services is most important to management, as well as employees.  Stand alone store as large as this one has many characters so placement, environement and ablity to work together is important. The company demonstrates these qualities."
good,"It's a good place if you are a part time associate who is in school. However, the expectations are extremely high for the pay. Some areas are better than others but they ask a lot of you. Managers are expected to work a lot of overtime."
good,Macys is always hiring. management is good and the staff is more like family. There is a lot of growth within the company as long as you show interest and are well at your job.
good,"I love to work in an organized, exciting, and dynamic work environment. I get along with everyone in my work place. I am definitely a people person. I am multi cultural and multi lingual a fact that helps me to relate to people. I am very flexible and I love helping people and solving their problems. My personality projects me as approachable making it very easy to deal with supervisors, co-workers, and customers or anyone who is in need. I love challenges and new assignments and objectives to be set and reached. When introduced to new systems or different applications I have no difficulty in learning and adjusting. My work experience with management has always been a positive one. They knew that assignments given to me will be carried out accurately and expeditiously."
good,"I have worked for Macys for a little more than two years now, in that time I have grown my relationships with my customers, business and my other employees, making friends for life and growing my dress stock two times the amount we had when I first started. I have received a big customer service award and have on average about 20 clients that see me on a frequent basis and love to shop with me. I am very reliable and have only missed work twice and two years, I always extended my shifts and worked hard for the company. I always worked hard if it was with customers, answering phones, register or placing more stock on the floor and making it better. I always up for whatever task is thrown my way and do it to the best of my ability. I worked my way up to specialist after only a few months and feel it's now time to move on to bigger and better things."
good,"Okay place to work, management was okay. Benefit are the best thing about the job and Holiday pay. If you like retail hours and standing on your feet for long periods of time than retail is the job for you. Make sure that if you do work at a makeup counter they offer training about the product. I ever met my counter boss."
good,"A day at Macys would start with opening the registers, attend a morning meeting or just make sure all products are stocks everything is clean and organized.When the store would open it was important to make a connection with a product in hand and try to introduce the product your promoting.. Always try to sit someone down to try things out so you can build the sale make the client feel good and purchase what you offered and used..."
good,They are open to letting people who have no experience to little work for them to gain experience. I had a good experience but i felt the store wasn't manage correctly.
good,To much work with not to much help from a few coworkers and management and not to much compensation a very stressful place
good,Macy's is always looking for better way to improve there position in the market. Not enough consistency with the management team.
good,Need to know retail and communication skills. Interaction with different customers. Product knowledge is a must and need to be competitive with other associates.
good,It comes down to the individual people. 1 Manager could be strict and very hands off while another could be very hands on and do everything in their power to make sure you're getting what you want/need out of the job you have and doing the job correctly.
good,A typical day would be that there were not enough people working in our department and not being able to take breaks due to the amount of customers we would have. I did love most of my coworkers and managers were helpful when they were available.
good,Macys is a good place to start learning about customer service. You will have to interact with many real experiences require you to make smart choices.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"a typical work day is pretty busy, you're working with many different customers. i learned how to engage with the customers. The hardest part of the job was remembering all of the coupons."
good,"Macy's is an enjoyable place to work. The management team is strongly driven and goal oriented. There was something knew to be learned everyday. From being on the sales floor to, team meetings and reviewing on my own, new knowledge about the business was retained. My experience at Macy's was a great stepping stone in helping me build."
good,Folded clothes and stocked shelves overnight for the next day during the holidays. Had to work as a team to complete all tasks
good,"Learning to do advanced things while selling like credits, returns, open new accounts on advanced computer register is Great learning experience especially with Great Managers, fellow associates going for commissions may get  cut throat which is something to reckon with."
good,Macy's is a great company minus the management style and lack of employees. Days are spent interacting with customers and tending to their needs while management breathes down your neck and speaks to you condescendingly. The best of the job are your fellow employees who keep you entertained and on track with inspiration to leave.
good,"I worked for Macy's as a seasonal employee. It was the worst experience I've had. My manager,  that was assigned to me, never once talked to me. Other managers were great and always told me how great it was to have me around. However, I was never told if I was going to be hired past seasonal or not. I had to just keep checking my schedule to see if it was extended, and when it was, I could never pick up any shifts. They expected me to come in and cover for anybody that called out. I did come in and cover shifts a lot, or stay later, much later, but was never given the common courtesy of letting me know if they were going to keep me. They expected so much of me, but couldn't even give me some common respect. They treated all the seasonal employees that way. Like we were just slaves doing their dirt work, and like our opinions didn't matter or our own lives. I wasnt sure if I should be looking for another job or waiting on them to let me know. Out of the blue, two months after the seasonal job, (they kept extending my schedule), I received a random voice mail saying thanks for the season and they hope I return for the next season. You don't just do that to someone who busted their butt working for you."
good,I loved how busy this job was. I had my numbers high. an worked as much as they let me. My supervisors were awesome. great overtime.
good,A fast phase environment. For those that enjoy customer service and work in retails is a good place tot start. The variety of department  give you the chance to move on in the company and learn for your personal development. Low season sometimes is frustrating cause the lack of customer which will be reflected in low sales that will result low commission and low paycheck. Some associates will still your customer to reach their goal but there are others that are teams player and will help you to succeed. A lot of go back in Christmas. You have to be strong sometimes and be aware of your co-workers that will get lost or do nothing in the area. that they just want to sale.
good,"I'm grateful to have been offered a position with Macy's Logistics and Operations to get my foot in the door in the field of Human Resources. Co-workers are great to work with, we are a great team and assist when possible. There are many projects available to be continuously working and we assist associates with basic Human Resource information. The negative side is not being compensated what an employee is worth with their education or experience, I was offered entry level with over 6 years of administrative experience.  I feel the experience in administrative duties is the same as a Human Resource administrative."
good,Macy's is a good company they keep up technology and fashion in this ever-changing world. The company is very generous with paid time off.
good,You learn how to work with customers. Teamwork and hard especially on holidays.The most enjoyable part is the self satisfaction of having done a good job.
good,"I gained a lot of experience working at Macys. I learned more about the registers pick list, and how to work as a member of the fullfillment team. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. They were very outgoing, easy to get along with and knowledgeable if i needed help with anything."
good,"A typical day at Macy's is very busy, especially during the holidays. You encounter a lot of new people working in the downtown Brooklyn area."
good,Holiday season is rough.... be prepared to work 75+ hrs from november to january... physically exhausting.... recommend only to those who have no college degree
good,This is a fun place to work with friendly competition. Co-workers are friendly and always willing to help new hires. Great incentives for opening new credit accounts as well as assisting with loss prevention.
good,"Great  Review, company takes care of their employees in regards to breaks and company issues.  In addition management takes time to adjust schedules an take into account the employees life status."
good,"Macy's was great place to work. The people and the environment there was amazing. The management was always helpful and hands on. my hardest time there was at first trying to figure out my task, but with help I was fully able to get a grasp of everything."
good,"Very rewarding, great team work and good professional management team.The most enjoyable part about the job was knowing that i did my part to keep someone safe and keep profits going to the store."
good,"I liked scheduling my own shifts at times that worked for me. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My job at Macy's is fun and I learn immense amount of information  about our inventory. The management is friendly and they are great people to work with, I would potentially like to move up to a management role. The only issue I have with this job is the pay rate. I need to find better employment opportunities."
good,i loved the setting it was fun fast paced and busy the customers were friendly and so were the co-workers. what I learned was how to interact with all different types of people. the hardest part of the job was to remember the sales for different items.
good,"This is the first time I have worked in Retail and I must say that it is really hard work.  I was a Supervisor and police dispatcher for 35+ yrs and only worked as hard as this job during a snow storm or police shooting, pursuits etc.  I feel that the employees are not compensated for their hard work and minimum wage is not acceptable for the work load.  No differential for night hours which is new to me.  I don't mind working hard, but believe fair pay for such a demanding job is a must."
good,I enjoyed working for the Macy's company.. I liked helping the customers.. I was able to see the newest and latest fashior on the floor. I was able to help any of the customers that was looking for their needs..
good,I wouldn't mind working there again nice company everyone is so friendly. work is smooth not too many bad days . its a plus working there because its close to the mall.
good,the management here seems to just walk around in circles all day.  Or sit in the offices.  They rely on the sales we created by calling our customers in the book for weekly sales
good,first week on the job couldn't really get the hang of things . then one coworker showed me step by step how things was done. I learned all you  have to do is ask for help.
good,"The company itself kind of puts co-worker against co-worker, cause if you want to keep your job you have to make sales, sales, sales. That  sounds bad as is, but it comes to a point where one person will have a line of 4 people and there at two other associates waiting to help with open lanes. And that's just one of the bad days. Good days, I'm in my department alone, closing shift, and I have a good flow of customers getting their last minute sales of the day. I have met some really down to earth co-workers, not many I can relate to, but still good people."
good,Very professional environment with helpful employees. Being my first retail job I was able to learn the value of respecting the customer while upholding a clean work environment. Active management so no one is ever left in the dark or always can access any answers to their questions. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people. although there were many employees who didn't take their job seriously.
good,I loved my time making life long friendships and gaining valueless knowledge on selling and make up applications. Unfortunately there is not much room for advancement.
good,I put my heart and soul into my position and I feel that i was not compensated for the hard work that i did. Especially when they want more out of you when you have such success (that's retail though). It was hard to balance outside family life with trying to be dedicated to you job. But over all I did learn a lot in being in a management position. I met very passionate mentors and certain management  supported success when you needed it. It allowed me to be creative in a lot of areas. I loved being a Clinique Counter Manager and the team that I led.
good,very fun place to work you have the best of both worlds all you have to is check fitting room and sales everything is done for you management turn over rate was very high after 2012 but that is expected in retail
good,"Fun and wonderful, and fulfilling job."
good,Overall easy fun place to work. Great with scheduling especially for part time students. Great potential in moving up within the company
good,"Was a steady job with the same tasks every day. "
good,At the start of the day you have to focus on customer service and fullfilments. Meeting new people and learned from them about their needs. Co workers always there to help you out and provide you opportunity to move ahead.When you dont open a new account and your manager not please with u is the most hardest part.We enjoy when we make customer happy and satisfy.
good,worked here for two years it was ok but we didnt have much staff on the floor so we were jam packed with work and the pay was not good at all
good,I do not have anything further to say at this time regarding the employment at this company. I have no positive or negative comments at this time.
good,"•	Oversaw goals, sales and the planning of events"
good,"While working here, I really learned how to read people. I got to realize when a customer wasn't having a good day or was having a great one. Working at this company made me understand people more."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very focused on pushing credit card sign ups. Fitting room maintenance. Selling, Returns and Greeting. Good first job."
good,"The company has been around since the early 20th century, but the values and goals may have changed. It used to be the needs of the customer came first, but now the needs of some of the sales associates came first as they treat it as their own personal gain. Each morning, I would do my signing duties and then get pulled away to do others associates jobs and preventing from doing my primary duties. Some middle managers tend to lecture me about peoples feelings and not to hurt them, and not to consider my own personal feelings. I've made good friends, but some of the staff managers made my tenure hostile. I would do my best to stay in good cheer and have a positive mental attitude, but it was difficult with the harsh treatment I received from some associates."
good,Perfect job if you want to be in charge of how much you want to get paid that week. Set your hours throughout the week.keep you busy.
good,"I managed handbags and ladies accessories. A typical day of work consisted of meeting daily sales goals and maintaining a high level of customer service throughout the day. I had to make sure my sales team multitasked throughout the day, but making sure the customer was the number one priority. I learned that team work is very important in order to get all task done. The hardest part of the job was being consistent in making monthly sales plan. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed. I would love to see smiles on the customers face."
good,On the days truck would come we would have the entire crew together working on it so it would get done quickly and efficiently. Very good people working together to accomplish mutual goals.
good,"Some days are fast paced and some are slow. Management is excellent and very welcoming, co-workers are okay. Best part is the customers."
good,"well, i would walk in through our macys employee entrance into our employee locker room. after i left all of my belongings in the locker room i would walk onto the sales floor straight to the escalators then went to my station clocked in"
good,"-I was a seasonal associate and I loved the fast paced work but the holidays turn people (customers) into maniacs:)"
good,"I really liked working at Macy's and helping customers, I also learned how  the retail and fulfillment center operate. I worked multiple jobs position including a dock manager for a few months. I would recommend Macy's merchandiser to any college student looking to work par-time and receive marketing/ business management experience."
good,My typical day at work would include cleaning up any clothes that would need to be put away. Helping and giving options to customers while their shopping.
good,Working here was cool and you meet people who experience similar things as you did. Very cool and laid back having fun while working.
good,"Working at Macys was a joy in the begining, I learned alot about the stores vision related to customer service and how that it is the number 1 priorty. I had the pleasure of working with many different people from different walks of life. I enjoyed the learening and development of onboarding new associates. I was instramentel in executing the classes in the 8 years of service. That was the most rewarding part of my job. Seeing and hearing how the new team members put the classes to use on the sales floor. The most difficult part of the job came to the holiday hours. Each year the hours of operation became longer and more of the holiday was taken away. You worked harder and longer with little thanks in the end."
good,"Often a supervisor from a different area would interfere, causing problems with other supervisors. If one supervisor wasn't familiar with how a certain area worked, production would be slowed down."
good,"Working at Macy's allowed me to know how to provide proper customer service to customers coming in, whether they're looking for something in particular or just browsing around and need help."
good,"At Macy's my typical work day consisted of 8-9 hours. They would usually ask me to stay longer  and I would gladly do so for an extra 2 sometimes 3 hours. I assisted customers, proceeded with transactions. At the top of the morning, I would count the registers to make sure they met the ""bank"" requirement. At the en of the night, I would count the registers, follow the bank requirement and turn in the cash in its respectful envelope to be signed off in the office. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a customer who had an urgent issue whilst trying to keep the fellow customers on the lines content. I say this because sometimes you have to devote a lot of time and attention to one person which may require extra assistance and it saddens me to see the disappointment in the other customer's faces when I have to close my register to address the issue at hand.I dislike to keep people waiting, and of course working in a customer service environment, your customers are supposed to leave feeling great about their experience. Honestly, I enjoyed every part of my job. It was a growing experience. Everything I encountered has and will help me along in the future."
good,I learned how to work cashier from Macy's. It's a very business oriented atmosphere. A lot of cool events they have to keep you motivated to reach your goals.
good,"Great early morning job! Loved my coworkers, the job was kind of boring and menial work, but that was okay because I was just happy to work there and the culture of the place was so great. I think the reason I was bored is because I have always been a people person and working early shift before customers came in and working independently made it not so exciting."
good,There's always something to do. If you enjoy learning then there's plenty of job functions to learn which in turn makes you more valuable. Easy place to get comfortable in.
good,Each day was a basically the same.  Running morning reports and prepping for whatever sr management needed.  Answered phones and dealt with customers as well as acting as a liaison for the employees.  I enjoyed the interaction with the employees as part of our HR duties.
good,Just an average job. Nothing spectacular. They do a good job of tailoring a work schedule around your availability. Great if you are a college student who has free time in the evenings and weekends
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Manage store coaching associates and connecting with customer."
good,A typical day at work is to greet customers and assist them with products and questions. I earned a great experience with customer service due to their high flow in diverse clientele.
good,Accepting inbound calls stopping fraudulent orders management okay seasonal work short lunches coaching wasn't great and team
good,"it was great job to be working at, helped me a lot to gain experience in retail."
good,"I learned to put items back if all possible when shopping and trying on clothing. This is not a hard job but it is not easy either. Staff and management was great, for the most part this was a nice job to have. The hardest was the long hours of walking / standing."
good,It was a great group of people. We were all very flexible and excited to be a part of the pilot program.
good,"Helping and assisting is the core to it all! Macy's definitely is the place to be if you are a lover of clothes and people! minimum pay to make sure floors are clean, mannequins are dressed and standing, no associates standing behind counters, and constantly ringing up customers. There is nothing really hard about the job!"
good,"It was a place i really enjoyed working with. Co workers were awesome and fun !, Department manger wasn't the best no leadership and management skill but overall really like that it was commission"
good,"Pay isn't that great and I don't get enough hours."
good,"My typical day begins between 4 -6am, except holiday season where my day begins anywhere from 2am - 5am. A short meeting with my team to discuss the sale going up or coming down and answer any questions, and we begin our day! Every product in the store is scanned for price changes. The prices are changed accordingly. This process takes abt 4-5hrs. I then run reports and blast signs for upcoming sales, make the work schedule for my team and help out the support team with their needs for the day. I've learned patience, how to deal with different personalities and how to be a good team leader. The management team is awesome and my co-workers are one big family. The hardest part of my job is the crazy hrs during the holidays. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers."
good,"i love the experience I had at Macy. Great management team and the hardest part is the hiring process, because training process and sitting down for a long time."
good,"Sometimes it's easy job, but most of the time its a lot of responsibilities and no time. You have to do multiple tasks without any help and the salary doesn't change. People are very nice, management is awesome. All of the managers are very helpful and understandable, they don't judge, they help. Team is the best. Benefits are poor."
good,"Some days very slow, some not so much especially in the cosmetics area.  Helping customer was the best part. Learned some management techniques that I would not use however, there were some that I would. Hardest part of job was standing continuously for hours."
good,My supervisors were very detail orientated. Teamwork was improvident when taking on rigorous tasks. It was my first face to face to sales job.
good,Very relaxed atmosphere. Friendly people to work with. A bit of lack of communication.
good,"Flexible schedule, "
good,Typical Office job you work in retail analyze numbers and go back to the cube.
good,"Busy workplace, always have something to do to make your day go by fast."
good,working for macys was good. I learned how to make sales pitches to different  customers.  The management was okay. the hardest part of the job was being there not happy because it wasn't something I wanted to do. The enjoyable part was knowing people left happy with what they wanted.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Managed cashiering duties in areas of purchasing, returns, exchanges, order processing, inventory    control, cashier management, and enforced store policies."
good,Overall my experience here was not too bad.  The job was very flexible to what ever hours you needed to work.
good,People Skills is well needed and have a motivated mind for a specific goal everyday.
good,Everything was new and interesting. I met a lot of friends. The management was great. I'm surprised but some managers stil remember me.
good,"I worked in two area my first year was junior clothing. It was a very demanding job, from helping customers with clothing to cleaning the fitting rooms. Typical day was the same as usually helping a throughout their entire time at Macys. I learned the that we must be helpful and patient with one another. A year later I switched to Cosmetics very different atmosphere. The co-workers in cosmetics can be a little rough on you. The hardest part of the job is trying to push so much on customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers satisfaction."
good,"on a typical day at work i will process the stock. Maintain the inventory and over see the day to day operations of the stockroom. What i learned from management that really stuck out the most was communication at the work pace and being receptive to feedback. I got along just fine with my peers; toughest part of my job was sometimes the constant non stop amount of work during sale days or holidays, what i enjoyed most is the relationships i made along the way."
good,"the job is secure at this level, but less secure as you move up... so it is not a good place to advance. also, the company is not very good at preparing associates with potential in advancement"
good,I worked in the handbags and fashion accessories departments and it was definitely fun because I take interest in both departments. Management is very supportive and will challenge you to be the best in your department. I loved the discounts!
good,A great place for those who are interested in pursuing a career in the criminal justice department. As a Loss Prevention Detective you are monitoring cameras for theft of merchandise. The employees are amazing and love what they do. They are very passionate about the job. I learned how to become a better observer of my surroundings and become a better people watcher.
good,"Good management, great benefits for employees, learn how to operate registers"
good,A typical day at work would include me clocking in to greet customers at the opening of the store. I would then walk around and see if anyone needed any kind of assistance. If anyone does need any help I would guide in their selection of the right product for their needs. If they agreed I would ring them up but if they disagreed I would show them some other selection or try to find what they needed online. What I didn't know was how cutthroat the competition was. Associates there would do anything and would constantly argue for their commissions.
good,What to expect in a work place at Macy's is a challenge waiting to be accomplished. I have great customer service skills and the environment at Macy's has increased my level of skills within a short period of time. I love team work; working with management that lend their hands to get dirty when it comes organizing a work place is a plus for me.
good,Showed me very great customer service skills. Very diverse company.
good,"-It was by the entrance where I worked on the busiest portions of Macy's, the center core. It was always busy and kept me going. People from different states and countries visit and you helped them pick and choose according to their preferences. "
good,"Work schedules and hours vary wildly, and no week is like the last (working part time at least). This can be good, as it keeps things interesting, but also bad as it makes things difficult to manage. "
good,"Overall, I had a good experience working at Macy's despite a few minor flaws in my department. Aside from my supervisor making some very not-so-sound choices from time to time, my co-workers were great! We all worked extremely hard in being the piloting department for a fulfillment center at Macy's Inc. in downtown Sacramento. The hardest part of my job were the two Christmas seasons I worked, and the extreme numbers of items we sold online for over a month. We couldn't seem to hire enough seasonal workers to accommodate for the workload, nor could we provide enough space for the seasonal workers that did offer a helping hand. Overall, the job was an easy one! A few heavy items to lift here and there each day, but we kept breaks and defected items to a minimum, and became the number one fulfillment center in the country!"
good,"Typical day at work, cleanliness, dressed appropriately,. Standing outside the counter smiling and  friendly. putting away stock taking returns graciously. Calling clients for promotions, something that was ordered comes in, and for special events. In management, I liked many, and I believe they felt the same. Working with co-workers was fine, and I made some nice friendships. The most enjoyable part of the job, was doing a make up lesson and not changing how they look, but making the person look even prettier then they already are."
good,"Customer Service, Assisting Customers. Fast Pace working. The hardest part of the job was the go back. The most enjoyable was having a sales goal and reaching it at the end of the shift."
good,"My shift is from 7a.m. to 3:30p.m. and my boss had a calendar for us to go by, but it changes on a day to day basis because we are always busy doing something. We have many set-ups to do for example father's day. There are certain set ups and out post that are required for sales and events. As the lead I must delegate projects to my team as to what is priority, we are a team of five. I also walk around with a phone, so when a customer would like to try on or purchase an item off a mannequin, I or one of my team members needs to take the item off. I am constantly challenging myself to be creative in all my displays and grow as a leader to one day own my own business and be my own boss."
good,The entire staff is very friendly but they make sure they keep their distance which is very professional. The customers are a very diverse crowd and I enjoy talking to them and getting to know them.

good,"Great place to work for customer service experience, multiple task knowledge that may sometimes be apart of your daily job functions but not listed, mentioned, or described in job description."
good,I enjoyed working at Macys I Learned a lot my co-workers were very helpful the hardest part about the job was leaving because it was just a seasonal position.
good,"crazy busy"
good,"It was my first job ever, and it was a good experience. It was during the holidays, so the hours were crazy for seasonal workers. I arrived about twenty minutes early and clocked in five minutes before hand. than for about three to four hours I worked with friendly people, which I enjoyed a lot. Getting every detail was the hardest part, I get into this routine, and sometimes I make simple mistakes, but I fix them immediately."
good,"I was in my elements at this position.  I quickly developed a clientelle of men who shopped for brands such as Hugo Boss, Theory, etc.  I felt the clientelling aspect of this job could have been better though.  We weren't given the tools we needed to really cultivate and maintain clients.  I suppose it was so it could be controlled within the store."
good,"There is always something to do at my job.  If you are not helping a customer then you are prepping food for the next day or filling up paper goods, condiments, etc..  or helping another department.  I learned how to bake and learned to make some main dishes.  My management is an easy person to work for.  co-workers have many different personalities.  There is never a dull moment.  The hardest part of the job is when the co-workers do not understand I have a lot of office work and they need to step to the plate.  They say they understand but, really ??.. The most enjoyable part is also my co workers they are really fun to work with.  Like I said never a dull moment."

good,fast paced sales I learned how to be persuasive and convincing I help callers with there credit care and rates management was strong and my coworkers were nice the hardest part of my job was the time management but I over came them and it became my most enjoyable part
good,"At a full day at work, usually I approach customers with a friendly manner as Hello, Hows your day going? Or may I help you find something. I learned a lot about the products in the department I was working in. I also learned how to convince a customer to buy products. Managers was strict but friendly at the same time so it made it a little easier to work, specially on slow days. The hardest part of that job was when the day was slow. There was really nothing to do but the employees still had to do something, couldn't just stand around. The most enjoyable part of that job was when the day was busy and all I did was ring customers products. It really made the day go faster"
good,"restock merchandise"
good,"As a seasonal employee i had a great over all experience with the store and everyone in it, but the management needs some work and tends to be very sloppy when it comes to scheduling."
good,"-Assist customers through implementing magic selling, understanding features and benefits of products"
good,"A typical day at work was decent and balanced."
good,"I enjoy doing my work, do customer service, make up my clients, have a great relationship with my customers and co workers, I am an achiever and a team player with a very positive attitude and more than eager to learn and be part of a great company."
good,Retail is horrible no matter where you go. Macy's is very professional so things are a bit better there.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was hired as seasonal help, in a lead position. I was thrilled.  I was told the job would last from Nov. to April. In December I was informed my position would end in January. I was only there two months. Very disappointing. The co-workers and customers were great. I was slandered by my trainer and supervisor 4 weeks in, apparently she was upset I got a lead position. I have 13 yrs retail exp. This associate continued to badmouth me, and management swept it under the rug. Other than that, the people were great. The work was monotonous, but the pay was decent. I was disappointed to be left off the schedule after Jan. 4th. Moving on."
good,"It's a job"
good,"price and hang clothes, stock shelves. help customers, work with RF unit"
good,A typical day at this employer consists of continuous interaction with customers.
good,"*Processes open enrollment benefit plan "
good,"O.K. place to work but doesn't pay well. Full time straight commission job but unfortunately part timers made almost as much because they worked just peak hours. Management was nice and repectful. Hardest part of job was when business was very slow, staying busy."
good,Greet and assist customers while maintaining a clean department
good,"Lots of on your feet moving and shaking. Wonderful interactions with customers, co-workers and managers most days. Loss Prevention was a bit overboard with their conduct though."
good,"Macy's is a Great place to work, I've met wonderful employees and customers while working at Macy's."
good,"Making sure you open enough credit applications, ensuring that selling floor is merchandised to the key, replenish selling floor, make sure selling floor is properly signed with sale signs, conduct quarterly seminars."
good,"A typical day working in a shoe department consists of helping customers try on fashionable shoes, helping those customers to the register to pay for those fashionable shoes and get the same customers to apply for a Macy`s credit card. I learned that no matter how hard you work, you won`t move up unless you flirt; that's why I was only a seasonal worker! I have nothing good to say about the  management at Macy`s. The manager I had in the shoe department was very nice; he was the only one. The hardest part of my job was dealing with all the drama but the most enjoyable was all the fashionable high heels."
good,"You assist every customer and greet them, try to sell more than one item to each customer. Learned to speak up to customers and assist everyone with what they needed. Management is ok, some managers will assist you with what you are having trouble understanding and others just talk to you when you are doing bad or they need something from you. Co workers at Macys are really friendly and help each other out. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for a credit card. The most enjoyable part of this job was that you get to meet new people, and working with clothes you get to see all the different styles."
good,A typical day involved dealing with customers complaints and counseling my staff.  What I have learned is that I had to be there more often than not.  Staff was sometimes unreliable so I would fill in.  There was no budget to hire over hires.
good,"Perform Outstanding Customer Service."
good,"Macy's is unorganized"
good,"Opened the store,ran the back of the house. Inbound and outbound trailers.  Validate manifests, stock,fixtures.  Processed merchandise so it gets to the sales floor in a timely manner.  Support store in every aspect."
good,"All day and everyday I am  very busy. I learn everyday something new of how to merchandise from magazines, co-workers, and  customers.  It is a good and safe place to work. All my co-workers are nice and helpful. I love my job but, the hardest part of it is making space to put new merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people everyday."
good,"A typical day at work was to provide customer service in the women's clothing department.  A typical day involved duties, such as, answering phones, transacting on cash registers, cash handling, sales, and general maintenance.  At the time management was not very strict and catered more toward the older employees. There were mix of co-workers, older and younger, and some instilled with hard work ethic while others only  did the minimum required.  The hardest part of the job was culture because I felt it wasn't as positive as I was hoping.  The most enjoyable part was the fact that it provided me with confidence to get outside of my shy and quiet shell."
good,For those interested in fashion & the latest trends this could be a great place to work and advance.
good,"As a sign team lead I am responsible for daily point of sale changes, as well as additonal descriptive signing. Scheduling and motivating a team to have weekly sale sets prior to the store opening. Influence and encourage sales through customer focused Magic programs and assist sales associates to make customer satisfaction their goal. I have learned helping people problem-solve and finding resolutions to seemingly impossible challenges is my talent no matter what the environment. The hardest part of my job is the constant turnover of the employees. You are constantly mentoring and coaching new employees. The most rewarding is seeing my hardwork pay off and the comraderie of the team leads."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Fun for a while, unrealistic goals for part-time employees"
good,"I loved the environment and the people. I like that things were organized such as my schedule, or what was to be done by the associates for each day of work."
good,"Retail Business, store was great when it was know as the Florida store and it stood alone as Burdines. The feeling is not the same now that it is just Macy's. It needs to stand alone once again."
good,We all get along well. Most of the time the work is interesting. we start at 7am. and I have several jobs they can do there. Witch ever it is I do my best and try to keep the mood lite.
good,Learn how to approach customers so they do not feel like you are stalking them when they just want to look.
good,"A typical day at work is talking and getting to know my customers so I can learn their needs and wants in my department , so I can assist them with their purchase. Management is ok but all jobs have good and bad. My co-workers are very nice people, some are not until I get to know them I bring them around if they want to or not. The hardest part of my job is folding towels and rugs, my nose is not to happy about that. The most enjoyable time of the day is lunch time having my lunch and relaxing in front of the tv or chatting with my co-workers."
good,"Learned how to maintain multiple areas of store, learned new material such as; how to operate a cash register, handle numerous difficult customers at once and to keep various areas neat and running efficiently."
good,Working at Macy's was great. Working with new customers daily is one of my favorite things to do.
good,"Assist customers with shopping"
good,Assist customers in selecting articles of clothing that they best described to you. I learned how to tailor suits to a customers preferences and specifications. Management wasn't far away when I needed assistance. Co-workers would stay in their assigned locations so they were able to reach their sales goal for their shift so teamwork was not always needed. Hardest part was watching customers buy clothes while you had to work. Most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with the customers and hearing about the stories they wanted to share.
good,"I am thankful to have a job here, although I do not feel challenged, nor do I wish to advance and climb the corporate ladder.  The people are very kind and friendly, although sometimes the associates and customers on the phone can be quite rude and offensive.  I enjoy when we have games and fundraisers for United Way, although they also put a lot of pressure on us to donate all the time with various drawings and raffles.  I suppose this is only possible when you are working within a large corporation, and I have won quite a bit of fun prizes in the past which I am thankful for.  Mainly I need more variety and challenge in my work day, and do not like working on the phone and talking all day.  I'd much rather work independently as I have a strong work ethic and I am task oriented."
good,Professional work environment. Fashionable quality merchandising
good,"My co-workers and managers were nice, but the job was seasonal and didn't pay much."
good,"it could be better for the mix of culture, its a big store but i think it could value their employees hard work better, i have learn a lot at macy's and i also i've got to know different people with different background, there is place for growth."
good,"Over all a good working environment. Typical work day is upbeat and detail oriented. I have become proficient in many company programs by teaching myself, webinars are offered but I learn more by hands on. The management team has a lot of turn over through a years time. Some movement within the company and some resign for various reasons. Hardest part of the position would be lack of communication, and most enjoyable would be the comradery between peers. When you have a mature team it makes it easier for the new associates to learn and feel comfortable."
good,"Macy`s bought out Broadway Dept. Stores in 1995, I was inter-"
good,"nice people great break room nice environment, great co-workers easy pace,hardest part is the managers trying to get you find new macy's card holders"

good,Very busy restaurnat attched to Macy's Dept store where I made sure all facets of the kitchen were working well together
good,Use your employee discount combined with the sales and you can really save some big bucks.
good,"A typical day at work was spent cleaning the department and assisting the customers in locating, purchasing, and returning merchandise. The hardest part of the job was having to compete with the full-time employees, especially since part-timers were judged on the same scale when it came to individual sale goals and credit. "
good,nice breaks but not enough hours.  Managers and coworkers were nice
good,"I would get to work at 6:30 a.m. and leave at 3:00 p.m.. I would scan clothing tags throughout a certain department and there could be things different for the tags I am scanning. I could either put a price-drop tag over the regular price, leave the price tag alone, or take it off the rack because there is no value on the merchandise. My scanner would send the info to the printer and it'll print the sticker out. I changed prices and stocked merchandise. My co-workers did the exact same thing as I did and we helped each other if it was needed. Those who were at management position took pride in making sure there employees were doing the job correctly and at a fast enough pace. There was really no hard part about the job. Most enjoyable part was fast active workplace provided."
good,Macy's is just like working any retail job. May have to work late and weekends but it's good merchandising experience.
good,in certain areas there is no growth and pay is very low. good hours and low stress
good,"A typical day consists of putting clothing back to it's proper place in a team environment with fun co-workers that make the day seem shorter than it really is. The hardest part is when you have an item that you cannot find where it belongs and you are wondering around when it is actually the last one in the store, so you have to give it a ""new home."""
good,this is a good job for college students just starting out in life
good,"Organized jewelry department, and created a team that made that department go from bottom of district to top of region within 4 months.  Received shipments, reconciled paperwork, repaired some jewelry."
good,"on your feet alot"
good,The employees from the new to old are always willing to show their point of view.  The management are always juggling from customers to their employees and it is a very demanding and stressful job.
good,"As the Home Store Specialist a typical day started out by making sure that the sales floor was well stocked.  When a customer came in and a situation came up where they wanted to talk to the manager I would step in and try to resolve the matter.  I did this so the manager did not have to get involved.  Many times this was the hardest part of my job but it made me feel good when the customer left happy. "
good,Open and closing register through out the day. Talking to customers and helping them with shopping. I also clean while on the job
good,"electrical installations every day, new wirring methods as time went on required one to two helpers to supervise over"
good,"I work with a lot of amazing people. My manager and our store manager (who was recently promoted) are some of the most caring employers I've ever worked under. They are extremely supportive, responsive, open to suggestions and very understanding. They are also hard workers. The associates, merchandise/receiving team and visual team have worked well as a unit to increase sales at our location and improve the appearance and overall standards at our location. "
good,"While the corporation shows more interest in keeping employees happy, the commission employees are cut-throat, and the various members of management don't communicate well."
good,"Working at Macy's starts early, long before the store opens to organize the selling floor and stockrooms for the other associates as well as for the customers. I have been exposed to a really fast-paced work environment where the needs vary from individual assignments to group projects, depending on what the day has in store for us. Management is has been great in letting us know what to expect and is always willing to explain in detail their expectations for the tasks so that we can meet their expectations. The hardest part of the job is moving from locations quickly and being physically able to perform the required tasks even after several hours into the day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a company Macy's encouraged very strong work ethics through supportive management, thorough training, and a strong network of team support. It taught me how to be a self starter and better leader. I enjoyed working with and training my associates to be their own self starters and develop their own sense of belonging and wanting to improve the department and their selves."
good,That it only takes a smile from me to make someones day.
good,"I have been working for Macy's Inc for two years and a half. I started working for Macy's as a Sales associate and a year later I was promoted with a position as a Specialist/Sales Associate. I enjoyed connecting with customers and assisting them with their special needs. I also enjoyed working with my fellow coworkers. It was challenging to meet monthly sales goals but I always remained motivated and determined. On July 2012, I was transferred to Macy's in Salinas and I obtained a position in Loss Prevention."
good,"I enjoy helping customers find what their looking for and putting a smile on their face. The management is great, they appreciate my hard work and give me credit when necessary."
good,My work day was calm and laid back I helped customers with the items that they needed to suit their needs.
good,I learned how to work in a fast paced inviorment working with a group of diverse and ineresting people. I learned skills needed for furthuring my career in the warehouse industry such as sending out packages loading and unloading trucks in quick and neat way.
good,"I am good at selling, unfortunately I hate selling. The company itself seems pretty great to work for. I liked their way of posting hours and points for attendance. Overall, a great place if you like sales. Also, the pay is minimum wage."
good,"The day starts early at either 5am, or 6am. Plenty of work to keep you busy. I enjoy working on the dock with my co-workers. I do not enjoy changing all the lights in the store."
good,"It was a good experience to work at Macy's. Worked at a very fast pace, needed to multi- task. However, it was worth it when you make good commission."
good,Overall good learning experience the holiday season was challenging and fun to work. Pay and commission compensation was great sufficient hours .Holiday season over not enough hours not able to make commission and job not willing to work with my school schedule.
good,"Everyday was someone different,apprehending customers or employees has to be done in a very cautious way,so the Company will not be sued,as well as myself as a Detective."

good,"Went through many postitions at this store. Started out in mens frangrance, got laid off then re-hired as a sales associate. After that I was advanced to a Ralph Lauren Specialist, then demoted to on-call because of my school schedule. It was great, loved working there until position changed to on-call. I was able to pick my own hours but usually moved throughout the store. Loved my co-workers but as they left the store, I did too."
good,its was very close to home so i didnt need to travel far. the human resourse department was great the really helped as far as when a problem occured in the work place

good,My co-workers were rude to me in front of my boss as well as other customers and nothing was ever done about it.
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers with their needs which, in my opinion is the best experience in retail. The managers are close however, my co-workers and I are like a team. The hardest part of the job would be coming across a rude customer or even coworker/manager. Keeping a positive attitude and charming smile the energy within the work place remains good."
good,I worked there mostly at christmas stocking shelves. It was an ok job for the time being.
good,You pack orders with RF units to send out to customers. Communcation was not the greatest. The company did not believe in letting their employees have the holidays off. The raises were not good at all.
good,"selling a lot of shoes, bed leadership, very good merchandise, great places for work"
good,"My typical day at work in Macy's are replacement and stocking of items. I have learned new skills, work well with others and be good what you do. Just be yourself and don't bad mouth others. Be open to criticisms and be a good role model to others. My co-workers is very hardworking and we respect each other. The hardest part of the job is there is no consistent hours but still managed it very well. The most enjoyable part of the job is I have a good relationship with my co-workers and manager."
good,Good work environment

good,"Fun place, very challenging! Poor work life balance, many hours and works most weekends/holidays"
good,"I loved this job it was the best! I loved the hours being on-call but the management was the worse. They don't help you at all, they are rude and because they have manager on their name tag they feel as though they have the right to talk to you any kind of way! Which i don't tolerate. The associates though, are amazing. They help when needed and they make the day go by fast!!!"

good,It's a grate place to work it has much room for growth with the company
good,"Company provides differing shifts to accomodating most schedules. There are many jobs that include first party contact, inbound calls and email contact. Management is a mixed bag, some are available for employees others hand off duties to team leads, some are personable and others are not."
good,I didnt like working with lazy co-workers. I really loved the management staff. I learned how to work a register also more details about clothing. My favorite part of the job was when i could do my job properly without any problems from co-workers.
good,You meet with the supervisor or your lead in the mornings to see what your assigned duties are for the day. Meetings are once per month to see what to expect throughtout the month. Everyone works great as a team. Theres really nothing hard about the job. You learn something new everyday when your needed to help in an area your not familiar with. It's always a learning experience in retail.
good,"Daily task change from day to day, as well as scheduled work hours. Employees have to be able to work multiple shifts that vary from there start time."

good,Great place to work I learned a lot working here and the coworkers were nice and helpful
good,Helping public with choices and help with finding what they need. Merchandise the store and stock new product as it comes in. I learned to manage my time and to get assignments done. Co-workers were helpful because they were borrowed from other departments to help as needed. The hardest part of the job was helping customers and trying to stock and merchandise the store at the same time.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help someone with their needs and talking to customers.
good,I love working here because the hours are good and it doesn't get in the way of what I have to do at school and at home. I've met a few nice people while working there as well. A lot of the customers are great to talk to. It's really a fun experience.
good,"Working in a true sales environment for the first time this is a great place to start. They give you a lot of skills to use in the job and to bring to other places as well. I learned a lot about selling during my time here. Management was not as willing to work with you as they first lead on to be and don't really allow for time off or flexible schedules. My co=workers were all relativity nice people but there was never a whole lot of interaction between any of us. The hardest part of the job was meeting their weekly sales, credit card, and various other incentives of the week, and being able to meet them all. The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant training that we received."
good,good company at the time
good,"Learned, to be patient with customer, all ways lesson"
good,"Working at Macys in the cosmetics department was a good experience. You are able to learn about different types of people from all walks of life and are able to help them with there self esteem, beauty, and skin care. The employees there are very friendly and willing to help you The best part of the job are the customers, especially during very special holidays."
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers and staff members. Monday was Muffin Monday! Management always tried to boost moral which was a good thing, plus they had great discounts for employees."
good,Not a bad place to work. Just expected to at least get bumped up to full-time after working there for so long and only missed my sells goal once since I've been there. Also as a huge company that makes so much money a year you would expect to make a lot more than you do here.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I meet the most wonderful people in this workplace, and they help you to understand the policies of the store and make sure that you know your products and merchandise."
good,"It was a decent job until management show a lack of concern towards my long terms goals. They would schedule me during school hours, and it would look bad if I had to call out. It was a miscommunication issue"
good,Seasonal sales associate . I really like this job the most it was something really different for me
good,"The Macy's Union Square, San Francisco store is a great place for those who seek to continue pursuing the retail industry as their future. They offer opportunities to become sales specialists, as well as I have witnessed certain associates who have even become sales managers. It provides benefits after 3 months, as well as contractual job security. The hardest part of the job is trying to get customers to apply for credit card applications. As an associate, we are offered a nominal taxed stipend from every credit card application of 1-2 dollars, with the unlikely one-time opportunity of upwards of 25 dollars after a successful month. This is sometimes nearly impossible as many people are facing credit scrutiny in the last few years since 2009 and are very reluctant to incur further damage to their credit scores. Otherwise, for most people seeking to continue in a grandfathered retail company, this is a fine place to work. Many of the older associates have been there for upwards of decades, and as I've heard are offered very nice pensions at the end of a 20-30 year service to the company. I did enjoy the common opportunity of meeting foreign travelers and utilizing my language skills. The only drawback from such an international clientele is that I do not, alas, speak every language. As for the Latin American countries, and Spain, as well as French and Quebecois, I found these skills to be of great asset and application when trying to communicate."
good,"they were flexible with my work schedule for the most part. For someone looking for a ""job"" it is a really great place to work."
good,"learned communication/persuasive skills, cash register skills"
good,"I totally enjoy working at macys, I revamped the off laoding of trucks at macys."
good,you are pressured to open credit cards
good,"customer service, clean up the store ( doing go back's)."
good,If your not interested in management or need a serious job may not be smart to stick around very long. Commision pays okay if you clientele and can handle multiple clients at once if not in big ticket departments. You have to apply and market yourself constantly to be successful and the holiday season is the best time to be around if you are not interested in that path.
good,"Had a manager I barley ever saw. Was told my school schedule would not be a problem but then they would not work around it. Most customers were nice, not a lot of training give before hand."
good,Macys was a good place to work. The people there were friendly and someone could help you though it took awhile. The management was not always that helpful and sometimes took weeks to get back to you or they just completely ignored it and you had to go to corporate to get answers. The employees were much better and they all helped out if need be like a family. I learned more customer service by working there as well as brands and how to complete an outfit with different styles and designs.
good,"Macy's does require you to work on weekends and weird hours, especially during the holidays (past midnight). Management pressures for you to open Macy's credit cards. Your performance is evaluated weekly on ""score cards"" measuring sales, average sale and items per transaction sold. They offer lots of training. Customer service is very important. They conduct morning meetings everyday before store opening. They have a point system where you cannot be late to work or points are deducted regardless of what the reason is. They pay is low. No sitting allowed."
good,Macys is a good enviorment if you don't have a lot of unexpected events pop up in your life. Their call out policy is sort of ridiculous though.
good,"If you love that and selling and meeting new people. It is a great place to work then. As long as you make your daily goal you will be fine. However, if you can't handle the high sales goal...during sales days or promotion. There are sharks out there that will steal a sale from you in case some customers return and change item. return your item and ring them up under their employee id's number."
good,Working for Macy's was a pleasurable experience because the customers & fellow employees made the days go by fast.
good,Great commission pay in those departments. The work vibe is try to set the trend display cutting edge while being classy. Great place to network and enjoy and fresh and new setting.
good,i was really dissapointed with their work ethics and how they control things.
good,"When I started out at Macy's it was a great experience, but once I finished my first 30 days then things got stressful. If it wasn't for my co-workers I would have left sooner than I did."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed helping people and making people smile on bad days.
good,"When I first started, the workplace environment was friendly, productive and rewarding. As the stores have been closing and the management has changed hands. The workload has increased tremendously without notice,    and no monetary compensation for additional workload. The customer used to be the main priority, now it's meeting metrics,  and chained to your desk. Management is always helpful and they are just handing down to us what they've been told by upper management. More people are needed on the floor and more time to assist customer's without the ( hurry up and get off the phone), we have cp60 to meet. If you like fast-paced, stressful, and a loud environment this job is for you."
good,"When I started it was a fun and good place to work"
good,Most days consisted of setting up fixtures of clothes and maintaining them throughout the day. Also assisted containers aim finding items and retrieving them of not stocked.
good,"Management is very professional and willing to help all employees no matter what department, but I can't say the same for the employees. Many are not willing to help you or claim they do not know anything aside from their given position. It seems like the departments are sometimes working against each other and can be petty."
good,This facility is closing as of February 7th. They are letting all employees go. I liked the people I worked with and will miss them more than anything
good,"Since it is my first job, being hired at Macy's has helped me to understand retail sales better. It is difficult sometimes but a good work environment."
good,I loved it just was far away from where I lived and I was having some personal stuff going on at that time so I had to quit but wish to go back one day
good,"Pleasant team of people. Customer focused. I feel listened to."
good,"We didn't get paid nearly enough for being on the frontlines of every holiday rush season. Of every destroyed fitting room of designer clothes covering the walls, doors and floors in every department. The managers showed their thanks by giving us meals, coffee, having cookie contests etc to boost morale and unify us as a team. Received bonus for doing good work, opening credit cards, helping other associates out when its slow. Great community feel to working at this Macy's."
good,"While I use to love my job, there was an incredible amount of drama stemming from managers as well as a dysfunctional communication system. I will always be grateful for the experience and guidance given to me while I was an employee."
good,This job was an eye opener to a retail sales position. I learned a lot about customer service putting the customers first as well as. Macys is a corporate company which makes it difficult to gain working hours on a constant basis. There are a lot of cut hours making it difficult to work a 40 hour work week. The most enjoyable part of the job are my coworkers they were very friendly and welcoming. It make it fun coming to work.
good,Easy compnay to work. Unfortunately they couldnt maintain a staff a large staff so i was released from my position. Althought while working there it was a wonderful experience.
good,"I worked as an APD and a sales associate here. As a sales floor associate, the job sucked. Had to pressure people into applying for a Macy’s card if you wanted to get a raise at your review...not right! Too many responsibilities for what they offered to pay. I am a person who prides myself in my job and always goes above and beyond,  so even the pay was awful I still did my best because that is how I am, but I become very  bitter and resentful towards management and the company as a whole because ofnif"
good,The job is great conditions in work place not up to standards in my opinion. Stairs and rats. The warehouse was very warm and dusty. Rats became a problem
good,"Over all good place to work,  scheduling system is easy to work with, management communication could be better, benefits need improving, I feel like background  checks should be pulled on all employees including management."
good,"I liked working at Macy's; everyday was the basically the same, but it was different at the same time. I only left because there just wasn't enough hours."
good,"Great Culture, company gives a lot back to the community. Charitable Events were my favorite aspect of work at Macy's. Retail, as an industry, is on the decline."
good,"I can safely say Macys does not discriminate in their job hiring process, I see people from all over the world get employed there. Management is very friend and their scheduling system is very organized"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This job is great for students. The hours are flexible and the pay would be great for someone who just needs a little money while in school. However, if you need serious money, I suggest working elsewhere. There is no benefits, and it can be stressful because the higher ups stress the managers who stress us in return."
good,I loved working at Macys and felt at the time of my employment I was paid reasonably. I had to leave my employ because of an accident. Being a rehire I was told all I would have to do in the future was to apply. Macys offered me $5 less than when I was part time. Realizing my employ was not Macys but the company I was representing itself. Other than the low compensation Macys does offer a positive environment to work with every day.
good,"The AP course and training depends on who will train you, their knowledge, and experience. I had a knowledgeable fellow but most of it was self taught, on  the job. Unfortunately, I got injured on the job.  The Manager was NOT FAIR in handling me and discussing my issues while in my probationary period.  Profiling was involved because I am Not Spanish. Will see how they handle & injured employee??"
good,"Working at Macy’s was your typical retail job. Customers at this store were extremely rude and it was the same thing everyday: cleaning fitting rooms, checking out people, and fixing racks. Co workers were friendly but the managers expected way too much."
good,"provide customer with a friendly shopping environment "
good,i Love the magic opportunity Macy's have to offer. The way they ask us to greet customers i feel like is a very good way to get people who are not comfortable to open up.
good,"Good place to have for a first job , kinda difficult to handle pressure at first but you'll get the hang of it, always good teamwork and communication. Always give good "
good,"Would I work there again no, but it wasn't a horrible job. I felt as if I was the only person being targeted for project and performing other activities"
good,Very poor management and a lot of favoritism. The hours were very inconsistent I always had to try and pick up shifts or I would hardly have any hours that week.The staff I worked with were really nice and friendly and I enjoyed helping my customers.
good,"overworked, underpaid, horrible management. I felt neglected due to the fact that managers wouldn't recognize me for any of the major help that I contributed to the company"
good,"Good company to begin working for, but don't expect too many opportunities to move up within the company. Very strong favoritism is shown in the Fulfillment Centers."
good,"Gather required scanners/ equipment needed for the work day, go out grab customers from the floor and bring them their products then try to sale the, said product and push getting them to sign up for credits."
good,"At the time was undestaffed, too much work, little to no training b/c of such. Had to learn the job myself. I was in support, not the sales. People complained, wasn't the same as it was years ago. Store stayed unorganized, etc."
good,As a part timer you could only make good money at Christmas time when there were more hours available.  I learned a lot and improved my customer service skills.  The union was very helpful in insuring that employees got the help that they needed.
good,Great co workers with some good management hours however were really scarce and pay was nowhere near livable wages was spending money to going to work that i was earning
good,"On an average day you will meet nice customers. Most of the time you are busy which is good. last but not least you will find yourself speaking, interacting with people you may walk right past in your regular life."
good,Not liking the new changes ! I used to love this job but now I’m heading a different way ! Hate the fact as well as they pressure you to open a Macy’s card !
good,"typical day, come in , report to the manager, check out landings to make sure supplies are filled in. give instructions to the team about the day to day operation. unload and process merchandise . deliver mail to applicable areas. receive fixtures/equipment. ship out customers' orders. record inventory/ supplies. help in store operations when needed. learned to be highly adaptable, learned from my peers and upper management. the hardest part of the job was dealing with not having enough coverage , when more than one person calls out and no one would come in , i had to extend whoever can to cover their shifts . i would work extra hours to get the job done as best as i can. most enjoyable part of the job is the team members celebrate when we finish our tasks efficiently."
good,"days goes by slow. I learned how to stock items, pull inventory, and sort by bar-code. A supervisor or manager can be fond with ease and are always willing to help."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy’s is a good job for high schoolers, college students, and retired people looking for something to do.  There’s not much room for advancement.  Can be very slow."
good,"I've always wanted to work in the retail field for my love of clothes, but after being there for some months it started becoming overwhelming and annoying. The customers were okay but they felt they were privileged due to the way the managers made them feel. The managers were young, they didn't know much about their positions and they would expect the employees to do THEIR jobs, like most jobs expect. They rarely helped out, and they had an under achievable and unrealistic goal they wanted ALL of their employees to reach in Macy's credit cards. I was there for over 5 months, and the way the employees that were for even a little over a year got treated, versus the way the ones that were there for months got treated (if I'm making sense), you could definitely spot the difference."
good,"This job taught me a lot about working in a fast-paced environment. Though it was stressful at times, and the work often became overwhelming, I was able to keep my mind on the tasks at hand and reach my goals."
good,"This company hires people of all ages. If you don't have any work experience there is a probable chance that you may be hired. My recommendation is to start as a seasonal, and from that point on there is a chance you will be hired as a permanent employee."
good,Store's in Florida are ran different than anywhere else!  Call center is exactly what it is! In a cube on the phone with calls coming in all the time that u are there! You do get breaks and lunch time no loyalty even after years of service to the co
good,"A typical day was busy but not stressful, because management did not follow one around and badger them or interfere. Co-workers were reasonable, diverse, professional and cooperative. "
good,"They're very flexible with their scheduling. You can give shifts up, advertise, take others shifts, and have a point system for calling out. The Macys I worked at was truly a family of associates who loved to work with one another. My store often has potlucks usually free some for charitable donations. They have their Path To Growth bonus, if the store makes quarter in sales you get a little extra money in your paycheck each quarter depending how much you worked during that quarter. "
good,Macy’s is a easy laid back job but sometimes it’s fast and a lot of competition because it hourly/commissions.So sometimes you fight for customers so you can reach your goal and make commission.Macys lacks professionalism because employees are focus on sales other than being professionals and giving the best customers service
good,"A typical work day started with employee meeting.  Your typical work day was determined by employees attitude and the department you worked in.   Management styles varied throughout the day, depending on if you had overlapping shifts.   Some managers were very task and people oriented, others were hands-off, as well as just task driven.  The hardest part of the job was getting other employee's to take his or her job a little bit more serious.   The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the interaction with the customers and the display's.  I loved making sure the displays and floor appearance was presentable."
good,Most of the time was a very relaxed and calm working environment. All the other employees were kind and friendly and had no problem assisting me. Overall good job.
good,I liked the job it wasn't too demanding but didn't slack on the work it made up for what you had to do. being assets and protection it didn't require you to do any heavy lifting such as apprehend people or arrest people just deter criminal activity.
good,"I liked working for macys other than the managers , hours were great I worked 4x10 mon-thurs , the work is not really hard but fast paced and you must meet a quota"
good,I stage the merchandise and make sure it goes out for delivery on the correct route.  I've learned how to use the equipment properly and learned the different routes. The culture is diverse and everyone gets along pretty well.  The most enjoyable part of is working with my colleagues as team players.
good,"Responsible for taking care of 3 Macy's stores in North Olmsted, Strongsville, and University. Making sure the registers, computers, phones, servers, switches are up and running. The hardest part of the job was when multiple projects had to be completed in an unreasonable amount of time. The most enjoyable part was being on your own and having the responsibility of making sure the customer is satisfied."
good,"I liked the people who worked here, but the environment wasn't as nice as I had hoped.  They had to cut hours and customers were getting mad about no one being there."
good,Macys is a company to work for only if you’re working it as a side job. The pay is not enough to live off. The company makes way too much money for they employees to get paid as little as they do.
good,"It a great department store after Nordsroom. Nice Atmosphere and "
good,"Macy's is a very flexible place to work,also a great friendly environment people are very nice and managers are very professional. Also great discounts on merchandise."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"- coming in at 6pm, working until 9, taking a 15 min break, then working until 9;15 then until 12pm then 12;15-6am"
good,"I worked for Macy’s in 2012 and I wouldnt of left if it wasn’t for my manager and co workers, everyone was nice and respectful, my manager was the absolute best!!! Made working there super fun! The pay was terrible but the environment was great!"
good,Working at Macy's was very fast- paced and allowed me to get great experience in a retail environment. The staff is very nice and helpful and really shows great teamwork.
good,It was a great atmosphere with fun happening everyday but still getting our job done. Massive management change and with that comes employees leaving. When you work with good people it makes a great team.
good,Working as a Bloomingdale's Client Specialist under MCCS is a good experience and stepping stone for me. People are nice especally the people in management.
good,I worked as a seasonal Fullfilment associate I picked items for shipment and in store pick ups As well as worked the cash register Also performed cleaning and rstocking
good,"I was lucky to have a such a great team, good management, fun place to work.  Hardest part of the job:  It is challenging to know which team is doing what, if you need to find a data or a correct person for certain task gets very complicated"
good,"It is good to have a part time job.  The flexibility is good.  You could kind of make your own schedule.  Management at the store I work at need to take a interpersonal class.  If the store manager and/or assistants managers do not know how to speak to their floor managers, what will be the outcome.  The store associates will be unsatisfied."
good,"I hated competing against my coworkers for sales. The fact that women's shoes was commission made some of my co-workers take sales behind others back. However, once I started working in the stockroom I loved it. And there was better hourly pay and no commission worries."
good,Macy's is a good bridge job. Usually pretty relaxed when it's not a sale day or Christmas time. Sales Associate position doesn't pay that well. You are pushed very hard to get people to sign up for Macy's cards almost tot the point where management doesn't care about anything else than credit applications. Extremely flexible schedule but if there is a sale going on you're almost guaranteed to have to work. The employee discount is incredible.
good,"I began my retail career with Macys in December of 1998. Being thrown to the wolves would pretty much describe my first few days as assistant sales manager. I was quickly promoted to an executive and continued to improve my management skills as merchandise team manager. I took over all administrative duties for our support team, I facilitated new educational materials to our store and helped run successful inventory (twice yearly). "
good,Slow paced work. Can be boring at times. Customers can be very rude with the employees and sometimes managers wont back up the employees. Not a good place to work at if you want a career and a place to grow. Only a good job for part time or student or seasonal.
good,Worked in the ladies shoes dept; interacting with customers; selling shoes on a straight commission sales basis; in a very competitive environment; and a structured commission scale
good,"It’s was a nice place to work but a little overwhelming at times coming in the fitting room was a bit dirty,just  I love that if you work in a certain department you can wear the merchandise."
good,My experience at Macy's was great the staff and management were friendly and helpful. Working during the holiday season and meeting people all around was definitely exciting.
good,working in the mens suits department I was selling suits making comission . I worked the cash register practiced excellent customer service and a safe work environment for the customers to shop.
good,Working there was great at the time. The associates were very helpful. Always friendly. Enjoy helping others and connecting with the guest to better assist to meet their needs.
good,I got the opportunity to learn about different departments so that I could be able to change from station to station. being able to communicate better with the customer by learning what kind of questions to ask.
good,"the management could've been more organized when it came to other ways for people to figure out when they were working or not, it was kind of hard when you weren't working on a specific day and the schedule was not going to be posted until the week after."
good,"Great Company to work for however in later years team efforts are no longer a priority. Training in Macy’s is a big plus."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Work from home.  Good team members and managers.  There was some down time between tasks.  Primarily we were a build team; Macy's gave us instructions on new machines to build (virtual and physical) and we delivered what they requested.  Aside from that, I worked to automate some tasks.  Primarily I used CFEngine.  I also used some Ansible for various things.  I also wrote some utilities in Python."
good,"Macy's was a good experience For me especially because I am a seamstress , so it was great to be in that atmosphere everyday. I enjoyed helping people find clothing that made them happy, and smiled."
good,"Checked out customers, did fulfillment, straightened the department. As customers dropped off, we were asked to do more tasks with no additional compensation."
good,The benefits provided were very useful to everyone who worked there but as far as promotional opportunities within the company it was nearly impossible and job security is something that the company needs to work on.
good,"I liked working  at macys. Everyone  was doing what they were supposed to do and even the managers were helpful. The other workers were polite, caring and helpful  when it came to the customer's."
good,"Some times fast paced, other times slow. You get decent work experience in retail if thats what you want to do. Very laid back culture. Very very low pay."
good,Problemas con las formas de pago cuando se trabaja por comisión
good,"If you're a sales associate, the managers mainly care about you opening up macy credit card accounts, which is the hardest part. I learned that macy's is a popular department store. And meeting new people is the best part of the job."
good,an okay place to work if you want something flexible and something to do other than that its very sales goal driven and they care about unrealistic numbers
good,"A typical work day would be 85% of the schedule you requested. Management was on top of most things but since it was retail they were always in demand with their various departments. The work culture was positive and very helpful. I would state the hardest part of the job was the ""customer is always right"" and they knew that even if they were wrong that a majority of the time they still would play that card. Most enjoyable, being able to help customers with their shopping needs."
good,"Retail jobs are all the same, do your best to help the customers, friendly matter. Do everything you can to make a sale to satisfy the customers. Some of the managers would be understanding, while others were not about how hard the job was."
good,Macy's had a great team environment. A lot of independent work with little management involved. I had to learn about the products and services that Macy's provided in order to better serve the customers. I was asked to be a Levi Merchandise Handler based on my organization and creative skill set. I loved making my department visually appealing and being knowledgeable about Levi's. The hardest part of the job was getting my pay to match the selling goals that I was exceeding monthly in my department.
good,The people was fun to work with and kind! They try to work around your schedule .  In the commission area it is cutthroat Macy’s is A good first job.  It was great
good,I worked as a Seasonal Associate. I was able to make my own hours cross-train between departments such as designer handbags or young men's section. Working during the holiday season meant it was a high-stress level time. Management was not able to have time to communicate verbally because you had to learn your basic skills of the job from training week. I really enjoyed the opportunity to be versatile and have flexbile hours.
good,"Macy's is a good work place, its fast past always work to be done. The employees are very cultured and friendly and always willing to help each others out even if they are not from your department area."
good,"nice people,go on trips clean place good benefits. help you learn the job.you have your own locker. good bonus.you have a hour for lunch plus two 20 mins. breaks.the also have a union,"
good,"It was a job I did not intend to stay at for long but I learned many things at Macy's while I worked there. My stay was not so bad, but I do not think I will ever go for a retail job again if possible because of strange and stressful holiday hours and the lacking hours during the off seasons."
good,"Great place to work, create work life balance, health care benefits is great. flexible work schedule opportunity for growth interpersonal promotion. "
good,It was a very pleasant place to work. I received a promotion quickly. It was during the busiest part of the season. The commission was a great incentive.
good,"I worked at Macy's for 2 years. The company is really easy to move up if your motivated and a hard worker, but it also depends on the manager too. I started off at Macy's as an oncall for clothing and ended my career full-time beauty associate. I quit because my manager was playing the favorite game. Over all if you have a good manager (which I had in different locations) the company is pretty good for a first time job. I had PTO and unavailable days as a part-time worker, I don't know if it's still the same since the company has changed some things."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Managers wouldn't let us talk to one another at times. The area this Macy's was in had a lot of rude people so sometimes arguments were started. Terrible.
good,Macy's was a second job for me.  The hours in the evening were fine.  However I did not like the weekend hours. I was employed with Macy's my children were young and I did not like having to work every weekend during the summer months.
good,"Macy's was a nice place to work, but it was the hours and the pay. The hours wasn't stable or enough to raise my kids. Macy's has nice management they will work with you under your circumstances but just don't push it overboard."
good,"Basically I off loaded products from containers, and categorized  the products according to the different areas in Macys that they belonged to. I enjoyed meeting new employees as I was on call so I only worked when they needed me to."
good,"Macys is a great place to work but the benefits and opportunities are not for every employee, especially the ones that works behind the scenes don't get any opportunities or promotins"
good,"Working at Macy's just for the holiday season was not what I really expected. The shifts are flexible, that's ok but you have to catch them in the employees page. This was the worst part of working at Macy's because you almost never get work shifts. In the holiday season I only did ten turns and that was not what I expected."
good,"If it's not a holiday then there probably won't be any hours. Most of the girl coworkers are nice but some will cause drama for nothing. Sales are very important and customers are expected to be logged so you may reach out to them again. The free makeup items from brands will rarely go to flex associates, they mostly go to the full timers."
good,Macys is a nice place to work at but there are lots of distractions going on right now because of there financial issues. They are laying off workers who have been there over 5 years and hiring two  inexperience temporary workers to do job.  Career opportunities are not stable.
good,Working for Macy's was a great experience. You get to do lots of exciting things and meet new people. With sales goals to reach you're always on the competitive side.
good,"Macy's is a great place to work. Flexible hours and great benefits. If you get along with management, it's great. But if you disagree with them, they find way's to not make it as fun."
good,"Management is not the best, they hire whoever is available for the position and don't provide proper training.  An associate is required to open at least 2 credit cared accounts per week and are held responsible if no customers are interested."
good,"Depending on which position you apply for depends on what you did. For me personally I would always have to unload boxes from the trucks, hang the clothing, sensor the clothing. I would also go on the sales floor and organize the clothing on the shelves on the sales floor."
good,I was able to advance from empowered sales associate to working in the office as an administrative support associate.  I worked part time and the work was rewarding.  I really enjoyed the friendships developed and the team spirit.  Sometimes the work was hectic but not complicated. My hours were flexible to equate a work/home life balance.  The pay in my position was not on the level it should have been and it was harder getting a significant raise.  I really enjoyed the work and the benefits afforded with the position.
good,"I do Love the people I work with. I might still work there if I was guaranteed a 40 hour work week. I have learned how to drive a stand up cherry picker, pick and put away also can work a scan gun, I was very flexible to work in all departments. When things need to be done right I was one of three people who they could count on."
good,For warehouse work its very under paid and can get a bit stressful but managment amd team mates make it worth it. Every day can be different and sometimes it can get annoying.
good,"My only experience of working at Macy's was seasonal. Having to sign up for your own shifts online was a huge negative for me because I never knew when shifts would be available until the morning of half the time."
good,Flexible hours and good wages along with health care benefits if you are a full time and allowances for sick pays and holidays. Management sometimes do not act professional(at least not at the work i work at) but overall if you are a student and looking for nice resonable and secure job Macys is well recommended.
good,"Working seasonal there was okay to say the least. I recommend if working there, be physically fit at least and ready to hustle. In my opinion I thought they could work better on training the new people, maybe then there wouldn't be so many mistake made."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The whole interviewing preposse was short, that was a plus. I would recommend to ask more questions. The training was longer then expected. It took three days."
good,It was ok u have to be a hard worker to be able to stay you can’t miss a lot of days or you will be fired you can’t have your phones and you get two breaks it’s open 365 days a year they never are closed can’t really be with your fam for holidays
good,You are required to stand for two 6 hour periods (30 min lunch on the dot) and the work is very repetitive.  Work includes boxing products for delivery to homes in the area.
good,The job was okay but pretty boring. Just had to be in the register and cleaning up around the store. Also help customers that needed it. The schedule is easy to work with.
good,"Easy to navigate a very much hands on self service style computer system to adjust your own schedule.  Swap shifts, drop shifts etc.  Also next to no interaction with mangers in relation to time off or sick leave (Seattle Sick is provided) everything is done through the self service system."
good,I love Macys and the career development  opportunities that they provide. I started as a sales associate and in less than a year I promoted to department manager.
good,The customers were friendly and I enjoyed conversations with my co-workers. Though they'll be occasional angry customers wanting their way because they shop here a lot. I don't enjoy a few managers who've been giving me a hard time.
good,The work place was organized and understood that employees had outside obligations as well as work place obligations. I learned to handle money and work with the public.
good,Great environment but heavy work for little pay. Got attitude from managers who looked for so much from you in so little time.  the break room was chill.
good,I enjoy working at Macy's.  Many people begin as seasonal hires and go on to become executives.  The opportunities are there if you are willing to put the time in.
good,"The store I worked at can be busy in other departments, but the fine jewelry department was usually slow, unless there was a big sale. The managers were for the most part likeable and understanding."
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with union workers. Countless customers who love to do outrages returns. Lazy workers. The pay is great. Gain lots of skills
good,"Benefit cosmetic counters at Macy’s is split into two separate teams.  One team will consist of a counter manager and beauty advisors which are Macy’s employees.  The other team consist of a lead aesthetician and aestheticians who are considered vendors.  There needs to be mutual goals, communication, and respect to be a successful counter/ business with two split groups of managers and associates."
good,I truly enjoyed my time with Macys. There were many years of full of excitement and innovation. I was extraordinarily fortunate to work with some of the best retail minds. I had incredible who are still in my life today.
good,I learned how to up sale and to help client by offering things they might need. The day always started off with pep meetings.We set goals daily. It had a very nice culture. The hardest part of the job was when the store was not busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was building new client and opening new accounts and successfully help client find great purchases they love.
good,Yes I would work there again I wish I never left in the first place Every place has a few bad apples u just have to ignore them. The managers & co-workers where great to work with.
good,"dealing with people , shoppers and co workers  everyday is unpredictable, it can be fun or frustrating."
good,Compensation is pretty low for the work and nature of the business compared to many other places. It doesn't seem that upper executives actually care or value employees.
good,"Great job for individuals starting off their career or students in school and need an income. Very fast-paced, at times stressful due to high customer level."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day of work at Macy's world start off cleaning and organizing the floor between helping customers at the register and find things on the floor. I learned how to work with unpleasant customers and how to really work with a team of people. The Macy's I worked at had three main managers I worked with, overall they were friendly and helpful and easy to reach at all times. The hardest part of the job was explaining to irritated customers why we couldn't do some things. The most enjoyable part of my job at Macy's was working with my coworkers, and meeting/ connecting with wonderful people."
good,its ok for seasonal but not a good for me for the long run. too much commotion. the hours are all over the place and they like to try and call you in on days you're scheduled off or unavailable.
good,I enjoyed loading and unloading the trucks every day. My manager was very friendly and helped us with every task at hand. The hardest part of this job is the heavy lifting.
good,"Been at Macy's for over a year and it can be a fluctuation between very busy and very slow, because it is a department store we make tons of sales and have thousands of customers. Management has improved but could use more work."
good,"When I was working at Macy's from 2015-2016, I was initially hired as a seasonal worker and stayed on a regular part time employee. During the couple of months that I worked there, I had no complaints about my specific position and I was pleasantly surprised about the camaraderie among myself and my co workers."
good,"A good place to work with fair pay, the managers are good people and layed back but still push you to do better, Ive learned good skills working there and I would recommend the job for people who are looking to advance their career in warehouse work"
good,Management is okay very helpful & supportive specially to new employees. I just do not get it with some employees who look at you as competition instead of being kind and show the work without being prejudiced.
good,This retail store is buys but manageable to work here. As long as you know the departments and a basic knowledge of where the products are you will be okay.
good,Fro working at macys i can say its a good job for anyone looking for a retail oriented job. You are in  charge of your schedule and can pick up shifts fro their website if you so choose.
good,"I greatly appreciated the on-boarding, training and mentoring from the entire organization.  Macy's has an incredibly successful Logistics team with highly trained and motivated leadership."
good,"Macy's was a very interesting fun place to work, the environment was up going all the time and the customers where always pleased with shopping there. I enjpyed!"
good,"Very good  place,beautiful."
good,I loved the people I worked with. It was a stressful job always had a hard time going on vacation. I did learn a lot from working there. They always promoted managers.
good,"Very difficult to review since I only worked on a temporary assignment but during the short time, I loved the work as we worked teams and the managers were extremely polite and helpful"
good,I have learned so much about sales. Customer service and interacting with people. I loved seeing customers from all over the world. I had allot of fun there.
good,"Macy's is a company that cares about their employees, You are given many options career wise, its easy to move up. many chances attendance wise. Very good about creating a team-based environment."
good,"I had the opportunity of meeting so many different people everyday. Got the best co-workers. During the holidays it's was so much fun. I learn so much about shoe styles. Matching with clothing. Help so many customers choose the comfort, style and convenient shoes for the outfits."
good,It’s a big and very fast paced environment. The managers were nice. I learned a lot of different things like sizing watches even though I worked in the clothes section of the store.
good,"I enjoyed the training, but was told that I would only get 28 hours per week and I need 40 hours per week, plus I trained for three days and was told I wouldn't start until the 29th. That means 2 1/2 weeks with no paycheck!"
good,Make sure you show up all the time and don't call in not much more to say about this job it pays your bills made a lot of good people lots of walking make sure you have got a good pair of shoes
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The job that I had was liaison between the associates, management and the customer. Due to the work pace a strong relationship was not seen and discussed with associates."
good,"Great seasonal job that I have had the pleasure to work multiple seasons. I gained experience in sales, computer/refoster. I had a lot of fun competing for sales at macys."
good,"I have been with Macy's for over a year now. I was promised many things as an entry level employee and received none of them."
good,Staff is pretty friendly. Good place for students who need a flexible schedule. Wouldn't recommend for someone who doesn't like night and weekend shifts.
good,"I feel that they take advantage of people, for example if someone is promoted to a counter management position they might be coerced into taking a pay cut."
good,Training could have used some work and better communication. Work was very relaxed after the holidays were over. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people to work with.
good,"A typical day at work is to make sure that the store is ready before opening or closing. Being moved a lot from different departments, I learned so much in so many areas. I liked coaching and managing my team. It was a two way communication and  beneficial to both. The associates learned from me and I learned something from them. Working was enjoyable with good team communication. We had so many events for the associates such as recognitions and celebrations. The hardest part of the job to me was during night inventories and the most enjoyable was having events with my team to make our sales goals. Macys changes every year. Since the internet shopping is doing great, Macys stores and employees were affected so much that they have to let go of many employees and eliminate positions."
good,I did not trust my manager although I did my direct lead. Macy's call center in Tempe used to be enjoyable to work at but they keep taking benefits and things that they used to do for us away. I would only recommend working at Macy's if you're there as a seasonal employee.
good,"Great start if you are a college student, can possibly grow in the company. Great flexibly. Employees are friendly, and polite, and good team players."
good,"Stressful, fast paced work environment. Poor training which promotes poor communication. Great potential for advancement, however. Macy's likes to promote from within; the company rewards associates and executives that work efficiently to produce results."
good,"In the Logistics Business Unit was my favorite place to work, but working in Merchanising really was not my favorite place.   All in all it was a good place to work"
good,"it was not to bad working there, but the only thing was the management was a little clumsy sometimes. They didn't really seem to be on the ball half of the time."
good,"I was very thankful for this opportunity, but the atmosphere was super intense and there was not a lot of trust for its employees. Over all i would recommend this job."
good,Working at Macy's especially for a high department store one person does the job of 3 other people which they could go out and hire. The pay sucks and i hated the whole commision aspect of working. there was never lunch coverage and the scheduling was horrible that they were always asking you to stay after or leaving that department empty.
good,As an associate you must make your goals even at the cost of providing outstanding service. As a manager you must ask you associates how many credit cards they have opened for Macys. They feel pressured and the customers feel pressured.
good,enjoyed working at Macy's during the holiday season. The managers and associates were very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this company to others.
good,My manager is great. Always communicates what is expected from us and follows up with him asking if there are any questions for him. Knowing what is expected of my performance makes it easier to perform my job.
good,"Macys' has very progressive views and the best technology.  They listen to their employees and  the Company tries it's best to balance work & home needs, and keep their talent.  "
good,"Though I've only worked for this company for about a year,  I felt that the job was quite easy and that I learned a lot of being a sales person.  The job wasn't as demanding as other sales job but It made for a good experience."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I have worked for Macy's for almost two years. I love the benefits and discounts, but the mangers all have an issue communicating and favoring those who do wrong to make their numbers better. And just to save face for the sake of customer service, they make us bend backwards for anyone, even if its against policy."
good,"As much as I resent the company, I gained a lot of skills. I was also easily granted many opportunities for brands, different departments, etc. I made a family with all my coworkers. You get incredibly close to everyone there if you're not in it to be a sales shark. But management needs a lot of work. For my particular store we never got recognized for anything we did. It was all about numbers. This company has incredibly unrealistic goals, especially when the economy isn't doing so well. When they don't make sales goals, they take it out on their employees for not doing enough instead of having corporate rethink their goals and business plans. Also was underpaid for all the work I did. I basically micro-managaed my department. Always had coworkers coming to me with problems with their customers, solved issues on my own, and basically trained myself. They only do very long training on the computer and a bare minimum to none in the sales floor."
good,"I grew within Macy's very quickly however, once I got my promotion my room for growth came to a halt. I have no room for advancement. The managers at Macy's put a lot of stress on your shoulders and blame you for things you have no control over. They don't give you the tools you need to succeed. My team is awesome and I'm grateful for the opportunities I got while working for Macy's. I don't see this being a forever job."
good,Macy's is a pretty chill place to work. Besides checking out customers and cleaning up fitting rooms there isn't much you have to do. Management wants you to sell a certain amount and open up a certain number of credit cards but customers love to shop and they open up cards all the time.
good,"Coworkers did their jobs correctly but did not seem positive about their positions, and often complained about working overtime."
good,fast paced retail store. Must work weekends and evenings and all holidays. Customer service oriented. Must be able to muti task and do register and stock
good,A typical day at work would consist of reviewing inventory and moving items to there designated area. I operated the forklift to move the furniture to the floor locations.
good,The majority of my job description required that I maintain an accurate register. Keep the department presentable and assist customers with their purchases. Count inventory every quarter in my department. Along with provided help to other departments when necessary.
good,Macy's is a great place to work. You can advance easily and also you get paid every week. Benefit stars as soon as you work but you have to be full-time.
good,not bad only worked five hours a day and the manager didn't even remember hiring me. I  would never actually see the manager and when I did he would always ask me my name.
good,"Get in early around 8 every morning. Check my emails to ensure all is going smoothly on my end as the Receiving manager. Communicate with other managers and letting them know whats my plan for the day and if they need anything from me, cause I do tend to get busy. Inbound and receive the trailer with new merchandise that's coming in. Spend all day unloading product and ensuring that all is processed correctly before it hits the sales floor."
good,It was a nice working environment with lots of loving coworkers. Our working days went by quickly just by being busy all day long. Managers and supervisor was easy going.
good,Fun place to work. only worked as a seasonal employee. Great people. My managment in the womens shoe department was great. hardest part was the work hours.
good,"a typical day in this work environment is, walking around replenishing merchandise and to make sure the merchandise is stocked neatly for customer shipment."
good,I got promoted three times during my 3 years at Macy's. I was a great experience gaining lots of management experience with the company. I got rewarded many times for my performance. Its a very busy place to work but its a lot of fun to work there.
good,"Macy's give me the chance to have my first job in United States i think it has a very including policies about diversity, is a friendly environment the hourly pay is not so good but if you work in commissions is up to you to do your best to have a good pay check."
good,Very good place to work.I learnt a lot from there.My colleagues were very helping.Working hours were flexible.You are not getting good pay but the work load is also not too much.The seniors and management are not helping
good,"-I have learned self confidence in my personal and professional interactions with conflict "
good,"Communication of policies and procedures with store population.  Protecting our company assets through external and internal investigations and apprehensions. "
good,"A typical day at Macy's was never the same. Granted there were actions that took place everyday but never quite the same. One of the most rewarding tasks, the coaching of associates, often took place in the moment. I found myself using the everyday workplace scenarios as a teaching moment to better my associates. I was always proud when my associates ""got it"", whether on the sales floor or an official training class. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked at the macys in palm beach gardens Florida, i started as seasonal, and worked my way up to full time, it was a fun experience, i enjoyed my time their and would recommend working their to anyone else."
good,The store is typically busy and things can get a bit hectic especially on sale days. The main job function is to ring up customers at the register. The secondary functions are to organize your assigned area and help customers find what they need. You are also expected to encourage customers to open up credit cards and tell them about seasonal promotions.
good,At Macy's Culver City you never really know what might come your way. Everyday can be a little different. It can be really busy or really slow. There are some perks when it comes to getting free gratis from the makeup companies that we carry in our counter.
good,"No Opinion - I worked there for 3 months with a solid pay and decent commission for sales made at the makeup counters. "
good,"Macys is a huge store so everyday was different and competitive. I worked at the location on State street which meant tons of downtown shoppers, including foreigners. On top of our commission based tasks we had to complete, making sure every customer had the best service as possible was an key objective. For the most part the environment was hectic but there were times where it got so slow that we were fighting in competition to get to the customers and meet their needs. I think the hardest part was when we had more associates than customers in our department. That wasn't fun at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers feel great leaving the store. Some times you could sense the customers had a rough day and by taking time to make sure they didn't leave the same way they came in is what makes my day and they really appreciate that."
good,"•	Performed inbound and outbound calls to process orders for customers"
good,"I love working at Macy's. I love my boss, like he store manager. I enjoyed working with my co workers but this job is very demanding. No work life balance for full time workers. Over worked with little to no recognition or rewards. HR is lazy & fired me for $5. The company doesn't care about their employees or how hard they work. Been there for 8 months"
good,fun and pleasant environtment and comfortable work place good management and friendly service a typical day consist of opening boxes and placing items in boxes on sales floor
good,Management is great and is very willing to work with your schedule. You are expected to work hard and I would only recommend to morning people. We start early and get off early.
good,It's pretty much easy work once you get used to it and everyone was very helpful when it got hectic. You also get free Fragrance samples.
good,"Upper Management needs to keep a better pulse of the Executive team and associates who report to them. Too many people are given absolute control and strips the authority from the rest of the executive team. Work is challenging and is never is short supply, which is something where strong leaders can thrive. On boarding could be much better but in order for that to happen, the company would have to pay more then the minimum."
good,"Macy's is a good place to work every one there nice, works as a team. There is no drama while working the lunch breaks are nice on the holidays. the job is pretty easy as far as that go."
good,"on a typical day, it was very hectic in the store and lines are very long. We did our best to treat every customer the same and to have the same opportunities."
good,"Macy is a very fast paced, competitive work place. It is a lot of hard work, but is fun to work with so many people. Every day brings something new and you are always learning something new."
good,I learned customer service. The management team could never make a working schedule. The hardest part would be the language barrier with some customers.
good,Needs better management and more hours. But it's a fun and face pace environments to work for. There are also alot of positions you can work for but they don't like to give raises to there associates
good,"Everyday, work is different which is fun for me. Work given for 4 hours can be accomplished in 2 hours. Co-workers are diverse in terms of race, and work ethics. No problem with communication since all can understand English. Some employees intentionally slow down their tasks to get extensions and overtime pay, the rest are quick, efficient, and very much reliable. Macys will have to improve their management, otherwise Macys will just waste their money on the slackers."
good,Helping customers with items and price check. All ways be kind to others pick up after your self. I enjoy seeing people happy at what they do that's shop.
good,"learn alot about selling; sometimes its fun' working in various departments you gain knoweldge. co workers are cool "
good,"Responsible for managing sales team."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working at Macy's helped me learn quickly, gain experience in customer service, and really see how retail is run. Macy's is a world-recognized brand, and I was able to help customers from different countries and cultures. I enjoyed team building exercises and how the managers would meet up with us weekly to discuss our goals and work with us on how to improve. The competitive atmosphere helped to motivate me in my position and aspire to work my way up. "
good,"Structured call center environment. I learned a wealth of management skills in this organization, excellent Lead  Program for aspiring leaders. I had great managers who were supportive of those interested in moving up in the organization. Co workers were generally pleasant. The hardest part of the job were the constant policy changes and changes in general. The most enjoyable part was set schedules."
good,"A typical day at Macy's will always be productive. There is always something to do in every department. Will usually never have nothing to do. I learned at Macy's how to be a good leader to the team I was appointed to work with in my department. I learned a lot everyday about the retain business and the work it goes into having a successful selling day with merchandise. My coworkers were the biggest help for me. We learned and worked together daily and with the good working relationship we all had, it made the work and deadlines to complete the work very easy. The hardest part of this job is the demand to be more productive when the time we had didn't allow to do everything at once, along with no recognition for all the work done. The pressure on holiday sales and long hours during the holidays did get to co workers and myself at times. I will say the most enjoyable part of the job was me being given the chance to advance myself from a shoe expediter to a Merchandise Team Lead. It was a stable job, good working hours and good pay."
good,"Macy's has one of the best Executive Development Programs!  My boss was amazing and took the time to really help me develop as a manager. She took every opportunity to help me learn, and give me exposure during corporate visits. She was all about promoting her managers to do something greater with their skills! Absolutely loved my time working at the Cherry Hill Macy's. "
good,"Typical day at work involves me standing around waiting to package ans label shipments on a machine. I've learned how to work in a fast work environment, and improved my organization skills.I was working alone to at my position to be associated with others."
good,Macy's has been a great experience and introduce me to the world of cosmetics. It has been a great stepping stone in this career journey I begin 2 years ago.
good,Great Job To Get Your First Experience From. They Are Flexible With You And Offer You The Choice To Add More Hours Or Give Away Your Hours.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different people from different backgrounds. The co-workers are friendly and the managers are sometimes flexible. Management varies depending on what floor you work on
good,I loved working for this company. It was a great learning experience. I met so many amazing people through this job. It was stressful and rewarding. They teach you as you go and are willing to negotiate pay with you.
good,"very busy flow of customers, great managers and great benefits. Great for College jobs, locations is perfect right at the center or the town. Managers are very flexible with college hours."
good,"reaching sales goals, interacting with new people everyday and the regular shoppers. I really enjoyed my coworkers"
good,"My typical day consists of taking payment from purchases, keep fitting room neat and clean every hour. I learned the Point of service cash register system other than what we were trained on. I have different  management during the weekend shift and they are attentive when needed and pleasant also knowledgeable. We have team players in all departments. The challenging part of the job is keeping the fitting rooms neat and clean when we are busy or short staffed. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with pleasant and friendly people."
good,"It was an okay job, but after being there for a while; you'll notice that Macy's lack qualified managers and supervisors. Macy's expect more out of you than they give."
good,Its fun working as a visual you get to be creative. It's full time and crazy during christmas but if you get through christmas that job is overall easy.
good,"Working in fast food early in my employment starting period helped me to be able to get use to diffirent people an ther attitudes, an how to handle stressful situations independently. Also prep you with everyday job skills you will need with any job/career."
good,"Working at Macy's taught me how to be patient and multi task. As a sales associate I worked as a cashier, did recovery of the sales floor on a daily basis, and I also worked on my customer service skills. The work was tough and enjoyable at times. The co workers there were nice. However, the pay was little compared to the work. The pay also didn't increase by much as the year progressed."
good,"At work i just cashiered transactions "
good,friendly atmosphere though the merchandising team is under appreciated. sometimes you dont get recognized and the raises suck.
good,"Always adding aides to the floor everyone always joined in if we needed it. the administrator was even on the floor!"
good,Low pay overrides everything else nice that goes on for employees.  They try to do nice things but turnover is very high and employee attitude sometimes reflects this.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"You learn alot and meet great people, but the enviornment can be bad. Managers in the store I was in only cared about their section, No real teamwork, the building was always understaffed the Limits on PTO was annoying, Their is no sick days which is now a law in NY. Maybe it is a store to store case."
good,"Loved the fact that there was three different shifts to choose from, 4x10, 3x12, or overnights. You are able to interact verbally with employees and potential employees."
good,"Greet Customers "
good,"Working as a sales associate for Macys, I would provide quality service by helping customers finding merchandise that the store offers.  Sometimes I would make suggestions based on what they are seeking."
good,Macy's was an okay job as an associate. I've learned most of my experience of retail there. What I found really tiring about the job was inventory where we had to spend all night twice a year scanning and counting items. I've only had one manager that did not do their job correctly. The only hard part was trying to open enough credits to reach your goal. The most enjoyable about this job is the coworkers.
good,you dress up for work everyday. have to provide good costumer service. schedule is good if you go to school or have kids. a lot of competition between managers and so as between associates. once you get a higher position the demands are higher and sometimes not compensable. managers will push for sale (even in slow days) and opening credit cards is key.
good,macy call center was ok they have great benfits and the company itself give you an huge discount nda you are able to pick your own schudule
good,"The schedule in this position was awesome 6 to 3 Monday through Friday with no weekends ,and by the time that the store opened your day was almost over. In visual we didn't have to interact with the public which made this position even more enjoyable."
good,"I sell women shoes to customers, help them with any questions, open credit cards, dust, organize the stock room, answer phone calls, ship items, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer find exactly what they need and then having them thank you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with hateful people who take their frustration out on sale associates. I have learned a great deal about customer service and have improved my selling skills greatly."
good,i would get to work most of the days and the other employees were very rude. It was days i get to work and it was too many people in one station or assigned area. very unorganized and i didnt like it.
good,they believe in a cross culture where you can move internally within the company enabling you gain exposure to other areas of business
good,"Working at Macys is like a roller coaster ride. It has the good and the bad, however over all it was a fun experience to take part in such a job. Working at macys means helping customers feel happy when they come to shop. Our goal at macys is to make magic, which means we meet and greet customers, ask questions, give advice and celebrate their purchases. Macys is a diversified company and it was great working with different people of all races and age groups. The hardest part of the job is having is having to clean up the department after a long day, or when customers become upset and make offensive remarks. In such cases as an associate/ manager, I have learned to stay calm, and express my apologies towards the customer."
good,I usually would go in to security by showing them my I.D. and then going up to the floor I work on and having a daily meeting with my co-workers about weekly achievements and everyone's daily goal. After I would get my own cart and start RePlening and Picking items that needed to be stocked. My management was very helpful along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working someone elses shift and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"It's ok. I have a hard time being tied to a desk,I am a very active person. Management is wonderful and helpful. It's a 1-800 number and all that ,that implies"
good,"Agile Development, Multi-Country Teams. Sales and Promotion oriented Development. Enterprise stability and rigidity in advance tech adoption."
good,"The manegement very poor, no experience in the business, they feel superior, the employees have more experience and knowledge they, some co-workers have the position because are friends or recomended per a manager or ae of fragance company but no experience and they pay better salary to this people."
good,decent not a bad job but can communicate better with employees about advancements and oppourtunitys. But overall decent environment and management.
good,There is so much opportunity to grow in this organization and the development tools are provided. If you are a go getter and want to learn and apply yourself the opportunity is available.
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers and I have learned from them. They provided employers with food during the holidays.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Not a good place to work if trying to save up for something. You can barely get any hours from the lack of trucks brought in form the dock.
good,"A typical day at work will involve assisting people locating merchandise, working the register at various departments throughout the day and possibly dealing with a rude customer or two.  You will learn about various products based on the department you are told to work at.  Most customers that come in are usually patient and friendly.  Since this was an on-call position, you will likely get paid barely above minimum wage.  This is a job that you should take if you need the extra income but not the one you should live on."
good,"I personal loved working at Macy's I liked their way of up selling and how they believed that sale floor associates should interact with customers. I liked the training and it was very easy to learn and was paid btw. However I did not like the in store management they would sit on the couch in the furniture section and just chill while people needed their assistants both customer and employees. When management wasn't laughing it up I hardly seen my department manager but he was friendly so I could complain. The shifts are great and you make your own schedule so you cant complain about hours. The break are great and match the shifts perfectly. The co-worker are nice and very understanding of being new to the job. Everyone is very supportive except the cosmetic girls/guy, they can rub you the wrong way  ,but they are alright to talk too. Hardest part of the job is having to call other stores and having them be blatantly rude or just hang up on you while your with a customer."
good,"Its good as a first job, but there is not many chances to advance. the hours was cut drastically, so is not a job to survive. There is good hours in high season of course, but if you get a part-time job, they cut from 20+ hours to 12."
good,"A typical day at work fast pace and fun at times, "
good,Enjoyed the interaction with co-workers.  A lot of employee appreciation activities. A lot of community service campaigns.
good,"Recover sales floor"
good,They worked with others and took the time to make sure each employee was satisified with their job. Lack hours for Flexibilty workers could improve.
good,"Great Staff and company offers a  lot of development and growth, I have learnt a lot in years I have been with the company. I  am extremely thank full for the opportunities I was given and development provided. I can not say enough good words about my mentors. I do not really care for immediate management though."
good,"I had been an employee of Hecht's for 12 years when Macy's bought out the company. They kept management on over the first year of conversion and then began eliminating positions. Human Resources for Macy's is handled from a single location in Atlanta, Ga. thus my position was one that was eliminated as well as my staff of 5 associates.  I cannot speak personally about the current environment other than to say that most of the associates I know no longer work there."
good,"Positive part-time employment during the Christmas New Year holidays.  The only problem was that there were not enough CSRs available, which is common with retail stores."
good,"A typical day would normally consist of tagging, folding and hanging new shipments of clothing and sorting them by brand, size, and sections of the sales floor. This job taught me about what goes on ""behind the scenes"" of a large clothing store. Management and coworkers were friendly and kept things fun while working in a fast paced and stressful environment. The hardest part of the job was memorizing what brands went on which racks. The most enjoyable part was working on the sales floor and interacting and consulting with customers."
good,"Best departments to work in honestly, the customers are always friendly and there is always a deal you can snag. Working with my co-workers was a blast, you meet so many new people each and everyday , its really an overall joy to be there in the work place"
good,My manager barely gave me and other employers work to do we just had to find work but other than that we all made a great time work effort!
good,"Overall Macys has been a nice place to work at, the people can be friendly. There is a lot of team work here, people who will lend a helping hand."
good,"Macy's has many different departments. My department is pricing. normally I come in and grab the utensils i need for the day.I get assigned a team leader and then i depart with my team to start scanning clothes. We normally scan until 11 am. from 10-11 we also help costumers. management is pretty lenient and understanding. the environment is safe and comfortable. The hardest thing abut my job is that its so easy to get bored, tired and uninterested. Its also hard to adjust because work hours are not very frequent. Some weeks we may not work at all and others we may have 3,4, or 5 days."
good,"Work with a team to receive and put away inbound merchandise. Operate a stock picker, turret truck, reach truck forklift, and electric pallet jack to accomplish most daily task. "
good,"A great place to work with flexibility"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The management was really bad at Macy's Home Store, other department managers wouldn't try to help us because we made more money than them and they were jealous. "
good,"as an employee of Macy's I learned what it takes to sell merchandise I learned that one must completely know the ins and outs, pros and cons of your product to effectively sell it. The Management was very supportive and helpful but the only problem I had with them is that they were a little to binding. I say that because when I signed on to start I had to agree to stay with the company for a year, and while I Completely intended on staying with them an opportunity for me to play collegiate football and I took it, since I had to relocate and no longer work for macy's I can no longer work for Macy's or a company owned by Macy's."
good,"When it is a slow day. Managers will be on you to open up credits and make your sales, but there is no people in the store. Not many open hours I was an option 5 only got 3-8 hours a week max."
good,Macy's is a great place to work. They provide training and daily coaching. Your coworkers are your greatest asset. Flexible schedules and gratis when you work in cosmetics.
good,"If you work hard they do reward you and move you up. However, they don't pay internal candidates at a competitive salary like they would someone from the outside."
good,Management was helpful when affording time and personel to priority jobs and knowlageable when supervising employees needs. Co-workers were cheerful and a pleasure to work with.
good,"Macy's is a good place to work. It offers a diverse environment, with an established leader in the retail space. There is room for advancement and the workplace is fun/relaxed."
good,"Good for the 'seasonal rushes', but not very good about managing the time or personnel needed for the 'off' season times"
good,Working at macy's was tolerable. They have a decent system in terms of scheduling and picking up shifts. I personally didn't see myself staying there for too long. Its a very time consuming job.
good,Its a good work environment to start with if your in high school. I learned a lot from working there for 5 years. I learned to assist the customers when they need help. Good teamwork. The most enjoyable part of working there is helping the customers and co-worker. the hardest part of working there is custumers getting mad if the coupon don't work that items they would like to use.
good,"Great place to work, even if it gets busy. Awesome colleagues. Culture is really good. Benefits not as good especially vacation days."
good,A typical day at work would be me interacting with customers and helping them find what they need. I've learned a lot working at Macy's as far as retail and using the cash register.
good,Sold a variety of merchandise to customers contributed significantly to increased store sales by providing great customer service worked effectively in a highly pressurized environment while also meeting marketing goals
good,I loved working with my co workers. My trainer was so great an very helpful. I couldn't ask for a better trainer or co workers. I never felt like i didn't fit in while working there.
good,Macys allows their employees to choose their shifts however full time employees get the first picks of the shifts. The discount is great and can be applied with any purchase and coupon.
good,Great place to start a career in retail but advance is slow if you want to move outside the retail stores. Control your metrics and you will be fine but overall performance is just daily not overall.
good,"Work Ethic and Management is very contradicting between On-floor Management and Upper Management. Associates aren't suppose to do things, which is utterly told by managers on the Floor. Issues will arise with Upper management if done so."
good,"Responsible for assembling mannequins, putting up lettering, signs, shelves, fixtures. Low pay. A LOT of physical labor, walking, using ladders, and tools. Would be a more enjoyable job with a team of visual people. Seems as if any decent promotion will require moving state."
good,Only a few of the people who worked here were decent and the managers had ridiculous expectations and attitudes. I really enjoyed the work and the customers though.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"•	Worked in sales, and handled customer questions and complaints. "
good,"I learned how to manage cash"
good,"When I would go to work I had different task. I would Restocking shelves, Attend the cash register, Cleaning, organizing, Greet customers, and attend to the customer needs. This was a seasonal job so I work in a retail store through the busiest time of year. There was complete chaos throughout the store but I still managed to do my job efficiently and correctly. I learned to have patience and better communicate with the customers. I learned to communicate with customers that didn't speak English and very minimal Spanish. Overall I enjoy also working with customers cause I was able to assist them in helping get their loved ones gifts for the holidays. The only thing I didn't like bout Macy's was the pay. I didn't get a paycheck on week to week or bi- weekly basis. Macy's paid me in the taxes so I had to wait to claim my paycheck at the time that I did my taxes which they didn't tell me upon getting employment."
good,"Macy's can typically be a fast paste environment and customers are very demanding. It's my job to ensure customers have the best experience possible.,"
good,I enjoyed working with the people in my team as well as the leadership.  Most days I worked were stock replenishment and stock room reorganization.  The most frustrating thing about the job was the unreliable schedule since hours depended on shipments which were unpredictable.
good,"Once you get clocked in, you check your sales goal and then look for any customers who have not been helped yet and see how everything is doing. While helping customers, you also have to recover merchandise. The shift managers are wonderfully informed about information on products and procedures, however, they are not all nice/ friendly, and most wont help new employees. The other employees are very friendly though, and will help with any question you have. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the different processes of payments, ordering merchandise from online or by calling a store that has the merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and meeting all the customers and being able to help them with anything they need."
good,"Because my job was eliminated, Sad they didn't base their decision on my performance "
good,A great place to work but looking for a career change. My coworkers were always nice and very helpful. Love being able to interact with the customers everyday
good,In my experience I have learned it is easier to let go of a problem rather than stick with it because it will only frustrate you further. Rather take a problem and solve it as quickly as possible and as productive as possible. Getting the job done on time and as best as you can do will make a day go by just as fast. The hardest part of the job is connecting with a customer. But once you grasp that concept everything else is a breeze.
good,"I'm currently a part-time sales associate, and I usually work 4-6 hours a day/5 days a week. My responsibilities include, but are not limited to interacting with the customers on the floor and via telephone, soliciting sales and products, counting money and depositing funds, opening and closing the register, restocking the shelves, and helping with recovery after closing. I would say that the recovery and stocking the shelves are the two most challenging responsibilities of my job because I am currently in the luggage department, however it makes it easier because we're all like family and we work together as a team."
good,Great company to start your career in corporate retail. Comprehensive training program for recent graduates.
good,I enjoy working here my co-workers are fun and easy to get along with. The only problem I have is my hours. I don't get forty hours a week and that's what I'm looking for.
good,"If you get a job in this office, it is a very fast paced environment, all training is on the job training. It is a lot of fun to train people from all over the store."
good,I felt I was an important part of the community stopping thieves and other persons breaking the law.
good,The staff was a bit rude. I worked like a slave here and I wanted to get paid more. I couldn't support myself with this type of pay.
good,"Depending on what position you had, it would generally be a fast paced job assisting customers."
good,"High-paced during holidays makes time fly. Slow pace when there isn't a big sale (But there is one like every week). Overall good experience. Good management that helps out. Co-workers vary, but many are cranky and old timers who think they can boss you around."
good,"Being that its a sales position, you have to make sure your goal is met, and they pride themselves on enlisting every customer they can to get a Macy's credit card. So knowing how to talk to people and persuade-Up-sell-is something you have to learn in order to make it as a valuable employee. The scheduling here is very flexible. Since most positions are commission based, you can work as many hours as you want, and work in as many departments as you want a week. You can easily, pick up shifts, trade shifts and give them away. It is also because of those perks, that poor attendance is unacceptable."
good,"Providing outstanding service is my primary goal."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,My experience working for Macy's of Dulles Town Center was not a great work environment. From the Store Management to the Department Manager. I have done my job to the highest level at all times even under the circumstances.
good,"Macy's was excellent in helping you learn about the job. They helped you when you had problems or if you needed to change the schedule. The management was very approachable, understanding and offered great solutions. Professional environment yet relaxed as well."
good,"unload truck and cleaning the dock"
good,"everyday you learn something new, and the managment keep the enthusiasctic to find the way that the employ enjoy the day at work"
good,There where not enough hours given for seasonal employees. As a primary job this job is not enough to live on.
good,"My day at work consisted of scanning the floor displays and replenish the floor stock, straightening floor displays, hitting my sales quota in shoe sales and credit card applications, having knowledge of the stock room, customer service, and opening/closing the til. The hardest part of the job was my co-workers. It was a delicate group of people to be tossed into for a seasonal position and they weren't very welcoming. I most enjoyed giving customers my undivided attention to help them find exactly what they were looking for."
good,"When I first worked for Macy's I was working for the recovery team, where I organize the clothes out and put them on racks and clear out the fitting rooms. After a month later I was hired on to start as a cashier clerk. On the weekdays business is really slow so you don't do much but organize the racks and fitting rooms. When it comes to the weekends those days you can barely stand up on your feet. I'm either cleaning out the fitting rooms and organizing the racks, or else ring the register and taking calls from customers. I have a daily goal the I have to reach at the end of the day. It may sound easy to do but you legs will go out on you when the days gets busy. i mostly enjoy the customers happiness and smiles as they walk out the door."
good,"Fun times , customer service experience was a great learning experience."
good,"Assisting customers with the latest and hottest trends!"
good,Run various reports that help one determine the factors that drive an individual to spend money.
good,"working at macys was a cool job got to me new people learn new things, and it was an over night job my co workers was cool and the manager was greate!"
good,This is a great company but advancement is hard to come by unfortunately.  The atmosphere was great along with the employees and working with customers.  I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for and in my job showing them new designs of clothes and different styles depending on their needs.  It was great fun in that area since I was able to build a rapport with my customers and help them find and honestly show them what I thought would be appropriate for the occasion or just for fun to try out.
good,"Productive and fun work place. The employees are pretty cool, and the customers are usually in a good mood unless they can't use their coupon's"
good,"Productive and a very busy retail store. Heavy customer service, flexible retail schedules."
good,"Everytime I worked it was usually a chill, content day at work. Management was nice. "
good,I advanced fairly quickly and I would recommend this company to anyone
good,"During the day we use usually cleaning and returning some merchandised to the racks, we encountered different customers some are good and some are bad but we are learning how to deal with them. Managers are very good on communicating with us employees,co-workers are helping each other need. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy and only one or two cashiers running the register and customers started to get inpatient and just leave. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everybody enjoyed of what their doing."
good,"Never got enough hours, I do understand it was seasonal, but driving across town for 1 hour and only working that one day that week. Management was fine, unless you needed something, like the rest of your name tag."
good,A typical work day is getting yelled at by your co workers that have been longer than you. I have been there for a few months and the people that have been working the longest just stand there and do nothing and the manager dont seem to care. One of the manager is a total brat and just doenst think before she says things. And for benefits you have to wait a whole year to apply for a parent with kids.
good,"a typical day at Macy's, I was able to learn about diffrent varities of woman shoes, I was able to meet customers from all around the workd who comes to New York just to shop at Macy's. I've learned about diffrent cultures which is something I'd always admired. My co-workers were very intresting, there was never a dull moment. The hardest part about my job was watching how disappointed customers were when we didn't have their shoe size available, the most enjoyable part would be having the ablitity to search and send for a shoe a customer wants that isn't in stock at our location, what I would do is search it up on our website find out what other stores had the shoe in stock, and I would be able to order the shoe for my customer and have it shipped to their home!!!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Nice place to work, but not enough work available to everyone."
good,"Very Diverse community loved working their, seasonal position Cleaned, receptionist  answering heavy phone volume"
good,"Unload/load trucks.  Management is good, job is good, hours and pay are low.  One week I can work 10 hours and the next 40 and the next 0."
good,Maintaining an awareness of all promotions and aid customers in locating merchandise
good,"Never a dull moment, but it was too much body stress for myself. And it's always different at different places. I was just lucky to have such nice team members working with me."
good,"My overall review about macys is that its a good company as far as retail, and clothing, its just the management suffered because people werent capable of doing there job."
good,A fast paced working environment with a lot of ball juggling to stay ahead of the game.
good,Co Workers made it uncomfortable to work there. Other than that benefits were great. Management was nice.
good,"no information that I would care to give. I have nothing good or bad to say about this company, but I am thankful to have been able to keep my job for the last 3 years."
good,The company itself did what it could to make customers happy but the location I was blessed to work for was not at all diverse. The employees of the same ethnic background made outsiders feel just that. When working in a tight environment it's important for everyone to work as a team no matter what. Because I was not of middle eastern descent no matter how hard i tried to involve myself I and other employees of other cultures were kept at a distance. The managers also being of middle eastern descent never corrected the problem but instead justified it. I being from a multiracial background feel everyone should be treated equal but this was not the same attitude others agreed with.
good,"When working for Macy's it was enjoyable some days but others it was very crazy. People constantly come in and mess things up, I barely had time to take a break because it was so many people and I want to make sure my co-workers was fine, and they always make the new people close up. I did enjoy working there however. It gave me experience to learn how to close a register and to deal with certain customers."
good,"I've been working at Macy's going on two years now, the atmosphere is pleasant and easygoing, and the work environment is nice. Management at my store is very pleasant and easy going, though I've heard this is not the case at other stores. There is a strong push by managers to open star rewards cards, which at times can be difficult as a majority of the people who shop either already have one or don't want one. Another thing I've noticed is customers can really make or break an employees day. I've seen some employees break down after long stressful shifts or right in the middle of the shift. I like the place it's been OK to me, and treated me fairly well."
good,"Macy's is over employed, and the pay wasn't enough. I learned how to give the best customer service to customers through Macy's training resources. Management gave me more of a friend vibe.The hardest part of the job was finding available hours. Most enjoyable part of the job getting my employee's discount."
good,Macy's is a great place to work where you gain confidence connecting with customers
good,"Working at Macy's was another interesting experience in the sense that it was more fast paced than GAP. At Macy's there were more clothes to pick up and put away, more people to help and a faster rush of customers coming in and out. The hardest part of working there was the times where my home department was understaffed. I would often have to work with customers as quickly as I could to get rid of a long line at my register. The most enjoyable part was meeting and connecting with many people throughout the day. The management was good because a manager would visit our department to see how we were doing and how sales were going and made sure we were on track for the day's sales goal."
good,"If you love the latest trends in clothing, this is the place for you. It a fast pace working environment."
good,"It's a nice place to work when you want set hours and possibilities for overtime.  It's hard work and they push you a bit too much, but the pay is decent and they give plenty of breaks.  Trying to get answers to any questions or help from managers or HR was near impossible."
good,"A typical day at work would be checking on every single merchandise for prices, sorting the clothes, printing out extra price tags for every day for sales. What I love about this place is that it keeps me in fit, when the escalator was off or not working I would climb on the escalator to work out. "
good,job is good .... at times you dont get hours when it is very slow
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"fun place to work"
good,As a counter manager and a make up artist my job would be to sell makeup and skincare while building up clientele. This was my very first job and it was great as I got to work with great people and great customers.
good,i worked there for the holidays.... overnight shifs it was good money
good,"Help customers, fold clothes and make sure your area is tidy. Assist customers with questions and any help they needed."
good,analizing financial documents using some accounting practices to work through work loads. Invoice processing working there was awesome!!!
good,"A typical day at work would start out with me being assigned to a section of the store, mainly folding clothes on tables and making sure everything is clean and tidy. After that section was done, I'd move on to the next section and do the same thing. I would interact with customers as much as I possibly could and help them to the best of my abilities. The customers were friendly, the co-workers were cool and easy to get along with. Supervisors were also very easy to get along with and had great personalities."
good,Overall experience is wonderful. I endure a lot of customer service.
good,The works are fun and good to work with but it not much work for one person especially in shoes but great place but salary is that that good.
good,Everyday we have different work experiences with co-workers and in servicing our customers
good,"Unloading trucks seemed like a daunting task, but with everyone working on the truck it went by at a good steady pace. Switching places on the stock organization helped to keep focused and upbeat. The hardest part of the job was lifting awkward boxes and deciding where to put them to be processed. I loved the demeanor that the crew had and enjoyed the everyday tasks."
good,Dynamic workplace with many opportunities to learn. Hardest part of the job as with any retail environment is achieving work life balance.
good,"working in retail is hard, working in women retail is a nightmare, so many people wanted to get discounts , fighting for not having enough sizes, the customer services was a bit ruff but in the end i never let it become too overwhelming."
good,"Loved every minute of working, yet I wasn't able to balance work and everyday life the way I would love to. I lived 45 minutes away to work for Macy's yet I seemed to always be scheduled for 3 hour shifts. I enjoyed everybody I worked with, including the customers."
good,"During my part-time evening shift at Macy's Call Center I verifying personal information. Then, assist customers with placing orders, processing returns and shop for merchandise online.  Credit card information and payments are posted to the customer's account.  I resolve complex issues and schedule follow ups if neccessary. "
good,it was an okay to work but i had to quit working there because i was not informed that it was part of the union then one the i got called into the office and the lady said if i don't pay it then i don't have a job. i called the union and asked if i could pay it the following week and they said no. so i was forced to give up the job. i guess it was really the unions fault but still upset with macys because i had no idea that they were apart of the union.
good,have a smooth good day reached my goals everyday im at work and i was just not satisfied with the rate of pay.
good,"greet customers handle transactions sales associate assist customers in any way needed. "
good,"A typical day at work is walking around to assist customers. While there isn't any customers around, I clean up the floor or the fitting rooms. My management team was fun when there wasn't anything to do but when days were busy they were about their job. My co-workers were all decent and we tried to enjoy our job. The hardest part of the job is to deal with customers who try to give you a hard time. The msot enjoyable part of the job is being able to joke with my managers and co-workers."
good,"My employment at Macy's is a ""bitter-sweet"" feeling. On one hand, when I'm there working, I feel great, accomplished, independent and etc. But then again, looking at how much I'm paid, hours given and the ""life-less"", all black dress code, not so great. Just thanking God I'm not on the streets."
good,The job itself isn't hard but the communication wasn't the best.  You were told what to do by different people all with different ideas.  Hard to do a job when told to do it different ways.  No training.  Managers aren't always helpful.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Assists customers selecting and purchasing items."
good,"A typical day at work for me was unpacking new products and displaying them on the sales floors, and interacting with customers all day."
good,Macy's was a great opportunity in being my first management job at a larger retailer. My immediate team was great to work with. THe associates I managed where hard-working and coachable. There was just not a lot of support from my managers.
good,"Everyday I worked I came in on time cleaned my station and help people find what the are looking for."
good,"Here at Macys everybody is caring and respectful. Manager are all helpful with anything you need, if you need more hours they will try there best and give you more hours. The stressful part can be the holidays so much going on and all the different changes."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's are the ideals that the company wishes to instill in each of its associates and managers (MAGIC). The idea is to interact with the customer in such a way that they will leave you having had a better day - thanks to you!  This is a simple, yet beautiful philosophy (and I agree with it).  The hardest part of working at Macy's is that it seems to be growing at such a rate that even though these fantastic values are often spoken to, they are not always consistently represented. In recognition of this, I would say that the company works hard toward self-correction. The company asks the employees for thoughtful feedback quite often. I think that if more associates took the time to offer valuable, constructive criticism, the company will (and does) respond.  This is a ""positive"" when it comes to working for Macy's.  If you are dedicated, if you show up on-time and come ready to work, and can keep a positive, affable attitude, in addition to truly knowing your merchandise, you can do well at Macy's (and you will be recognized).  The company is very good about providing you with what is expected of you and also with providing you with a detailed break-down of what you have done. You will always know where you stand.  Again, that's a positive. "
good,"At Macy's, I managed the NARS makeup counter with two part- time associates.  While doing cosmetic applications, I also trained my staff.  It was a great place to learn how to motivate others to sell and also work as a team."
good,"A typical day of work includes helping customers out on the sales floor and ringing transactions.  Since this was my first job out of high school in a seasonal position, I didn't really learn much, except learning how to offer outstanding customer service and learning about high-quality fashion in a specific department.  The management there was really nice but, just like Target and Wal-Mart, not always available to assist when needed, ending up where the associate has to figure out ways of dealing issues themselves.  The co-workers there are actually very helpful since it's a smaller more high-class store and you're able to associate with them more easily.  As far as the hardest part of the job, I think the hardest part was learning how to familiarize myself with the system and how to navigate through the technical functions for a transaction.  The most enjoyable part of the job though was the company of friendly colleagues (associates) and being able to learn the fashion and styles for a particular accessory, in this case, handbags and fashion women's accessories."
good,"This is what you would in on a day to day bass working for macy's "
good,"Fast pace in helping all customers shopping from every department being ale to multi task , selling ,transferring calls from different dept assist with purchases and returns. up selling with new products, opening credit applications,product knowledge , all weekly ads circulating and percentages off ,. the ability to work in other dept with other employees, keep wrap stands clean ,count money, properly handle checks and personal information  straighten and fold or hang clothing , check dressing rooms for discard clothing .And keeping  a smile pleasant personality in all customer service duties and be assertive to customer needs. The most enjoyable are the incentives being chosen for a  large  Christmas  project that delights many and serves all shoppers who enjoy the holiday decorations and the exciting wonders of the stores  extravagance that binds many shopper 's to boost all sales during the season."
good,"Operated register"
good,typical day at wotk assting customers with any quesitions they had about a cerin department. The management was very good they alwasy helped out with any thing and any question i needed answered with there most honest answer .The co workers were very nice as well there. 
good,Macy's is always busy so it's a great place for workers who always like something to do.  The managers are nice and its a great part time job while attending college classes.
good,"It was a interesting job that I worked while in school, they hours are constantly changing, there were difficult customers but even more difficult fellow employees.  It was very competitive with certain people, which made going to work much less enjoyable then it could have been.  Same routine every day, making your dales and credit goals."
good,"a day at work is pleasant, the customers are great since most of them are tourists and regular. the job is not that difficult all u have to do is to help sales associates and customers when needed.the most enjoyable part of my job is u get to meet different people from different places."
good,The Pay Could Be Better And You Basically Have To Play Personal Shopper To Customers.
good,Work in an environment that is fun and rewarding.  You will have room to change departments until you find great fit.  Opportunity to grow in the company.
good,If you are looking for a fashionable job position Macy's would be the most desirable one.
good,"Seen a lot of other employees not doing assigned tasks, upsetting when you are working so hard."
good,First job I had where I was not mirco-managed. Worked with very down to earth people. Manager was very friendly and laid back as long as work was completed.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Helping costumers with their purchases and promoting sales. Keeping my area neat and clean. I learned how to properly work a register and how to close the register at night. My co-workers were friendly because we always worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was closing, often costumers would be upset that we could let them continue to shop. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing costumers happy when you they saved money on their purchase from the different holiday sales that were going on."
good,"i have learned that Macy's does anything to make their customers happy, like returning items that were purchased years ago, they have been worn and they have been returned due to wear and tear."
good,"You have to be able to balance a lot of impatient customers at once. But the good thing about working at Macys is you have the flexibility to manage your own schedule. You can advertise, swap, or get someone to cover your shift as well as pick up more if you want more hours."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed recruiting for Macy's. It was a positive work environment, fast paced, challenging and a great learning environment. It was only a temporary seasonal position so unfortunately there was a beginning and end date."
good,Great associates
good,"Great co-workers. depending on area a great working environment, with good management."
good,"I am very happy to still be employed with Macy's almost a year later. Being this is my second job, I'm very grateful to be working there, especially since finding a job last year was very difficult with my lack of experience. And through this job I've been able to gain the work experience I need not only for professional advancement, but to add to my resume."
good,"The Cosmetics department is a very fun, productive, social place to work and to advance your makeup artistry knowledge."
good,macy's pays depending on location example a same Macy's will not pay the same as one that is in a mall. Also scheduling is pretty good they have a new program which pretty much allows you to create your schedule and pick up extra hours.
good,"Macy's was an excellent experience. There was a well established work environment that required teamwork for it's efficiency. A typical day would depend on whether or not we had received a truck that day. On truck days we worked hard to get everything off the truck and properly tagged. Due to our organization and teamwork our store was said to be the most organized dock in the district! My other work involved pricing. This included putting up the signs, changing prices, re-ticketing items, and checking for markdowns. I really got a chance to find work all over in the store. I helped with recovery (tidying up the floor), customer service, stock room management, moving products to the floor, and inventorying. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that taught me much about the benefit of working with a team towards a common goal."
good,Management is awful. They lack decision making and communication skills. With some changes to management and weeding out the lazy people it will be a great place to work. HR is worthless.
good,"I loved working at Macys they really do care about you and the customers, but if business is slow there are not enough hours to spread out. Which made picking up shifts rather difficult."
good,"Made a lot of long life connections, learned much about the world of retail."
good,A typical day at work consist of reviewing the business for the day and the needs to help drive the business. The things I've learned from being a figure of management with Macy's is how to multitask under extremely stressful situations and manage the needs of 40+ associates. The only real qualm I have with the rest of the management team is the lack of communication. There really isn't a hardest part to this job as long as you have the ability to learn things quickly. The most enjoyable part would be working with all the associates and turning problems into solutions.
good,"Enjoyable place to work with very little stress level, easy to problem solve."
good,Very entrepreneurial but has lots of limitations. Work-life balance is encouraged but difficult. Working long hours with minimal results.
good,"it was challenging position, a position I thought I could handle."
good,"Training and mentoring associates was a great experience, you learn that everyone has a different way of processing information and reacting to it as well."
good,"You meet new people, and learn new things, and get experience with retail and talking to people and learning how to push a sale. But time goes slow, shifts are long, and its minimum wage, so you feel like you work all the time and at the end of the week you get a small paycheck. Oh, that is a nice thing, you get paid every Friday. Everyone is nice, managers are nice, employees are nice, and you dont run into many rude customers. I enjoy my co-workers and when a customer truly appreciates my help."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This job was okay I had scan and organize shoe and I work as a cashier I love to help people and inter react with the customer help them find shoes and things they need it
good,regular retail experience
good,"A typical day is making sure designated area is clean and shoppable, Nice co-workers. I learned how companies differ from other companies and the importance of getting your own clientele. I enjoyed meeting new people, Hardest part learning different areas in small amount of time."
good,"A typical day at work was maintaining the sales floor while catering to customers concerns and needs. While working at Macy's i learned how to multitask in terms of pleasing not only my job requirements of the day, but pleasing customers and helping as much as needed. The managers that i had the opportunity to work with were helpful, attentive, and understanding. My co-workers were a joy to work with they were also helpful where it came easy when working as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job were the managers where everyday they encouraged the employees and when ever i had a concern or dilemma they were easy to help and figure things out."
good,"My day usually begins at 5:30am. Once I get in I join the receiving team to strip new merchandise that comes in for about one hours. After that hour I am off to the Accessories department, for which I am responsible, to put up new merchandise and organize the section before the store opens. I have learned the importance of punctuality and managing stress well in a fast-paced environment. My co-workers are very helpful and our teamwork helps so much to lighten the workload and increase efficiency. The hardest parts of this job are the demand for heavy lifting and also, being on my feet all day. Most enjoyable however, is the fact that though we work early mornings, we do not work on weekends or overnight shifts, which gives me ample time to recoup and prepare for work the next day."
good,Co- workers are fun and pleasant
good,"I come into work at 10am open registers, clean area and for the rest of the day im interacting and helping customers shop. The hardest part of that was the unflexiability"
good,Assist customers with shopping and merchandise
good,typical day at work was very busy and productive its not really much else to tell
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure the dressing rooms were clean and maintained, and the floor area was kept presentable. Helping customers find what they needed, or making suggestions on putting an ensemble together. Though I was sales support, pre-sales were made on the floor with attentive customer service. I got along with all the managers, most were flexible when needed; as long as you went through the proper channels. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day, the most enjoyable was the ""family"" of co-workers."
good,"I had a great experience in the distribution enviroment. I learned how the store actually gets its products. I would be in 3 different departments; Picking, Packing, and labeling the shipment. My co-workers would always be on point in finishing and meeting the deadlines."
good,"As working with retail, sales is the most important aspect for a company. This is firm and thorough at Macy's."
good,Co-workers was pretty friendly and helpful. Loved my managers! I liked working here cause I liked to help customer's with their decision making.
good,Working for Macy's was great experience. I was able to be around for big promotions and learn about new fashions and brands. I also learned techniques to get customers into applying company credit cards.
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's because they were very flexible with my school hours and the team was very hardworking. The management cares about there staff and they keep their store and relations professional. The only problem I had was the lack of benefits for any of the workers besides management.
good,"I worked at Macy's during the holiday season and one thing I didn't like were the lack of hours. They'd want me to come in for 4 hours a week and then hike up the hours to like 30 right around Christmas time. I did enjoy my co-workers, they were a lot of fun to be around, and the management was pretty prompt to answering any questions I had and getting me supplies that I needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to champion the value of having a Macy's card and handling a massive amount of customers at one time. I would recommend the job to someone who isn't strapped for cash and can still make it on minimal income. I didn't have an issue with anyone while I worked there, just the lack of schedule consistency bothered me."
good,Very busy
good,A typical day is easy going but fast pace with much traffic throughout the department store. I was responsible for keeping the men department organized. I enjoy giving opinion about what outfit goes best for certain occasions. I enjoyed the one on one interactions in a small amount of time. The diverse group of customers is the high light of the day.
good,A typical day at this job was just okay.
good,"organizing inventory, cleaning my department area, and operating cash register management and co-workers were great very competitive. i enjoyed helping customers with the items there were purchasing."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"- I get to work Clock in look at my Sales Goal for the day, Open/Close Terminals, Provide customer service on/off the floor."
good,I would walk around the men's section looking for people that exhibited behaviors of possible shoplifting and would help direct customers to different parts of the store.
good,"I like working at Macy's and I really like all my co-workers. I have learned many things working here, especially different approaches to customer service. I love being around people and interacting with everyone. The toughest part is dealing with understaffing on a busy sale day or weekend, we usually only have 2 associates closing and have to try and do a million things. As a sales associate, we are required to do so much and managers seem to let that slip their mind. First of all we need to help customers at the register; which includes sales, returns, opening credit cards, issues and concerns with billing, ordering merchandise from other stores or online, and phone calls. Some customers require so much time to help out that the people in line get annoyed. Dealing with mad customers is only the half of it, we are told what we are and are not allowed to do, but sometimes managers come down to our areas and tell us to go ahead and do things, making us look like we're the bad guys for trying to tell customers we couldn't do what they asked for in the first place. We must also make a credit and sales goal, be available out on the floor assisting people with clothing questions, advise, style options and suggestive selling. And of course cleaning the fitting room, putting away all the clothes back on the sales floor, which should be considered hard labor in my department. At the end of the night we close registers, take holds to the stock room, remove expired holds, take damages out, empty out sensors and clean the sales floor. It's frustrating because we never have down time,"
good,"it was a good seasonal job just didnt get many hours, it was a busy job i enjoyed customer service"
good,I was satisfied with how I was treated as an employee. It is a god place to start you work experience.
good,"My typical day consisted of me trying to help customers find the items or clothing in which they were looking for. I had to work in a very competitive sales environment. I worked the cash register while also providing excellent customer service and making sure I made my sales goals. My co workers were alright and the managers really were awful. They did not care about their employees at all. The hardest part of the job was working in a very competitive sales environment.The most enjoyable part was making the customers happy knowing I helped them in every way i possibly could,"
good,There was lots of customer service dealing with the customers and making sales.
good,"Working at Macy's, I've learned great customer service skills. You'll have anything from an average middle class customer to a wealthier customer, you just have to know how to deal with them and their needs."
good,"Macy's was a nice place to work. The management staff, for the most part, was very friendly. Dress code is different from alot of places that do retail- nice change of pace- TV in break room. When people called out and they needed coverage, if you had other things planned like vacation, family dinner, doctor's appointment they badger you about coming in. ""Please wont you come in? We are really short staffed tonight since [insert name here] didn't show."" and you say ""I'm sorry I can't because [insert reason]"" ""Well we need you so can't you put that off?"" I mean really? Right before I left the company, they had come up with this points system. This system helped to determine if people were worth keeping. (how degrading) This system was terrible because if you were late, even if you called and told them and they said ok no problem. The system deducts a point. Once you reached a certain level of points, you were terminated- no questions asked! This was awful for me because I worked two jobs at the time. I would get off at 5 and have to be at Macy's at 5:15. I told them to stop doing this because i couldnt make it there by that time, did they? NO! Also, you cant dispute any points lost until AFTER they have told you that you're going to be terminated. Other than that, its a nice place."
good,"Macy's Herald Square is apart of Macy's Inc, which is a solid, growing company. Store-line for Macy's Inc is a fun environment, although not your typical Monday through Friday. Herald Square is a great place for those who want to work hands on with customers and product in the retail industry."
good,Working for Macy's was always productive and flexible. Macy's will work around your availability.
good,its a good job you dont make enough for rent but you get a lot of expirence working with customers and its a job you could enjoy and learn a lot from.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's was working with my lovely coworkers. The least enjoyable part was the job required lots of running around the store.
good,"That they will go with you with your hours and you stay very busy even when you don't have consumers. You stay up on your feet everyday and all day, you are put in different departments. When you don't know they right answer you have a good coworker where they can help you and give you the right answers and help you when it comes down to the consumers and the registers."
good,I am going to work on learning how to work independently with the people who come shopping with Macy's. I want to get to know the Store better. So I can serve the people who come to Macy's
good,The store is fine the system could be underrated with commission but it’s a good store to work for anyone that just start working their first job but the pay isn’t going to be much.
good,"Its similar to any other retail job, but there is a nice employee discount and the work environment was nice.There will be a variety of positions to choose from and you become very knowledgeable of products quickly"
good,Was more of a summer job the co workers was nice and friendly and everyone helped out a lot needs more things to do the only negative was trapped in a closet folding most of the time working
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Management in the office lacks communication skills.  In order to move up you have to be considered a ""favorite"" I was told even if your customer service skills are excellent. I've had numerous customers compliment me to management however I was not recognize because I wasn't a favorite. Very unfortunate."
good,Helping staff workers with keeping up with the working area. Helping customers find products and showings our new items to them. Working on cashiers..
good,"I work threw macy's for four years. on diffrent shifts. I train an helped others. but to my knowledge i dident get the thanks . or respect i deserved. I was a part that took charge in the areas of what i knew. because of the employs always asked for me to help when they need an answer. or to help in any way due to job relate. i got the respect from the employes i train but not from managers. its a good company if had better managers that obay the rules. an regulations. do to me i did my job fair, an went buy the rules an regulations."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company in the beginning in all honesty. Unfortunately, I wasn't trained at all for the position. When I asked for help, nobody was around or cared to help. Was told to cover different departments with little to no knowledge about the product. Was left alone with no one to shadow around."
good,Just a little too slow moving for me. I don't do well being inside all day and it gets very tedious at times. The employees are very kind and helpful though.
good,"I was lied to by Management about obtaining an position that was filled by an new employee which made my wanting to work hard for the company morale drop, which eventually picked back up after I was put in an better position."
good,"Great place to work, was sorry to leave, I was seasonal employee.Loved management, very flexible with a schedule and good employees benefits.Provided regular training."
good,It’s a overall good job I recommend it to everyone the pay is also good .u just need patience .everyone there is super friendly and they’ll teach you everything u need to know
good,"I use to love working for this company, way before all the new changes. Now everything is different. It's easy to work your way up but there's a lot of favoritism with management. Managers can't be taken seriously, no communication. They're constantly on you about pushing customers to open up a Macy's credit account. Customers can be very rude, if you have the patience for it, then you will love working there. They will make you return used merchandise even after all their return/exchange policies are enforced. Asset Protection is constantly watching the associates all the time, more than the customers. Discounts and benefits were great."
good,"Working at Macys was a solid experience. The department I was placed in was different from what i was used to but I was left with a great teacher. Many of the other employees in the same area were very friendly and welcoming, which provided a enjoyable workplace. My Experience with the management was slightly above average. Pretty much every manager in the store was helpful with teaching me things I didnt know. Although I had particular problems with one manager being too intense and "" by the book "" than they needed to be. Overall I can rate my experience at about an 6.5-7/10. Macys seems like a great first job for younger people to help them get varying work experiences for their resume."
good,"Management was not good, they hired me as a different position than what I received. They barely scheduled me and did not communicate well with the scheduling."
good,"I have been working for the company for 5 years. I have moved up in the company really soon. However they really care about your ""brand!"" Its hard to be yourself. Other than that, the benefits are great!"
good,"Enjoyed working here. Supportive staff, fun workplace. Hours somewhat few due to too many part time people. Other than that it is a great place to work."
good,"You show up ready for work, proper dress form. Go to your department where ur stationed at and have a meeting with crew to go over the numbers they have to meet at the end of the day. You go off with ur gladiator and scan boxes or items to take them to a new location"
good,I gained valuable experience in the areas of merchandising and premium service which helped me in my current job.  I was previously in strictly electronics and this was a good gateway to new opportunities.
good,"Pay is pretty good. "
good,"• Unloaded and unpacked new merchandise shipments; delivered new merchandise to the appropriate department assisted with the execution of merchandise price changes."
good,"the benefits were none for seasonal workers, not always enough work to go around. sometimes very fast paced and other times at a standstill. I only worked during peak season."
good,"Although it was a rewarding experience, I would probably not want to return to work at Macy's in this department. The co-workers were nice and friendly, but it appeared that you were thrown in there and had to figure out on your own what you had to do. There were opportunities to meet the different departments and events to attend, but I felt that I could've been checked in on more than once a week just in case."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Supported the Product Owner in grooming and maintaining the product backlog."
good,"Macy’s is a nice and friendly place to work. Only when you make it past the initiation faze of employment can you advance with the benefits of the Job. Until then can Macy’ s be used as an advancement. However the experience of tag and SKU, organizing and promoting, while dealing with the customer’s needs. Managing and Operating the Sales floor presentations was a large responsibility to the eye of the public. Yet the experience was meant to promote me to a higher ability. In sales and presentation and Promotion."
good,"It's nice because it's Macy's but it's physically tiring , yeah u have to wake up at 6 and leave at 6 it's excruciating,maybe if I had a different position"
good,"Macys had a very good and friendly work environment the pay is good, positive peers, realistic expectations,  very respectable overall a very good experience"
good,I learned a lot and their entry program for people fresh from college is great. Each team has different styles of management/culture. Culture can be negative and constant management change created lots of chaos.
good,Its an overall great place to work if you're in high school or college. If you're a parent of very young kids as I am I wouldn't recommend it unless you have family or friends who is able to watch them because if you're kids get sick then you're out of luck unless you've worked for the company for over a year.
good,"I learned how to mark down prices i learned how to use the cash register , learning the store more and where different departments are located at work all over ."
good,"Macys lets you build your own business and wants you to succeed. It is still retail with long hours on your feet and weird shifts."
good,I worked very well in the Macys company and provide my management  team desired all the times. In the Macys I have chance to increase my ability in this yeres with customer service.
good,"Flexible schedule, team environment, store events, wide variety of designers and brands regular sales & incentives human resource always accommodating"
good,"Its very different I never really felt part of the family. I did enjoy lots of my co worker, but management was unknown pretty much and was never seen."
good,"Idea employment for people who need extra income, college student, stay at home parent or  retiree. Can earn Macy's money for opening charge cards . However, customer service associate have now become salesreps per  management and must push Macy's credit  when  most customer's  prefer to use other method of payment."
good,"Great place to work at as a Warehouse Associate. So many opportunities to choose from and with good training program."
good,I worked from 8-2 Monday-Friday. It took me an hour or less to fix the cloths/ add new cloths to the displays. The rest of my day was spent wondering/helping the other departments or storage units
good,When i was working at macys i had early hours and the morning went fast. The work was sipmle and also very easy to do. Customer service was not really needed during the hours I worked.
good,"There were daily meetings regarding how much was sold the day before, who met their goals, who got the most customers signed up for macys cards and...."
good,"working for Macys was fun at first it was very hot  then we stand on our feet all day long got a 45 min lunch break 15 min break they treated you ok, when it was a summer day it felt like a heater we had no A c just fans and when it was winter it was very cold felt like an icebox"
good,Helping customers with all of their needs. Welcoming everyone with a warm smile. I have learned how to multitask and how to team build. I have learned time management.  Management is very difficult to work with. They seem to be very one sided and are becoming sloppy.  Hardest part of the job is working with a team that doesn't have much support. The most enjoyable parts are building the relationships with the customers.
good,This company is still new so it needs A LOT of help. The parent company is basically playing everything by ear wgich can be very frustrating if you are used to structure.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was good but could be better. Starterd as pt and moved to ft and afer to supervisor. Fast job. Have to work with lots more people. Managers are not that great.
good,I prefer not to answer at this time. I do not feel this is an important part of my employment search. I have no opinion on this company that is pertinent to my current endeavors.
good,This was my first retail job and I was originally a seasonal associate for the holidays and decided to stay on as a permanent associate. I had an amazing associate manager that supervised me and she really put a lot of effort into training me. Not only that but she deeply cared for the well-being of her associates which in retail is amazing to say in the least. I worked at a very large department store Macy's so it was four floors. The cleaning after closing was the biggest pain because it gets really busy at the location I worked at. I mostly enjoyed being able to get experience interacting with customers and learning a whole lot of communication and sales skills while I was there.
good,Really good place to work. If you can get pass the mean customers once in a while and the some times poor management its not a really bad place to work
good,"Macy's is a great place to work and collaborate with other employees.  You can receive Macy's money. A typical day at work consists of inventory, putting drags back, customer transactions, etc."
good,"I started working at Macy's when I was 18 and was there for 4 years. You get to meet great new people to work with & the environment is nice. My only problem there was how customers treated us & we had no kind of back up from managers but I guess that is just a customer service job, also the hours sucked! But during the holidays was the only time we were allowed over time. Other than that I learned A LOT, made amazing friends (still friends till this day basically my 2nd family) & also got to remember a lot of my customers. It is a great place to start but I did not see myself working here for years."
good,"Typical Day: sales, dusting, cleaning, inventory, size watches, size glasses open/ close procedures."
good,"A typical day at work included full knowledge of register functions, watch maintenance, up keeping of the area, communication skills and the ability to multitask. I learned a lot about how to aid in the management of a team, how to better serve customers and how to keep a work environment happy with a positive attitude. I made some life long friends and enjoyed every person I worked with."
good,This is a huge company with a lot of options and opportunities.  Networking is key within Macy's because there is so much movement between regions and departments.
good,"My manager was very easy to work for. A typical day would include servicing customers to fulfill their needs, maintain personal stockroom responsibilities, meet predetermined personal and company goals."
good,"I had to interview people, help them apply if necessary, help them through pre-employment, and recruit new hires. I learned how to interview people and how to do hire people through the system.  Management was very helpful and friendly.  The full time employees were like family to eachother, which is a good thing to me.  The hardest part of the job was getting through interviews that weren't going good, helping older people on the computers, and looking for people who needed jobs (surprisingly). The best part was actually giving a job to people who truly needed it."
good,Because of the turnover rate was so high it was difficult to train and be taught by and experience worker. Holidays is so hectic if you're hired around that time you can get lost in the Mayhem
good,Macy's Asset Protection department officers great exposure to the Security world. Daily tasks included preventing fraud and loss to the company on many levels. Running reports and cordinating with Law enforcement to ensure prosecution of accused. Management structure of Macy's is excellent with an inclusive nature allowing all ideas and perspectives. Workplace allows for causal attire and an easy going work atmosphere. Hardest part of the job requires to work a schedule that is not consistent. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with and the satisfaction you receive when preventing a loss to the company.
good,"With my experience working at Macy's, I have learned about the importance of delivering great customer service and reaching store sales goals. I enjoy being a part of the young men's department because everyone is a great team player and very easy-going. When faced with difficulties during customer interactions I try my best to reach the satisfaction they desire. It is important to leave the customer happy and wanting to come back to Macy's. I feel extremely accomplished when customers feel happy with the customer service they have received from myself."
good,Overall the company is in an identity crisis. Trying to please too many consumers- online and brick and mortar are in competition for resources instead of supporting each other.
good,Very friendly environment with great sales associate. Builds your people skills and customer service experiences are built and shaped to make you a great peoples person.
good,"A typical day working for Macys was coming into the store, walking to your work area, clocking in for work, and standing at the register ringing people up, or walking around your area recovering. Management was really cool. A lot of them were new so sometimes they didn't know what they were doing. The workplace was very comfortable sometimes certain customers would become hostile, but that's expected working in retail. The hardest part of my job was selling Macys credit cards. Most people that shopped at Macys already had credit cards so to sell them to people who already had them was hard. Another hard part about my job was when I first started working there. I went straight from training on a computer to just right out on the floor with no instruction on what to do, or where anything in the store was located. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet new people everyday and just having conversations with complete strangers. It felt like a made a new friend everyday."
good,A typical retail job. Girls down stairs are very rude. Nearly impossible to get hours after Christmas. The pay at 9$ an hours is not great but not bad for the amount of work. management is ok but they are extremely busy they don'[t do what they say they will but I honestly think they just forget (sometimes). I would recommend a smaller store if you have no retail experience but it is not unmanageable. If u apply during holiday season and are decent you will get the job.
good,"A typical day at work is getting the store prepared for customer, clean, greeting client, handling cash, product knowledge. I learned how to be proactive, time management, compliance is key, and team . Diverse workplace. hardest part of the job is to keep the store clean. Meeting people and interacting with my peers is the most enjoyable part of  my job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working in security was fun and exciting. Not the best pay for security job, but discounts, schedule flexibility made it not bad... working in security was fun because everyday was different, I hate jobs that are same old thing everyday.. if you live close to the one you work at there may be times where friends, people you went to school with or just people you know before Macy’s work the sales floor, once promoted to internal investigator it made it hard to think the people you know might be doing dishonest/illegal things, but my job proved that wrong, as hard as it was to sit down and try to get a statement/admission from then, then having to tell HR which fires them immediately then telling your Secuirty Director which makes the decision if charges are being pressed or not, the job had to be done..."
good,"I was a seasonal employee , overall the job wasn't too bad , pretty easy , I'll say Macy's is a good place for anyone looking for a first job. Staff was always helpful."
good,My experience at Macy's was pretty good. I appreciated the management and the hours were reasonable. Pay is not very high so I wouldn't recommend the job to anyone as a primary income. The biggest downside to the job is the customers. The customers at Macy's are next-level terrible. If you have experience with customer service it won't be anything you can't handle. Management provides a lot of support in difficult situations.
good,"The associates are great to work with; for the most part everyone gets along. However, we are understaffed and management does not believe that one person can only do so much."
good,there are better places out there. company strategies are not innovative and needs to modernize workforce to compete wit the future of retail (aka Amazon).
good,Working in INC Misses was very faced faced and fun.  Our team worked well together and our manager was the best!  She was very understanding and listened to the concerns of her supporting staff.
good,"They really do like to hire from within. They give incentives for their credit card apps. and other things. If you work there, you learn the discounts and can get some nice quality stuff for pretty cheap. On the Sales side of things, there have been people that have worked there for 15 years, I just don't see myself staying because they honestly don't give great compensation in terms of dollar per hour and sometimes there isn't a fair share of hours or not enough hours altogether because all the hours are based on the previous year, even if you are exceeding sales this year. A nice thing is that all the swap shifts and callouts are all done online."
good,"Macys offers a very good work/life balance with very relaxed policies regarding attendance and productivity.  Pay is not bad for entry-level agents, but job advancement opportunities dwindle as you grow within the company."
good,"While I liked having flexibility I did not like fact that retail work requires credit applications as part of the job instead of a plus. Yes, it has its perks. I am not knocking the store itself. Just the industry standard requiring credit applications. "
good,"They are Very strict on credit cards you have to get store credit cards as part of your job or you can get fired. "
good,it was fun knowing new people on how we all got along. the manager was very friendly had no complains or what so ever. the hardest part of the job was carrying boxes and pushing them.
good,average place to work too much work for bad pay looking for something quick it can be good but long term i would not suggest it a typical day especially for my job is a lot of work with no sort of good pay in almost two years i got a 20 cent raise
good,"My typical day consist of line checks, BEO checks, ordering for next day... The Chefs that i work under are very attentive to detail, but that just made me better. I think the hardest part of the job was coming in as the Kitchen Supervisor and having to prove myself to my line cooks.That was also the most enjoyable part of my job. Being able to show what i know and being willing to learn from my cooks earned me respect from them. learning how to prepare for a TV demo was one of the best things i learned there. Over all working in the catering department at Macy's taught me a lot about myself."
good,Macy's offered flexibility with their schedule. Macy's also offered a great employee discount and 401k match. The sales mangers in Grand Rapids are great.
good,it was a seasonal job and i bearly got like 20 hours per week. i used to get like 180 dlls so it wasn't much. there's not much hours for seasonal workers
good,Great place to work! Make best highest sale each day. Welcome everyone comes in. Always keep a friendly smile. Treat everyone with respect. Always listen to your customer. Sometime new each day. Learn a lot.
good,"A typical day at work is going to work greeting customers, helping them with anything they need. I learned how to handle stressfull situations. The management was great."
good,"I liked working at Macy's for the first few months. The days went by quickly and my coworkers were all very nice. I quickly learned how to use their computer system worked and became skilled at helping customers find what they needed. The only negatives to this job were the schedule cutbacks after the holidays and the sick day policies. Other than that, my managers were awesome and I was treated very well there."
good,Its a big retail corporation so be advised that many changes happen rapidly and you're expected to roll with the punches. Salary is good. Most of management is okay. HR is horrible.
good,"It was definitely good job for college students. I had the chance to learn as much as I could while I was on my summer brake. Great vibe to work, but sometimes it gets stressful when the mall has lots of discounts."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked at Macy's part time seasonal and all in all, it's a solid job for a teen trying to make a little money. Management is generally friendly and there's always someone to help you out. However, pay is definitely weak for the work being completed."
good,"Worked mostly overnight shifts when the store was closed to the public."
good,"Macy's is all around a great company to work for. Times do get stressful however, it is a pleasurable corporation to work for. Very easy going overall"
good,I loved working at Macy the environment is great for people who love meeting new people. It's a great way to learn how to sale and learn more about fashion.
good,Strong customer service is required. Must be patient and willing to assist customers. Enthusiasm and self motivation helps. There is availability to transfer to other Macy's department stores.
good,Working with Macy's was a pleasure and I enjoyed working there. My Supervisor and the employee's was very nice and kind. I learned how to multi-task. Easy to understand what you need to do.
good,Arrive 30mins early to do inventory. Nice work environment cool staff members. Staying focus in committed to the job. In dealing with unhappy customers was challenging but worth the challenge  you have to just have patients.
good,for one of my first job experiences this job was great. i loved working here. the people that i worked with in the shoe dept. were wonderful. yes it was very competitive and you had your occasional moment of disagreement with some more than others but it was nothing but a positive experience
good,Working At Macys I Would Be At Work for 4 hours So We Didnt Get that Many hours. Working here i learned how the back room gets situated. The management was pretty good didnt have many problems with them. It Really Wasnt Anything hard bout the job. As Far As Enjpyable Parts To The Job i Really Didnt Enjoy it
good,"The policies were poor and the morning meetings were not inspiring. The coworkers, however, were amazing and made the job less stressful. The work environment was okay."
good,Macy's was an amazing company to work for and you'll make a lot of money up until the season becomes slow and you cannot make any money or your hours are cut tremendously.
good,"Great place to work if you go to school. Employee have full control with their schedule, and can pick up shifts or give them away. Plus we get paid every week."
good,"Demanding warehouse position, but expectancy would be just a temporary job, they layoff after Christmas season ends for them "
good,"I enjoyed the weekly pay, the opportunities given to grow within the company. However, organization lacked, some managers lacked respect for employees"
good,Nice work place never had a problem with anything works with personal schedule very nice staff and you're always being productive good pay and good company
good,"My experience at Macys is a positive one even though it has three stars. I was managing a very disorganized accessories department with a coworker. I being a really organized person made it my mission to built the department back together and have it thriving. In a couple of months i saw an increase in business and clientele. Within the year of growth i was able to acquire Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors and Swarovski as new vendors. Job and life balance for my was a bit challenging because i don't drive but thats not Macys fault. As far as job security i must say that it is secure but moving up proves to be a little but challenging. Overall i enjoyed my time at Macys."
good,"it was usually a good time working at macy's"
good,"The work environment is ok, some lazy employees. Management is ok, friendly and understanding. There aren't many hours for employees, compensation could be better and not many full time positions."
good,At Macy's you are responsible to help customers and run the register. You must be willing to sign people up for credit cards and it is a big evaluation on how ones is doing. over all a nice job.
good,Macy's offers an excellent training program. Their flex scheduling is amazing because it allows an employee to be responsible for his or her own schedule. The company offers employee discounts.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Working at a mall is stressful but comes with great benefits as growing in customer service and helping you have a stable student life and able to work.
good,I met so many people while I was employed with Macys and still maintain those relationships to this day. I enjoyed the opportunities for growth within this company.
good,Got a lot of experience in sales and a whole new way to interact with customers. Employees were nice enough to constantly help me make sales and keep me informed on different products.
good,Job for me consisted mainly of helping customers find items. Either by looking for it in the back of calling a local store to see if they had that particular item in stock.
good,The job is good and has good benefits. Benefits are probably the best thing about the job. Pay is decent and management  is unorganized. some of the management is good but they aren't all on the same page most the time which leaves you confused. My direct manager is nice and fair for the most part but often you report to different managers.
good,"My overall job experience working here was okay. I learned how to work with others more, worked as a cashier, and learned everything there is to know about working in retail. The other employees were fun and made my work experience a lot better, and so were most managers. There wasn't really a hard part in the job everything was easy, although I would say working as the cashier was the easiest part. The major problem was the pay and the hours. They were hiring so many employees and didn't want to give a lot of hours so I would end up with about 8-10 hours every week. It got really bad. But overall the work experience was great I just wish the pay matched. I would've liked to spend more hours at work."
good,I loved this job and the pace that it was set in. I'd still be there if it was for full term. I love the management and the many opportunities they provided people in need of employment.
good,Macy's was a very busy atmosphere with very engaged and loyal employees. The hardest part of the job was customer interaction during one-day sales and straightening the store after said sales.
good,A typical day at works runs by smooth as a support associate. You are given instructions on what is needed and fulfilling them is a breeze.
good,The prototypical workday consisted of primary duties as a cashier and providing assistance around the store as needed.  A good experience for working in a high-paced environment under quality management.  The atmosphere was positive.  The most difficult part of the job was that Macy's is occasionally short-staffed and the job is difficult at first if the employee has no previous cashier work experience.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was interacting the friendly employees that Macy's hires.
good,Very uncomfortable working for Macy's because they have a lot of unbearable rules. I mean rules that are likevyour not even human.every job has rules that you have to abide by to have order but Macy's had some that made no since .Also management teams have very poor communication .
good,Had a really good time working there just busy all the time with fifteen min brake I hated no time to eat your food or relax on brake.
good,A typical day would include helping customers and keeping the sales floor clean. I worked in every area of the store from customer service to behind the scenes stocking the back room. I learned a lot of people skills and enjoyed meeting new people. I loved working in the back rooms keeping things organized. Management was good. I always felt listened to and wasn't afraid to speak up. They really did want to help their customers and I respect that a lot. The hardest part was the hours. I could be working as late as ten and on hard days like holidays and weekends and it was very exhausting. The pay did not make it worth it. But I am a people person so my favorite part of the job was meeting new people everyday and learning from them. I liked feeling like I really helped people at the end of the day. I had multiple customers go out of their way to compliment me to one of my managers.
good,Macy's is a fast pace environment you need to be ready to work and assist customers. Customers are our number one priority.
good,"Working here is a great experience. You get to work on the floor and deal with customers that strengthen your customer service skills. Working here balances out your life easily if you go to school, or have another job. The only con is you may not get the hours you may want, since that could be competitive here. Management here wasn't the best, I have requested and asked kindly for help, but management is terrible."
good,"It is a very fun job. You are always busy and there is never a dull moment. Also what I would like to say about this job is that you learn so much. Like apparel, stlye, colors and much more hands on."
good,"The hardest part of my job was the physical part. Moving, lifting and unpacking 30-60lbs. Also would relocate departments within the store. This required moving heavy racks, shelves, bars and etc., Inventory was conducted 2 times a year and all managers were responsible for their departments a lot of tedious very detailed work.  The most enjoyable part was satisfying a disgruntled customer and really great associates."
good,"The management suck and the manager are rude"
good,"This job is very flexible and helped me with my customer relations, and how to really treat a customer. Management was really friendly and has a family feel atmosphere."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I learned how to work with difficult coworkers and how to organize my time. I also learned how to be a leader. The hardest part was definitely the day before the door busters. The most enjoyable part were the senior staff members who had been working there for 10+ years.
good,"Not a lot of micro-managing...Room for advancement very quickly if Managers and CEO see talent and want to use you  and help you grow within the company."
good,"loved the job, my crew most management and all of support and sales associates. hours and pay was ok unfortunately some management my direct boss was not good at their job and very unprofessional"
good,"Macy's is a wonderful company to work for."
good,The job was a fun experience because the employees and managers were nice and the environment was settled and collected. I learned how to operate functions on the computer and learned how to interact with customers more fluently.
good,"On a regular work day, it is usually pretty great. I have no problems with any of my co-workers or my customers (most of the time). My managers are very nice people. I just don't appreciate how they push you so hard to get loyalty accounts. I understand that they are important, but not everyone is great at getting them. The best part of my job is connecting with the customers and seeing them smile because they are satisfied with their purchases."
good,"Macy's is a good company to work for.  My department is the facilities call center.  We service all Macy's, Bloomingdales, and Backstage stores.  It is very important that we keep the store running at an optimal level."
good,"Family environment."
good,"good"
good,"Macy's has a productive work environment with supportive management and employees. However, the way the company does their scheduling needs to be addressed as soon as possible."
good,"Some of the best people I know I met at Macy's Department Stores.  The management was very eager to provide a great working environment for associates. Macy's tried to be on the cutting edge of all work trends.  The auto scheduling for employees didn't really work well in a small store like ours.  Also, the pay was not great, but there was fun to be had."
good,I loved to work with the customers. I loved to watch them smile and have fun while I was helping the customer shop. I got great satisfaction out of pleasing the customer.
good,Love to shop at macy's but as far as working their its impossible to get hours and the management switch's too much and mess up on payroll quite often.
good,"All I needed was a small part time job to help pay some bills while I was in school full time & Macy's helped satisfy that requirement. "
good,"Move freight, stock, or other materials to and from storage or production areas, loading docks, delivery vehicles, ships, or containers, by hand"
good,"Very typical retail job except my specific position is better compensated and is generally less stressful. I have great co-workers and have had 1 wonderful department manager in the past but overall, management here is terrible. If you want a very generous employee discount, then work for Macy's."
good,Laid back workplace helping customers and receiving awards for hard work and dedication. I was very helpful with helping customers find what they need making sure that they were satisfied.
good,"Over all a great place to work. By far the best management team I've had the pleasure of working with. Very friendly  employee team in the Men's department. The hardest part of the job is getting hours. Not a problem for the full time worker but the part time, flex time, and part time/flex workers have a hard time getting enough hours on the time card."
good,Working in Macy Women you learn to manage your time and run a store mostly on your own. This has been an excellent experience for because I am self motivated and goal driven.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I did work during seasonal, and that is honestly one of the worst times to work. Over all I did learn a lot about it and I would hope to do seasonal this year again."
good,"I liked working here. Almost every other co-worker was very kind and helpful, so it made making friends easier than I had anticipated. The job itself is fun and not very repetitive like most retail work. The managers were very friendly and are always offering insight, but some may need to get their priorities straighten. The hardest part of the job were working overtime during the holidays, but that just meant more hours. I only wished part timers were provided at least some benefits."
good,"Over all not a bad company to work for, but could use some improvements. Pay rate is not to bad. Hr works well with employees."
good,days were challenging but having faith pulled a hard day at work love enjoying working with people management wasn't good but sales associate gain to work like managers
good,The location that I worked at was managed poorly. There was favoritism shown to the friends of management. Those that were shown favoritism were promoted based on relationship not skill.
good,the hardest part of the job is to follow procedure when there isn't any. There are practices in the workplace that is completely arbitrary to the job itself. It is difficult to stay focused on certain goals when the people around you do not
good,The job consisted of the handling and selling of fine jewelry as well as the inventory and maintenance of precious gems and metals.
good,"I had a great experience working at Macy's for this seasonal position but I was able to meet new people that was different from me, when I first arrive there I had alot of different co-workers show me so many ways to get better at moving with speed  . At this job I learned how to be a role model such as a leader, everything was a fast past movement because it was always a busy environment full of customers. I think there was never a hard part about working with Macy's because I always got the job done no matter what."
good,"was a very fast paced job, i enjoyed working here. it was a a very easy job Macy's is a very busy environment so even on a slow day you will never bored"
good,"You have to be here to understand the process. It's not just a dress on the hanger. It's the difficult process of many people to get it there. "
good,"very unorganized to many different managers, very confusing of job task. Discounts are great. CO-workers are sometime bitter. Co-workers favoritism and so does managers."
good,"a typical day here was just go and get your assignment for the day and do it. i learned how to scan bar codes properly. The management was super cool and very professional, mu co workers were really nice, ther was no hard part about the job at all, the most enjoyable part about my job was everyone would be very communicative about everything!"
good,Macy's has wonderful benefits for employees and they offer many hours. There was always some kind of drama or gossip on the floors. Customers were hard to deal with sometimes but this job really teaches you how to gain some patience.
good,"I learned how to work with a team, and great communication. Macys provides excellent workshops on how to reach sales goes, and to reflect to company in a positive way"
good,"A typical day of work:"
good,a typical l day at work was to come in firdt check if their are any go backs in your section that goes any where else.make sure customers are first priority and they are greeted and very comfortable.
good,"Long work hours, little pay. It was the holiday season, so it was also an extremely busy all the time with constant sales; never a dull moment. I learned a lot, worked hard. The managers always pushed you to work extra hours on top of long work days. Not enough people on the floor. Co-workers were all very helpful and dedicated to their work as far as I could tell. Most enjoyable part of the job I'd have to say was helping customers out on the floor. It made the time go by a lot faster, and it always felt wonderful to make a sale."
good,I am a people person and Macy's give me a opportunity to work in the environment where I'm able to use my skills.  you can interact and communicate with people all you want. Also you have a chance to work with people from different culture and backgrounds.
good,"My typical day at the job was clocking in speaking with shift leader they would assign me to a department and i would mostly be in the make up department or the shoe department and help any customers needed. Also i would try and sell items in the store, and tell customers about our on going sales, and our cuponing promotions we would have, also try and get a customer to sign up for a macy's point card so they would get to become a part of all the deals that we would offer."
good,"Good overall, managers/ supervisors do need to improve in training. It is very vague and managers expect other associates to train you when clearly they need more training themselves.This especially during seasonal employment. Also could work more on organization otherwise great work environment."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Good company to work for and able to grow in the asset protection world.
good,"I was employed for Macy's for On Call, Merchandiser. A typical day at Macy's would be; Coming into work, clock in, get the little guns they use to put price tags on, go to wherever floor you're working at and wait for your team leader to tell you what is going on the floor or what needs a new tag."
good,I worked here in the cosmetic's department sailing different types of lotions make-ups soaps and aroma therapy oils.
good,"Very diversified. Management team was excellent, very fast paced. Loved serving all customers needs and wants"
good,The short time I have worked for Macy's has proven to be full of learning opportunities and networking with amazing people; all leaders are willing to talk to you and teach you to make you better. They are all very supportive of the employees and each one's individual needs within the company.
good,I am working in Sales as Specialist Area Retail. Is one of the best Retail Company around Usa
good,"It was an alright job. Due to the location, I had to spend extra money daily to get to and from work."
good,I learned how much building great relationship with customers was important . The management was great also .
good,Macy's.com is a creative and fun environment where the E-Commerce Management Listened to your ideas
good,its a good job to have if u need a part time job. we moving furniture to the routes.also we do bedding and shipping thing off. also recycle boxes and things of that nature
good,".As an operations manager I would typically start my day off by going over the projected forecast for the day. I would review how much product was going to be shipped, and how many associates it would take my department to complete the workload. We would review our expenses and profits daily during executive meetings. I had a wonderful team working with me. The hardest part was trying to predict and staff according to an ""estimated"" workload."
good,"This is the first big retail business I have worked for. And at first it was a little bit intimidating. Weekend sales were over whelming and filled with customers. As the weekends past, I confided with seasoned vets of womens shoes and came out with a game plan. Now that I know what to expect, it's more of a challenge."
good,"A typical day at Macy's was either fast and continuous or slow and tedious. Very rarely did we have a regular flow of customers. Weekly sales report motivated me to do and be my best. On a more hectic day, it was difficult to keep the merchandise in order and help guest. Sometimes I would have help from my co-workers, only after having to request a manager. Otherwise, my day was spent folding clothes and directing guest to the right areas. The hardest part was getting a portion of my co-workers to help fold and tidy instead of cashier. Otherwise they were friendly, the days were short and it was an easy-going job."
good,I have learned many things through interaction on a daily working shift and was able to develop skills that will increase my ability in any new job.
good,"each work shift the employees had their own goals to reach, this helps in the long run to be able to achieve daily goals and set new ones. I met a lot of new people and helped me practice my communication skills. management was ok. co workers varied. a lot of co workers were not as social as others. I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,"It was a awesome job to work at, they wouldn't put seasonal people on the schedule like that."
good,"let me just explain. "
good,Fast paced high volume call center. Enjoyed the fast pace always busy. Never a dull moment always something new or different.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's, the environment was always open and fun, It was a lot of work involved, but I learned to take it all in stride and know that there was always work to do. My associates were the best part of my job, they respected me because I respected them, and could get them to work for that reason. The hardest part of the job was some days it just didn't seem like there were enough hours in a day to finish the job at hand."
good,"i love working with my start team, everybody knows their job and the support of our managers is excellent"
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Macys. The pay should be more regarding the fact Sales Associates work like slaves
good,"Stripping plastic off of new clothing arrivals, putting security tags on most items, moving new items to sales floor at the end of the evening.  "
good,interacting with a multicultural customers and making there day a little bit better
good,The hardest part of the job was that it was a commissioned sales position and merchandise sizes were frequently available to satisfy the customer.
good,I like the job just wasnt a long enought task for me. I work only on call ins. If I could have furfilled a full time schedule would have been a great job.
good,"(review not based on sales floor experience)"
good,I apprehended shoplifters. I learned great ways to conduct undercover surveillance. The co workers are enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was that it can get boring at times when the store has little customers.
good,Macy's make almost everything accessible to the both associates and customers from open to close. It is a comfortable environment;everyone is friendly. Managers and co-workers are all willing to help if their is any problem or may be confused about something. The hardest part about the job can sometimes be explaining coupons and why they don't work. I am able to adapt and learn quickly so everything else is fairly easy or manageable. The most enjoyable part about working at Macy's is interacting with the customers and making a connection.
good,working at macys was a nice place to work customers and even coworkers was nice it was easy to get work done.i was a sales asscociate also back stocking.helping customers find what they needed I was a help at the cashiers with assistance to my coworker.calling other macys to see if they had something that a customer needed if it was in stock to place it hold for them to come get it.
good,"What I enjoy most about my job is the team work.In the department that I work in my manager encourages us to not only better ourselves as sales people but as people. Every morning they encourage us to bring the magic to each customer and how we can assist them in better ways. We learn to create lasting relationships with some of these customers by the way we go above and beyond to help them get the things that hey are looking for. The hardest part of the job at least to me, is during the holidays. Just the volume of customers in the store during that time is plenty but we all get through it.  My co-workers are some of the best. I have grown to learn something from each them and even look to them as a little family. I have learned to work at a faster pace while still being efficient and also doing what I can to please guests."
good,"Its a nice environment with great learning experiences. A typical day would be straightening clothing racks, checking out customers, helping those with a selection. and mataining a clean area."
good,"I worked short shifts and helped many customers find the certain items that they were looking for through out the men's department. I built a great rapport with so many interesting people that a great deal of them grew to know me on a first name basis.  I learned a great deal of patience and how to treat each customer as if they were my family. The management kept the work environment quiet and relaxed and made sure we knew what our roles were for each shift. My co-workers were great people, but the commission aspect of our jobs would often create animosity between us. The part I enjoyed the most was meeting so many people from different walks of life."
good,Co workers we're usually friendly some were cut throat being that we were on commission. But I loved working there. Met so many different races of people and i loved the mall environment. I loved our busy days because there was always something to do (no idle time). I was working in a department that I love....SHOES. it was great overall but somethings about the job were a bit unfair. And I didn't like the miscommunication and the bit of drama that sometimes made work toxic. 
good,"A typical day at work is like, standing on my feet a lot going to ask customers if they need help on finding anything or pricing things if they have a question about finding a price. With me being a sales associate in the men's department I have to no the size of a man if they don't and by doing that I would have to meager them by there neck and harm's, and sometimes by there chest. If having a problem that is sometimes out of are hand's we would have to call a manager most of the time we would have to wait at lest at the most maybe about 3 min's. Co-worker's can have there moods because of working off of commission.Sometimes we don't"
good,"The fitting rooms are always a disaster, cleaning up after customers can be a nightmare. Scheduling can be a challange if you want to have any kind of home life. But most of the people that work there are great people."
good,"Doing many things at once such as unloading the merchandise off the trucks, organizing merchandise, sending them off to their proper departments, sensor the products, helping customers on the floors and managing and keeping the dock clean."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Trusted to be responsible with high-end merchandise. Challenged to multi-task.
good,"A typical day at Macy's would be just to stock. I learned leadership and to communicate well with my team. Management were great to us and understandable. My co-workers were great as well we all helped each other. There wasn't really a hard part of the job, just the hours were not good for the position I held their."
good,"The typical day at work was somewhat enjoyable, but very brutal. That's mainly due to going through major sales during the holidays. I have to keep my work space clean at all times and even at times  I help other Sales Associates with the work space. "
good,I been working for macys over a year now and I been trying to move up in retail but it seems like its impossible. They hire probably 20 people a month and give less and less hours every month   
good,this was a desk based job that I took with macys and have to say i was glad i did. you focus is the customer. you make sure the orders are going out right and customers orders are being received correctly. you fix problems in the website. 
good,Macy's is a Retail University.  If you can make it at Macy's you can make it anywhere. I learned and learned the do's and don'ts of Retail 101.  Great experience. 
good,I learned how to package items. the co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was good. A typical day at work is when the day got slow.
good,"Depending on what region you are working in, your experience will be better. East Coast Macy's is rough, and not a place for people who like to think freely. Macy's in the west is where creative, interesting, pioneers work. Either way, plenty of opportunity for advancement and training."
good,A typical day for me at work is preparing my for when the customers come in to connect and assist them. I larn alot about the customers and their needs. I help managing the area that I work in by making good judgement and choices that a manager would make to assist the customers. I enjoy helping my co-workers when they have a question or when they need to take a break. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the areas are very clean and organized. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing that the customers are satifyed with their purchases.
good,"I would clock-in, then go to the Warehouse room and start opening boxes and folding clothes to set out on display. I learned how to fold clothes, move in a fast paced environment in a workplace, and a little bit of cash register. My management never handed enough hours, but the co-workers were very nice. The hardest part about the job was just the little things, cleaning something I haven't seen and such. What I enjoyed most was helping the customers."
good,"I worked as a Suit and Shoe Specialist, so I had pleasure of working with men/families who were shopping for special occasions such as weddings, funerals, college graduations etc. A lot of the associates there were seasonal but were always great to work with, I had a great supervisor who cared about my performance. I was always a top sales performer for the entire store, I had a great time while I was at Macy's. I found that the hardest part of my job was opening up credit cards for customers, other than that, everything came pretty easy with how organized of a person I am. I learned great customer service skills dealing with customers and upper management face to face. I learned to be more outgoing and friendly and I cherished that even outside of work."
good,"they dont pay enough money and they dont appreciate your time and your extra work, manegment was amazing but they are not organized...for me i'd rather to work another company who ther are organized and appreciate what you do and an exciting enviroment..."
good,"Liked working with clients piecing together outfits for them, loved merchandising, did inventory, restocking ,setting sales, rtv transfers re-pricing merchandise .Coached new associates,on store policies and procedures and cash register.Handled customer service register.Co-workers great"
good,Handling customers purchases
good,Great place to work..most days are pretty busy but the atmosphere and co workers are friendly and works as a team. Hardest part of the job is inventory and long holiday hours
good,I enjoyed working at Macys. There are great people working there
good,"Gives a great way to help balance life and work with the ""My schedule plus option"""
good,"It was a good company to work for, I enjoyed my time working there. You get a 20% discount off everything in the store."
good,"great atmosphere, great co-workers, loved working in cosmetics"
good,working in Macy's was good management was good good schedule
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Assist customers with sales and cash transactions. Personal styling assistance for customers while ensuring sales floor is organized and replenished. Enjoyed meeting new people each day and having a flexible work schedule
good,Work at Macy's was a mervelous experience to me. It was my first Job the co-workers were so nice I learned a lot of thinks they trainning me how to do sometimes. Sincerly I was apreciate by the staff .
good,"A typical day in cosmetics at Macys would consist of achieving different goals, clientelle interaction, customer support, stocking, ordering, scheduling. I have learned alot in the retail aspect of marketing during my years of cosmetic management. In a position like this you work close together with your team. How well you work together will help you achieve beyond our goals. The hardest part of this particular kind of job is the hours. Retail hours flexuate by holiday, weekend, and event hours. The things I remembered most about this job are the friends I have made, either people I worked with or the my close customers."
good,Great job overall from the moment you start you will keep busy as well as learn new things on a daily basis. Some of the worker are hard to understand but most are very friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was me able to assist the company on a daily basis.
good,"Poor hourly wages, but with much opportunity to advance. management was excellent in making adjustments with schedules to help balance work, home, and school life."
good,A typical day at Macy's is kind of stressful due to the fact that I've been working extremely hard meeting every goal for 2 years to still get paid $7.75. Sometimes I come across negative customers but it does not bother me because I have worked in retail for 5+ years. I get along with all of my co-workers they make my day with their teamwork and humor also. The part that I dislike about my job the most is the fitting rooms. The customers literally throw clothes in the fitting room on the floor and damage them to sometimes steal or just for fun.I have a passion for fashion so that is my reason for putting up with so much.
good,Nice to work for Macy's pay is not good but you get great discounts and work with nice people.
good,"Basically working for macy's for 4 months I've noticed that the managers in charge were disclosing confidential information about previous employees that used to work there. Giving full names and the reason why they were fired, as well as singling out certain employees of different backgrounds, African Americans mostly, and finding ways to fire them. They even went as far as giving employees bad advice and then later build a case against them and terminating them for not following the rules. I once turned a manager in for telling me personal information about another employee and in return I was fired and the manager is still working there as of today."
good,"Gave you as many hours you would request, learned alot of organization skills and how to be patient and maintain a clear head in an busy environment"
good,Great staff. It didn’t feel like work. I like the people there. Everyone was easy going. I enjoyed working with some people there. I did my own thing working as a private merchandiser.
good,- i like working at macys for how well knowledge i am about how the system works and how i make many peoples shopping experience better by how attentive i am and patient.
good,During the holidays it was very busy. Always have a positive attitude and just have fun. This is a very good job to have. You get 20% Employee discount. Always great Sales.
good,"Over all I loved my time there, but now my store is suddenly closing so I wouldn't recommend it. Also you work nights weekends and holidays including thanksgiving. But the people are the best and managers are really good."
good,Understood why its an icon of a company.  Great people helping great customers.  There are systems in place that help bring wonderful people in and under traing and development are able to utilize the tools and skills needed to become part of the culture to in turn wow our customers.
good,It takes a strong character to work at Macy's. Business is highly variable with busy 4th quarter and very slow periods in the summer. Coworkers and management a good.
good,Retail sales based company so a typical day at work would be to persuade a customer to make a purchase. The job wasn't hard I just think that things could be better explained as far as to what the different products consume of or are used for in some of the departments. For ex: (Cosmetics Dept).
good,Macy's is your typical retail job in that you will work most weekends. The pay for the top performing stores which I had the pleasure to work at is fantastic for a retail job especially if you get a commissioned  area like cosmetics or fine jewelry. The scheduling can be a little wonky but it is easy to swap shifts with others in your area. All in all I really like it.
good,"Shows partialities, taking advantages on innocents people, work is fine, some people don’t work @ all, comes for chatting with their people & getting good pay checks. Not paying good for hard workers because of the people colors."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked at another Macy's for a long time. I transferred to this store and I'm satisfied with my decision. It's a new experience and I'm looking forward to Christmas.
good,Job well enjoyed challange at some points i had flexible schedule supervisors were kinda rude during training an on floor training guidelines for safety wasn’t properly acuantiance
good,Macy's is my first warehouse job so i cant compare it to another. The employees at macys are really friendly. The pay is not the best but its better then most places.
good,"Managers constantly changing, either quitting or put in other positions, most of them are good  at tell you what to do but don't help..always pressured to open at least 3 Macy's accounts weekly, as a sales rep one must talk to customers on the sales floor, but don't dare to talk to your coworker, that for sure gets you in trouble with manages."
good,You always get a 20% discount at macys stores.  They give a good amount of holidays paid and pto.They have okay medical benefits.  Overall if you are looking for just a job this is a great place to work.
good,"It was a nice place to work. every one was nice, diverse, and it paid well. Everything was good but what I loved about it was the eminence learning that accord in the day to day bases."
good,I liked it was a great learning experience because that was my first time working in a retail store and plus doing shipping and receiving the training was easy because I'm a fast learner
good,I love working at macys they let you do your job but still keep an eye on you They don't stand and constantly watch you they let you do your work and it was good for me because I was always busy I got along with all my coworkers we all work as a team and if you have questions there is always someone to help you
good,"I've worked at Macys for 5 years now. Love my coworkers . There's just no room for advancement in this warehouse. I would like to become a Supervisor, or Maner at some point,but know it will never happen."
good,"Was my first time to work in retail. The staff was kind for the most part. I got good hours and the pay was nice. Very long training, but it was paid."
good,The job is slow and they treat you terrible that’s why I’m looking for a new job but if your used to that then you would fit well with them they might treat others differently thanks for reading my page.
good,I worked for them for the holidays and enjoyed my time with them. late nights were tough but they kept me on their team after the holidays. Pay was good along with discounts.
good,"Working at Macy’s can be fun at times depending on traffic flow, as with any retail department store. There is always something to do, whether recovering the floor or helping a customer; to processing new merchandise and getting it on the floor."
good,This job is mind-numbingly boring. You do the exact same job everyday with no variation. You could sometimes spend an entire 10 hour shift folding cloths or putting boxes together.
good,People that work there are amazing but upper management is terrible. Too many levels of management on too many different pages. People who work with you are amazing. Hardest part is lack of direction and unrealistic goals company wide.
good,It was fun working as a beauty advisor at Macy's. I enjoyed the perk of discounts and sales. The hardest part of this job was not being able to control shopping.
good,"I worked in several departments in the 8 years I worked there. All were in support staff, usually before store opened. The coolest position I had was a B.O.P.S. Lead (Buy Online Pick-up In-Store).  The position had several aspects to it. You were just doing one thing all the time. Plus I like finding things that people loose. That was the main job of that position. Was finding products throughout the store that customers ordered online."
good,Granted it's been awhile since I have worked here but from the experience I had it was honestly probably my favorite. I wish I could return but times have changed and they don't seem to be doing as well as they once we're.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Retail is not my industry of choice but the workplace culture is awesome! I had a hard time opening new  accounts but enjoyed dealing with the public.
good,"I liked working there, sometimes customers were very stressful and it would get very slow. Sometimes there would be nothing to do because we already did everything."
good,"I would go back, more attention to associate performance and skills should be paid by management before deciding who to hire at the end of each seasons. One of the more enjoyable jobs I've had."
good,scanning 
good,"i believe its a great place for it to be a first job, the pay is great , they a very quick to hire anyone , they training isnt as great as it used to be being that i worked there last year and i nevr got trained to do what i had to do ."
good,Lots of training was required but the benefits were well worth it once new techniques were put in place. Management was friendly and helpful at all times.
good,It was a fun experience. I didn't work as much because I was a seasonal employee.I was on the customer service side and there's something new in that section everyday.
good,I truly enjoyed the connections I gained with the customers. I worked in the men's department and soon had to shop for personal clients. i enjoyed the friendly team work that Macys encouraged.
good,I use to work for the fragrance department. I had a great time working for this industry  been that it opened up so many other opportunities that I didn't expect. Good place to work but it was very competitive for no reason.
good,Assist in helping customers and help the customer make a choice in the store for family and friends. giving opinions on the presentation of the goods display
good,"A typical work day at Macys was  fast-paced  and included a lot of hard work. The management was very attentive towards their employees and made sure to be supportive and motivational to help everyone reach their daily goals while working. The environment at Macys was very fast-paced, which I loved because that meant that time was flying right by. I loved working at Macys because all their employees had an understanding of team work."
good,I was only a seasonal employee. a typical would be morning team meetings and review last night and yesterday sales. I learned a lot about fashion watches
good,"Macys Corporate was a solid place to work when I started. the management teams are wonderful. Biggest issue at Macys Corp is that the company is on a downward slope and they are at point where they are quick to outsource jobs. Again, management at the lower level is fantastic. The benefits and compensation packages are nice as well."
good,Macy's had meetings every morning and before each on coming shift that would allow each employee to know what the day was going to bring or expected to bring in sales. Team players
good,Macy’s is a fast paced job but it’s also on your on time & it’s easy they do 12 hr shifts & 30 min breaks with a weekly pay Macy’s can benefit its employees
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"overall a decent place to work if the employee can handle standing 10 hours for four days a week, maintaining a standard number required and only having one twenty minute break and a thirty lunch."
good,Learned time management and customer service skills. Very fast-paced (especially during the holidays). Flexible schedule that let me go to school full-time.
good,"an overall day at Macy's good, not stressful  I always looked forward to going to work until our Managers changed. And  Macy's.............so good...."
good,"Sometimes it would be busy an the other times it would be slow, but no matter what I also enjoyed meeting new people to work around and had fun putting a smile on customer faces when I got there specific order correct"
good,"its a place that you can get by, by doing the minimum.  I don't enjoy a work environment where you are not expected to do your best.  since their pay isn't competitive I believe they don't care about what the employees are doing"
good,Macys warehouse was an good experience for me though the management needs strengthened in a lot of areas. There needs to be more control of the team's and information as to what people need to be clear on regarding there task for the current shift.
good,I like working at macys furniture dept. Although it was supposed to be for the Christmas season in 2011 I was asked to stay on indefinitely in which I have grown to like it. But the time has come that our store was closed down and I was not able to relocate to another position.
good,Macy’s is a good company to work for because they have a lot of different job opportunities. The hours are long and it is a fast-paced environment. The discounts are also very good around holidays.
good,Good environment and people. Is a fun place to work. Good managers and staff. Stand up for a long time is the worst part. Enjoy the extra discounts employee
good,"N/A- "
good,Its a fun and friendly environment . Flexible schedule and they work with schools schedule as well. Its a good job but I dislike the holiday schedule and weekends as well.
good,Fun place to work in an ever changing industry.  In this industry everyday you experienced something new and challenging.  Work environment was very diverse and provided opportunities for growth regardless of your experience.
good,"Keeps you busy. Always something to do. The staff rotates on things to do. All employees helps each other out in any job title you have"
good,"I loved working for Macy's. The discounts are amazing. But they should raise more pay and give more hours. Also, the management is really horrible. The managers has their favorites to pick side on and they're really harsh on their associates!"
good,My overall review is working at Macy's was fun did not get paid enough though they should hire at a higher pay for all the orientation drug testing fingerprinting criminal background testing.
good,"I worked here seasonally during college. The atmosphere was fun, fast paced, and you had adequate training. The managers worked just as hard as the other associates. For such a huge corporation, I wish Macy's paid a little more but there were so many associates who had been with the company for over 20 years. So they must be doing something right!"
good,"Working at Macy's is a great place to start if you are interested in working retail. Even if you work in a certain department it is pretty much guaranteed that you will travel around the store to work in different departments, so that way you'll have the experience of working in Men's, Women's,Children's,Shoes, Handbags,Jewelry,etc."
good,"It's usually understaffed, although I love my managers, I feel like a lot more could've been done for the employees to get the job done a lot faster. Understaffing was a huge issue"
good,Fast paced fun environment. Meet and greet potential customers. Love this assignment. Learned how to interact with clients find out they're style. Excellent fashion
good,The typical day at work was always fun and busy. We all bonded together which to me is very important because if you have good bonds with people work tends to be much more enjoyable. I learned so much dealing the company. I learned how to work a fork lift which to me was very exciting because i enjoy learning new things along my journey in life. The management system was very well put together. There human just like us so they developed a bond with us just like everybody else bonded together. You have any questions or problems go to your manager and they will not be hesitant to help you out. The hardest part of my job was when i first started working the forklift where it takes you high in the air was very challenging for me because my number one fear is heights but i learned to concur my fear and because quite good at working the forklift. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see all the new merchandise in the building going for designer to designer it caught my interest because i am very big on fashion.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I was new to New Mexico so I decided to get a hands on meet the people job and I loved it I would have stayed but I got excepted to San Jose Job Corps and honestly I wanted to come home to California.
good,Its a very busy job will keep you on your toes from when you come in until you leave. You will learn all about the different designers and their goals.
good,"I really enjoyed working here at Macy's, the only problem i had was there wasn't many hours to work but the plus was they pay everyweek. The whole entire team was excellent and mangers were realistic and understanding."
good,"It was okay I liked it, good people good management I wold recommend this job for anyone who wants to get into retail or job experience as a sales associate"
good,"I worked in commission sales, so the work pace is multitasking, on your feet, running back and forth aiding multiple customers, at a time, while competing with rival salesman."
good,Working here was fun at times and other times it was very stressful. I really enjoyed my team and they made the workplace much easier to work in. Well management was good depending on which manager you were dealing with but most of them were great.
good,Working at Macys Livingston is a project . You have your moments there . Sometimes it can be fun and sometimes it's just I'm ready to go . Some customers are nice and some are extremely rude but you can't let that affect your demeanor
good,I love working in a field where you can meet people from all over the world. This industry is going towards the era where you have to build relationships with your customers for repeat business.
good,Macys is an awesome place to work place to be. One thing about macys is that there very protected over there employers and i really like that..macys is like a family to me because they make you feel like family.
good,I enjoyed working in Macys. Very fast pace & I was schedule for some great hours. Although i worked commission that was something I will never do again. I rather get paid per hour.
good,"learned a lot about how to treat a customer. Learned a lot about management.It's very flexible work place,positive enviroment.As more you sell more you get paid."
good,Macy's would have been a job I would have stayed with but I had to quit. The management is terrible. Almost no manager knows what they are doing and it's all over the place. Most unstable job I've ever worked at. I had to quit because even after talking to mangers they were scheduling me crazy hours. I couldn't balance being a biology major with the amount of hours of work and school. Other then that if they would listen to their associates a little more and find better management I would recommend Macy's to anyone.
good,At the beginning of the work day the managers would gather all of the employees around and lecture us about the daily goals and sales. If reach the goals for the day then we get rewarded.
good,"Very high energy and fast paced work environment, always filled with customers, always something that has to be done, there is never a dull day at work. Many different learning experiences while working here such as customer service, and retail."
good,Working at Macy's means that you are not only part of a team but you're surrounded by energetic and great people.  My professional management tool kit is loaded with skills & tools learned by working at Macy's.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My day at work begins with sorting items and sometimes helping customers; including working cashiers and other jobs. Management for the most part was well versed and kind.  The hardest parts was mostly the time provided to do a certain job. The easiest however, was the job in of itself"
good,"I loved working in the cosmetic department, I am still great friends with most of my coworkers, the hardest part of my job was the pay. But if you do have opportunities  to move up in the company."
good,i enjoyed Macy's and i still do till this day. i worked for the coach section of Macy's and i feel like at first it was great and all and i really wanted to stay because the environment and people were great. after a few months i started noticing that my hours were cut in half and honestly it wasn't a place were i didn't see myself staying for too long and i just wanted out already.
good,When you work through these doors you come to learn the ins and outs. Not just the job but the culture the people the life of the job.
good,"My co-workers and supervisor were all amazing people to work with and very welcoming. They made the job fun and I felt I had a whole team supporting me through anything. But apart fromt that it wasn't as good as they make it out to be. The reason being is the customers are given too much power. By this I mean if the customer is being rude or insulting you, you had to take it and if you ask them to leave or anything like that they would get the manager and you'd be the one on trouble. When a shoe couldn't be found they didn't want to understand that it could not be found and would yell at you to go find it when that not how it works, we had helpers for and that if they couldn't find it we get blame for when it wasn't our fault. Also even when you put down that you have a mental disorder they don't take into consideration of where they put you. I was placed where I could easily be triggered but luckily since I've lived with disorder a big majority of my life I could control it but if they aren't careful they might hire someone who could lose it and attack or do something to the customers or coworkers."
good,"great management system. They are caring, and understanding. You can pick up shifts as many as you want. Even to 50 hours a week. insurance. Tuition reimbursement, and etc.."
good,"Clocking in and getting the day started at the time you set your schedule is great. Everyday you learn little tricks around the store to keep it clean, hang clothes a certain way. Co-workers are great though working with a large group there can be some negativity at times. Mangers are always walking around and are very involved with their department. I don't recall there being a difficult time in the job but i do know that it was a great way to meet people from around the island."
good,"Macy's is a company constantly striving to be the best it can be in a changing retail environment by being a leader in technology and managing a good balance between corporate strategy and localized assortments. "
good,"In once you able to reach your sales goal everyday you'll be good to go. It's not something easy to do everyday, and when you can't reach I you'll get  minimum pay."
good,"Macys is a good place to work but that want more out f you then they want to pay.You put in the time and get nothing out of it. The management needs help, because no one talks to anyone the lack of skills and training needs to be worked on."
good,"Share and provide excellent customer service"
good,"A typical day would be around 200 calls ranging from angry customers who wanted to use there card to people wanting to add authorized buyers. I learned that you can't really let angry customers get to you, all you can do is resolve the issue as best you can. "
good,"A typical day at work was very slow or extremely busy. I learned cashiers experience with the cash register and handling large amounts of money. Management weren't all the same, some were good and others were bad. My co-workers weren't all the same either, some worked hard while others hardly worked because we weren't always under supervision. The hardest part of the job was working on busy sale days and holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving monetary credits applied to my employee discount for shopping and meeting lots of people of different cultural backgrounds."
good,dealing with customer was fun because you come across different type off people and its okay with the associate not to much with the managers some off them act like children and they just didnt know they places
good,"loved the coworkers managment the culture of the company, only the pay is way too low !!!!  I believe that with higher pay happier employees and company would keep longer good people that make customers happy and to keep them coming back."
good,"A typical day working as a counter manager in the fragrance department in Herald Square can be filled with lots of responsibilities and excitement. I always had to ensure that the customers were treated as special guests coming to the biggest store in the world while doing my other duties (replenishing merchandise, supervising my team and merchandising and even supplying stock to the counter from the 10th floor). "
good,"Though I absolutely loved interacting with new people often, the business aspect I did not like. "
good,It was a great  experience for me to work at Macy's the culture of handwork and business on the daily basis was amazing. I appreciated the workmanship of each employer.
good,A typical day would be very fast paced and busy. I enjoyed my co-workers very much; they were all very happy and helpful. I learned to  take control of my position and to always go above and beyond for the customer.

good,I loved this job there I a lot of room for growth. I was working for this company for 4 years and I ended up going back to school for a career.
good,"Great place to work gain lots of experience in real life emergency situations such as  building evacuation at times of actual  fire or fire alarm.To evacuate the largest store in the world Macys herald square NY NY  is an experience I'll never forget, Working in this capacity has prepared me tremendously to be a Nurse, learning how to stay calm under pressure executing procedures calmly and efficiently whilst  dealing with life and Death situations  are some of the most valuable lessons I've learned. Management usually treats workers depending on their value as for me I had no problems with Management because they knew  I was an Asset to their Company and I did my job well, coworkers once I got to know each personality and they got to know my Personality stand up guy then just like Management no problems just mutual respect and get the job done, best part of the job is getting commended by the Chief  of FDNY Supervisor and coworkers, the hardest part of this job is the fact that there is  no room for error because the Ceo and Executives may be in  the building in meetings etc at time of emergencies if you panic and loose composure and make  mistakes your supervisor will be sure to get an email from the executives and because of the tragic 9 11 events  that took place in NY people in High-rise buildings are very apprehensive."
good,The cosmetic team at Macy's was a great team to work with. They were like family. The hardest part of the job is selling a high interest credit card as a benefit to the customer. The pay was pretty low.
good,Cashier/ Sales Associate duties such as helping customers locate products and inform them of current sales.
good,"The management was fantastic, but lacked communication. It really just depends on your department and who you are working with. I was in fine jewelry, there were a lot of miscommunication among the other associates in my department. making it a little tough to work with some of those associates. My favorite part of the job was helping my customers find the special piece of jewelry to give to their significant other."
good,"busy , a lot of walking around and picking up after people. folding clothes over and over. you have to be patient and able to deal with customers. co workers are a big help if you need help someone's is always around. The hardest the part of the job is standing for hours in a suit and shoes"
good,Very fun yet demanding job. I love the  atmosphere of always being able to assist customers .
good,"This has been my best job by far as far as work/ life balance, good management, and the best co-workers ever! I have the best dept in my store!!! We work very hard as a team and are like family!!! Sad shame that we are grossly underpaid for the hard work we do!!!! Macy's make so much money, and pay their workers pathetic pay!!!!!!"

good,I enjoyed the diversity and opportunities to experience different departments in this store.
good,My day with start with loading and unloading boxes.  The boxes that were unloaded we would have to place on shelves or racks.  The trainers were very helpful and took their time to show the proper places everything needed to go.
good,"we always make sure we have enough items on the floor, always have to smile, make the job fun."
good,It's a hard job.  I learned that it takes more then shoe skills to make it there.  The Management could use some work.  Co-workers were great.  Hardest thing abut this job was waiting on shoes to be brought out to you by expediters.  But the most enjoyable time spent at work was in the associate's lounge.
good,"I had part time, and worked with a team, of up to 3 people. But we split off and did what we were told to by the supervisor. "
good,"My first real job. stayed there forever, got paid good, got good hours, loved my team."

good,"I actually loved working in Macy's, always i kept busy with customers and the coworkers were helpful too"
good,"Very busy atmostphere. Dont like the fact that no matter how much work experience you have, coming to the company is like starting over again with low pay rates. Low pay raises.

good,Working at Macy's was a good place to learn how to  work by multitasking. I learned skills in customer service. The co-workers are helpful when needed. The jobs are really not hard but just making sure that you do your job in a timely manner is whats most important. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers.
good,"I started at Macy's as a seasonal employee in the Women's clothing better sportswear department.  It was a little overwhelming at first because there were so many different clothes and we had to learn where to put them.  But after a few weeks, it's pretty easy.  I worked at that fast pace full-time during the holidays and it was a good experience because it teaches you how to work quickly and efficiently. "
good,"Busy, very productive days. interacting with shoppers. Disliked the retail schedule"

good,"This has been an okay job. I have been with Macys for a little over two years. It really works with my school schedule, and I can pick up hours and work whenever I want to. A typical day at work includes Assisting customers with clothing for casual, work, special occasion, or vacations. Working at macy's I have learned that you have to be able to read customers to understand what they really want. If they are comfortable with their purchase(s), they won't return the items or second guess the purchase. The management is okay. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers who demand a discount on merchandise that is not on sale, and causing a scene in the store, causing higher power to get involved. The most enjoyable part of my job, is talking to customers. I really like talking to customers and finding out what they like, what they don't like, where they are from, what are they currently doing in life; things of that nature."

good,it was an okay place to work sometimes i didnt like the rules but other then that it was okay
good,I did sales so I was always moving around to help a customer and then I would be at the desk answering phone so I can take orders. I learn how to do sales and be very patient. The management were hardly there so I was by myself all the times. I mostly help my co-workers and they were hard workers. Is selling a 400 dollar Jeans it has happen to me but it hard at times to convince a customer. I enjoy meeting my goals and helping a customer fell good.

good,Company incentives for good performance. Retail in general is a hard job - on your feet for long periods of time. They provide adequate breaks and break room accommodations.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship that were built through my years of service.  The culture at the location I worked was friendly and inviting.  The most difficult part was losing my job with a Company I love working for.
good,It’s a very hard working company very simple process but also advance always busy the job definitely keeps individuals busy and the breaks are very convenient
good,Management is terrible there. They Only do what they want when they want. Never on the floor always in the office. Even when they in the office they barely answer the phone
good,"Learning something new everyday, interaction with customers on a daily basis was very interesting. Working with my team and meeting daily goals was the best part of my job."
good,"I have worked for Macy’s twice. Once when I was 18 (my first job too) and then again when I was 21. The first time around I was a “support” employee is what it’s called I believe and mostly with that position it was just folding things, picking up shoes, getting more shoes in stock room and just assist customers. The second time I was a sales associate/cashier. I would say though what I didn’t like about it is how they kinda just rotated me around with little hands on training. Other then that it was a good growing experience in that field of work."
good,Macy’s is very fast paced and it gets you a feel for what retail is really like. It gets you experience on sales and commission. I worked in mostly fragrance so there was a lot of competition being at the register!
good,"Macys offered job training for a new hire member of management.  Macys also never schedules enough associates per day, the result is you have associates that do not have a specialty area they can focus on"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a good place to work if your a student or a college student. It helps you communicate with new customers daily but sometimes the work can be heavy. If your prepared to work on black Friday's with constant complains go for it !
good,The associated are very friendly and very helpful I never had a problem with customers for my friendly face and continuos smile the work was a lot from time to time but other then that really comfortable
good,"very family like, manager are helpful and great team to be apart of , around the hoildays can be crazy but it was worth it, sometimes work and family life can be hectic , balanceing both is all up to you,"
good,"Bench Technician Keep workstation and common areas of the repair shop clean "
good,Our computers are outdated and incredibly slow. Important information is never given to us it was more like gossip. When you are scheduled for a nine hour shift you only get paid for 8 because you clock out for break. The managers are very helpful and so are all the employees. The work environment is extremely friendly and welcoming.
good,"It was a good experience after being out of the formal work place for so long. It wasnt the best place to work for many trying to earn a living wage, but for me and my circumstances it was enjoyable for the most part."
good,Nice environment to meet new people. manager is very understanding and a sweet person. store manager is awesome as well. only thing is the pay sucks. other than that their great
good,Work consisted of meeting new people everyday and pleasing customers. Meetings every morning to discuss sales and awards to be given out alongside music to greet customers into the store so that they feel appreciated.
good,"La empresa provee excelentes beneficios a los empleados, mucha oportunidad de desarrollo y crecimiento profesional. Las politicas y forma de desarrollo estipulado por la empresa es excelente, lo no excelente es la calidad de persona que seleccionada para administrar la empresa, son seres despiadados y egoistas que una vez se percatan del potencial de su projimo y se sienten de alguna forma amenazados a ser desplazados se desacen del buen empleado y optan por amistad mas que por el talento. La empresa pudiera generar mucho más con el equipo correcto, profesionales con etica, lideres que desarrollen, encarrilen y reconozcan empleados con verdadera MAGIA."
good,"every day is  a challenge ,you have to do your best to keep associate happy working for you and for the company ,and at the same time make our customer happy and make them to come back to hour store ."
good,"•	Performed daily department tasks including inventory control (cycle counts), receiving/shipping merchandise, e-service transactions, stocking, markdowns, etc. "
good,If it wasn't for personal family situations I would've love to stay working in this establishment. The management is very understanding and good to get along with. Bosses also help you grow and teach new things to grow with in the business through every day of work.
good,"Its about who you know to move up and not how hard you work."
good,"Very flexible hours, very professional and kind people, great environment, well dressed and comfortable, just love it there. Wish I worked there longer but it was seasonal"
good,Worse job ever. Work 9 hours and drive 30 min one way never at home. Get reprimanded for helping customers not a company I want to work for. This store has a really bad problem with there management.
good,"Skin time, the hardest part of the job: How to invite a costumer to sit and try our product. Fortunately, Clarins is a french cosmetic, but the everyone' s pocket is a manner. I was famous because of my hands, everyone said that my hands felt like cotton. It was a great tool to introduce the products and close sales. Another hard task was to open Credit Card, sometimes I was lucky, but most of the time people told about their legal status or bankrupt, I obstacle. The Macys Credit Card was a stressful thing for every associate in the department store."
good,"Macy’s isn’t a bad job for the pay, but standing 10-12 a day on your feet in a hot work place can be killer. Sometimes the company will send you home if the work gets slow but other than that if you don’t like long days I wouldn’t go for it."
good,"I truly enjoyed working here because my knowledge, skills and opinions were valued by the management.  I was in NYC so could not live on the salary offered.  If I had lower rent/bills I would have stayed until I was advanced to a hire paying role in visuals."
good,"Friendly staff, great place to socialize and make good connection. Awesome place to practice and excel customer service. Good management team. At Macy's you have the opportunity to grow and move up."
good,"In my career, I Doug my best to be the number one, never fail all the compagne I work for gone to be the number one. Promise to give all i have to make the cook nice and be nice to my team"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed the time I spent at Macy's as a Sales Specialist for the Eileen Fisher line of womens high-end clothing.
good,"As a sales associate, you must be responsible for sales and customer service support. Also, as a team member or an individual employee, you have to accomplish goal of sales."
good,The costumers were very fun to interact with and my fellow coworkers were very helpful. Although one of the managers were very rude at sometimes but overall was a great experience.
good,"a typical day at Macy's would be mainly recovering the section you're working in. In other words, fold, hang, and organize clothes and racks. Also working at the cash register is a daily responsibility."
good,"A typical day at work was always different, I learned how to stock, put on shipping labels that were going to be sent internationally. Management was great and very understanding, professional. They are excepting of anyone and everyone, they are welcoming, all types of people from different cultures and ethnicities which makes me feel comfortable because it was a judgement free zone. There wasn't anything too complicated about the job, everything was simple you just had to get the hang of it like any other job in time it got easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to pick between which section you wanted to work at, not being stuck at just one section of the building."
good,If you show your love for customers and sales then you will go far. Take the time to learn the products and keep up to date with current trends. Be prepared to have people ask you some very random questions on the sales floor.
good,They kept us well-informed month a month and all the company was doing I didn’t have a problem with any other fellow employees my manager always made sure to make sure that we were OK and we had everything we needed when I came to work condition wise
good,"Good place to work part time. Flexible hours,good co-workers and work atmosphere. Family oriented and considerate of family matters. Encouraged employees to put family 1st."
good,I loaded and unloaded trucks on a daily basic I stocked shelves cleaned floors and maintain orders to go to right locations train new employess and made sure all trucks were loaded properly
good,"Overall, my experience as a Macy's associate was satisfactory. The other associates and management were fairly friendly and helpful throughout my experience. Working with a variety of customers in all the different departments was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I did gain very valuable sales experience. I loved working in the Macy's South Coast Plaza Home Store and specially in the wedding department. I enjoyed working with couples. Everyday we had different issues to deal with.
good,"Working at Macy's as a sales associate has to be one of my favorite jobs, besides the pay. Everyone is super nice and most of the time you're always busy so time goes by pretty quickly."
good,"Great coworkers, okay hours, not so great management. Management used to be good but over the years I feel like they are unsure of what they are doing and lack concern for employees."
good,Great experience for my first job. I enjoyed going to work everyday and talking to the customers. This job helped me so much with my customer service.
good,Macy was very busy everyday which made my works days go by pretty fast. I enjoyed seeing new faces everyday and the expression on ones face when I suggested fragrance that they liked.
good,"Very fun workplace. Macys has taught me a lot about customer service and how to deal with different types of situations. Has helped me a lot with ways to overcome obstacles and not stay behind. The hardest part of the job is having a task assigned to you when it takes more than 1 person to do, but nonetheless it is manageable."
good,Macy's was a great experience and I had a great time even though I only worked there for a short period of time. It showed me how to interact with customers and the other side of the business industry.
good,I was a Flex for cosmetics so I had flexible hours and able to choose my hours and days. It was convenient with school because I am a full time student.
good,"Co-workers are like family. "
good,"For the ones that go to school , full time job , and/or need to tend to their family . Macy's is very good with scheduling. Also , if you love meeting new people. Also it's a everyday learning about Macy's product."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,So much stock coming in daily overall good family of coworkers great customers manager was awesome very understanding and helpful. like a second mother money was okay getting paind on friday was the best
good,"I enjoyed my time at macys. I worked in cosmetics where my department was more of a close knit family rather than co-workers. I also held a flexible relationship with my floor manager who always worked with me to fix my concerns as well as gave credit where it was do. At Macy's, I learned how to interact with all walks of life, as well as how to handle customer concerns, where the customer left extremely satisfied."
good,"Work life balance is the most attractive aspect of this employer, however company is undergoing a drastic change. Several locations are closing."
good,"A typical day at the warehouse is extremely tedious , long and busy."
good,"A typical day at Macy's was me recovering sections of the store. Making sure everything looks presentable to the eye of customers. Management and my co-workers were all great to work with. I enjoyed working with this company, although I was a seasonal worker"
good,"Typical work day as a sales manager is all about sales focus, making the magic of macys and of course stars. Stars was a big part of the day to make sure we was asking each and every guest about the rewards program for the credit card. I would walk the floor and interact with my guests and customers"
good,the old ladies working there are very competitive and won't help you with your costumers because they want the commission. They won't do anything unless the costumers are theirs .
good,"Come to work and clock in grab my sales device to scan shoes when customers wish to try on their size, Greet, help and assist customers to meet my daily sales goal."
good,"•	Delivered an outstanding experience to customers by explaining the use, operation, and proper care of merchandise to customers."
good,it was an interesting experience only a seasonal job. Good hours and good pay good breaks. management is nice and efficient helpful and handy. Work was fun I mainly sold colognes and perfumes.
good,Working at Macy was a very simple place to work. The co-workers and managers there are kind. The store offered a few benefits for being their employee as well.
good,"you will learn how to go out and get your money here seeing that many positions are commission based. you learn how to approach many different people based off of simple things like age, gender, conversations, etc. Management are usually driven and hard working , usually always in meetings however. As an associate you earn a lot of take home things such as gift rewards and prizes . Macys  money helps too when you sell a credit card."
good,"I learned that yous must always be polite no matter what the issue is, to always treat people in your workplace with respect have communication with others .. the hardest part of the job is to no be discourage when you see a line full of customers some might be angry because its a long wait then you have the floor (clothing in your area ) looking a mess items all over the place... you must remain calm and keep a smile on your face ... the most enjoyable part of working at Macy's is when we had a morning meeting to see how we as a group in every department did on our goals i was top of the 25 i was happy about that they gave me a Macy's money i brought a new hand bag"
good,t was a very fast pace learning environment and it skilled me a lot in the retail industry especially when it comes to being able to multi-task and handle various jobs at once.
good,"In a typical work day I usually greeted customers, gave directions, and helped cater to each customers individual needs and wants for the product."
good,"It is a very fast pace environment. They're always willing to move up employees. But they are not very flexible with school. My co-workers make it a friendly environment,and family orientated. Time seems to fly on the job.I learned how to manage a group of individuals to tackle a task. My first management skills were produced from this company. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I meet different people all over with different personalities."
good,I learned how to organize and sell merchandise by helping customers with things they would like. I learned how to use a cash register and development more customer service skills. My coworkers were genuine people. The most enjoyable part was the holiday when people came in after christmas :)
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"no complaints on this job, everyday couldn't wait to get there and stayed late. co-worker's where very pleasant and fun to work with and hang out after work. wish all of my employments where like this job"
good,"Macys was an great place to work, The management team was a great team  to work with. The employee were okay to work with."
good,Very crowded need way more breaks while doing 12 hr shifts but overall good employer would apply there again soon.
good,A typical day at work here would be managing registers and hourly sales. Also cleanliness of department and customer satisfaction. All employees are very friendly and greet each customer. hardest part of the job would be convincing customers to open credit accounts.
good,A typical day was going in seeing my fellow co-work happy to be there we would clock in and herd out on to the floor. I learn that its the little things that people appreciate
good,"A typical day consist of meetings with cross functional departments internally and externally. "
good,"Effectively deal with patrons, staff, faculty, students, and others on a regular basis. The most enjoyable part about working at Macy's is interacting with new people everyday."
good,"•	Assist customers in finding products that match their needs."
good,Typical retail work. Really shouldn't expect more than that.
good,very friendly and concerned about u the management was very nice
good,"Typical retail position - keep merchandise organized, assist customers, clean out dressing rooms.  Management varied by department, but were generally pretty great.  Co-workers were a bit gossipy but overall good people.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers or dealing with an empty store for the last 3 hours of an evening shift.  Best part was having a co-worker to hang out with if it was really slow."
good,"a typical day at Macys is a full busy day of handling customers and products with care and knowledge. Giving each and every customer that great magic experience when shopping at macys. A manager is always at hand when needed and co-workers work together to bring the customer the most easiest, fast, and hassle free shopping experienece"
good,"A typical day for me includes finding various items around the store and making sure they are ready to be shipped.  I also help merchandise the rest of the store's products in a way that helps sales.  I've learned to be more of a self-starter, how to work in a team, and the value of adhering to a schedule.  The hardest part about this job are the hours and the extreme flexibility of the schedule.  I love what I do, I just wish I could live on the wages I earn there."
good,"I Actually Enjoyed Macy's. I Quit For Personal Reasons. Since It Was My Very First Job, I Learned So Much From Learning How To Use A Cash Register To Explaining The Service Of Customer Values. There Wasn't Really Anything Hard About The Job. The Only Most Tiresome Objective Was Re-Sizing Clothes. Overall, I Had My Pros And Cons."
good,nice people and a great place to work if you are a college student
good,"I work in the fine jewelry department.  A typical day there is waiting on customers, doing all the jewelry counts making sure everything is accounted for. Can be a little confusing if there have been mistakes made during the day."
good,the coworkers are the best they make coming to work enjoyable
good,Great! work environment and good management. The typical day at Macy's as a sale beauty advisor is standing on your feet and providing customer service. 
good,easy place to work but the managers can be annoying when they don't have to be. Connie desmond left in February though so its probably a whole lot better now.
good,This company is very productive when it comes to selling merchandise. Either in sales or making the floors look better with the teams and making the merchandise stand out. Putting the best deals out there in strong effective merchandising and customer service. It takes all teams to make the selling floor look its best. The visual team goes over and above what needs to be done in order to make everyday count with finishing each project to its fullest. The hardest part is having the same knowledge of other team players and always being at least on the same page. Because the way directions change you always must be ahead or on top of what to do next and always stay busy.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"helped customers with sales questions stocked floor, and balanced cash register"
good,"fast, always learning something new, management that listens"
good,- meet a lot of interesting people
good,"I believe that Macys is a nice place to work in, but as for its benefits they are some what typical. Although my co-workers are sometimes helpful and sometimes a pain they can be helpful in most situations. I enjoy the managers stupendous leadership!"
good,I've learned that working with people is just as important as accomplishing business goals.
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's especially being the first to see the new fashion helping the customers and enjoying co workers and don't forget the sales the best ever
good,"At this particular job I've held 3 different titles, I've worked in Fragrance, I was also a sales associate and then I switched to a merchandise handler, but I must say that selling fragrance was my favorite, but due to lack of communication and the fact that most of my co-workers were NOT nice and always competitive.. THIS made me not enjoy my job anymore"
good,"Working at Macy's can be fun at times. I've learned a lot about the business since working with this company and the hardest part of my job is the people, working alongside so many different personalities was very challenging still is but it help me to grow as well."
good,"My immediate supervisor was very knowledgeable and my assistant supervisor trained me very well.  All store managers were very helpful."
good,Macy's offers plenty of opportunities for advancement. Even if you do not inquire about it the leadership is always looking for an opportunity to coach/mentor you for what you want. Nice family environment.
good,"Eventhough my position was seasonal, working at Macy's drove me crazy. Almost every time I went to work they would always switch me from the department I was working for."
good,"Nice company to work for,I only worked there part time because I was still in high school at the time. Enjoyed working with the people there,management team was nice"
good,"My Review Summary sorts it out, if any more confusion is going about it, try the job out to find whether it’s hood or has consistently problems without any changes."
good,"For the most part, this job is pretty fast paced. If there are no customers buying at the moment, there is always something else to do. I personally liked this, although it is pretty physically demanding to be on your feet all day. I learned about how to help customers be happy, and how to help better the company at the same time. Management is enthusiastic and wants to help. I loved my managers. The culture is great, and the hardest part of the job was the long hours on my feet. There were consistent breaks, and i enjoyed working with my managers and the main manager."
good,In all honesty the culture for Macy's needs to change and the business needs to do a better job at adapting to customer desires especially within big ticket.
good,"Flexible hours,  good pay and the managers worked with you and cared. Good team work. Nice relaxing environment. I met a lot of nice people and made some friends while working there."
good,"The things that I enjoy is the people they are supper nice and helpful. The managers will help so much they work with you, if you need something they will be there to guide you."
good,"Lovely place big safe, and very busy m, discounts and savings, but just too many questions and directions to give, many tourists need assistance but overall is great great management"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,We begin the days with meeting and warmups. We stretch and talk about what were walking on the floor to. its a relaxing environment with respectful people. Whilst working at macys I learned leadership and better responsibility. The management stays busy for us so they expect a lot from me and a lot others. The hardest part of the job would be the 12 hours shift. A bit long and strenuous on my feet but the job is easy and enjoyable all together.
good,It’s was ok management is not the best to talk to no one new the right answer to give would just throw you off on other department managers but overall the compensation was great and also the perks
good,Calm but busy work place. The hardest part of the job is keeping your area clean because the customers tend to look a lot and physically mess up organized areas.
good,"I did enjoy certain aspects of retail because at the most I learned patience and hard work. For the most part, I learned how to pay attention to detail."
good,Great customers and great food. Small little lunch spot so it doesn't get to crowded except for holiday season which is the time to get big tips. Short wait time.
good,I loved the early 5 am shift and the fact that someone was always willing go around my hours so that could get a second job. I do not however like how the store closed on us
good,It is a nice job for students looking for part time jobs. The managers are very helpful and gentle; they are always saying hi to you and asking you if everything is going fine.
good,"Macys is great as a company, but could do better with management and how they operate business. They're a great company to work for but have a plan B."
good,"early morning clock in, I learned how to operate the hand technology , great customer service, co-workers were ok depending on how there day going . the hardest part of the job was finding the last of any product because it could be anywhere."
good,I loved being able to work in retail. Was a very different environment. A lot of the time it was busy and loud. The management was really good and never had a problem being there.
good,"It's a pretty relaxing environment to work in, if you are in the right area. I wouldn't recommend getting to close to all the employees, because a lot of the co-workers like to gossip."
good,Macy's requires a lot competition with one another. It is a very clean environment. Security is also always on top of their game. Managers and head leaders are also very attentive with helping each other if there is ever a problem .
good,"On a day to day basis I was responsible for checking my section for what was needed, and then I would proceed to stock and organize that area."
good,Everyone got along very well. Management was very laid back but adamant about getting work done on time. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was everyone working together happily to complete all our tasks.
good,As a supervisor I was responsible training and coaching two teams totaling 20 employees. While doing this I was responsible for reporting to my manager daily on numbers and goals that needed to be met. I was in rotation for manager in charge. This lead me to be the main manager of the entire store over 220 employees and assisting over 1000 customers daily if the associates couldn't handle the situation. I was responsible for giving my teams product knowledge of the different clothing coming in and also delegating tasks and making sure they got done. The hardest part of my job was training associates that were 10 years because they were used to one style. The most enjoyable part was the daily rush that was different. No day was ever like the other.
good,Wonderful working environment just not enough pay to maintain a suitable lifestyle
good,great working place and all the people were great also. i loved every one and they all make y feel at home
good,Co workers were very calm and subtle. It was a temporary seasonal work time I had.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day working at Macy's Warehouse for the most part is pretty simple and straight forward. You're on your feet all of the hours that you work and you're constantly walking and moving, performing typical warehouse distributing duties. I learned after my first week of working there that shoes are a very important thing to focus on in a warehouse job being on your feet for such long periods of time. Hiking shoes are definitely recommended. A healthy breakfast, some good lunch, lots and lots of water, and maybe some over the counter fatigue/pain meds are so essential for this job. I learned ESPECIALLY to stretch as OFTEN as possible. Stretch in the morning before arriving, stretch upon arrival, stretch during breaks, and ABSOLUTELY stretch before going to bed after work."
good,"This is the place where I am working, it is my first job and my co-workers are amazing. I have fun there besides the rude customers."
good,"This job is all about style which I loved. Flexible shifts, easy computer systems to learn, on your feel alot, good selling experience here. Christmas time is always nice at Macy's to :)"
good,"Working for Macys was actually one of the jobs that i had i actually liked, I mean holidays where a bust i hated cleaning the fitting rooms because i worked in Juniors department and some days you just wants always sure what you would find in there, But your usual everyday customers that you loved that became ""your client"" you enjoyed  there you enjoyed always helping them out because they where the reason you always came back to work they made hyour job so much easier"
good,I was a sales associate and specialist for 12 years at this company. i had a good time working there with helpful coworkers. macys is the best place to shop.
good,"We had a great team of effective merchandisers. But do to management change, there was a large number of employees who exited the company at the same time."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help and greet customers and them leaving with a smile on there face. The most that I have learn from Macy's is to be very organized.
good,"I had fun at the job while it lasted, however there is not much room to climb the ladder. In other words, many people at the company have been working there for many years, and they're usually selected first in promotion."
good,It's a great job to work at if you want to be in a safe company. They treat their employees well. The department I worked in was not the best department to work in. Other than that it's a great job.
good,"It was my first real job experience and it was very rewarding. I loved the coworkers I worked with, and management was really accommodating. A typical day at work involved organizing items that were out on display and making sure they were organized by size and every item was accounted for, as well as managing the register and helping customers with transactions. The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers that I had the pleasure of working with. They were all so helpful from the beginning and I owe my positive experience at Macy's to them. The hardest part of the job was making sure that when I multitasked, the jobs were done efficiently. Every duty that I was given I did it effectively and well, but because I like to make sure my job has been done well, that might take me more time because I want to make sure the customer is satisfied and that management approves of the job that I was given."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with some awesome people in the workplace of Macy’s, and I know that retail stores are not for me."
good,"Management not always available when needed. Not enough employees to be able to attend to customer needs and keep the sales floors and changing rooms clean and organized."
good,"The company let that you development different skills, at time that you do your work the team work its working all the time for get a good result and goals."
good,Though the job does not pay well and there are no benefits it's a good fit for beginners who need some experience.Fun work place and co-workers are nice.
good,"Nice place to work. People usually are friendly. If you are looking for a great customer service job this would be the perfect job, you work with a lot of customers."
good,enjoy working there get the chance to better my skills in the building maintenace dempartment..good fun envorinment frendly co-workers management was good pay was ok.
good,this really wasn't my type of job. was not used to standing on my feet for long hours of the day. typical day at work was loading items into totes and sending them to the packers. hardest part of the job was being on you feet for a long time.
good,Great place and environment to work in. Great benefits and people to work with.
good,I loved Macys it was just a seasonal contract position. Macy only counted approved Macy credit accounts you opened for customers to save . you can go in the computer and see what openings that have for more hours.
good,grate place to work nice people work there I WORKE PUT BACKE CLOTHES ITS FUN  grate enviorment to work in if tou like working with people
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Hours per day are long and filled with work.  Rewarding when it's busy, but dreadful during slow seasons.  Overall, the department was great and the shoe manager was wonderful, but there were other issues with Macy's that makes it difficult for folks to truly enjoy their work."
good,I love working at because it’s big company and big name also and the management very friendly  I work part time I work very hard  .put we have long brea.
good,Macy's is a very fun work environment for someone who loves fashion products. The one thing is that the flagship Macy's at Herald Square is not competitive with their pay. They are very cheap and pay only between $9-10 per hour. I have worked at retail locations that pay $12 per hour. Besides that the culture in Macy's is very diverse and they promote accepting people despite their differences. You cannot discriminate a customer or a coworker by their appearance and I like that. I love the discounts there. Especially if you love fashion brands when they have the sales you should take advantage. Like I said everything is good about Macy's except the pay.
good,I did a lots of planning events hosting events scheduling answering phones etc it was a good learning experience for a admin
good,Macys is a great company that really helps you understand the meaning behind there magic saying. They teach you the proper tool for customer service that you can take anywhere and any job!
good,Good if you're to going school full time and work here part time. I was a sales person and its is an enjoyable part  time job
good,"These past years working for Macy's has taught me customer service and to speak openly about certain products that will help value their needs. I have also learned how to work with a team to help maintain a stable working environment. I have however, experienced hardships when it came to customer satisfaction. Sometimes the product needed was not available which resulted in the customer buying from a different store or company. The most enjoyable experience working for Macy's was the satisfaction and smiles the customer shows when the right size was available or was just happy for the information given about a certain shoe or jacket. Sometimes even if the product wasn't available, the customer was able to obtain knowledge about other products that he or she has never heard of. The customer had more ideas on what to purchase and more options for certain things."
good,"a typical day at work for me was handling stock ,checking product prices to see if  they're up to date and assisting customers in their shopping needs.during the time that i worked at macys i learned how to work with a team.the management was awesome love the managers they are always willing help.co workers are kind and are very focused on getting the job done.the hardest part of working at macys i would have to say was the overnight it was just so much stock and they had to get put away in limited amount of time but we got it done.i truly did enjoy the time i spent there and the skills that i built while working there."
good,comie in and set up displays for new merchandise. leared abut different companies in clothing and their styles. management was fun and creative. co workers were good to talk to when doing daily work routines. hardest part of the job was holidays and setting up for them. most enjoyable part was knowing i did a great job setting up.
good,you're always learnign something new
good,"Lead Tugger, order picker, lift 70 to 100 pound boxes. haul furniture throughout the ware house. maintained Forklift."
good,Working at Macys you come across a lot of people each in everyday some good some bad but each other person that comes in we as myself try to make them feel right at home I learned so much at this josh leaning about the store in side in out my co workers are very fun to work with yes we have our ups in downs but each of us no how to get the job done the hardest part is tell some body no some people go all the way around the world to come to our store we might not have it at times but we make sure we send them to someone that make have it the most enjoyable part of working at macys is making somebody day onces I do that I no my job is done.
good,This is very good company to work for if you are hard worker and like to stand very long hours. And also like to do. Hands work moving lifting and bending
good,I love it but at the same time it was so hard for us to finish everything on time because we were short on people!!
good,"And everyone is paying for upper managements mistakes. There are no raises, no advanced training due to the fact there is no money available to build their associates."
good,"Working at Macy's was alright, although, they did not give you promised hours. I worked night shift which really got in the way of every day life. Co-workers did not help. Macy's only offered me 12 hour shift which was hard, considering the work I did."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is not knowing what to expect from every customer, rather is putting a smile on a customer's face or making sure you greet the customer once they first walk into the store."
good,"I have been in retail for a while now and the amount of pay is not great. Working nights, weekends and now holidays 10 hours at a time and only making a tad above minimum wage is not what i desire anymore. I feel that We do not get rewarded for all the extras that are being added to our job description daily."
good,Management Sucks . They only care about how many credit card accounts you can open. Hours are always available so that's the only good thing about working there.
good,You were able to go on line and pick up shift yourself you never really had to talk to a manager. On line you call off or pick up a shift and get more hours. It was nice but it wasn't a steady 8-4 weekday shift
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Excellent opportunity to learn sales with goals and small commissions.
good,Macy's overall is a wonderful place to shop. I would not recommend working for the locations in Oklahoma. They have a convoluted way of running things.
good,"The coworkers were fun to work with its just the management there act as if they were in beverly hills . Snooty attitudes all the time when they were new to being managers themselves. The commission was the worst you only get 1% of your sales and your sales goals for the day would rands from $ 1,200 to $ 2,000 in cologne  come on now really? and thats every day. Dress code. i feel like if we sell it wear it. Different departments needs to dress the part of whats they are selling. not over dressed. victorville macy's"
good,There at 6 a.m. immediatly start unloading flat bed and hampers full of new merchandise. Keep things oraganized and clean. Put exra's in the stock room. Make sure all mark downs are done on time.
good,"First being on time, greeting customer""s, and learning about our new products so that we are able to connect with our customer in making a better sale...I have learned alot processing shipment, processing payrolls, etc. My co-worker and I get along very well, were also like family. The hardest part of my job is cleaning up messy store after a holiday sale, but we work together and get through it. Most exciting part is making our goals for the day."
good,"This job pays well, but it can also be very physically demanding for someone as short as I am. Pretty simple, but also walking for 12 hours straight was very painful."
good,Lack of Leadership and collaboration on the VP level has led to to high turn over rates and the inability to attract true potential leaders who want to lead with a collaborative and engaging mindset. Advancement is very difficult with leaders who do not work with their teams to build growth plans and provide visibility with senior executives.
good,"I loved the company and my bosses hated to see me go.  I needed more hours, pay and the advancement. They were not advancing anyone, I need a company I can advance and thrive in."
good,Macy's is a  good place to work part time. Full time I feel like the compensation is not enough for the amount of time and effort that employees put in.
good,"Long hours, can either be so busy you don't have time to think and your shift is over, or it can be so slow that you try to find things to do and it drags.  Overall good pay though."
good,"Macy's was my first job as as a beauty advisor,and I loved it.I would help customers choose a product that would benefit their skin. I interacted with people all day and help them suit what products suits them best.I learned how to work as a team with my co-workers in order to achieve a certain amount of money that the counter had to make."
good,"Receive products from merchant. Scan and inventory product, place anti-theft device in secure location on garment(s). Place items on manikins or display racks; folded neatly according to floor sales plan. Report completed task to supervisor"
good,"Fun place to work, friendly, busy all the time, competive wages, medical and dental denefits, Its a blast working there.  You will always learn alot. Professional"
good,"a typical day at work is very busy, employee don't get what they deserve very low comprensation and benefits. The management are very unorganized"
good,"Associates/Co-workers - You will meet friends along the way. You'll see the good and the bad. You'll see who you get along with, stick with them. And stay away from those ones with nasty attitude."
good,"I actually didn't mind working here. In the beginning there were no issues, but that didn't last long. First, they put you on the schedule on days that you didn't agree to. (If you're seasonal) This is after, you've already worked with them on your schedule anyway. Next, be expected to work your butt off and after seasonal forget about that job. There were people there who constantly slacked off, and did the minimum but somehow still got offered the job once seasonal was up. Which showed me, either the managers didn't pay attention or just didn't care. The manager's seemed to just be there, besides Chad in Men's. He was the nicest, most helpful person. The seasonal managers, which are the people who are usually associates are yeah...some are down to earth. While others, get a little big headed. It's a great company, but that store needs some real help. Your associates need the same respect the customers expect."
good,"The store I worked for in particular was...un-savable. The store had low standards and high expectations. Meaning, they did everything half A**  and expected excellent results. Management  was a joke. All I can say I learned from macy's was how not to run a department store."
good,"the location i worked at was fun because i was able to make good friends with the people i worked with but my enjoyment was short lived! after 7 months of working close to 40 hours every week, they cut me down to 4 hours a week paying me only 8.00 an hour"
good,i did everything from lawn and garden to cleaning bathrooms to painting in and outside the building
good,I was a merchandiser and the pay was terrible. I worked maybe 8 hours a week and was paid min. wage.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I organized clothes, worked with customers, learned to be patient, put merchandise on the floor. i learned how to deal with all different kinds of customers from nice to mean, and how to handle certain situations depending on the customer. Most of my co-workers were easy to get along with and very helpful when i needed it. Hardest thing of the job was staying after hours especially on the holiday's to make sure everything was good to go for the next day. Working at place where you shop makes your job that much easier when using the discount cant complain"
good,use pallat jack unload truck helping co workres after school job work like 2pm to 6pm day weekend off
good,Macys is a great store. Unfortunatly I will be laid off next week in JAN 2013
good,All support staff work together as a team. They always supporting each other and providing a good learning envirnoment. The work is labor intensive and the hours can be long but it is rewarding.
good,"As a sales associate Macy's was a good company. I was only hired as a seasonal sales associate for the young mens, and I got to say during the December and other important holidays the store was packed with people. Some customers are great and some are not, you have to find the balance. I learned a lot about customer service, I learned that it is important to step back and give the respect they are giving, because in the end we just need to get a problem resolved. The hardest part is nothing, the job is easy and with the right training and co-workers you can learn the basics and become a pro. The management is really on the employees case about opening accounts, because that is the reason sales go up. Other than that the company is good to work for that is if you only doing part time, and on schedules that are not during the intense holidays."
good,"This is a great company to work for however,opportunity for advancement is not in my opinion is not priority."
good,The job it’s self is fine it’s just that sometimes They don’t know where to place you the way that management talk to you is a little degrading and when you would ask for help it would take 45 minutes just for somebody to get to you and your customer is already upset
good,"it is good working in macy's. i learnt a lot over here especially how handle people, how to be calm and thankful in worst situation also, how to be multitask er. last but not least how to accept that costumers are always right."
good,"I loved working during Christmas because I had lots of hours. "
good,don't help the seasonal people get full time jobs left me out to dry would of loved to stay with macys they just didn't give me a chance now I had to find another job
good,"Be ready to pick up extra task and stay busy. Very cool place to work, and restocking is the best. Very friendly staff, that is helpful when needed. Just plan ahead when needed a day off or so."
good,"the sales and employee discounts were unbelievable at times.  The management was terrible.  There was no time off even when it snowed, Macy's was the only store open."
good,It would be a good experience if one wants to work in marketing or wants a career in sales and retail. Overall the company is friendly. I enjoyed working there as part of team
good,It is your typical retail work style. The associates are very friendly and there's always time to have fun as well as work. The hardest part of working in receiving is being able to work consistently and work at a face-paced to get things done.
good,"working at Macy's was different than I expected. It wasn't the worst job ever, but the management could be better. for example when you are scheduled for a break and call to be relieved the managers act like you're a pain in the neck..."
good,The products and the pricing of the merchandise at Macy's was great as were the employee discounts.  What was horrible was the managers and the general atmosphere towards temporary holiday help.I was treated with rudeness and sometimes outright contempt.
good,"The magic of Macy's!! Macy's is a great department store to shop in, everyone is told to be so friendly and nice. The customers always come first.That's Macy's main priority."
good,"My opinion on Macy's is that they understood my living situation, also they didn't question it. And the coworkers were friendly to a certain extent."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was great at first until our store management left everything went down hill from managers were not experience enough didnt help out it was always an issue if an associate had to leave or anything with the scheduled month but if it was a manager than it was ok for them its alllllll about favoritism
good,I like working at macys because i get the hours i need to pay my bills. not a stressful place to work at all. Very flexible scheduling.
good,"I loved working for Macy's. "
good,"A typical day at work usually starts with some report running so see if any associate dishonesty has taken place. I learned a lot from the manager that was in charge, from different reports to run to save on time, as well as help with productivity. The hardest part of my job was learning a new building and the cameras and where they are placed. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to mentor and teach my team how to react in certain situations based on past experiences."
good,"Very busy from the time I get there to the time I leave"
good,The most enjoyable part of woking for macys besides my co-workers was the customers and being able to satisfy a new client with my knowledge of the products.
good,"Not enough hours. Rotating days off. Sold jewlery, and accessories."
good,Another day another dollar. I was always on time and worked extra if they needed me to.
good,"Learned quite a bit about cosmetic companies.  I knew about skin care as a nurse working with plastic surgeons, etc. The make- up side was a nice break from the stress of working in operating rooms for many years."
good,I really enjoy working there cause I get to meet a lot of people from  all over the world. Some days we are really busy and some days are very slow be I make the best of it.
good,I enjoyed the flexability of the company and the ability to try out new positions. Breaks and lunches we're not always according to scheduling  avalibility.
good,"as I clock in to work i walk over to my counter make sure things are not out of place . I do stock &  restock the counter, clean , organize and attend to paper work if its not already done. then attend to anyone that may need my help on any product ."
good,I got the hours i needed if i picked up shifts but it’s a lot of work did a little bit of money and the manager side expected so much from you but was not nice at all
good,Got a chance to earn Macy’s money which could be used with discount. Great buy.  Draw against commission which gives the associates incentive to go way and beyond to meet their goals.
good,This position is fun and very fast paced. Extremely busy during the holidays and can be a bit stressful. You get to meet so many wonderful customers and the discounts are nice
good,"Due to company wide downsizing over the past several years, everyone was worried about their jobs.  Managers were not forthcoming enough about the changes taking place and when asked who specifically was the manager of the department I worked in, I got no definitive answer from ANYONE"
good,"As usual there are the coworkers you can't bare to work with, the plus side to that is meeting new people. I really enjoyed talking with the customers and getting to them and helping them find what they were searching for."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys the only thing that I didn't like about working there is that they pressed the issue of getting a Macy card, and a lot of customers I came across either already had one or got denied for one. My manager even threatened to write me up if I didn't get a macy card"
good,"A typical day at work s started early with a team meeting, setting up the register, organizing the department, and making sure that all clients are given the best most personal experience possible              I learned how to support all of my clients with their needs. Even the difficult and stressed ones that no one else was willing or able to."
good,"Great Employees, Hard to get and opportunity to advance! Heavy work on Holiday season . Not so great health benefits and management is short staffed at times."
good,"This job was sales based, so hours were not guaranteed.  This is hard for a person to make a living and feel secure.  Overall the job was fun and easy, just unsecure."
good,It was an interesting first job experience. I made it work and did well. I would return part time but couldn't make a career out of it because there is no advancement abilities.
good,Macy's has a great referral program. I worked as a seasonal hire over the busy holiday season. My team consisted of 5 other seasonal associates and we serviced 4 counters together. Excellent place to work. Great employee discounts.
good,"Worked part time during the holiday season and had a great time working here. "
good,It was a very hard job but I enjoyed it.  Loved working with customers and making them happy.  Hardest part of the job was keeping the fitting rooms picked up.  Learned that customers are messy and I have a healthier appreciation of the hard work that sales associates do.
good,Macy's is a good place to gather experience and a good place to gather the pros and cons on what not to and also what to as sales person. The co-workers at macy's are very nice. The co-workers is always there for you if you need help.
good,greeting customers & excellent customer service. we inspired customers my making a connection with them and demonstrate techniques as well as products.
good,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs."
good,"I resigned my position with Macy's as I was having difficulty hearing in a noisy environment.  I am hearing impaired and require a relatively quiet environment or someone I can go to if I do not hear the question of a customer.  I learned a great deal, my management was compassionate and I enjoyed the day I made the sales quoto."
good,"they pay minimum wages to their new sales employees and have very few career advancement options."
good,"I enjoyed the fast promotion, but there was little room for diversity, lots of favoritism and meeting new employees every week."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's! I didn't have that much experience working in a department store but it was always a dream of mine to work in one. I always dreamed to have more experience working in a department store but never had the opportunity to do so other than working at Macy's. I loved working in that type of environment, working with customers. I was a little nervous working with the customers but I loved it. I organized the shelves and took inventory and assisted the guests. Management was very nice and helpful."
good,It was an okay experience. My location lacked management for a while. Not really a job for advancing people unless your in the right spot or place at the right time. One girl became manager within three months another lady worked their for 6 years and applied for the same position.
good,"The employees at Macy's are the nicest that you will ever find. My supervisor always gave me a directive with ""Please and thank you."""
good,this location at the time was easy going but i know now things have changed a lot with the company.i enjoyed working while i was in school at the time i was there.
good,"The only thing about Macy's is the management team is really bad when it come to talking to your employees, they are very rude and don't really help out when you need them to handle some customers issues. They never answer the phone, you could never find them on the floor when a situation arises. That is the only problem with Macy's management."
good,"I learned what it is like to work in a department store, and the way they educate you so much so you are able to do your best on the floor."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Its a hard job most of the time you standing for hours, that required a lot of energy. its a fun place to work you can develop your communication skill better because you interact with people on a daily basis."
good,Management and co-workers were very helpful. I enjoyed talking with people and showing them the jewelry.
good,I wasn't there very long so I didn't get to experience all Macy's had to offer. My first job and helped me to get out of my shell a little.
good,As an employee for Macy's call center is was a fun working environment. The most enjoyable part was working for a family like environment. The hardest part of the job was that there was no room to grow in the company. I learned many things about working retail.
good,"A typical day at work would be handling customers, retrieving merchandise, ringing up customers purchases, etc."
good,"It was during the holidays so, I can only comment for that time of year. This is a very serious job employer. The job introductory was a good length. You were running all the time I felt. They have a good customer base."
good,"if the work was steady, my feelings would be more positive.  but since macys basically illiminated full time positions, they have adopted the practice of doing as much as possible with the fewest people."
good,Processed orders for customers if something needed to be order online through the store. Stock all returns and unwanted merchandise and did inventory for the Christmas Season. 
good,everyday i got to see and connect with a lot of different people everyday was different some days were busier than others but it was always fun built a good relationship with my coworkers the only challenge was to open macys credit cards for customers but nothing impossible
good,"i learned how to communicate more to other people socially,i do like selling shoes to womens and listen to their stories....hardest part of the job is that you need to finish a certain task before you start working and the problem too is that you need to pick the right or easy ones to find because if you make a mistake you will spend like one hour looking for that and plus you have to make your goals for the day which are sometimes they are also really high and comes the pressure with opening a credit card for a customer too....i do enjoy selling shoes for womens..."
good,"i had alot of different managers or supervisors. i worked at different departments everyday. we had to schedule our work schedule ourselves online. i was seasonal employee. met alot of people, co-workers. learned about different merchandise in departments, sometimes it would be hard to find an item because we werent familiar with the department we would schedule our work. we had to schedule ahead or first to get the department we wanted to work for or else someone else would schedule it for them & would leave whatever was left & would have to work or pick up shift so we can work that day"
good,working at macys was an excellent way to show how the real world moves management sucks hours suck only good thing about working at macys was the facts that you come in contact with alot of different ppl
good,"Macy's is an overall good company. Since i have worked at Macy's i have learned how to better understand the customers needs, during slow and busy days. What i enjoy most about work is knowing that i was able to provide great customer service."
good,At Macys i learned how to assist customers with their clothes and also keep me fashion forward.
good,Great company however relocating is very hard and pay is not adequate for jobs.
good,"It is the biggest standalone department store in the world with tones of history and beautifully designed. Some of the employees are amazing while some are standoffish and rude. Not a unique experience. The pay wasn’t great but hey, it’s retail.  Go work there if you want to push company credit cards all shift because that’s all they are worried about."
good,"Never got really started due to falling I'll. I had to  travel 40+miles.Requiring 10 to12hrs shifts.Didn't have resources  for car, tires and gas etc."
good,"Working in any retail job consists of devoting a lot of time and energy into your job. Luckily, Macy's has a bit of flexibility when it comes to schedules and life outside of work. There is always something to do, and for the most part it's a fun environment if you enjoy being around people."
good,"On a typical 8 hour day, I would average 8,000 steps...in heels. Shoppers want to exploit evey coupon and discount. There is zero respect for sales staff from shoppers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Under managed, employees are asked to do more and more every day. I would guess the average age of the employees is somewhere 40years+/- and most of us are struggling with physical injuries because we can't get help."
good,I enjoyed the customers and helping them. I like the flexibility. The pay could have been better. The employees are very helpful in helping new employees.
good,The company was nice to work for. The only drawback is that don’t have enough hours to go around on the dock. But other than that the company has a lot of nice people.
good,"In the department I worked at, we received the shipments and would deal with the racks of clothes and put the security tags on them and take them up to the correct departments. We also took inventory of the stock rooms. We were on our feet 24/7 on concrete flooring and had one break."
good,"If you do work for Macy's  don't have any opinion's  That your little micky mouse managers Don't Agree with ,keep them to your self,and don't share them with your co-workers either for some of them are in with the mice. Good luck"
good,"Job is pretty easy to do. Working in a team environment is mainly what happens in this company. However, the long hours of 10 hours a day especially doing them overnight does mess up the work and personal life spectrum"
good,"As a relatively new employee, staff has (in general) been quite helpful in teaching computer skills/sale transactions.  Supervisors/Associates tend to be supportive and positive."
good,"A typical day was fussing over sales with other employees and not allowing for people to try and get on your huge sale."
good,Very rude company.  Didnt give that much hours wasn't paying enough money always sending people home if I ever work at Macy's again I would be more at work and getting my money be able to experience more
good,"I liked my department.  i worked in the cosmetic area.  I loved my work there , but the management was not good.  Overall, it was alright.  The managers was not very helpful."
good,I really enjoyed working at Macy's fulfillment. It was fast-paced and fun. I did find out I had a cardboard allergy but overall I would work there again. Lots of differing personalities and had fun working with others. My original manager got let go so my rating on the management would've been higher because she was awful. I never understood why they didn't provide free coffee!
good,The company is good to work for with flexible hours.  The advancement is within store unless no one qualifies for the position.  Working with the public is very interesting when meeting people from other countries.  The company tries to make your day a positive one but it is up to you to do this with a good attitude and smile for the public.
good,I should not be required to do a review you are trying to force me to do somehting I do not want to do I will no longer be using your site peace and I will let others no as well
good,I enjoyed the mobility associated with being a seasonal retail manager during the Christmas season. I was walking around constantly.  Getting an employee discount was definitely a nice benefit.
good,"Laid back, hectic during holiday season. Enjoyable working early before store opened. Worked in men's department sorting garments, pricing, and arranging ties. Not much customer interaction. Spent most of my paycheck there. Hardest part of job was having a customer rummage around and destroy my neatly folded, stacked clothing and locating the changing locations of brands etc.Had to ask for a lot of help finding things during holiday season. management was very nice."
good,Long days yet not enough hours. Added more customer service experience to my resume. The hardest part of the job was all the different smells(fragrance department).
good,A Typical day at work go in work with some Associate and some you can't work around but you do and get you job done then take lunch then go back to work
good,"opening regesters,counting money,ordering product for customers,selling product,knowing about the product i was selling.greeting customers.refilling product,closing at night"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This was just a job to do for the holidays and extra money. Crazy hours, management not the best nor helpful. Discount was ok, nothing exciting. Had to ipen a store credit card."
good,Great place to grow and develop your talents. If you aren't in love with the company or service then this isn't the place for you. Had a ball on black Friday!!!
good,"Love this Job but most people leave a job because of their Manager. This job has everything, people skill, thinking, interactions, problem solving skills, and team building."
good,"They sucker you in, by promising discounts and about the pay. But even working overtime you never see much of that money. So you mind as well not work extra."
good,"Working at Macy's as a Merchandise Recovery Supervisor was a pleasant experience, which enabled me to work with people from all over Westchester County."
good,"I love working for Lancome, their products and their company in general. The only problem comes in reference to Macys. They love to ask for your time but when there is an emergency from the employees side there is a certain reluctance to give in. Management is extremely biased when dealing with employees and will definitely have their favorites whose words will only count. if you have a friendly team then you're walking on water and should appreciate it since competition is rampant."
good,This was a seasonal job so I knew I wasn't going to stay here long. But the customers as well as the coworkers weren't only nice but I actually had fun and loved coming to work. Fast paced but well worth working here again.
good,Macys was very sporadic and the manager at the time was seldom there. Employees did whatever they wanted. I felt very unappreciated. I enjoyed the working atmosphere but other than this I would not work as a sales person within the company again.
good,Like most retail jobs no weekends or holidays off.  My team and coworkers were great and made the time pass quickly on slow days. My manager was great but very overworked. Discounts and Macy Bucks were great and could be combined with sale items.
good,No benefits if you are not full time. The hours suck. The pay is okay. The discounts are great. No career advancements. This job can be hectic but fun
good,"Going into work was always a pleasure. In fact the job title given to my co-workers and i, strongly affected the way that we work together as a team. Coat Check the job title given to me as an Macy's employee required me to retrieve the belongings of my fellow workers that worked throughout the building in Macy's."
good,"Very busy in the department I work. No time to stand around, always busy and always work to do. Good job for a teenager or college student that needs something part time."
good,"The store was disorganized and I had two weeks before a fashion show to organize lady's wear, junior's, woman's, plus sizes, kids, evening wear and intimates. There was no store manager so it was up to me on how to organize the store. Needless to say, I was praised by district management"
good,there's never a hard part with working at lgstx only cause I loved my job and the length of time I was there showed  .typical day at work helping others training loading and unloading trucks
good,"Great job, learned a lot. Would of stayed with company if I wasn't laid off. Morale was never an issue, management made it worth the while to return to work daily"
good,"Loaded multiple trucks thru out the morning about 6 tractor trailers "
good,"Macy's trains you for any job by making you work long hours, in any and every department, and managing employees without the title. It doesn't matter how long you've been there, your job is in jeopardy every day and every hour. Also, management will say they care about you, but they don't. My best advice is to show up on time, do your job, don't offer more, don't do less, and clock out. It's best to not learn everything because they will use you and not play you. Holiday season you will be on the clock for 16 hrs and don't dare try to take a break, because Loss Prevention will find you and you will be fired. GOOD LUCK!"
good,"Right spot for college students, good flexible schedules, opportunity to earn more over time though, no job security. Little room for advancement (promotion)"
good,"Nice work enviroment,  but short staffed in certain  departments.      Many customer complaints because not enough help."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Although sometimes unfair, the managers are able to work hand in hand with associates to fulfill their work, school, and misc. schedules. Sometimes PTO is 'unavailable', which is incredibly irresponsible, unfair, and unprofessional."
good,customer service is always the number one priority and looking your best is too. they didn't really care about its associates just making goal every day.
good,"My typical day started with opening up 6 point of sale systems, checking dressing rooms, and then staying busy helping customers. You have to learn the ways of Macy Magic and work very hard to get exactly what your customer is looking for in an item. Hourly checks of the dressing room along with cleaning those out and putting the clothes back on the shelf. Making sure that you checking on customers very often. Holds have to be checked daily and put back when they expire. At the end of the day you need to make sure every hour of the dressing room sheet is signed, clean your area, and closing point of sale system down to 1. Make sure to wear extremely comfortable shoes your legs will thank you."
good,"Mays is a good job if u are retired or a younger person but it's nothe good for a full time job because they just don't pay enough, my manager was just mean to all of us but I loved making people happy and I was glad I can talk to and make customers happy to have had very good customer service. I biggest issue was the 9$ a hour"
good,"overall the job taught me allot about multi tasking and doing the job of cashier, sales associate, supervisor, security and more. which has molded me into the worker that dose not need super vision."
good,"Overall work experience working for Macy's was not positive. The Company in my opinion, did not and will not value the hard work, dedication, loyalty, and extra long hours that there employees put in on a daily basis."
good,"You can do all the best you can, but it is never noticed.  the teamwork among workers is not seen by management or supervisors. But would welcome the opportunity to work there again."
good,I was hired at macys not too shortly after applying for the seasonal position . the pay is great around the holidays but the works days are slow if there isnt alot of business
good,The job was high paced and the co-workers were good at team work. Very little room for advancement and no recognition for your hard work as an employee.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and answering their questions.  It helped that I could work in different areas of the store, ready to wear, men's, home goods and jewelry."
good,A typical day at work would be just coming in and getting right to work. Even though it was my first time working in Retail I actually learned a lot like how each departments work and what needs to be done in each department. The managers were very nice and understandable. My co-workers were nice also they made me feel welcome and help me with anything I needed help with. I don't think anything was really hard I'm a quick learner so I catch on pretty fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was just learning everyday like I learn something literally everyday.
good,"Worked part-time there, co-workers were great, as well as supervisor. Pay was not that great. Nothing more to add here."
good,No room for advancement because of seasonal position. Great for a starter job to get customer service sales experience and cash handling experience.
good,"most managers are fine, some are completely lost at how to do their job though and do not understand scheduling and constantly schedule for unavailable times. Overall the job isn't bad though; good discount and general customer service"
good,"the pay is ok. some of the team members can be sneaky to get commission, but all and all its a great place to work. some of the customers become repeat that insist that u and only you assist them, but u also have the customer that u can never please"
good,"Poor scheduling, EXTREMELY POOR PAY. STRESSED OUT...FRUSTRATED...Not a family oriented company. No understanding of illness."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was it kept me on my toes i love a job where i have the option to either work alone or with a team my team leader made us feel comfortable and it made my day go smoothly as possible I've learned that with a team you can agree to disagree but no matter work you have to come together to get the work done
good,Good place to work while pursuing higher education. The schedule swap option is beneficial and greatly appreciated. Got along with everyone in my department well.
good,"working with customer s at a constant basis, also working with vendors. working in the receiving area as well in all store events."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked one the floor in the juniors department for Guess. My job was to train the staff in the juniors department about the Guess product so they would help sell it and I was also responsible for making sure the product was placed in a was that people were drawn to it(merchandising). I really enjoyed this job. When I started Guess only had a small space in a bad location in the juniors department, but within about 3 mounts of me being there I was able to increase sales of the product and I was given a space that was three times the one I started with and in a much better location. Sales were amazing. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to work one-on-one with people and seeing them smile when they walked away with their purchase."
good,This job also allowed to work with a diverse population. Very easy going job. Hardly ever saw management but they never were hard on their employees. We did what we could in order to maintain the departments clean.
good,Great job with very little room to advance. A typical day at work consisted of bringing out merchandise to the sales associates.
good,"Seasonal Job.  Co-workers were nice to work with.  Worked ten hours 4 days a week.  Received certification SP Hi-Reach picker."
good,"To think that a corporation makes their huge profits by paying their employees minimum wage disgusts me.  The fellow employees are, for the most part, friendly and team oriented.  They're all poor, which is sad."
good,Love the job the hunting for people that are shoplifting is such a reawarding feeling. At times the management makes it hard to do the job.
good,Overall it was a great place to work for. I wish that the pay was better.
good,The environment was a average call center didn't have much to offer in way of long term employment
good,"Not enough work hours."
good,"Sales is easy, work is easy. Mgmt. is team oriented. High turnover in employees."
good,Macys is an ok job for part time work and trying to  get on your feet  not a  great career choice.
good,I loved the hard work. It was fun to me unloading the truck and organizing.
good,"Fast paced, meet different people everyday, management were pretty organized, co workers were nice and more than likely were helpful, most enjoyable was that learned to sale on a fast paced and different cultures to deal with"
good,"Working for Macy's was an overall creative and busy job. The atmosphere could have been great, but upper management lacks communication with team members and show know desire to strife for a better understanding of team members that might have workplace concerns."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to shop all day.  The co-workers are very fun and friendly.
good,Management can change frequently and the customers can be difficult however if you are a patient person who wants to start a new career or get a seasonal job this is the place.
good,"Great job to hold while being a student. Became more fluent in sales, increased interpersonal skills "
good,If you can work any time and any day of the week its a good job to have but if you need a consistant work schedule this is not the job for you.
good,Management is not the best but I enjoy assisting customers and helping them navigate the store.
good,"really cant say much was a on call worker, was never ther much"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked in different departments
good,"Great hours! I learned organizational skills, made great commission, and a few good friends. Even though, at the time, the store was poorly managed, I did enjoy working there."
good,Macys is a very fun place to work. There are lots of ways to get Employee discounts and so forth. But the pay sucks . I would recommend this job for a young adult.Someone that needs a temporary gig.
good,"Collected shipments of product, process and display all items, price adjustments, store remodels, mannequins, greeting customers, cash register, anything needed in any department I helped with. I was hired as a Seasonal Employee and finished my work contract there."
good,"I work as a member of the support team, which means I help sign and price Macy's long before it opens. I also help with inventory and truck processing about 2 days a week. Taking the plastic off and security tagging certain clothing."
good,"Worker for macy's improve my customer services skills, it keeps you occupied with work that was the main reason for loving this job and very professional."
good,"It was a great place because you were able to work in different department thought out the store. My managers were easy to talk with about any thing from, I need more hours, im having a conflict with a worker. Im missing hours in my check, etc."
good,Helping the customers with their choice of clothing is ver rewarding. Knowing that you helped and individual with an important wardrobe choice for those special occasions.
good,Loved working there team effort is a big plus worked as a merchandiser early morning crew loved it just wish i could of stayed there but had to let go due to missing a lot of work due to took care of my mother in-law but it is all good experience was very good learned a lot.
good,"After you work at Macy's, you can work retail anywhere. Learned about retail, customer service, sales, and clearance. Learned about brand name vs knockoffs."
good,Its a good company if your new to starting work. The pay is okay but could be better for single parents. Also they could be more flexible for schedules but there isnt really enough hours to get by in life with just one job.
good,Not appropriate. Hostile work environment. It was great in the beginning then I start getting singled out. I would dress business casual and be told I’m being dressing inappropriately. Overall it was bad experience.
good,I worked in Backstage outlet store and the team there is very hardworking and friendly. Atmosphere was mostly fun and the new floor lead is very detailed and concentrated that she influences me to work harder too.
good,I worked 3 years. Very beautiful atmosphere.  Managers and supervisor everyone so good.  Even co workers are really really friendly and helpful. Very good experience.
good,"Poor communication between upper management and in store managers."
good,I enjoy working for Macy's you learn a lot from the company if you are willing to learn I love what I do for the company but I feel that I am not well compensate for the work that I do.
good,"Good basic retail experience at the busiest time of the year. The training was basic and did not include how to use coupons correctly, very brief overview of where everything is located in the store. If you apply it's best to have prior experience because everyone you work with expects you to know things that training failed to teach you."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I didn't like working at Macy's. Very unprofessional and far from being a good work environment. Management very catty and aggressive, often disconnected with the needed of employees."
good,Macy’s is a great entry level jobs if you plan to have a career in sales. The downfall about the company is the starting pay is very low it could be way better.
good,I made it through school with there help! Was never a career just a stepping stone for me to get better! I did a little bit everything there tried to stay busy
good,"when I was working at Macy's I was getting paid every week such as 9.oo/hr working early mornings from 7am-2pm.When I was working there basically I was with the recovery team know as putting the clothes back on the floor, such as taking it out the fitting room sorting them then putting them where they belong . I was such a fast worker/learner in GREAT with the customers they promoted me to the downstairs lead for the most busy season holidays months. I loved working at Macy's but I had to leave because of lack of hours."
good,"I would love to work there again. I would consider relocation. I had a seasonal position. I do not live in the area, so I had to take the bus that was provided from Cumberland, MD. I loved my job, but I lived so far away that it took up all of my time. I was on the bus for about 3 hours each day."
good,Descent job to work at if you need some pocket cash not a very good company to grow within. Not slot of open opportunities and not enough hours. A simple part-time job.
good,"Busy with tasks and aware customers are first. "
good,All about pushing the product  out the door. The low level managers were very nice but upper management was always concerned about making the quota every hour. Many times was sent home for lack of work.
good,"The management is terrible, does not hire more staff even tho it is necessary, schedules almost everyday of the week, understaffed, manager is never around. If work isn’t done, they yell at you even tho manager wasn’t there to tell us what had to be done"
good,I worked as a temporary employee and it was fantastic.  I enjoyed my time at Macy's and would encourage everyone to work at Macy's if they need part time employment.
good,Macy’s the Company has been very good to me. I have unfortunately been in some bad situations in the locations that I have worked in that have prevented my advancement. The lack of training to get you to the next level was also a downside to the stores.
good,"always moving at a fast pace, never stopping until break or lunch. trying to meet your required quota and more. picking orders so they can be shipped in  a timely manner."
good,"When I worked in the fitting room in nonsales recovery it was great fixing up everything I loved it. I had a great manager that took her time to explain things she was tough but fair and I respect her for it. still to this day.  most of the other managers were not that great sad to say and were rude and mean for no good reason."
good,Great place to work and career advancement. career planning. good colleagues and wonderful managers. great culture and training in sales. great benefits
good,"Gray company however over the years they’ve become a revolving door of employees and managers. "
good,Macy's was actually a pretty decent seasonal job. The only negative thing I can really say is that it was nearly a 2 hr drive to get there and back from Clarksville so it took up most of your day. It was a good job though.
good,"managers are like 50/50 you have some really good ones and some very useless ones. Its a stressful place to work because you have to open new accounts, reach sales goals, maintain your area clean and organized and deal with very rude customers. Not worst place to work at if you want to get in and get experience, but for a company that has been around so long they could definitely pay their employees more and treat them better. You are better off working at In n out. They will start you at way more and you get a free burger a day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"In my role I worked in the morning before the store opened."
good,"Always has new goals, incentives, easy to talk with manager and store manager."
good,"Poor compensation package... no incentives... nor benefits... not much for advancement neither... culture breeds camaraderie, though... working relationship with associates,  managers and officers is more personal and very relaxed..."
good,Macys is a nice company to work for new management sucks my recent manager was promoted to another store and my new manager that I had for not even a month that was also a great manager went to another Dept at least with the store.
good,"Macy's provided a fun atmosphere while getting the job done. They noticed your hard work, and gave out great incentives for a job well done. You got first preference on sale items, and it was a pleasure to wait on customers who really appreciated your work. A kind smile always touches me in a special way. It shows appreciation!"
good,"nice place to work for those wanting part time or new to the workforce. The hours you work tend to change depending on demand from customers. If customers don't shop as much, the less hours you'll have. Also you have to be able to stand for long periods of time."
good,If you love helping and interacting with people then this the job for you.  Management wasn't the best but it is still a good place to work if retail is your thing.
good,The culture at Macy's was upbeat and professional.  A team atmosphere was maintained at all times as well as a high emphasis on customer service. Management was supportive.
good,"Needed better pay for all the work you do. Not enough workers, too many demands. Everybody didn't work so sometimes all the work is on one person or when you start, they make you close with little to no help"
good,"The management was unclear. I just stopped getting hours for no reason, It was hard to find out my work schedule. I only worked there for the holidays."
good,"Can be busy at times so if you don't mind standing on your feet all day, you'll be good. Fun environment to work in with nice and friendly associates."
good,"For working in fulfillment it can get pretty busy, once you knew how to package everything correctly (didn’t take long to memorize) it was simple. Downside is your on your feet all day. I’ve worked on the dock just putting security tags on clothes which was super easy. Hours for the dock and fulfillment are not good at all, would only recommend if you have another job. Apply for fulfillment around thanksgiving time your hours should become full time up until New Years."
good,It was an easy place to work at you could easily get lost sometimes and the managers were very helpful and also encouraged you while you worked giving you pointers as well
good,"*Fast pace long hours alot of standing ring out customers a typical sales associate job."
good,"Working, especially over seasonal periods can be challenging. Customers have high stress over completing their shopping tasks and need competent and well-informed sales representatives to give them solid recommendations."
good,This location is the Red Headed Step Child.  It is owned by Macys which goes to their benefit as for still be a up and running location.  It's outdated and has one of the poorest management and their procedures going.  Managers are in their offices and not on the floor until the end of shift and then only to walk around and point out what's left for you to clean up or straigthen up but not when you need them when working with co workers who think their only job is to stand at the register and ring only.
good,Working at Macy's is great if you want it as a part time while in school or working a full time somewhere else. They are very flexible with the schedule which is the biggest plus.
good,"Management is not the best, complains a lot but doesn't do anything to help. You do find some managers worth working for. Employees and some managers do not do their job and causes you to pick up the slack"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is too unstable of a company right now. There are more stores closing and layoffs coming."
good,"Distribution, Cross Train/Work in other departments.  Distribution is what I learned, management was great, culture was rich, hardest part of job is seasonal."
good,My day was very fast paced and always interesting. Being able to meet people from different cultures and help them find their items. Working in sales I had to be people-oriented and very patient.
good,"This company is a fast -paced environment."
good,Fast-paced and fun working environment. Given an opportunity to work her again would create a better understanding of the benefits offered for I was only a seasonal worker
good,I worked in the fine jewelry department for two years. I enjoyed most things about this position except the retail hours and the pay. Macy's needs to step up the hourly pay.
good,"Was a temporary job for the season.  Unloading totes from belt, scanning each item to make sure invoice was correct. Then packing the orders for shipping to customers."
good,When you work at Macy's you have a department to be in but you can walk around the store and bring clothes that belong to other departments back to them. It's a very free place to work. You don't have managers breathhing down your neck
good,A typical day at Macy's was competitive but yet friendly with co-workers. I learned merchandising and promotional skills. Management was fairly okay. All aspects of the job was enjoyable to me.
good,"Macy's provides a fast paced environment with focus on customer satisfaction. The job required attention to detail, merchandise placement, control and display.  The most difficult part of the job is the lack of compensation, various shift hours and long hours of standing."
good,"I enjoy being a merchandiser at Macy's. A typical day at work is very 'on the go' with little time to do anything other than the tasks at hand. The hardest part of the job is having a manager who does not praise me for work well done. I am praised at work, however, only by co-workers and district managers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of doing a good job everyday and completing tasks in a timely manner."
good,I enjoy assisting people and helping them to find merchandise and clothing and shoes to fit the only downfall is everything has to be put back in its place when you're doing retail and a lot of the times most younger people will not do their share of the work
good,The job at Macys center city Philadelphia is a great job to have to meet people from all over the world. The only thing is the long hours and sometimes hours get cut.
good,"If you like working in retail, and you don't need a high salary this will work. coworkers are usually very nice and supportive, management does the best they can with what they got."
good,I enjoyed working at the Macy's in Annapolis Mall. The only thing that needs assistance would be the organization in the store room. The floor is a direct reflection of the back room. IT NEEDS HELP
good,Macys was a learning experience especially because it was in Jerald Square and mostly tourist. It was a pleasure working for them and it help me break out of my shell.
good,It was an ok job starting out but it got really complicated when school started. It was like working at a warehouse but it was really difficult being the only young person there so it wasn't too much bonding with the co-workers when you're being lectured 90% of the the time working.
good,"I enjoyed my job as a seasonal employee for 2 seasons. After my 2nd season, macys called me and asked me to work full time. I already had a 40 hour week job and did not think I would like doing 2 12 hour days. I accepted the position and loved it. Until management got involved. I was told if I did really great there would be an incentive. I met the challenge and did great. I always picked over 1000 a day and never received the incentive and then was told I misunderstood. They lied, I then put my 2 weeks notice in. I don't like being lied to and then told I misunderstood. What a slap in the face. Management is terrible. I miss the job but not the management."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I like it taught me how to get alone with other people and how to take responsibility with my money and other things to it taught me how to deal with my attitude
good,"Working in cosmetics you are educating clients on skin care and make up application,  Up selling products to reach a higher goal and also being able to give them the best care and look for their skin,  The most enjoyable part of the job was working one on one daily with clients and being able to meet their needs."
good,It was great experience. I learned how to work within a group and they were very supportive of you. They always kept you communicated on new sales and it was great to work one on one with the customers.
good,Busy and fast pace work place. I learned how to multitask. The hardiest part of working here is wearing many job hats and many departments. The most enjoyable part of the job were the incentives and weekly pay.
good,I must admit that my time in Macys Asset Protection was a learning experience. I learned how to properly deal with customers and associates while maintaining a professional look. I learned that by using the tools I learned in the Marine Corps I would be able to teach what I was taught easily so that others can do the job properly. I had to deal with a lot of violent shoplifters and was able to show and teach my team how to properly detain a shoplifter. I was able to communicate with police on what happened during the apprehension and file a report. I was able to learn how to use CCTV and learned how to save and burn footage that was saved from previous apprehensions. I learned the importance of having steps set in place to make sure our job is being done correctly and in a safe manner. I was able to work with new workers who had little to no experience and was able to teach them the importance of their job.
good,"This was a frustrating job. The flow of the warehouse seemed inconsistent which made it difficult to accomplish the assigned tasks. I learned a lot, especially how to operate most of the equipment, which was a plus."
good,"fast paced environmet, i was hired during the holiday season. Competitive job, facilities could be better, and management too. Job security could also improve."
good,You have got to be creative. Good working environment but the challenge is keeping up the Macy's reputation for having quality merchandise. It is not the Marshall Field and the Macy's of old.
good,Here i helped customers with there purchases and any value question they may have. Also replenished the floor or any other items that may need to be restocked from the back.
good,North wales macy's was very unprofessional and lacking in all aspects. Working shoes was unberable and i felt attacked almost everytime i worked there. i wish to never work there again.
good,I would clock in on the register and help customers around the jewelry counter. The management was not competent and HR was rude and not helpful. The coworkers were what made the place enjoyable.
good,I did enjoy working for this company but I felt it was hard to move up because the management team never saw potential in their employees. Senority also means nothing to them so it seems.
good,"busy,long days"
good,"It is a good place to work for a college student because the scheduling is flexible. It is also a great place for retirees to work. At Macy's you learn many valuable skills like time management, giving  great customer service skills, and learning to multitask. The hardest part of the job is not being able to please every customer. The co-workers are great to be around. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a smile on the customers face because I have made their shopping experience memorable."
good,"I am well dependable, reliable great creative entrepreneurship by working people skills along with the motivation work areas, as well mentorship and resloving work prior matters..."
good,"Was a fun place to work, I worked part time during college but was treated as a valued full time employee. T hey provided adequate training and is a great place to work."
good,"Upon arriving you first have to count the drawer making sure everything matches.  If any customers, help them with what they were looking for.  Also had to keep my section of the store clean and organized."
good,It's a decent place to work. You have coworkers who steal your sales and you end up with the short hand of the stick because you didn't make your sale goal . If you don't get a customer to open up a Macys account they harass you until you do. One week you'll have no hours and the next they'll throw them on there without telling you
good,"typical day:"
good,"fun place to work, customers can be difficult. management is not that good. i love working with the customers, and my co-workers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Although the co-workers were excellent and management was approachable and professional, the hours were far too intermittent and inconsistent."
good,My experience at macys has had its ups and downs. The overall job security is great as well as the pto/sick time benefits. The downs are the opportunity for growth within the company.
good,"Macy's is a industry giant and customer-oriented company. The departments offer many challenging opportunities to improve customer support and product knowledge. Everyone is friendly and the workplace is easy-going and not very stressful compared to other companies."
good,"Nice people to work with. Flexible hours. Job basically focus on sales, recruiting, sales goals, inventory, planning for events, calling customers, open charges. Pretty self sufficient."
good,A typical day at work would be clocking in then seeing your schedule on a list that shows the tasks you are supposed to do that day. I have learned to work in a fast and accurate working environment. Being able to work efficiently under pressure during the busiest days.
good,I like that as a part-timer you can choose up to how many hours you would like to work that week. They are really flexible with your schedule.
good,"Many think due to the way we dress we are paid well, we are not. A lot of emphasis is put on opening up cards, but this day in age people are not fools you can't force customers to open a credit card if they don't want to. I worked there for almost 2 years and neither I or fellow peers (some worked longer) received an increase in wage. I found it odd that during the holiday seasons, there was a surplus of untrained employees that needed help or assistance but were getting paid more than me. The schedules online are convenient for college students and part-time workers they are flexible with that. However, their attendance system is faulty, I was fired due to calling out on a sale day but had attendance credits which were disregarded."
good,"it was nice to work with Macy""s i have learned a lot while working in macy's which definitely helps me to build confidence in me to deals with customers ."
good,"On atypical day i would get to work clean make up brushes, open registers and get ready for customers. I learned to how to multitask in a fast pace environment, also how to effectively serve foreigners despite our language barriers. The hardest part was closing a sale. However the most rewarding part was seeing women completely happy with their new make up/ new look ."
good,Management and employees have a good idea what customer needs are. Building and maintaining a relationship with clients and employees while providing excellent customer service is priority.
good,Great place to work but it's very physical and there is no work life balance. You are required to sell people credit cards and I don't like being that pushy. It's okay to offer but credit in general is a difficult thing for most people to manage.
good,"Catered to the needs of the customers by performing tasks such as answering phone calls, tiding up clothing floor, ringing out customers when ready to check out, cleaning fitting rooms and putting away clothes left inside, helping customers find certain items they were looking for, and closing down registers at the end of the day."
good,"Good job for your first job, no experience was required. Learned how to use a register within a week. People are friendly."
good,"loved working there, unfortunately the way they make there schedules, or lack there of was terrible. co workers were great and the days were long but it was never a problem."
good,I liked working here..people were nice. my associates were very helpful when I had questions. The customers loved the store and were mostly regulars.
good,"A typical day at work is to greet and assist customers."
good,"Fun environment, space to work around and create a more individualized schedule."
good,"Despite the lack of magerial support the job was overall good. "
good,"My Team Is Amazing ,But In Need Of Better Management "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work would be counting cash drawer, performing daily shoe audit, dusting and cleaning. I learned about product knowledge and how to audit shoes. Management was easy to talk to and get along with. I enjoyed my co-workers. They made the job fun and helped when I didn't understand something. The hardest part of my job was keeping the back room where all the shoes were kept clean and orderly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the holidays."
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for, everyone has an opinon"
good,i enjoy working with the older peoples the best group of peoples to work with.
good,I loved the job for being able to bring people out of there shells.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's but being an on call agent, I was usually not able to get anymore than ten to fifteen hours per week."
good,"I didn't work here long, it was just seasonal. I enjoyed the time there and would have liked to stay, but I wasn't needed."
good,A typical day working at Macys was exciting.  I was able to meet people from all over the world.  Although it was only a seasonal postion I enjoyed working with my coworkers and management.
good,Macy's is a good place to work but the benefits are awful and pay compensation is very low compared to other corporate businesses.
good,Sometimes you can't get help or too much help from co-workers.  Almost everyone acts afraid of the system.  I understand that you have to follow the Macy's MAGIC but make sure when you show it working here it's not robotic.  Meaning be yourself but stay professional.
good,"A typical day at work would include going to your designated department, finding out if you have a duties for the day, and immediately help customers. I also am responsible for cleaning the sales floor, fitting room, the back counter and also putting back all the clothes that were pulled. I have learned that you must always be on the move in retail, the environment is fast paced. I enjoy all of my co-workers and management."
good,"Stacking, Folding, Fixing displays, Building & breaking down of Displays, Carry out orders, and Restocking Merch"
good,Macys is a fun place to work but they are more interested in how things look rather then how they work.
good,"Weekends are a MUST to work there, especially working for commission. Customer Service and multitasking with several people is mandatory. Macy's is MAGIC!  "
good,Fun Place to work and be established with. But wish they had more growth advancement with the company.
good,Great people to work with but company couldn't provide stable scheduling.
good,"typical day at work, clocking in going tothe backroom getting things situated then getting on sales floor with the customers. ive learmned to ask about a job title before i take it. my coworkers are very friendly and fun. the hardest part is maintaing multiple people at a time. the best part is the customers."
good,I really like waiting on customers and discussing their needs for shopping that day. Coworkers are very easy to get along with and help eachother as needed.
good,"I learned how to deal with people in difficult situations, How to manage my time at work and stay organized.I enjoyed every moment of my time spent at macys when i worked for the company twice seasonal."
good,It was nice to be able to work around my school and kids' schedules. The pay was decent.

good,"Macy's is a good company, just very hard to move up and benefits are not motivating."
good,"Enjoyed working with people, the woman training was great person. I developed great relationships there and still have them"
good,"this job was a fast past job keeps you busy and on your toes, i get to work with alot different people that became good friends. the employee and employers where very."
good,I have to say that being an employee of Macy's
good,a typical day at work would consist of me either being the cahier in my department or the floor manager or i would have to move to another depeartment such as the polo club to help the workers in that area
good,answering inbound calls
good,"A typical day at Macys is every employee being constantly on the move. There's no such thing as ""There is nothing to do.."" because there will always be something for you to do. Its so fast paced that they have a contest called ""The biggest Loser"", where employees have the choice to participate in a weight loss competition. Who ever loses the most weight will win a prize. It encourages those who needs to shed a few pounds while working. I didn't participate in the competition but I, myself, lost a good 20 pounds while I was working there."
good,"I worked at Macy's Herald Square for 2 years. I worked for a wonderful woman who was the Senior VP of Fragrances for the East Coast. After a time, I was assigned an additional VP to assist. My typical day is described in my resume."
good,it was really busy but i had some nice co-workers
good,It is a very nice place to work if you have a flexible schedule. Overall the management staff is very friendly and easy to talk to.
good,Macy's is a great workplace for college students
good,"Atypical day at work was helping costumers find what they were looking for and help make them comfterble with their choices, I leaned how to use the register with no problems at all, my workers were very nice and easily to get along with, the hardest part of my job was closing the register at night some times, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the costumers."
good,At the time I was a college student and only worked at Macy's during the Christmas holiday.
good,"As soon as i check on there is a customer waiting to be helped. Between customers I'm taking clothes back to the right department. I am constantly tidying up my work space. When there is something that i am not familiar with, management is just a phone call away. I have learned the different keys on the cash register, computerized since the last time i was on one. For the most part, my coworkers are helpful. The hardest part of the job is meeting the sales quota"
good,I work in the Ladies Shoe Department. This gives me a chance to sell shoes and meet new people. The co-workers I have are like family. The hardest part is when the item a customer wants is not in stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing that a customer is happy with their purchase.
good,I had a good time working for this company. The staff was very friendly and I got the chances to work with various types of people and personalities.
good,"I enjoyed working here. The work flex was a pro, however with the retail environment we currently live in, it was unnerving at times as to what positions would remain."
good,I have enjoyed and grown as an employee from every roll I have had within the company. I love the new found rejuvenation and direction the company is headed!
good,The hours in the department I'm in suck and make it almost impossible to pay bills but the people I work with are absolutely amazing to work with. My immediate boss can be difficult though.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,seasonal work is great if you're looking for extra cash. it's an easy job. i Recommend. nice place to work. the pay is not great...................................
good,My job just consist of me being a cashier. Handling anything In my department. Sometimes I was in different departments. Just made sure the customers found what they wanted. Also promote our sales and new merchandise
good,if you have never had a job before this place is a good starter great training and not so fast paced but not too slow so that the day drags on and on. I enjoyed working here if they had more hours i would of stayed but as soon as i stopped getting at least 20 hour per week i had to find new employment. I would totally go back but only as a manager or as corporate.
good,"Overall, a fun experience working in makeup. Had great customer interactions, got to know co-workers on a personal level during down times. Management, however, was not as friendly."
good,"Long hours and variable work schedule. Scheduled were typically done a week in advance however they could be done the day before (as needed). Not a difficult job, but could get boring at times. Lots of display set up and maintenance as well as customer interaction. The holidays are crazy at Macy’s, but the extra cash is welcome during this time of year."
good,"As a creative person, I would like to see Macy's become more creative with their marketing materials. It seem like sometimes Macy's play too safe with their marketing materials."
good,Personally I would like to get paid the same amount of work the job provides. There was a lot of standing which isn’t too bad and the breaks were reasonable but I didn’t get to choose enough hours for myself.
good,"Although I did not hate working at Macy's it was not a rewarding job. Retail can be stressful and seemed as if days would drag on, cleaning was the worst part of the job as well as the mandatory unpaid breaks."
good,"While employed at Macys, my job title was customer service representative. A typical day was customer service and sales in a high pace retail store enviornment."
good,It can be a nice place to work but it is not a enjoyable environment sometimes. I enjoy the event days but there are often days where the days drag on and feels like the time there is not worth it.
good,"Other positions in the company had many opportunity for advancement, if you put in your time.  Although it seemed as though the management positions were only available through relocation.  "
good,"Very busy during the holiday season. Discounts provided to employees are very good. I was able to use to purchase gifts for Christmas."
good,"Performed various duties, including register open/close, online order fulfillment, stocking, recovery, inventory adjustments, customer assistance, checking out sales, credit applications ordering on line for customers and monitoring activities for loss prevention."
good,Typical day starts early. Going over inventory and cash register. Friendly staff and management. Hectic schedule. Long hours. The most exciting part of the job was the morning meetings where the goals for the day are set.
good,It was a fun place to work at for a seasonal job. I'd do it again. Wish they kept me or told us ahead of time when they'd start letting us go for sure.
good,Do wish that they pay more to the ones who do more physical work. Have incentives to those who do outstanding job. Meet great co-workers during my time at Macys.
good,"This is an nice place to work, but without the proper staffing and lack of training and tools, it made it difficult at times. once newer equipment came in, there was really no need for the amount of technicians we had or so we thought. every year during the holidays we were tasked with setting up various department s that don't necessarily get set up in a branch store. for example, Santa Land, Macy's Flower Show, Holiday Lane, Christmas Hiring training room set up for 80+ associates. just to name a few..."
good,The job was ok but management suck to many chiefs and not enough Indians. The hours really suck and the pay isn't good either. If they pay a little more I would of stayed.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The job is easy and fun. There is great people to work. Can be a competitive job depending on the people you work with but it can also be a great and friendly environment just learn how to pick your battles.
good,"I loved working there. Just wasn't cool that they let everyone go on 3rd shift graveyard shift at the very last minutes without any warning. Overall, I love the job and working there with people who made you feel like family."
good,don't have much to say. Easy work environment. not that different from any retail job. all retail jobs kinda suck. i worked in fragrances so its nice to go home smelling nice
good,"This is a job that if you’re looking to make quick money as a part time position it’s good. But if you are hired for full time and only getting 28-32 hours a week, it’s technically still part time. Their full time  hours and part time hours are made for younger people with barely any bills to pay."
good,"Macy’s was seasonal job I go every year around Christmas time to get extra money. "
good,Working at Macy's taught me a lot of customer care services. A typical day at Macy's would consist of many happy easy going customers and also many rude customers only looking for a discount. You cannot offer discounts that the company is not offering which was hard to keep all customers happy all the time.
good,It's a great place to work for side money. Holidays its busy . Very good managers . pay isn't enough to live off of and not enough hours. No benefits for part time employees
good,"Typical day would start out making sure Visual displays and Promotional Displays are set properly and correctly."
good,"Working at Macys gives you flexability with your schedule, although nights, weekends and holidays are a must.  If you are a hard worker there is great opportunity to advance.  Working in management is where you make better money.  Associates start off at minimum wage and raises are not great.  You need to have great customer service skills, and enjoy retail to make a career at Macy's.  I met some of the best  people working there, and if my store did not close I would still be with the company."
good,"A seasonal job: exacting pace; great from interaction with many types of clients/customers, who were from all over the globe; pleasant environment; enjoyed the many co-workers and the cooperation of the team."
good,"Working in cosmetics is fun, but my overall experience at Macy's has been mediocre at best. It is not a place where you can hope to advance, many positions do get cut, leaving the current employees left to carry on short-staffed. The company does have a very useful online system for employees to see schedules, benefits, and paychecks."
good,"Macy's can be a fun, active place to work with great people in a busy but productive environment. Great retail experience, the work hours can be flexible and the other employees are nice and welcoming."
good,"Every day was different, every customer was different. That's what I enjoyed most, adapting and handing any challenge presented to me. The hardest part was probably doing the twice yearly ""Gift with Purchase"" events at the counters. High goals, very hard to hit, also we did achieve them more often than not, and there was no better feeling!"
good,Learning the different department of selling and earning point. Displaying the merchandises for customer to make their selections and assisting them with their choices. The morning meetings before going to your assigned duties for the day and overall review of sales the day before.
good,"I worked 2nd shift and that's always a plus for me. the work environment was pleasant. lots of people from around the world. "
good,"On a typically average day/night I would clock in, then proceed to sign in and be directed to my station or department for the shift, I would then begin my preparation for the tougher, bigger, and more IMPORTANT orders. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is getting used to the hours as I worked the graveyard shift, and at the same time the best part of the job again in my opinion is the HOURS, since I can only work nights or graveyard shifts due to childcare issues and at this job it's not an issue because the hours are perfect for my schedule!!"
good,"process items unloaded truck on days that trucks come in pack and deliver stuff,collect stuff, help other coworkers when there is only one truck this job sucks for hours"
good,"Working at Macy's was an interesting and a valuable experience. In general it wasnt much different than any other Job ive ever had. Some ups, some downs."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,All I have is positive things about the company. I worked with good people and it is just one big happy family down there. They make you feel comfortable.
good,"Macy's is good for a part-time job, because you can not make a living of $9.00 an hour. I started as a seasonal employee and decided to stay hoping they would give me a raise. I have worked in almost all the department and also learned so much."
good,"Great place for seasonal employment.  Large facility minimal workforce. Stable employment. Corporate hardships, economy,  cyber shopping. Store closings."
good,It is a corporate environment with a retail mentality. They pay below what the position should be paid. They have been eliminating positions from upper management down so there is very little room for advancement and the potential of having your position eliminated grows every year.
good,Its big and you have to work really fast to ship the stuff out in time have to be on time or they make you go home you have to take off all your jewelry
good,Seasonal hours I worked go in @ 5pm - 3am. Some days I went in @ 4pm. So we worked 4/10s even doing 2 days of O/T.  Had to pick @ least 1000 items nit
good,"Good place to learn customer service, but can get stressful when it’s busy. There’s  a lot of deals and promotions you need to remember and always ask customers about"
good,Was an exciting fast paced job. Great way to see people who decide to do the wrong thing and try and take merchandise from the store and going after them.
good,Macys gave me an oppurtunity to use my education and expertise in my field. I learned alot from my manager who had so much experience in this field. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Hoping that i will continue doing what i love.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's and was disheartened when sales manager positions were cut.  If not, I would still be there.  The fast pace was great.  With staffing cuts it was frustrating to all associates that more was expected from less staff.  You have the opportunity to develop great relationships with coworkers and customers."
good,Macy's was a good work environment. everybody got along well. the hardest part of the job was recovering the store during  closing shift. management was decent. They we hard workers that didn't just sit back and was the employees slave. THEY GOT THEIR HANDS DIRTY TOO
good,"Managers, mentors and trainers that are equipped to coach, inspire and bring out the best in their people. Long job hours but the people working there make it easy"
good,I enjoyed working with the employees I was placed with. Merchandiser are assigned one floor of the store along with three or four others employees and are to report to a floor manager.
good,"I enjoyed working here, although the store manage was always on vacation and I couldnt always make it to work on time because of my car troubles. Which is why I needed to find somewhere to work near my house."
good,"its a nice job to work at,i worked in recovery and it was a lot of work to do, doing go backs and walking around the store with a heavy rack is tiring. everyone is nice and helpful, management could be better. a typical day at work would be having to go and sort clothing and do the go backs after and when there isnt any go back racks left, you start recovering the floor and fix tables."
good,"Macy's is a decent job for a newly employed person, or someone who just needs a flexible or second job. It's easy to get hired. It pays slightly higher than minimum wage, and you can basically choose your schedule. There's a website where you can pick up any open shifts you want within the store in most departments, and even advertise your shifts without manager approval. "
good,Macy's provided an opportunity to provide service to customers with a vast selection of high quality merchandise as well as face to face interaction each day.
good,"I work on the start team. I usually worked from 6-1:30. I would complete markdowns, set the sale, place merchandise. My manger was nice to work with, but she is very overwhelmed. Work place culture was friendly. I really enjoy working a Macys. The hardest part of the job was being held accountable for things that were out of my control. For example being expected to complete tasks and not having other scheduled employees show up to work to help. Most enjoyable part of the job is working early morning shifts and getting off at 1:30 in the afternoon."
good,"Macy's was a seasonal position. We would have morning huddle before store opened. Once clocked in, you are given a dollar amount sales goal to reach for the day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Although I enjoy being here, I also know I can't be here forever. I enjoy the people I work with l; I've established great friendships here but at the end of the day, we are just here to make money. A typical day at work varies on who is in for the day."
good,"Provides competitive pay for sales associate positions. "
good,"Macy's can be a great place to start your career, but management in stores should improved. There are plenty of unqualified employees on the floor and they won't care about your growth within the company neither will help. Overall I had a great experience."
good,"It is a great place to work but like all retail, the holidays kill. Expect long holiday hours, and general craziness when it comes to black Friday. If you travel for the holidays I do not recommend this place as a job for you, working is required."
good,What I mostly enjoyed at Macy's was the discounts. You could always find something in Macy's. I just didn't like when we were under staffed. I've learned a lot working with them.
good,"This job had the potential to be promising, however the store closure devastated many. I learned nothing lasts forever and everything isn't always as it appears. The management was not forth coming regarding the status of business. There actually wasn't anything hard about this job except parting ways. The customer's were definitely  the best part of working with company."
good,"Assisted the general managers, along with other merchandise support staff, to provide a smooth transition of merchandise and flow for the store; in addition to this replenishing the general store of products that have recently been received, sold or require to be returned to the vendor.  Also provide manual support to the other merchandise support staff, along with helping in the smooth operations of the store sales associates."
good,"I cleaned the store, and helped customers. I was sometimes a stressful job because I was working long hours, but the pay was great and so were the people."
good,"I like working for Macy's but the hours are not promised and i could not provide for my family on 20 hours a week. The people are friendly,my hours were great,jus didn't like working major holidays"
good,"Working at Macy's can sure help you meet a lot of people. due to it being a large department store, it is sometimes hard to get a hold of a situation right away"
good,Loved the atmosphere and people i dealt with...very professional and loved the commission that was offered being a connect specialist. Lots of room for growth within.
good,horrible management always forcing to sale credit but good hardworking coworkers. Lots of customers go through several businesses nearby is a plus. Parking sucks
good,This is a great company for diversity.  I was part time but when the schedule was posted there was always a ton of shifts you could pick up so I always had at least 30 hours a week.
good,"The employees and management were very friendly and understanding. They worked well with your schedule preferences. The security was very poor, and rude."
good,Depends who you work with that's could make the job good or bad some people just gossip while others actually do the work they are supposed to do and it can be easy to move up
good,"I worked in woman shoes, the woman in that department are strong willed . To make it in the department you have to be a strong willed, driven person."
good,"My experience was  brief at Macys . I found it to be an easy environment to work in and i think they value their customers and employees equally. The hours could be demanding and some departments are more hectic than others. I enjoyed to work in the jewelry department  and liked less clothing departments such as children and sports for example. Nevertheless, if you work as seasonal, they shift you to various departments as each one fluctuates daily  based on its needs throughout the whole operation. ."
good,"I learned the operation of electronic cash registers, registering sale transactions, opening and closing.  There was emphasis on dealing with customers, relations and communication.  Communicating and "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's itself is a good employer. Retail industry is really in a tailspin no thanks to online shopping."
good,"working on commissions was not what I wanted "
good,"Not all management remains friendly during holiday season and their stress becomes your stress, felt like I was constantly being watched. Also they expected a lot out of employees because we were so understaffed all the time."
good,"Macys is a fun place to work, I enjoyed stocking the floor with great looking clothing. The only thing I didn't like was I didn't have consistent schedules."
good,"I liked to work for this company however, there was not much advancement, no raises, no compensation. You worked very hard to please the customer in any way. I learned proficient customer service. The pay was very low, but if you like sales and people this is the job for you."
good,Its a very good company in which to advance but it requires allot of dedication and hard work requiring many hours of overtime.
good,"A decent seasonal position with the opportunity to rack up hours and overtime. Management was alright, most coworkers were full of it."
good,Better if Macy's can provide all trainers the true decision of them. I think all people need and wish to know the trusted clue of what they gonna be after training.
good,"My experience was fair. There were more negatives than positives. The work, I really enjoyed. During holiday season, a typical day is very busy. No down time (which is a good thing). The most enjoyable part of this job (for me) is recovering the sales floor. Refolding clothes, fixing tables and fixtures."
good,"I was a seasonal worker, i folded clothiers and was also a cashier, during the holiday season they were always busy, the hors were also very flexible."
good,"I Answer customers' questions, provide information on procedures and/or policies; bag merchandise, scan, compute and record total of transactions using electronic cash register; count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change; establish and identify price on goods, greet customers entering self-service store; issue receipts, refunds and credits."
good,"Macys is a wonderful learning company. In a typical day there isn't much to do, you help the customers, clean up the floor from any mess, and fix any items that are misplaced. I learned a lot about different kinds of people, some are great with others and interactions but some people don't know how to approach others. I've only noticed that some people don't know how to approach others or talk to them in management. Some of the managers don't know how to properly address certain situations, which is a huge downfall. The hardest part of the job is just being able to put up walls towards the awful things some people say when they are angry and upset, obviously this is not directed at you personally. The most enjoyable part of this job is honestly the amazing people that you work with. They are amazing people and that is one thing that Macy's does well. They make sure to hire the most genuine people around, all of which have many different personalities. It's an amazing company and will offer amazing opportunities."
good,"The job provided a flexible work schedule, social interaction with customers, and talented and creative co-workers."
good,"A regular day is very unpredictable the work can go up and down withing a matter of minutes, but over all its a fairly easy place to work for."
good,Just wish it didn't have so much drama and it paid more for the more you learn different stuff and not move you so much. And if they moved you into other places to different jobs they pay you more for that job.
good,"I discounted merchandise and moved items from one area to another, I liked my job but I was on call only. I didnt do anything else"
good,"I was trained as a seasonal sales associate very quickly so I could join others on the sales floor. I learned how to use the register, cash and credit card transactions, up sell, recovery, fulfill online orders, and build relationships with customers. "
good,"This was Seasonal work over the holidays. Was offered a permanent position which turned out to be only 16 hours per week. Clean, pleasant work environment."
good,"Very busy at all times, always places to clean and keep tidy. I learned how to resize watches, i learned different brands of handbags and the significance of each type and brand. Management was pretty much all over the place. Co-workers were awesome always there to lend a hand and always smiling."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was over ll a good store to work at, all the workers were friendly and helpful. I just wish it was easier to be kept on after holidays"
good,"Enjoy being able to get up and move and get involved with projects.  Dealing with customers and there problems if any, all around just pleasing Macy's to get things done."
good,"I have worked at Macys for a few years. It was my first real full time job and I was always beyond excited and happy to be part of the company. I was a sales associate who had to deal with registers, customer service, and stock. I admire my co-workers and we were all a great team. I always enjoyed interacting with others and hated if the customer left unhappy."
good,"It was a good place i had a hard time getting hours and the pay was not that . I learned how to work a cash register, Typical work day assist customers with their needs."
good,Responsible for operation of cash register and processing customer payments. In charge of identifying and solving customer needs.  Involved in store organization and setup of customer displays.
good,"I learned to be a team player and to rely on my intuition and human courtesy. The company has offered me many opportunities to give back to the company, community and society as a whole."
good,"I didn't really like working for Macys,it was boring and a lot of micromanagement. The company invest a lot in their employees so thats a good part of it."
good,I worked for the company twice. I started the second time as a Seasonal Staffing Coordinator for the holidays. The got hired full time as part of the  Administrative Support Team. Macy's had been a good place to work.
good,very chaotic environment . low pay but very social job .management may need a bit of tweaking. the most enjoyable part is actually meeting people from different parts of the world
good,"Working for this company showed me the importance of working in a team based environment, learning about different people, and backgrounds. It also showed me the importance of excelling at customer service and how valuable it is to be professional and courteous regardless of the situation."
good,"I have never disliked working here, i love my co-workers and all of my associates, i enjoy coming into work everyday, i come in an leave with a smile on my face everyday"
good,"As a manager, I enjoyed building rapport with my associates and gaining valuable insight within the company. The hardest part of the job was after the holidays when work hours began to slow down."
good,Fast pace environment which I really enjoyed. Worked as seasonal employee so it was a challenge but helped me grow as an employee.
good,"day to day day to day day to day day to day Macys was fun, hectic, lovely, interesting, never dull, a machine, constant, never ending."
good,"I believe macy's is an excellent company to work for. Depending on the field that you are in there are opportunities within the company to advance,"
good,"Very fun and loving place to work, but the managers make a lot of empty promises, as to being kept on the job as a seasonal employee."
good,Work environment is fast-paced; big workload; every department is involved in customer service and sales support; 45min break; full time schedule is up to 39hr/week;
good,in the mornings you go in and open registers and greet incoming customers. Assist them with what they are looking for and in between customers keep work area neat and orderly while also maintaining fitting rooms and put away clothing that has been left in fitting rooms
good,"After setting up, logged into the phone system and waited for the first call of the day.  Various types of calls, International, Bridal. I had to wear all types of hats."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers and meeting customers. It has taught me to be patient and listen more to what the client is asking and saying rather than just me talking.
good,"management is exceptional as well as employees, although their are not many benefits to working for this specific company as well as a low work/life balance"
good,After your probation period managers are willing to work with your schedule to suit your life. Except weekends working are mandatory
good,When I worked for Macy's as a seasonal hire it was fun sometimes but tiring other times.
good,"Maintained updated knowledge of all menu items, specials, liquor brands, beers and non-alcoholic selections. Routinely checked identification of patrons purchasing alcoholic beverages."
good,"unloaded trucks and processed merchandise. helped out with other departments with what they needed. did minor cleaning and moving. got along with everybody there, management was good too. most days were very short so the pay wasnt very good"
good,This was my fist job. It was the most demanding but also the most fun. My cowokers and I were almost like family. Our manger always stressed team work to us.
good,The job is very physical but the team makes the time go by faster. My boss is very down to earth. Most of my co-workers and I try to have fun while we're working.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people from different backgrounds and meeting new customers
good,its okay not enough hours no advancement opportunity only part time
good,"They helped hone me into the sales person I am today. Their sales model and the direction I received at the Eau Claire location really help me push myself to not only look for the sale but to actually HELP the customer find exactly what they are looking for."
good,"Customer service experience and retail department store with various merchandizing.Large cash handling and responsible of opening and closing micro departments inside of the store."
good,You can advance if you work harder than everyone else AND a manager/s can advocate for you. The pay is so low so you have to work doubles and overnights to even feel like you're taking something good home. & they harass you everyday about getting credits which you will also be judged on for an advancement .
good,"A typical work day would depend on everyone's attitudes when they arrived to work. It could be a really good, fun day or it could be dreadful and drawn out. Meeting new people was my favorite part of working here. The hardest part abut working here was doing the job alone."
good,helping customers finding items cleaning dressing rooms and hanging clothes up and on a cash register. always keep a smile on your face and your customers and manage my time better.management was good. good when they come to work wanting to work and not just standing around. my enjoyable part of my day is my customers that come in with a smile and leave with a bigger smile.
good,"Everyday at Macy's brings something new to the table. On a typical day I am assisting customers with purchases, returns and credit card payments. I am also incharge of making sure the department I am assigned to looks presentable and clean for shoppers."
good,Customer service and solving issues with merchandise was the main part of the job.  Working on busy sale days was very challengable.
good,"My very first day I assumed would be a challenge, yet I learned to just be my self."
good,"Ensured invoices were coded correctly and corresponded to the correct Purchase Order including international invoice processing. Paid strong attention to details of invoice processing, research and correction coordination"
good,Reputable company.  Supervisors were always willing to listen and help when needed.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Store manager lacks leadership"
good,I love Macy environment just warm and friendly i learned how to multitask a lot better and build patience.I loved my coworkers were still friends but thee hardest part of the job was the schedules and late hours.the most enjoyable was everyone worked as a team
good,"I loved working for estee, love my customers ,and loved working with people."
good,if you are in school make sure they understand your schedule
good,Strategic organization managed by strong leadership. Provides ability to utilize creative thinking.
good,I Love Loss Prevention but I just wish they offer career advancement for there VSO. I Love what I did and I wont give LP up for nothing. I was good at what I did and wish I could become a DET there and I know I will bring great thing to that company. I was never even give a chance. I made awesome stop and made LP look great.
good,"This is the first position I have had where you had to practically fight for hours by logging in online. This made things difficult. However, I understand that this was necessary for the store due to the vast workforce it employed."
good,I liked working at macy's because it was nice to see when there were good deals were you could use your discount. The managers see you as disposable due to the fact that there are always people getting hired and being fired. The co-workers are extremely fun because they are around your age(college students).
good,"My first day was not what I expected just because they told me I would be walking a lot as a Picker. Didn't really get into picking also until weeks later. I guess I was expiating to do a lot more but maybe because of the volume there wasn't much to do. Management was very helpful with any questions or concerns I had. The hardest part I want to say was seen co-workers go because they were great, specially the team we had in GOH with Steven as our supervisor. I would want to say that was the most enjoyable part, how our team went from three people and just grew as the season went on."
good,"I liked working in Macy's with exception for the exceptionally low pay, but for a college student the pay was decent at the time"
good,it didnt pay enough and i had to go to my second job fulltime because it paid more
good,The stock room at Macy's was a very interactive workplace where everyone on the stock team cooperated in their own way. It wasn't the sales floor environment where two people could not be seen near each other. This is what made the job tolerable.
good,Retail isn't the same anymore. Overall just glad to be employed part time.
good,"co workers are friendly but competitive, mandatory breaks, no over time, pay based on experience."
good,i enjoyed working in the shoe department..the most enjoyable part of the job was trying to outsell other coworkers as well as just meeting your own daily goals. the hardest part of the job is trying to make a living off of the pay.. we worked really hard at that job to bring in the numbers for the store but the pay just wans enough at the end of the day to support the everyday living.
good,Management are very professional to work with and to work for.
good,Macy's was a great place to work in my teens and early twenty's. good environment and decent manager
good,"Some of the managers are awesome, but others are off the wall crazy and mean.  I enjoyed my time there.  Hardest part about the job was cleaning fitting rooms and shoe stockrooms.  Enjoyable part was coworkers and making customers happy with their purchases."
good,I don't have any good or bad thing to say about them it was cool just some of the co-workers sucked worse then others
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys is a good retail store to work for. learn to meet sales goals and to be a good sales person. There Model is All about customer service. Mangement could use some improvement. And the pay could be raised.
good,i enjoyed working with the public and my co workers but over all it just didnt seem like it was going anywhere
good,A typical day included helping customers with their purchases.  Cashiering multiple purchases and/or returns.
good,"Working at Macy's is very fun as you get to meet people from all over the world who have all sorts of things going on. This is a very good place to work for a part time job. I have been with the company for over about 4 or 5 years and this company is always changing. I feel this company could be far more successful in the Chicagoland area if management were more involved with their people working for them. Things are not fully explained to the sales associates and therefore management has one direction and the sales associates have another direction. I feel that this job is not very secure, even though I've been here for almost 5 years. Over the years, and more recently now, associates have been let go of for things we had no idea one could be let go for."
good,"Always had a clean work station to start the day off. Fun and nice co workers of all ages "
good,there was good days at macys they taught me alot of things when it comes to sales associate its a good company with a great reputation. the other employees came their in did they job really good no complaints every customer we had was very satisfied and thankful people we gave them excellent customer service.The most difficult things i had a problem with is when other people didnt show up for work or didnt call in and the mangers didnt say anything to me about it especially if we working in the same area. But other then that macys was a great experience for me i love the customer i helped every customer that i see or greet every customer i see. The most joyful things about the job is coming there doing my job very well in helping the customer with what ever they need help with.
good,"Was always busy , learned how to recover merchandise on sales floor and work with all types of costumers and tourist. Management was decent and coworkers were okay most of them had a ""one for all attitude"". The holidays were the hardest and the easiest was having understanding managers."
good,"The people I work with and have met are diverse and a great group of people. There is quite a bit of turnover in the younger associates, as they move on. I stock handbags, sell them, keep the floor neat, handle all POS transactions, and meet some very nice customers. Our management team is young and energetic. The hardest part of the job are the hours that is a rotation, flex schedule. I enjoy all of the people both associates and customers."
good,"Macy's was great. Coworkers were good, humbling; customers were nice. Great experience working in retail."
good,"enjoyed working here, seasonal work, The store in general needs to be cleaner."
good,"I worked at Macy's seasonal position, the craziest time of the year. As my job as an sales associate i had to put away all the clothes, the managers did not check-up on the sales associate, and when we needed a manager they were not present. Co-workers were as new as i was, but they were friendly."
good,"a typical day at work is cleaning up your station before start working. i work cashier form soon as i got there until break and from break until finishing time.every day i learned something new. i learned how to work and get along with with co-workers and customers and all that i need to know about my responsiblity of the job. my manager is a very easy going person who stays on top of what should be done. and there are management above her that stays on top of what are expected to done. some of my co-workers are fun to be around and some are just unpleasant but that doesnt stop me from doing my work because i try my very best to get along with every one. i loved my jod, i have never found any part difficult. the most enjoyable part is when we all get together on fridays after work to eat, drink and talk about work."
good,"I worked a ten hour shift on my feet the whole time. At first I packed all the time. While I liked that OK, it took me awhile to get the supervisor to let me try something else. I was then allowed to try different positions that I was able to do better, and learned that management should let the employees change jobs occasionally to see if their strengths are in different areas. I loved my co-workers and got along with them well. They are a great bunch of people, including the supervisors. The hardest part of the job is standing on concrete floors for ten hours without moving much. Where the job is not at all hard, it is hard on your body. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the work itself. I enjoyed seeing the different products and thinking about where they were going, and who might have ordered them. I found it very interesting. I also enjoyed working with the people."
good,"tends to get hectic during the holidays, lots of traffic. always something to do."
good,customer service
good,I was hired to be a seasonal sales manager and during this time i excelled buy without much help
good,"At the heart of the business, you have to think on your feet and respond to the needs of the business and the associates. There are times when you need to be proactive and respond to a crisis before it becomes one."
good,decent place to work with a good core of fellow employes. some mangement is better others but overall a good company to work for..
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,pretty much works with your schedule some mangers do not know how to talk to people but the good ones make up for it. most areas are commission which is great during the holidays.
good,"The evironment was always friendly, clean and most of the managment show that they care about you individually. They're pretty organized a lot of the time. Much of the time there is not much room for advancement, or salary increases. The times when I enjoyed myself the most were when I was being kept busy by assisting people with their purchases, and putting merchandise where it needed to be. The hardest parts were when management could not communicate clearly to us what our agenda for the day was, and even though many things were unorganized, we were instructed not to take any action until management could figure things out, which usually took a long while. There was never a problem with other co-workers because everyone was friendly. One thing I learned here that I didn't learn from my othere jobs was how to work in the women's shoe department during the holidays. I really learned how to take care of multiple people's needs at the same time, and assure as well as calm stressed and agitated customers."
good,Typical workday was to get my assignment & go to work. The work i performed i was used to stemming from my work at the airport.
good,Worked in recovery and enjoyed it very much. The position enabled me to have a variety of things to do each day. It also gave me the opportunity to be of service to customers.
good,"At my job, we put up signs for the upcoming sales and/or events at the store. My team is not given very many hours in which to do our work. We all work as a team to get things done, otherwise nothing would ever get done. The people on my team are amazing. The hardest part of the job is not having time to get everything accomplished. Our current manager is very nice and does his best to work with us when we need it. I enjoy my job because I can work by myself and at my own pace to a certain extent. I have learned how to better work as a team with my co-workers and that it is necessary to do so to be productive."
good,"It is different every day and full of challenging experiences.. you really have to be on your toes..you are pretty much on your own , having to make on the spot judgement calls to better assist customers..assist/ help co workers and sometimes yourself..Some of the management team doesnt communicate well with each other and arent well organized ..seem to be oblivious of whats going on around them.. A few of the other Managers are very much on top of things and do an excellent job.. My co workers are an amazing bunch, who work very hard and are kind loving people.. The hardest part of my job is realizing there are really no advancement opportunities at all in any direction, whether as a promotion or just a transfer to a different dept..doing something you would be great at and passionate about or developing new skills and if you do transfer you are at risk of losing pay or hours and benefits.. The most enjoyable part is the customers I have met so far and the great people and manager I do work with..."
good,I love macy's but it is not cofortabel the schedule and time avaliablity for each and every body. at all the benfit and time management and some other staff is not the one i like.
good,Typical work day was serving customer's
good,My day consisted of helping customers purchase merchandise and folding clothing. Management was wonderful and helpful. My co-workers were in different departments so there was no much socialization other than with customers. My job was relatively easy and enjoyable.
good,new tasks every day poor leadership but good people for co workers hardest part of the job was being thrown around customer interaction was the best part
good,"I love working for Macy's. The only issues that i have deals with low pay and one coworker. The situations are bad that it is affecting my work. You would think that the hardest part of your job would be the customers, but in my case it is one of my employees. It is to the point where it makes you do not want to come to work around the individual. I have adressed all issues plenty of times with managers, but it was never handled the correct way and i do not appreciate it."
good,"putting up stock and changing things around. learn many different things that are helpful, management is awesome co worker are very nice hardest thing is moving every four seasons everything there is never a dull moment"
good,I loved my job at macys
good,I am happy and great ful to be employee of Macy's..The only concerns is that I hope they will raise my salary as I work at night and give us night differential if its pssible...
good,"I liked the people there. They were very friendly and even after me leaving there I still speak with some of them. The hours were ideal, time wise. There weren't always many hours given in a week, but they had hours to give new people they hired. That i didn't understand. The management was very poor. They didn't treat the employee's very well at all. They also have scorecards, which I think are not needed. They make the employees look like they are not even trying at their job, which is totally false. All in all, I would not go back there and I wouldn't suggest this job to anyone."
good,i would like to work there again soon. I like working in a place where i like to shop. And they give good employee discounts.
good,"Working for Macys was my first job experience so I had to get the feel of things. Working in retail is really hands-and fast paced. Things moved really quickly there. There goal is customer service always. I learned a lot from working there, but since I was only seasonal, part time there wasn't really a chance for advancement."
good,"I loved working with all the people at Macy's, my managers and coworkers were great!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys has its pros and cons. The hours and work you put in os more than you are being paid for. But it's a great learning experience and as any job you have good and bad management and coworkers.
good,"Enter work, get a list to pick items for the entire morning, every hour returning the merchandise to be packed "
good,"Macy was a very competitive work environment. your performance is based off of sales so other employees step on your toes at times to make a sell. The customer service overall is not that great I would give it a three out of five. Plus it is extremely hard to move up the chain and for management to really notice you. It had its perks to working there, and there are always sales that you, as an employee, needed to be aware of, which was at times a challenge, but if I had to choose I would work for another department store."
good,Overall easy job just do your work n you done but they tell you to find stuff bur it won't arrive till two days later or its not in stock so they hate it when you cant find the item but it's on its way lol
good,"The job was fun and really calm and easy. "
good,The overall experience was there were never enough employees. Customers were constantly looking around for help. Their return policy is ridiculous.They will take back anything even if it is clearly used and not from the store.
good,My experience there was good the employees were always helpful. There was a lot of scheduling leniency.  Due to personal reasons I couldn’t continue my employment.
good,It's a okay place to work depending on what you're looking for. There is room for growth if you want to stay in the retail world. Pay is ok. They can be flexible with your schedule if you stay on them about it.
good,Working I didn't really get to interact with the customers unless it was something from the back that they needed. The backroom stock is where I was placed so I had to organize and clean up areas in the back that was broking up or out of place.
good,"Working with macys is fun. you tend to meet people. it  a little too much for the pay but when you have no choice.you have to deal with it, Not bad for a starter or young graduates or interns. definitely not sufficient or good for someone with loads of responsibilities."
good,"Very political work environment, navigating a career can seem like a game of chess. You'll learn a lot if you stay focused and play your cards right. Always have your next move in mind."
good,The store smells good all around. While working there you'll most likely end up buying things for yourself or friends and family. Also working there gives you an opportunity to get all dolled up since that is a apart of the dress code which is formal/casual attire with some makeup. You go in and you basically do the same thing everyday. Just sell and make sure you keep your place of work neat.
good,I answered questions for customers based on our merchandise. I also worked the register and fulfilled online orders all around the world and in Colorado Springs. I kept the area clean and get along with my coworkers.
good,"loved working there . balancing was easy , coworker were great . Absolutely loved the atmosphere. I would overall recommend this job to students and anyone looking into a retail position ."
good,"Good place to gain customer service and sales skills, you meet people from all over the world, the hardest part of the job is standing for a long day can be exhausting"
good,"Overall, I was at Macy's to backfill for MAT leave, but enjoyed my time there. I worked specifically on Holiday and Fall campaigns in San Francisco, CA which allowed me to build my Event Management experience and hands on ownership of activations."
good,Macy's is an exciting place to work.  The hardest part of the job personally is discipline in buying for self.  Things change daily from customer interactions to products. Most transactions are different. Never a dull moment.
good,"Fun for awhile until I could not get any shifts was was down to making $25  per week - Nights and weekends got old.  Nice people to work with, but Macy's doesn't pay very well."
good,I like the job but there are not a lot of hours in this position. Also pay is really low they say you will win commission on sales but not I myself have gained commission.
good,I enjoyed much of my work but over the years and due to lack of help and less people applying for such a job hard work I would do during the first year now is not even close to what I was doing in recent years. It felt like doing a job for 5 people. That being said it is a great place to get ones first job and or working experience.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A good place to work for someone seeking a part time job while in school. If you're head of household with a family to support, this job is not for you."
good,I enjoyed the flexibility of the schedule when I was part time but when I went full time the flexibility decreased. I worked 3 different locations and they were all good locations to work at but I wish I had stayed at my 1st location because I feel there would have been more of a chance to advance. I would recommend the job for someone who's looking for something part time or just passing time unless the pay has increased. I loved opening new accounts and earning Macy's money and the discounts you got with your Macy's card.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's and would do it again. Was a pleasant environment to be around, I enjoyed coming in to work"
good,"Macy’s Beverly center is super slow"
good,"The pay at the time was only okay. But they did pay weekly, so that was a plus. They would give us pizza athe meetings every Friday. Of courses"
good,A lot of down time due to a retail depression. The pay and benefits were below my expectations. Customers service relations was the highlight of my duties
good,"healthy work environment "
good,Very fast paced had yo meet a quota. I liked the position and the fast pace but in the jewelry cage it was really cold. I guess since it was a warehouse it wasn't climate controlled
good,Macy's has been a retail giant for many years and is constantly changing the way they do business to try and stay ahead of customer demands in the ever changing world of retail.
good,"It was okay but most definitely not a place/job where you can provide for your family. Macy’s is more of a job to supplement your income. You will most definitely need another job, a spouse or government assistance."
good,If you’re looking for a place to start working then this is a good place to start. People treat you well and fairly and the co workers are good people. My only complaint was that hours are VERY inconsistent.
good,"It was a fun experience to work at a clothing store like macys, they were just inconsistent about hours when i had another job and would call me in and then call back saying nevermind when i have another job,, i couldnt do that"
good,"It was a great place to work. I loved meeting different people and working along with a staff of different races/ethnicities. "
good,"Is a great place to work at for a small time, but not something to do long term. If your manager is good then it makes the time easier, and if you have a hard working team in your department."
good,I was 18 hrs. a week at Macy's. They cut all employees working 18 hrs. or less so I was let go. I loved working with people and helping them find the perfect outfit. If we didn't have the right size I always offered to order one for them.
good,Great place to work. Everyone from colleagues to people leaders are challenged on a daily basis to get better. Offered many tools for personal and career growth.
good,"Prior to store opening,   1/2 hour before: Opened store register(s)"
good,"Lots of hours, Get paid weekly, Not too much manual labor in some parts of the building. smoking permitted in certain areas. good amount of time for breaks. not enough time to come back from breaks. lots of walking."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Nice co-workers, great training, little to no opportunity for advancement. I did enjoy that I could use multiple discounts and they did give you nice incentives for sales which was motivating."
good,it was a ok place to work but its not ideal if you have bills. If your retired and want to keep on your feet  this is the job for you or if your a high school graduate wanting to work JUST for the break before college this is also for you.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Macyś. I have had a successful career. The holiday hours and time away from my family during the holiday season are the reasons that I am looking for a new career,"
good,Macys is a good place to work however it does come with lots of goals and expectations. There is a limited work life balance due to all the weekend events that will take place.
good,This job is great for those looking to build experience in a well known retailer.  It is almost impossible to advance within the company. Most new management are new hires from outside the company.
good,"Good. Hard on your feet. Do not micromanage.  Kept employees well informed,  cared about employees  needs and health issues.   Wish I could of stayed longer but my health at that time made me leave prematurely"
good,worked as per diem in high school in cosmetics and fragrances. it was alright as a starting job. holidays were hectic as expected during the holidays slow in every other season
good,People and managers mainly focus only on the work and nothing else!!! It's more like all work and no play. Some managers are really rude and make sure that you fail in your tasks.
good,"Temporary job, seasonal position for holiday. very good pay and ability too work over 40 hours if wanted. 10-12 hours shifts and buses for transporting if do not own vehicle."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's,it was a good work environment.The managers and co-workers were friendly but professional.If I was asked to recommend Macy's to a friend or family member I would . I was only hired for a seasonal position but if I was called back I would be happy to return to Macy's."
good,Don't be a mexican from San Bernardino or you'll be falsely accused of theft. I was suspended without pay for 2 weeks while they were investigating an innocent person. Defamation of character was already done when they told me to come back to work.
good,"A typical day would require unloading the delivery trucks, sorting said delivered items. attaching security tags on all products before sending them to the sales floor."
good,Most days coverage is low requiring open communication with colleagues to coordinate adequate coverage for meals and breaks. Management has been going through a lot of shifts resulting in senior associates providing training to new management.
good,"It was a typical retail work culture."
good,"The position was  seasonal, I have nothing negative to say about it.  It was fun but  tiresome.  You get to meet friends, nice people, fun and place!!"
good,if you're not helping out a customer you're doing online orders and cleaning the sales floor. There wasn't much culture within the company but zone managers were on top of holding everyone accountable for opening up credits and making daily sales goals.
good,Macys has a very busy atmosphere daily. As the holidays come around prepare for lots of customer interaction. You are required to offer every customer the opportunity to apply for store credit line.
good,It was alright working there. Lots of people who are just as in the same boat as you. Rude customers here and there. Managers were nice while others were clueless. Don't work black Friday!
good,"They need to pay more for certain positions for example receiving because they do the most and always helping the other associate with their task apart from them having their own. for example me, I ave to help different teams on wha they have to do because they wanna be lazy and ask the manager so he sends us and is not fair at all. Especially for that pay rate"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,good place to work little to no supervision. work jobs trained for and work in different departments. there were opportunities to take other postisions
good,"Management was barley around, commission was never a real break down of what you can earn.  Fast pace work environment, minimal room for growth. Schedules are not flexible."
good,"Its an alright job doesn't pay much but this is more of a job then a career. Learned a lot about clothes, companies and the different fits every company makes."
good,"Workplace was stressful at times, but that's common in cosmetics and sales. Commission jobs are competitive and can sometimes cause problems within the workplace between employees."
good,Regardless of the knowledge and results you show and give the company. They only promote and compensate who they like even if you are ready for management
good,"Very collaborative. Management was not the best, but not the worst. You learn a lot about selling and building rapport with customers. Decent discounts, but the commission rate is incredibly low."
good,"Work hard,stay focus,Conversations exceptionally but not to much,learn,be nice to costumer and associates,have respect,and the costumer is always RIGHT"
good,"I worked as a floor ""stocker"" in the mornings. I enjoyed this position because we had this sort of freedom to it. We worked when the store was closed so it was nice not having to deal with customers."
good,It was a fun place to work; loved the supervisors and management very helpful in helping you learn your job. I enjoyed working with the people in my group
good,Challenging fast paced work on the dock unloading trucks. Great manager that was very hands on and helpful. Was not very pleased with other department managers although it was never a problem for me.
good,Good Hours for those who prefer to work in the morning. Great team members to work with. not too difficult work however sometimes some weeks can be much more frustrating than most. Extra hours are offered when they are available. Work culture can be improved and work/life balance is fine.
good,Macy's is a great company to start in. They teach a lot of valuable skills that you can carry on throughout other positions in and outside of Macy's. I've invited several friends and family members to work here. It is an enjoyable place to work in.
good,"Macy's provides daily pep rallies to try to encourage customer interaction with the customer, promoted sales daily, product knowledge. Management was lacking in the realm of support for it's employees"
good,"At work on a typical day I could be doing many different things. I've worked over night, I worked in mens sells, I've also worked in cosmetics before. I learned how to get my jobs done effectively but also how to communicate with my other team members. The workplace was very busy but everyone was friendly and nice. The hardest part wasn't to hard but I guess I would say on a certain you could be doing something completely different and its weird to adjust when you've been doing it a certain way. I enjoyed most in this job doing something I liked and working."
good,"Great place to work, great people.  The best part was the discounts  and the one hour lunch. Really easy job. Bad part is they  never have any full-time positions"
good,fun place to work if you love to people and shopping. The discounts are the best . The employees are pretty friendly and it becomes a family environment
good,"It was a great job, lots of autonomy, good work environment. The manager was cool, and understood the reality of weather around here. The only major downside was getting passed up for an open position even though I had been doing the job for six months."
good,I like my job Macy’s is a nice place to work but I want to move stores so I can be closer to wear I live. I would also like to get a higher position to expand my skills. I want to work in cosmetics at a store closer to me. I have a lot of experience and would like to use it to do better in life.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,While attending collage as seasonal sales associate which require additional funds. The hours and position fit in perfectly with my schedule.I would recommend working for Macy's.
good,Could be very stressful and disorganized at times. Issues with scheduling and understaffing. There were training and development classes that were very helpful for expanding product knowledge. The culture was generally very friendly and everyone more or less sought to help one another out.
good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's, I had a great Shipping and Receiving manager, also all my co- worker's where a great team to work for. However I was not getting enough work hours, during the week. I also was told that I would be called back to work during the spring. I was never called back. I never worked enough hours to qualify for unemployment benefits. Would I go back to work for Macy's ? Yes. If they ever decide to call me back to work."
good,"I was just a few years out of high school when I took this job. I worked in the accessory department. My first day was black Friday. Macy's was located at the mall so it was a complete mad house. "
good,"I loved the job. My manager was fantastic. The store managers were all great. Unfortunately,  there were store closings and this store tried to absorb as many employee's as possible. The downside is many great employee's were lost."
good,"But the hours were inconsistant.  You didn't know when you were going to be scheduled,  or if at all for periods at a time. I loved what I did there,  but the only times we were scheduled to work (worth even going into work for)  was during a sale,  or holidays,  as I was just a merchandiser. This is the only complaint I had about working for Macy's."
good,A typical day at work consists of unloading a shipment and putting it out on the sales floor. The managers are very friendly and always there to help.
good,I really wish things where the way they said it was going to be. It was a great workspace at times but things could have been done a lot differently..
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's . The staff and management were great.  The discounts were phenomenal
good,Good company to work for  part-time. Like having discounts and working for Macy money to be used to purchase merchandise. Like having flexible scheduling. Like having to earn time off points.
good,Was my first job and for a first job it was very good. You can advance in your career at macys if that is what you choose but you have to REALLY apply yourself and have numbers to show up for that to advance.
good,"Although I enjoyed providing outstanding customer service to clients while at Macy's, it was merely a seasonal position. The workday went by quickly and it was rewarding to help clients. The staff was very good to work with."
good,"It's a pretty cookie cutter place to work. As to be expected. Pay is decent and horse are fairly flexible, but if you're looking for adventure or excitement I wouldn't reccomend applying here."
good,Great place to work but the salary and increases are LOW. No bonus and long hours. Some of the work is not balance by management some people have more work then others.
good,I liked how you get to work as a team. You meet new people mostly everyday. It’s very enjoyable. You learn new things almost every day. I would recommend
good,"I was not called after the Christmas season and was a little disappointed because every time my manager found me, I was working. They even put me in Juniors because my position was neat."
good,"Everyone I work with is very friendly and helpful.  They really have the team part down in teamwork.  "
good,I enjoyed working with the people at this location.  It is nice when I go back and can still see some of the old faces.  The salary was not enough for me as time moved on and advancement was not optional or what I was looking for/expecting.
good,You got to be on it if you want to work here. They give prizes at the end of the week if you’re the worker with the most of what you are doing. They will check on you too
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked as a seasonal ringer in the Lauder/Clinique counter over the holidays. It was very quick, very fast-paced and there was a lot of information to learn but I caught on pretty fast. Unfortunately they decided not to keep me on the schedule, but it was my most fun job, so at least I got that."
good,Working at Macy's was a fun experience sadly I personally bit off more then I could chew when I was working as a Receiving staff. The managers were understanding and it was a fun workspace
good,"1.My dutty was giving a great customer services experience."
good,"It was fun to help customers putting a specific styles or look together, but then it became stressful moving from departments to departments not knowing where everything was."
good,Great when I started.. weekly pay.. but way to much is expected for a low pay rate.. some managers like to give tons of orders and make allot of drama.. new store manger dorla took over and to many changes happened allot of people were cut
good,"Macy's is fast paced workplace, there are days when you have an 8 hour day or a 4 hour day. They will often call you in when people do not show up to their shifts so you can get a lot of overtime. Most of the coworkers get along well enough to make the workplace enjoyable."
good,"Nice to place....It's just they need to find manager that people are gonna flow. I don't think  If the manager have favoritism,  nobody gonna respect this person as a manager ."
good,"I worked the black Friday schedule and although very hectic, the area and team that I worked with  was organized and we helped one another which made the process run fairly smoothly."
good,Macy's is just a temporary position while I pursue my career. I enjoy my time there as most management is friendly and courteous. The fellow employees are also good to be around.
good,"clean the desk tops ,phones ,and computers.putting out stock waiting on customer. ordering merchandise for the customers.working with people hat where set in there ways."
good,"It’s nice to take pride in whatever employment you take on. I felt Macy’s really was elite and prepared us all in mornings sales meetings.  We took pride in our appearance to show respect for ourselves, superiors, and customers."
good,I did not like that my manager wasn't willing to help me move up.  I wanted to be a make up adviser she kept me cashiering.  She never took the time to see what i could do she was always on the move
good,i had a good experience to work for this company. learn so much from working in different departments. lots of experience of customer service and been teller.
good,"Macys is a fun environment, where i learned to interact with customers, offer and invite them to see new things that arrive in stores.  There are very strict about opening credit cards."
good,"Only working on seasonal until the store closing down. Managers are very nice, friendly and flexible. Meet and greet lots of customer.  It is fun place to work."
good,"Working at Macys is very physically hard work.  Carrying stock/boxes, etc. If you can get a commission position it is more financially feasible to earn enough to live.  Don't count on the benefits to pay for anything."
good,The salary is not the best but the experience you get with costumes is great especially during holidays
good,"Best place to work to meet people."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It's an easy job"
good,"typical day was easy "
good,"Not very hard work , very busy but enjoyable and good team of coworkers. Had to start the day with my own schedule that I choose"
good,I worked here part-time for 5 years and had fun working but you have to love working with the public. its cutthroat when you have to get sales. Management could be better.
good,My experience may have been unique.  My boss and coworkers were excellent.  All of the managers were radiated with positive attitudes and contagious smiles.  I enjoyed coming to work every day despite the low pay.  What a great store.  It's a shame they're closing this location.
good,"I love my customers/clients and co-workers,  I love working with the public and have learned many selling and customer service techniques, however, the sales staff continues to get cut due to budget reasons and it has become very stressful and difficult, both mentally and physically. The benefits are expensive and  the annual raises are pennies and it is just time for me to move on."
good,"Overall, Macy's is fun place to work with for seasonal only. I met variety of customers. The job is too easy to work on and the Managers are very nice and fun to work with."
good,"The Macy's that  worked for was a union Macy's and you needed to join the union in order to work there. I was working on a base plus commission, which at first seemed great, but if a product was returned anytime in 6 months we would have to pay the commission back to Macy's which, at times, created problems."
good,"Come into work clock in, and then go to the department you are working in for the day, find out who else you are working with. Management was nice, fair."
good,a typical day was filled with helping customers in there shopping sometimes just giving encouragement to a customer. Our store manager was Awesome very motivated and pleasant. I love fashion so help a customer to fulfill and be happy with there purchase was a delight. Irate rude customers but I remained humble
good,"Macy's is a place that is high paced and overall you become very knowledgable of your culture background, due to being in the heart of NYC you learn a lot not only from your coworkers but from tourist and foreigners."
good,love working the fragrance dept during the holidays because it always busy and makes time pass by faster also they have fun events during the holidays as well
good,This company gave me a great incite on the world of Accounts Payable and Mailbox operations of transmitting data.  The ability to advance was slow and only came during a time of crisis. Co workers are wonderful and helpful in all aspects of work area.
good,It was a nice experience working at Macy's. The people were nice and warm. I enjoyed making the goals for the month and the morning rallies. I am going to miss it.
good,Macy's was a great place to learn my craft.  I received great training and support as I learned how to drive sales through coaching.  I was promoted 3 times in my four years there.
good,"Macy's is a pretty cool place to work overall. I would only recommend it as a part-time job though. It's pretty fast past, competitive, and fun. The company doesn't pay the employees enough for all the hard work that it requires; which is why I would prefer it only for part-time. Some of the managers were great, some were not. But overall, I enjoyed working there..... Especially for the discounts and sales!"
good,MST is driven by projects. This can make the job and work day stress filled. A typical day will start by reviewing problems tickets for that site and resolving the issues which may involved other departments at MST.
good,Its ok if you dont mind a flyctuating schedule but its not a hard job. Discount ks onky offered if you apply for store credit. Some managers are ok but alot of mean ones.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I really enjoyed my position and clients at Macy's.  However, I did have trouble with cut throat co-workers. Management is only concerned with credit card loyalty."
good,It's a large store with customers pouring in by the minute so its a face paced environment. Store is always updating with new merchandise. Gets a bit stressful when dealing with many customers at once.
good,A typical would be answering customers queries and looking for opportunity boost sales. My job also required me to provide the best customer service possible.
good,"I like working at Macy's and its ok place to work at the only thing is that i wasnt suppose to work on call but the spots were filled when i went for my interview and i was pretty sad and i need more hours and money lol! but i like working there,"
good,It was a great experience for me. Macys have great customer service and the employee are very friendly and helpful. Good environment and the associat discount is everything
good,"If you can handle the pressure of not getting help when you need it Macy's can be a great place to work, youre always busy and shifts tend to go by quickly.  There is not enough management to go around so help is not readily available."
good,"good register training, great competitions to get teams pumped to sell, fun selling culture if one decides to participate in sales games. decent managers, decent resources to help problem solve. really out of date registers. will let you pick up co-worker shifts in other departments for extra hours, no over time. work with other departments is frequent for customer service."
good,I worked for over 7 plus years at Macys and planned on retiring with the company but was laid off. My experience there was overall very good with the exception of my last dept manager i worked with. The company offers benefits that most retail companies do not.
good,"Great Company to have in your resume, you can grow so fast and you have the option to manage your schedule.  Top retailer in the industry, good benefits."
good,"Easy minimum wage work, mostly friendly team members and management was there for a majority of the time to help, however this wasn't a long term place for me."
good,"don't work here, management is awful!!!! you get over worked and all the company cares about is making money, the associates are all unhappy and you do more than what you are paid for also the hours are weird"
good,"It was fun working at Macy's! I learned a lot, got lots of recognition. And I loved shopping!!! Didn't like the Sign-In process being one minute late adds up and could cost you your job."
good,"I worked for Macy's during the Christmas season, very busy time. mostly I was in charge of linens and towels..customers came first ,but had to straighten up and keep my area clean and  neat looking. really enjoyed the customers 99% were very understanding even if I had 15 in line to check out.my manager was very understanding. The hardest part of my job was stocking the towels, all the was up to the ceiling. dealing with customers was my most injoyable part of my job, because I like people. I'm a people person"
good,I had fun working here but I really wish they paid better and offered more work hours. The discount and credit card was good but there was no room for position advancement.
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent there, the environment was very nice and everyone treated me with respect. The manager that I had was very nice, if I had any questions she would answer every single one if them. Never made me feel Like I was a burden"
good,"Great for students, availability is great with school schedules. I've gotten great customer service experience and management experience. Family dynamics and very willing to work with you to meet needs."
good,"I wanted to work closer to my home and try a different venue."
good,"Responsibilities in Macy's Receiving are unloading trucks, opening boxes and organizing clothing and additional accessories by department. At the end of the night, receivers run racks of product out onto the sales floor to designated departments. "
good,"The culture is very upbeat and the executives clearly care about their employees. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Flex scheduled, good job experience, decent pay rate, "
good,"If you want somewhere that can be flexible with scheduling, Macy's is the company to work with.  However, due to restructuring, many positions have been and are being cut to support the budget."
good,"some of the managers are just a pleasure to work with, they will understand that you do have a family even though its retail the work life balance is possible. The discounts doesn't hurt either. If you're not careful you might spend more than make more money."
good,An average day mainly consist of unloading merchandise from truck(s). Afterwards the team would sort the merchandise and move them to the correct department. The co-workers are very motivated and caring to customers and each other.
good,"macy was an great experience , i love the face that co worker & i work so good as a team when it came to busy days, I also did great with my daily tasks as Stock recovery/cashier"
good,this was a productive working place. the place was bright and full of smiles. I love making people happy and seeing there smiling faces when they found what there where looking for when shopping
good,"I work in the ICQA Dept. and we count non stop, sometimes it's enjoyable especially for someone who likes to be organized but sometimes it's boring and can aggravate you. My manager is awesome, she's been very helpful with the benefit enrollment and helping me get the days off that I need for my doctor appointments."
good,"Macy's was a unique and diverse experience with a variety of clients that kept up a lively and vibrant atmosphere. The hours varied drastically with the seasons, but there were opportunities to compensate for losses."
good,"I probably would not work in commission sales department again.  But it was not a bad work environment.  The employee discount was wonderful.  No, it was really fantastic.  Really loved the employee discount.  The bad thing was wearing black everyday.  Had to up my anti-depressants."
good,"I enjoyed Macy's.  I love helping people.  I was a floater, so I covered others when they went to lunch.  I liked the variety of the departments.  It is hard work being on your feel for hours."
good,A typical day at Macys would be customers coming up to you and arguing or asking a ton of questions. We were supposed to promote our product even if the customers didn't want to.
good,"I liked my job and things i got to create/do over the course of working there but i personally was not fond of my manager. Coming to work became stressful because of the way he acted."
good,overall great place to work  commission is amazing! however you tend to spend your summer days and nights on the sales floor ....snow storm or not be ready to get to work
good,"I worked at Macy's as a seasonal sales associate during the holidays. Training was a couple days until I hit the floor, then it got busy. I never was assigned to shadow any co-worker, so I was basically on my own. I primarily worked in women's coats/BOPS (buy online pick up in store) and fulfillment. Scheduling and shift change was usually an issue, but myself and co-workers worked it out."
good,"Being that I was an overnight processor, the work hours were extremely long. Placing alarm tags on all clothing, one department at a time, is what my day consist of. The work place is a fast but yet chill setting."
good,"I liked my job there,was a great learning experience, the only reason why I out four stars is because there was never enough hours, but people were nice and organized."
good,I loved working at Macy's until the company started suffering because then there was too much pressure put on us five people in management trying to run the whole store seven days a week. Even when we were making our numbers we still didn't receive any appraisal. We were never doing good enough even though we were number one in the district for several consecutive months.
good,A day at work would be clocking in through the computer and checking up with your supervisor for what duties you would have that day. Many customers needed help on sales floor so I would always be stopped by a customer.
good,Make sure all displays are correctly placed and are stocked with correct merchandise. Restock as items are taken so you won't fall behind and have empty displays.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked 'off stage' performing stock and merchandising activities for the housewares, tabletop, textiles, and children's departments, and of course, the Christmas department.  Everyday seemed like a holiday, opening boxes and new treasures.  It was physically demanding work, but I enjoyed it."
good,"My original job duties were mostly shipping and receiving merchandise, handling customer repairs and occasionally help with customers. Through the years, I helped with re-fixturing projects, training managers and supervisors, communicating with vendors about their brands and training, training new associates, merchandising case lines, logging all countable merchandise, assisting with inventory controls, assisting with fashion jewelry and watches. Changes in work culture from senior management required more responsibilities for sales associates and clericals. The best part of my job was when my customers recognized my care and concern about their request for repairs, as well as maintaining records for continuous repair requests. Most difficult customers came to me because I had more knowledge of products we sell. I enjoyed working with the sales associates, and customers.  I was also very customer service oriented."
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's during the time that I was working there everything was great I wish I would've been able to get paid a little bit better for the amount of work that I was doing but it is what it is. The management is unfortunate because a lot of people don't know how to organize themselves or say that they're doing a lot of work but in reality they're not. My manager that I had on the dock Was one of the managers I was not doing absolutely nothing at all but was always complaining that I was not complete my work on time. I was the person who is running the dock unloading trucks making sure that the merchandise hit the floor set up the furniture department help with merchandising and remove the pictures off the floor.
good,"The reason I had to quit working at Macy's was because I was taking classes over the weekend and they don't see that as an appropriate excuse to take the day off. It's understandable, but I value my education more than the job."
good,"Start my shift and greeted my manager and co-workers. After getting my assignment work begins, the floor manager comes over to let me know what is required at my station. then, continues his/her duties. "
good,"I worked there for one Christmas season (November to March 1) I worked in many different departments but mostly in Men's wear and the kitchen and bath department."
good,The employees were GREAT.... We needed or jobs but that how things go. WE worked hard and long.  The supervisors we understanding  and believe in team work.
good,"Because of the nature of retail, the hours are long with long periods of time standing and walking. At busy times, work can be stressful. Flexible hours can be difficult in planning personal life."
good,"Loved the job, hated the hours, i enjoyed working in two of the departments, not so much in the others. Some what like high school with all the drama."
good,great place to work  if your dedicated you will move fat and far have to learn a lot on your own and progress best if you already have previous training
good,I worked in the shoe department at fashion valley i loved it. Great crew i worked with. Customers were friendly best part ofnit was when i had my regular customers come in. Witst part of working in that department was closing it was a mess recovery sucked.
good,Very fast paced day. I learned better time management and productivity skills. My day consisted of a 10 hour shift that started by gathering materials then packaging and processing.
good,Macy's is a good spot for someone who's looking for part-time work or a second form of income.  I learned a lot of great lessons regarding the retail industry and also how to manage a group of people.  The management was nice and they were very flexible in terms of working with people's schedules.  The workplace culture is laid back and easy going.  The hardest part of the job was the physical labor.  It was also challenging not knowing schedules very far in advance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people and getting to know many of them.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that were easy and fun to work with. Everyday when I or another associate walked in we were always greeted by security, other associates and the managers."
good,Working at Macys taught me a great deal about how to deal with the public. During my time here the business was always booming and sales kept me busy and happy.
good,"If your looking to start a career in retail, Macy's is a great place to start.  Company is truly making an effort to educate their employees and reward them as much as possible.  Managers are frustrated with the high turnover and the hostile employee peer to peer relationship.  You cannot blame an organization for launching a buy on line pick up in store process, however this does nothing for the employee in the way of sales commission which creates an enormous amount of negativity."
good,Seasonal job with an ok environment to work in. They stressed security and integrity. Also the job itself mainly consisted of putting things where they go.
good,"There were always problems with the register or the signature pad, or the bathrooms, or the this or the that. We got hundreds of complaints as sales associates, and there wasn't much that the management did until they absolutely had to. BUT we got by just fine because of our accommodating attitudes as a staff, team work, and coordination. The positivity and drive to succeed kept us successful when the systems and certain flaws failed us."
good,I love make up so I love what I did.  I didn't agree  how to management wise but I mean thats how retail jobs are. The pay is OK.  But not awesome.  It's a good job to start off
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,the pay was very bad and they treat their employees like they are not but expect them to stay longer when they need them. i learned that your self worth is important and not change it to please no one
good,"Everyday presents new challenges.  Loved working with sales associates, vendors and customers.  Great store management team."
good,"A typical day at work was just scanning totes with merchandise inside, throwing them in the conveyor belt , pack merchandise ready to be delivered. I learned how to work with others mentally and physically . How to be responsible for your duties , work hard in accomplishing your goal and give your best effort. The culture in the workplace was very old style , just a lot of machines , noise more like a factory .The hardest part of the job was trying to reach the goal for the day and having to multitask while other areas were in need . The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people , practicing and trying new things in the work place and learning new techniques ."
good,"From the beginning of the shift you are always moving needing to finish some kind of task. "
good,I am very grateful to have had the chance to work for one of the biggest retail companies in the world. I have learned a lot of customer skills. I have faced a few problems on my journey.
good,I sold shoes and put away shoes were the belonged. I rearranged settings of shoes that were on sales. Management was ok but could get rude at times.
good,"Macy's is a good place to work.  I have worked retail others places and this is much better.  We have lunches, bowling, different things like that.  I work in IA and our customers are very nice and fun to work with and help.  My co workers are great.  Some of the managers are great and some are not."
good,"Fun workplace, but the store was not very successful. The management was mediocre because all the good managers got better jobs. Good job for college students because flexible schedules. Work Weekends a lot."
good,"I really like it there and look forward to staying. However they do not pay well. I have only been here foe a short time, but I've learned much especially when I go help in other departments."
good,"Working at Macy's provided me with more customer service skill, helping others is very rewarding for me. A typical day working would have been cleaning the area i was in at the time, helping customers with questions and being apart of a great team."
good,Assisting customers with shoe sizes and purchases.  Real busy during holidays and alot of standing for hours.  The employees were very nice and helpful.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for Macy's. I learned so many things about fragrance and cosmetics, and I am excited to carry that knowledge with me."
good,"It was cool."
good,"Similar to other retail company involves working different schedules, making sure customers receive the best customer service the moment they walk in the store"
good,"Many times where they throw tasks/projects on your shoulders to complete asap regardless of other important tasks. Constant calming of customers and responding to associate calls that they have no idea how to solve when in reality its very easy. These problems come from extremely seasoned associates, too."
good,when I would go to work everyone was very nice. management would be walking around and helping customers with us. I wish I would be able to stay but I didn't get commission because I was a seasonal worker and not full time so all of my sales would go to everyone besides me.
good,"Nice retail job. Flexible hours and benefits are good. Commission is can help increase pay, but you need to sell a lot of items for it to make a difference in your check."
good,It was a simple job. When you finished you'd help out with other tasks. They paid very well here. HR is also very good. Holiday shifts were always fun.
good,"A typical day is to clock in and make sure that everything is straighten up and check customers out, engaged with the customers. Co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,If you've never worked in retail its a great experience. Great part time job for holidays or if in school. Discounts are the most enjoyable thing about the job.
good,The management team is great people to work with. Helping Customers with what they need. The store needs more sales and more customers. As well as staff.
good,"Terrible management, pick favorites, things always laying on the floor getting stepped on and then put back up to sell. Employees take breaks when they please forcing others to stay after shift is over. Managers don't provide you with enough information or training."
good,The workplace at Macys is crazy. Sometimes the customers and coworkers can be really rude but you have to learn to ignore it so it wont ruin your day.
good,"The work space was very organized. the other employs were mostly friendly, some of the Senior employs felt entitled and acted as managers even though they were not, this made my work experience with the company uncomfortable as i was giving multiple instructions that did not work with each other, I worked strictly on my managers instructions and this made the senior employs upset with me."
good,"Good Company to work for, I had a good experience with all my managers.  As long as you have good work ethics, you can enjoy each day at work.  I learned to work with a diverse number of people.  Got along with everyone I worked and met.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for long hours.  I only worked part time and enjoyed my short shifts.  I really felt like being part of a family.  I got the opportunity to work all around the store and got to make many friends.  I felt at home."
good,"Working at Bon Ton is really easy just like any other retail job. However, the computers were so slow, and the ordering system was horrible. Barely even functional yet they want us to get so much money in orders per day."
good,It was a nice place to start of with work and had a very comforting feel to the whole experience. I worked with many women coworkers and leads. They were all understanding and were thorough at teaching me what I needed to know about the whole process. My manager trusted me to give me the RFID specialist position. While not very enjoyable pay it was a good stepping stone to learning inventory work. I always had help when i needed it and always aided when needed. All in all a very comfortable place to work
good,"Decent enough place, management very reactive and static, needs a more cohesive set of SOP to be truly successful. Union shop so employees dictate whether or not there's a successful day."
good,"Learned many skill their and developed many valuable relationships including my wife.  A typical day would be to check email and act accordingly.  Then proceed to accomplish my daily activities like unload and process the truck or trucks, coach train my employees to be effective at their job.  I learned all aspects of receiving and sending out merchandise, Inventory taking, computer training, and customer interaction.  The hardest part of my job was to get everything required to satisfy the customer.  The most enjoyable was when it was accomplished..."
good,this job has a lot of fun people and ins very active and hands on it is also a fast pace job and is a good experience to have at times
good,"Macy's was a fun company to work for, but slightly disorganized.  It took them over a month to get me into training for the fine jewelry department so I was picking up shifts in different areas of the store.  I enjoyed my coworkers and the managers were cool, albeit slightly disorganized at times.  The hours were the worst part for me, especially during the holidays."
good,arrive in morning set up to push product to floor. co-workers are very helpful and management is also everyone is a team player. the hardest part of the job is moving heavy display tables and fixtures. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers.
good,low pay cutting positios due to poor store sales. Not many jobs available to associates looking for FT work due to not wanting to pay benefits.
good,"Provided outstanding customer service, meeting hourly selling and loyalty program standards. Regularly assisted clients to make purchases with both cash and financing."
good,I work all different area of macys. all employees and management are very helpful and friendly. Theres always something to do. Macys has a good atmosphere within the store
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I usually clock in and ask what sale is happening. I prefer to be inform so I can help the customer with the best service I can offer. I smile and enter work with a positive attitude. I get to interact with the customer and learn a bit more about them and how to approach someone. In order, to create the atmosphere that the customer is comfortable."
good,"All their advancement to the younger associates.solud long term job but we differed on constant changes of people and policies each day, week and month . I take great pride in my work , knowledge , appearance and character . In the end they questioned my resolve for my 20 plus years with them. I had to move on in a new direction."
good,The work was hectic but I had the opportunity to work along diverse set of people and i gained a lot of experiences and valuable skills that I can use in the future.
good,"Worked at Macy's cross county center for the holiday season."
good,"i work over forty hours a week, becauseI love my job and my clients. I create a daily and weekly task sheets so that my employees know what is expected.  I have high expectations of myself and my employees.  The hardest part of the job occurs when my numbers are down or I didn't meet my goals.  I can really beat myself up, however I am getting better at reminding myself that tomorrow is a new day.  i love seeing my clients and creating new connections with someone who is interested in using my cosmetic line."
good,The shifts were good because the store closed when the mall closed so you were not working all night or over night. Management with in the department was good they were always willing to help and teach you.
good,"everyday i would replenish the sales floor, merchandise and make sure the floor was always clean. i would do like 3 recks a day to bring down merchandise that we would need on the sales floor.also help costumers with what they were looking for."
good,I enjoyed my time at Macy's as a Michael Kors Specialist. I felt that I needed more opportunity to make better pay with better benefits.
good,"Busy and slow work days all depending on daily the number of customers shoping in the store."
good,New location work hours not flexible. Minimal work hours of 4-8 hours per week. Too many hires in a newly opened location. No employee guaranteed parking
good,"I liked the fast paced work flow in which this place had. On a busy day one is running from one side of the stock room to the other to please a customers needs in a specific pair of shoes... on a normal day one is checking to see if all the shoes are in place and in order for the next day, restocking the place and organizing any sales events"
good,"It's a fun environment to work in when you're with the right people but it can definitely get stressful when management starts pressuring you to solicit credit card applications. Also, I completely disliked the first come, first serve scheduling format."
good,didnt stay long. they told me how much they liked me but never gave communication as to if i was going to stay as a permanant or if i was not.
good,"Great sales training and experience.Good starting place for in-depth customer relations. Low pay, however, seasonal holiday and events allows for some extra spending cash. Staffers have good relationships with sales and store associates."
good,a typical day at work was fast paced followed by a long days work. Ive learned you must always be patient with customers as well as other employees in a job setting so fast. the hardest part of the job was finding room for your break amongst the hectic shopping. the most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the smiling faces of a satisfied customer.
good,"Honestly, I do like my job. I work on a team of great people and I've made great friends but, in the long run, this job will not sustain me. I do mostly signing which is basically scanning all the merchandise and changing the sales signs accordingly. I also do pretty much anything else there is to do in the store like helping customers, cleaning up the sales floor and setting up merchandise. I love my co-workers, really. I work directly with directly with a team of 5 ladies and we all get along so well. They're probably the best part of my entire job. The hardest part of the job is probably the shifts, they can start anytime from 3am- 8am and waking up at 2 to get to work can be so difficult. I like that I work in a quiet environment and I'm pretty free to just do my job in peace but, when people need help we all band together so it works out great."
good,"The managers does not treat the associates the way they should, They never have your back. The hardest part of the job was knowing something was wrong, but because the customers came first you had to give them their way.The best part of the job was being able to meet some really great people both sales associates and customers.  I built some very strong relationships."
good,"i had a lot of fun while working for macys , i also liked the friendly competition that was there, my supervisor was very understanding & helpful i enjpyed my time there"
good,I have learn that Macy's is a nice place to work because you get to deal with all kind of cultures like co-workers and customers. Getting credits is the high goal for every retail store so it is for Macy's. The rewarding side is when a customer leaves the store very satisfied and eager to get back.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"some associated were great to work with enjoyed their company as co workers."
good,"Strong company with a clear vision. "
good,"The job was fast paced and challenging! I loved every part of it, especially being able to provide my co-workers the help they needed and the customers with great service."
good,"I started at Macy's almost 5 years ago.  When I started I was hired into a new position and was tasked with helping a 3PL get started up.  As the years went by my responsibilities grew fewer and fewer.  My typical day consisted of a morning report, checking the dock for old cartons, following up with the furniture department to make sure that stock was moving.  An afternoon forecast of what truckload movements I expected for the following day.  Throughout the day I was to collaborate with the 3PL and help them with any questions they had."
good,"My co-workers were very friendly and I got along great with them. They were very nice people, and I can't imagine a place to work without them."
good,"I worked at Macy's over the holiday rush. The Job was pretty much as expected busy and without much management support.  That being said, the atmosphere was nice and the associates were helpful."
good,Twelve Hour shifts with high production required. Management very focused on production but not at the cost of their employees. Breaks are split up well to give everyone a chance to rest. The hardest part of the job was getting used to standing for that many hours in a row. The easiest part of the job was that it was very easy to learn each job function quickly
good,"Working for Macys was an overall good experience. When I completed training and started checking customers out at the cash register it got a little stressful. There would be 3 other employees and myself in the juniors department, and when I needed help I was always alone and couldn't find anyone to ask for help if I was unsure."
good,"A typical day at Macy's included cleaning, selling and pushing to open credit cards. I was a closer so I was not able to open as many credit cards as my co-workers and as a result during my review I was denied a raise and told that I needed to step it up. Working for three hours from 6-9pm during the week left me little to no clients to make my weekly credit quota. I worked hard, I cleaned and I felt like that was overlooked because of this. I loved my manager at the time, she was very nice and tried her best to help me out when it came to more hours and teaching me about certain things. She trusted me to be her right hand during inventory and whenever she was working. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer. The hardest part would have to be feeling like i was in competition with my co-workers all the time."
good,"Work day varied. You either work a short shift or a long shift. Mostly one short and two long hours. "
good,"Part of the Human Resources position allowed much interaction with interviewees and associates.  It was a pleasant and fulfilling experience as everyone was welcoming and made the workplace stress free.  The job requirements and daily work responsibilities were in line with my job as ""on call"".  I made many good friends and will remember this job with satisfaction and good memories."
good,"Macy's is not a bad place, just like any  job it has it's pros and cons but overall it is a fair work place with understandable management. I learn new thing everyday just from the people around me."
good,You can work as hard as you like or as little as you like it is up to you if you want to make your goals for the week. Management was great. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to clean up after and during a sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,This is the place to start off working when you trying to get back into the job hunt and great for the time being type of place to work. This is where you work so as put some money or a little extra in your pockets.
good,"A typical day in any retail position is assisting customers with their needs as well as ringing up their sales. In the two months I have worked at Macy's, I have learned how their register system operates and how to use it Since I am a seasonal employee, I am very flexible as to what department or area I work in from day to day. I may be scheduled to work in one department, but needed in another department. Most of the people I have worked with for the past two months have been really great to work with. They have answered my questions when I asked them as well as helped me when I needed help. The hardest part of any job dealing with customer service is working with difficult customers, but sometimes these difficult customers can and end up very nice customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to pick up a shift on any day that I want to work in the department I prefer working in."
good,"work with multiple customers at the same time"
good,"Low pay rate."
good,"Loved working with the company, management is very understanding and flexible."
good,"A typical day at work included Restocking, Re-tagging items, Running the Register, Cleaning Fitting Rooms, Lock-Up, Customer Service. Working her gave me a great sense of pride in myself along with building my customer service skills and how to tackle any problems from a different view point. Management was pretty hands on with Macy's you got what you put into it which I love. I honestly wouldn't say there was a hard part to my job Macy's was more then willing to help their employs with any problems they might have faced while on the job. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the great working atmosphere and my kind co-workers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Start with having to find parking then logging in on a register. After that, you start with what you need to do."
good,One word to describe my experience at this Location. Diversity.
good,just an overall boring seasonal job. lack of management and unsafe work place.
good,"Good place to work, buy not much room for advancement.  When it turned to Macys they remodeled and would give fashion shows and bring in designers."
good,Overall a productive environment. Great place to start a career.
good,"A typical day at work includes opening functions, such as pep rally meeting prior to store opening, opening the cash registers in my department, walking department, doing recovery so all merchandise is presentable and looking great.  Great customers and assist with any/all needs.  I have learned how to assist customers first hand in person, on the phone, as well as, locating merchandise they desire by using functions available to us via register/computer and ordering for customers accordingly.  My co-workers and I have a wonderful working relationship, everyone I work with is always willing to assist. We have created a great team and work very well with each other.  The hardest part for me, I would be aggressively obtaining new Macy's account holders  on a daily basis.  I very much enjoy my interaction with my co-workers, as well and assisting/interacting with new and repeat customers."
good,"Come in and open registers. Attend meeting to see what sales were going on through the store so we could inform customers."
good,I enjoyed my time here. I did a couple different departments.
good,I would start the day by following up with my clients and confirm any existing appointments. I learned about color and treatment by taking part in educational classes offered thru Lancome. I was part of an amazing team who always strived for better. The hardest part was to balance Lancome expectaions and Macy's expectations when they were very different.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working at my current employment.  I enjoy the busy, fast pace, ever changing environment. I have learned management skills, improved organizational skills, and become comfortable reading and interpreting business reports.  I work with a great team of managers.  We work together well on every day tasks, such as dividing up responsibilities, and driving business in each others areas when necessary.  We currently have a new Store Manager, who has brought energy and recognition for the little things to our store.  The hardest part of the job is the commute one way, and the hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast pace, never boring, and  continuous learning.  I also enjoy working with a management team."
good,I was trained to fit women for the correct size bras.  Also handled cash at opening and closing.  Enjoyed meeting all of the different customers.  Liked those I worked with and still keep in touch with them.
good,"learned macys products, ways of selling, diverse co workers, fun and easy going."
good,"Enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. Stock floor, price clothing, work on dock unloading boxes, tagging and stocking floor."
good,Very fast-paced exciting place to work. Co-workers and management were friendly. Team atmosphere.
good,A typical day at work was to invite customer’s that were passing by to our counter and to demonstrate our new products. I would always show two to three items at the same time that would go together. If my customer would like what i demonstrated to her and would like to purchase the item then i would walk to the cash register and ring her up. She would leave with a smile on her face. We are able to apply makeup to demonstrate. This is how I would make my goal.
good,"The store was usually severely understaffed on really busy days. But when there was practically no customers in the store, there were too many employees scheduled and most people were left standing around with nothing to do..."
good,One of the top points working at this company is the flexible schedules that they offer. It makes managing your personal and work life very easy.
good,"A typical day consisted of contacting clients for shopping needs, making appointments, promoting & marketing sales. I learned alot from Macys..How to deal with the growing changes in a retail environment, how to sell according to clients needs & how to grow a business by selling. The management team at Macys is very dynamic. They are team players, advocates for driving results & making results matter. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the changes to keep up with the fast pace growing retail world. Accomplishing large sales volumes also proved to be difficult at times. But the most ENJOYABLE part of my job was building the relationships with the clients. Getting to know them on a one on one basis makes the job so much more worth while.."
good,They're always there when I needed them. I learned good customer service. I got along with very co-worker there. The hardest part of the job was standing after 6 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the christmas music during the season.
good,"great people to work with, good environment to work in. great manager. however this place went out of business so we all were laid off."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"On a typical day of work on Macy's I would check out customers and help them with any questions that they had about our sales or about our merchandise. My coworkers were very helpful in the fact that when any other associate needed help they were willing to give assistance,"
good,"A typical day at Macy's included assisting customers in the Men's department. Keeping the department organized and ready for sales and the customer. "
good,"The hardest part of the job was coming in @ 2:30am and working until 1:30pm for inventory. Management seemed overwhelmed at times, which seemed to lead to a lack of communication between management and sales associates. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers. Overall it was a pleasant work place."
good,"meeting new people"
good,The overall job is very fun because within merchandising lets you put your on creative touch and mind into placing product out onto the floor. The work environment is fast paced but that is hat keeps you motivated in doing your job. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect with moving fixtures and trying not to get hurt in the process. The hours are also the hardest part because during the holiday season the hours get crazy and very early mornings. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the creative aspect and having fun making the floor look good.
good,Macy's had wonderful management as well as co-workers.  Everyday was a new day to do something different and learn something new.  Anything from working in different departments to learning about new products.  The hardest part of the job was probably having hours cut but the most enjoyable was being able to work with such great people and also to provide great customer service.
good,"I would get to work count out my registers to open them and get to straightening out my department. Can't really say I learned much other than I can tell some brands of jewelry and handbags simply by looking at them. The management at the location I was at was cool. Hardest thing to do here was inventory. Not because it was hard, but because of the hours. The perks were my favorite part of working here. Something called Macy's bucks."
good,macys is a good experience if you want to get into more fashion they have fashion majors there to assist you
good,I loved everything about my job except when it can to my hours. i would have to be in 5-6a.m mostly everyday and i have a toddler which did not become a problem. Due to me not having a car and running on public transportation times i started coming 10mins late and was asked after the great job i was doing there for that time to resign my position because they did not wanna fire me. I am very hurt by that cause i was one of the best support staff they had but i am moving forward.
good,"i worked as a merchandiser for 4 distinct brands and i helped with markdowns, helped other places of the store to set up displays and dressed mannequins. "
good,Management could have made the day less stressful and overbearing. The most enjoyable part of any day would be the interaction between customers including brides. The hardest part would have to be explaining to customers that they couldn't combine coupons on electrics.
good,"its a good place to meet a good group of diverse people. it has its up and downs, meaning on some days you can be bored but on the day of the sells, you get to show your stuff. Also you get a lot of perks working there."
good,"A typical day at Macy's is just like any typical day at any retail store, just add 10x the work and workers since its at herald square the biggest retail place in the world."
good,Liked macy's.I liked helping the customers with what they needed and I always helped the best to my knowledge.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Macy's because the employees of Macy's are very motivating. Every Monday we would have meetings and recognitions of all employees. I learned how to use my creativeness and productiveness to create a store display. I get along very well with everyone therefore my co workers and I created a relationship where we would come together as a team and have fun while doing it. The hardest part of the job is having to work with other departments of the store but not everyone would be on the same page as everyone else, leaving the visual department to do more then what they should. The most enjoyable part of this job was creating displays."
good,"Love going to work always feel like I'm going out, I enjoy it very much it's fun."
good,"The manager of my department is very thorough, professional and easy to get along with. My co-workers are very friendly although some can be unprofessional. There isn't much room for growth within the company and the pay is very low. I enjoy working with people and having a fast paced job."
good,from this job it helped me learn how to small talk with people of diffeerent culture race and age. it was a competitive job there was always set goals for employees to make which pushed you to talk to stangers in the store to make sales.
good,"Sales and training of new employees.  "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Opened Macy's credit accounts, made sure fitting rooms were free of clothing and clean, scanned merchandise, replenished sales floor, counted currency accurately, provided wonderful customer service."
good,The customers are who I enjoyed the most. I learned how to use the tools I had to keep my customers happy. Management was okay. They were not very helpful. Some of my co-workers were wonderful and some were not so nice. The hardest part was trying to get customers to open store credit cards. That was not easy and they expect you to do so many a day. The customers and a few co-workers were the best part of the job.
good,"Retail services"
good,"A nice place to work, friendly customers, beautiful clothes and a nice atmosphere. The day starts and depending on the department you'll be busy until the day is done."
good,"there is no typical day at macys its either busy slow frustrating or jus so random there is easy days at times but working in retail you jus never know,ive learned lots of product knowladge why we sell and dont sell the things we do why we have these procedures and rules we have, management, they kinda go through managers alot since ive been there about 1 or 2 every year or so, but all are willing to help within their abilities if so and are friendly some kinda play favorites as well, some will jump on you about doing your work than others but all around great people, our co workers are open and friendly oriented but we all complain about the same thing which is lack of hours and the sporadicness of our hours as well, there really isnt anything to hard about being a sales associate but lots of product knowladge what we sell and what other stores sell or may not have how to use the pos system very well (pos) stands for (point of sale) and keeping up with recovery on busy days can be frustrating at times if by yourself or the other coworker isnt willing to pull their weight, and the most enjoyable part is seeing the other associates and working with the co workers and once in a while we get good customers who are fun to be around and all the nice and new products we get in "
good,"Open and Close register, customer service, serve the customers needs while trying to reach your own sales goals. the hardest part of the job was trying to reach your goal without letting the customer know and without stepping on co workers toes. the most enjoyable part of the day was hearing all the stories and why  the customers were in the store shopping and how i could help  them."
good,For seasonal work I enjoyed that you get to make your own schedule!!!
good,The training for Macy's consists of a serious of lesson that you do on a computer and when you finish you are put on the floor.  There is no one to show you what to do on the floor because everyone is so worried about making a sales goal.  Which I think takes away from real customer service.  Because many of the employees are territorial about customers and dressing rooms.  There a few good managers.  Most are young and have no experience in management.  I have learned that if you are closing a certain area for the night the best you can doing especially on the weekend to to work the rolling racks that overflow with clothes.  Many days the clothes are piled up not from customers but from lazy associates who leave it for someone else to do. What I do enjoy about the job is the friends I have made with the few employees that take the time to teach you and get to know you.  Also the very colorful customers that come to shop.
good,I have learned a lot with customer service and how to work in a fast past environment. While gaining the ability to learn about products and organization.
good,Macy's is a great place to help people select products for themselves or as gifts. The team works together to keep the commitment of delivering the services to the customers.
good,my co workers was  fun differents cultures and ethnics. the hardest part to open credit cards.
good,Would make sure the jewlrey is put out each morning or night at closing. Had goals to make each day. Co-workers were all easy to work with. 
good,"This was a seasonal job during the holidays. I had fun working at this job. The employees were nice to work with and I liked the merchandise therefore, I was passionate at work. I ran the cash register and helped customers find what they were looking for, according to their taste and desires."
good,"Stayed busy by choice. I learned to remain self-motviated even when others didn't. Manages each had their own ways of doing things, so I learned to deal with what each individual did best. Co-workers were eager to learn knew things when challenged to learn. No hard parts of job, all work has challenges that are best described as leaning experiences. My favorite part was developing loyalty with my customers."
good,Usually the day starts with seeing the mess that is you assigned area. Always take care of the customers first. Some managers pass by to check department and to give suggests or offer help.
good,they have a great balance between work and home life. A big problem is not enough work.
good,job is easy. the pay was only 7.60 you cant live off of that but i did enjoy my boss.
good,Learned money management. Percentage values. co-workers are awesome. Tons of personalities. Hardest part of the job was getting people to enroll in loyalties. but the most enjoyable part was meeting people from other cities/states/countries from all over the world.
good,"Macy's either was very busy or very dry depending on the day and the season, and it was a nice place."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working here gave you plenty to do, advancement, and flexibility depending on your needs."
good,"Besides the store i worked for closing, Macy's is just a really nice friendly work enviroment!"
good,"This is an easy going work environment, but there are pros and cons to this. The management does not always take care of their employees and their needs well, nor do they manage well in general. My personal manager has less knowledge about our department then majority associates and is often hard to contact if she is needed(she will even ignore associates at times). Because of her lack of management, this is a relaxed environment. It is not an uptight job and you get good breaks. Co- workers are generally good people and are very helpful, but work issues between co-workers are not handled as well as they could be. I love how easygoing the environment is, it allows me to do my job well and not stress about going to work, but I do not like the relationship I have with my manager."
good,I worked there for almost two years and learned a lot about customer service. It taught me how to deal with angry customer and be patient. It taught me to have self confidence and how to work in a team more efficiently.
good,its a nice environment to work at but it gets boring after the holidays
good,working with children and having fun with them and also a very active job
good,"I would usually clock in and begin selling shoes if customers were in that section, otherwise I would do stock and manage the maintainance of the stock room. The benefits o this job was that I got to uplift the spirits of people by selling the perfect shoe at a great price which is very important for the demographic I was working with which were women. The hardest part of the job was struggling to get a very high commission because sales were low or because of the amount of employees on the schedule."
good,A great place to work and continue to grow your customer service skills with several departments a company respected across the country
good,"Unload truck worked with great people had great laughs while working hard.The job started as a seasonal job then was permanently hired on. People I worked with was great fun , they liked me a lot.Only thing I did not like was having to go online to find when I worked and even then I missed a day when the truck date got changed last min and nobody even called me even after I never showed up till the next day."
good,"I put away stock, either on the floor or in the stock room. I set up merchandise displays. I organized stock rooms."
good,i liked that everyone is just so laid back. i have learned the whole process of what happens before taking the clothes on the floor.
good,When I was hired during the holiday I mad 7.50 but when they hired new people in the spring the started them off with 8.00. I never received a raise and there is no over-time Love All the people I worked with
good,i loved my co-workers at macys it tought me alot about the retail environment.
good,i love the pay alot i m good work but sad i got lay off that job but on thing is they pick wrong people who get layoff who work hard then other and other people just not doing job well talking the phobne
good,"When I worked in this position it was still a local company. At the time this was not a position I would have encouraged anyone to take. Immediate management was adversarial, worked less days then their people and to some degree were clueless as to what it took to do this particular position. I cannot speak to what it is like today. I left this company that I had given 15 years to because of the managers I had. So I had weathered many different types of managers over the years and this was the first time I no longer had the energy or drive to keep fighting."
good,Working with commission was great. The hours were complicated
good,Macy's is a fun place to work co workers were nice being around people all the time I learned to deal with multiple personalitiesManagemennt never really listened to the stock people
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's. I was part-time in Juniors. I learned how to run the registers as well as how to promote and sell. Most of the management was really good, there were only a few glitches toward the end of my employment. The hardest part of the job was when customers did not know what they wanted, you pretty much had to guess and help them. The most enjoyable part is the fun we all had together."
good,Staff and management are wonderful to work with. Just the cooperate and floor management seem to never be on the same page of store operations
good,"As a sales associate/cashier I was always busy. I was an=ble to help customers and other employees. My managers were very helpful and always had something new to teach me so it made work very intresting. The other employees were always joyful so it made work a better place and a great shopping experience foe all our customers, even if someone just came in to browse. The hardest part of the job was feeling that I woud'nt be able to succeed in helping someone but the most enjoyable part of the the job was being able to ask another employee for help. All in all Macys is a wonderful company to work for."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,My co-worker are all good people.
good,"work days pretty easy going, plenty of time to get the work done and flexibility if we needed to put in or change the times in order to get some jobs done"
good,60+ hours a week
good,"i worked there and i would have worked there longer but they couldn't put me into the hours i needed to keep my apartment,i was working 17 hours a week,and they hired so many people that it was to many people on the sales floor and people were just standing around. that's how you know theres to many people but not enough customers. i call it bad management. But the company was great ."
good,"In the mourings when the store opens it starts off very slow; this depends in what department of the store. Go back and forth to the regester and clothes racks. The day will usually speed up around the afternoon; this means standing at a regester for three or more hours straight this is common on the weekens. This was my first job and I learned a lot about customer service. I learned hand how an outfit may appear on a mannequin can have and affect on people. With the outfit you can change just the color of the shirt and more people may have an appeal to it. However, management wasn't that great; there were some managers that are willing to help you weather it was with a customer or with a product. The co-workers that I had worked with were great anything that I needed help with or had questions they took there time explaining and showing tasks that was at hand. One of the worst part of the job is being on your feet all day, not being able to take breaks when you need to, and rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that your co-workers try and have fun just to make the atmostphere calm, you get to meet different types of people, and over is a great learing experience."
good,"It was a job I was hoping to move up but didn't. It basically going to work, making your sales, being aggressive in sales. Coworkers are very competative, sometimes rude."
good,A will equipped job. Every associate has a gaol and must complete the goal to help you and the business keep going and this is very significant
good,A typical day at Macy's was enjoying seeing new and known customers on a regular basis. Selling products and reaching a sales goal was an everyday must. I learned how to approach customers and greet them in a manner that made them feel comfortable and at home. I also learned how to ask open ended questions to help sell items and add to items already being purchased. The managers were very helpful and understanding. All of the managers that I ran across was willing to help me with any issues that i presented to them. The hardest part of the job was to learn each and every product with the pros and cons of each product. Every thing else was a breeze. The most enjoyable part of the job was being the top sales person on many of occasions
good,"Typical work day is average and professional, I learned to do inventory and the management was very professional. Co-workers where understanding and patient as well as diligent. There were no difficult task to the job, everything was simple. I enjoyed working at my own pace."
good,it used to fun and the store manager really valued employees but in recent years they push employees to be too comptetive and t cater more on customer complaints over minor things! they do not listen to employees concerns! or understand! they do not defend associates when customers complain!
good,"Great training,Great management. The managers and leads work with you on difficult calls and troubled customers."
good,This is a wonderful place to work. The people are great it is my first call center experience. If I wasn't relocating I would continue to work there.
good,I really enjoyed working at Macy's because it was a upbeat place to work. The management was helpful in coaching you in areas you lacked strength in. Overall was a great place to work.
good,"Macy's is a good place to work if you are interested in a retail department store. Pleasant working environment, low pay."
good,Was a good customer service learning experience and always learned something new each day no matter how small of a fact it was appreciated that it was something new.
good,Working with the support team means coming in early mornings to get the store ready for opening. Setting up sales and and stocking the floor are the main priorities for working as a merchandiser.
good,"Working at Macy's is like not working a day in your life."
good,There was always something to look forward to at work. I enjoyed my coworkers and appreciate them for the team building atmosphere they provided for me. Macy’s was a great company to work for but I now want to expand my horizons and continue to grow and be an asset for my next workplace.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working at Macy's two years . Co-workers great, helpful, friendly! . Management , expectations keeps changing . The hardest job I worked for so little money. Never had a review two years. New manager come in  , highest store sales. Got award, meet an greet  district manager said good job . one week later let me go never missed a day's work"
good,"Working at the Macy's Warehouse was not the best. The hours were good and the pay was way more than I expected, but, it was not the most sanitary place. Many people would knowingly come in sick. The systems/electronic devices they had for employee's were extremely difficult to navigate and learn, as well as had many problems."
good,Labor intensive. It varies at each store. I dont know why this is required. The scheduling if very flexible. The pay is minimum wage. There are more hours during the holidays
good,Nice working there for the holiday season.   The only down side is that I messaged my team lead about staying permanently and she never messaged me back on that.
good,Recent developments of management at my location have caused moral and many other things to drastically dip. When brought up to higher position it has gone ignored as well.
good,Somewhat of a miscommunication with specific managers and employees. A lot of turn around of people coming and going starting from the top. Great store and the departments don't always acknowledge the people in their area.
good,"Dress business casual. Dont be nervous, tell interviewer about yourself. “Sell yourself”, make them impressed with you and make them want to have someone like you on their team"
good,".macys is a company that has been around for generations, not only is the staff diverse but so are the customers and environment. The many departments gives you the opportunity to grow"
good,There’s always room for growth in the company.I have a part time schedule but can easily do 40 hours a week because of the flexibility of picking up shifts.
good,I helped people out in anyway I could and did my best to learn all the departments so I was able to pick up more shifts. It was a fun first job and  I made a few friends out of it!
good,"For me working for Macy's was great , everytime I walked out onto the sales floor I felt like I was a part of a great production ,  although I have been in retail for many years I really learned a lot about customer service from my experience at Macy's."
good,"Easy productive job, training could be better for some tasks,otherwise straight forward easy logistics job, would still be working there were it not an hour drive"
good,This was my favorite job. I loved working with people and learning the new products. Clothes is a big thing to me so i really thrived in the sales of them.
good,"The warehouse associate job was a good experience for the most part. The only real problem is that the company works on a point system to for tardiness and absences, with there being no really excused absence and your direct supervisor has no say in anything having to do with the points."
good,Great place to work but alway layoff. It very difficult to advance before most employee stay at their jobs for 25 or more years. But overall benefit great.
good,This is a very good company to work for and grow with they treat everyone with respect and give all works a chance to learn more then what you came in knowing
good,Schedule flowed well and so much work to do😄Had a great and hardworking team! I also had the freedom to work independently! Great company to work for lots of opportunities benefits and employee discount. Freedom to manage your schedule online is very convenient venue to as well.
good,The people were great I love it there. They always have something going on for employees and almost everyone was treated with respect. It’s not a hard job
good,The job was ok not hard in anyway. I would like to return there .The  hourly  could be a little  more. The discount could be higher on some things. the coworkers we always willing to help you if you got in a jam.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked at Macy's on two separate occasions a good job especially for a young person or a older person who just wants something extra to do in their free time.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, the hours were flexible and the environment was friendly. I did not leave due to negative circumstances on the retailers part but due to health concerns in a personal level."
good,"Macy's is a big franchise and has a pretty good amount of sales a day, and what I would do is find the online purchases and their items then package and deliver them. It isn't as easy as it seems when their is a three level store with limited stock on some of the online items"
good,"Macy's is a great place to work during the winter and holiday seasons, During the spring and summer there are a lot of cut backs. The great thing is you get to meet a lot of new people."
good,Discount on fragrance cologne make up or clothes you cant beat that so great Macy is one of my favorite store and it’s a plus working for them cool job
good,"I like the macy’s Job because different type of people to get meet them and sometimes chat with them. It’s like a family."
good,I have not been employed at Macy’s to give a complete and fair review. I feel like training was lacking. I feel I could do a better job for them with better training
good,Just Always Find Something To Do Be Cause The Hours Are Long But The People You Work With Are Great The Managers Are Good When They Want But Hey It’s A Job I Like It Overall
good,"I loved working here, I had some unfortunate things happen to me this year and I received bereavement and was given a day or two to collect myself. We also had an onsite counseling during this tough time. Seasonal is the best time to work because you can work as many hours as you want!"
good,Over all it’s nice to work at Macy’s specially for a first time at retail . I wish they have flexible hours specially for mothers who need to be at home by 5 o’clock
good,"This is a great place to work. I already had recruitment experience, so it was a cake walk for me. The environment was fun, and I would definitely return."
good,"Rating is good , pay was fair. The hours are long and hectic during the holidays. All hands on deck for Black Friday and the day after Christmas. I did not get the loyalty I expected"
good,My opinion is based only upon what I have been subjected to. The manager that I work for is not really an attentive manager to her employees unless it shines the light on her. Her scheduling practices are not always fair if left to do it on her own. Rarely does she offer thanks to her team unless you are a favorite of hers. She's definitely taught those who usually care to stop caring so much. Glad to be here and have this life experience. Definitely learning a lot about politics at work and how it works in specific work cultures.
good,"I really enjoy this job always a chalenge and I love dealing whit so many people in dayli basis."
good,"the growth that we experienced at macys.com from 2008-2015 was unprecedented. the team grew, the business grew, the profitability grew and the processes improved along the way."
good,I really enjoyed working there. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only part I didn't like was the rude customers. Some were very impatient when I first started because I was new to the job and still hadn't learned how to do everything. However there was one lady that was very nice and understanding and she even told another customer that she was being very rude. Unfortunately rude customers come with the job. But the staff was nice so that's all that matters.
good,I learned alot about the company. The company has alot of benefits. Made a few new good friends from other countries. An gained a new skills picking and order selecting using a scanner.
good,"If you work on the dock, unloading the truck, they only start you at 9.50. Like the cashiers. And it isn’t fair given we literally have the weight on our shoulders."
good,"I was hired as seasonal for a visual merchandising position. This was my second time being hired as holiday help and the second time I was told that they could keep me on as full time.  But as all show business gigs, nothing is certain.  A short lived 5 week job was fun and once again I exited stage left as I was waving good bye.  Welcome to retail is what I would summarize and close with."
good,Great to work for if you need overnight work great with over time hours like helping the empolyes with making sure they get to work with no problems great place
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Macy's was  working in a healthy environment , good management team and employee discount.  Management staff engaged with employees and  consistently set positive outlook."
good,clock in then find out what floor you are working for the day or the week everyone got alone with each other the supervisor was nice and the work sometimes was not easy but it was a team the hardest was to leave due to the pay if they gave more i would have stayed
good,"If you like working in a fast paced environment, this is a good place to start. I learned a lot here and management will work with you most of the time."
good,Management kills the sense of self-responsibility by opposing extra tasks and not appreciating the work you do. Safe and clean environment of work. Nice people working with you.
good,"Managers were pleasant, coworkers were mostly pleasant.  Exceptionally busy and hectic on black Friday, but that's expected. Policies are easy and make sense"
good,"macys they do train and teach you how things suppose to be. "
good,"I learned customer service and how to conduct CCTV and floor surveillance for suspicious behavior from shoplifters, Data entry run reports for the company, apprehend shoplifters, Lock and alarm the building,The best part of the job was meeting our goals that were set for the day"
good,"Easy place to work at, they work with you about your schedule. Managers listened and helped employees. Co workers were nice and friendly, and helped train me."
good,"I had a wonderful experience working there, however they set unrealistic goals and expectations for part time workers that can only be achieved with the hours of a full time."
good,Supportive management and good team work but competition from online retailers has resulted in under staffing of the sales floor. Fun incentives and rewards for a job well done.
good,I enjoyed the time I was employed there. I would however work there again if given the opportunity.  Preferably not just seasonal employment.  I would love working in cosmetics department.
good,Seasonal employees shd not be mistreated for serving customers who are repeat customers for certain sales staff when those people have their hands full. IT'S ABOUT THE CUSTOMER; not how much commission reg sales staff can generate.
good,"Great company to work for. Great work environment. Leaders are great, never an issue with any coworker. Great company to work for. Nothing else to say."
good,"At Macys, you will have your hands in every department.  You will learn every aspect of operations, customer service, on boarding, coaching, and training."
good,"Overall I really enjoyed  Macy's and its MAGIC Mission, unfortunately  the store where I worked where more focused on hiring from the outside rather within and this is the reason why many of us left. Despite if being an amazing company workers would like to have the opportunities to grow in the company."
good,enjoyed working there learned a lot about sales and working in a retail based environment they had me doing a lot around the store so now when i work somewhere similar i’ll have the experience
good,Macy's as a whole is a solid company with opportunities to grow if you have a manager that is willing to spend time with you to develop your skill set.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is a good place for a part-time jobs. It is a friendly environment, the managers and people I worked with are approachable and helpful. I learned to deal with people from different walks of life. It is not always pleasant but it motivates you to work even harder to give the customers satisfactory services."
good,"The macys where i work was a very unorganized one. When i needed a managers help they were no where to be found. Macys does not have a cusromer service department so us sale associates had to deal with eveyrthing in regards to the customers, while a the same time keeping the fitting rooms and the floor clean, neat, organized, and easy to find items."
good,just helping customer for whatever they needed in the Mens department. If was helping an customer with clothes or orders you would be folding shirt tables
good,"It is a nice company to work for. Schedule is not fixed, sometimes work life balance is impacted. Not easy to move up to management position of you're just a sale associate. Good benefits."
good,"It’s okay for a part time employee..."
good,"Time spent at this position was not wasted. There is a lot to learn outside the normal expectation of Security in general. Time management, social interaction and manipulation (when stopping a subject), and multiple technical roles."
good,Yo evaluo está compañía de buena y no de exelente porque deberían cuidar y considerar más a sus choferes que se revientan el día entero y Aceves parte de la noche bajo agua cargando piezas bien pesadas a cambio de muy poco.
good,I really do not have a review to give at this time. It was a part time job during the holidays. You received discounts as an employee. It was nice working there.
good,"Good people, Good Work/ life balance. Poor compensation, benefits and little growth opportunities.  Good place to start your career but I would jump ship before it completely sinks."
good,"Macy need to train new employees better , the managers need to know there employees. They also need to have a better training program for new employees that don't know the store merchandise"
good,"Great place to work! Wonderful environment, even better people. I enjoyed my time there. I was sad to leave , however my time was up, so I decided to depart."
good,Great working environment interacting with customers. A lot of positive coworkers and customers. Providing great customer service by completing transactions on the cash register and helping out customers walking around in store.
good,"Need better team manager and team Leader  but everything was okay. I have learn to be more patient, learn how to get done with my tasks in fashion time. it was hard to keep cool when you under pressure, the most I join my company and my co/workers,  I  love doing fulfilling. "
good,Fast paced environment. Worked with great people. Learned a lot and quickly. Great place to start up and continue to grow. They just have to raise their pay.
good,"Productive and fun working place with a lot of great people."
good,"It is what you would expect from a retail position. You are expected to clean the floor, help customers, answer the phone, assist in checkout, handle money, add and subtract large numbers quickly, know store policy, offer the customer the greatest service you can and be on time all the time."
good,"Overall a good place to work."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Willing to work with you on your schedule and also will assist with obtaining more hours if needed. Super early morning hours esp for the signing team
good,Flexible schedules perfect for students in school. Opportunity to grow within the company. great learning experience. Most busiest are October through December.
good,Responsible for up to 100 colleges and several managers at one time. Understand how to drive business and create best shopping experience. Greeting  customers in a warm and friendly manner.  Grow and communicate with team to everyone have the same vision to achieve desired results. Celebrate daily and redirect when needed.
good,"Income is not what it should/ could be. Hours expected to work are minimal, really! Which is really odd so you actually have a life working here, if you can afford it. Management okay from my experience, do what you're expected to do, sell warranty and you're good. Very rigid structure, many rules which is necessary to run a company this size."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Macy's.  We were one of the top stores in our region, but with the downturn in the retail environment, were one of the many locations forced to close."
good,"It was a good temporary job, didn't learn much. With the job I had, I knew my schedule a week in advance and only worked about every other week for 8-16 hours."
good,"My overall experience was great. Working in retail is tough. You must have a lot of patience. I worked in KOP and lucky to have learned quite a lot especially when it came to Commissioned Sales. Worked there part time for six years as flex associate which enabled me to work all over the store. That is a plus because you are never stuck in one Dept. in Center City, I worked there about 6 months. Enough said right there! "
good,"doing security is very stressful there, you never know what's going to happen with an apprehension... only good thing is they are very flexible with scheduling that's why i lasted so long there...."
good,"I like that you can pick up shifts if you want to work more hours. I think that's the cool part about the job. Also, management is pretty cool. That's why I gave 4 out of 5 stars."
good,It was a very stressful place I had to always cover for everyone there was a couple times I worked 10 hours and almost didnt even get a lunch break i had to ask for it. They dont care about the employees and the managers weren't the best at there job
good,"Macy, is a great place to work and be in. Its not only fun, yet a lot to do. Its very instructive, and organized. The directions are expressed to the extreme point of knowing."
good,there are projects and a set schedule for the days of work. hours are either always given or rarely provided. customer and employee service it key to this company. but i do hope that they can be more accepting of positive ideas to help work flow as an employee.
good,"Working for Macy's asset protection team required and reinforced a lot of skills involving teamwork and the ability to deal with different kinds of people, whether other associates, regular shoppers, or shoplifters. Unique skills are learned and overall it is actually exciting to build up a case and apprehend the repeat offenders. The pay tops out around $14 an hour, which I consider very low for the requirements of detectives in this department, and starts at $10.35. My ultimate reason for leaving, besides very noncompetitive pay, was the hourly schedule. I was required to work roughly 10 hours each day scheduled, from 12:00 PM to 10:00 PM. This left very little time for a personal life or any other relatively productive outside-of-work activities. Overall, I did enjoy the Macy's atmosphere and had very few complaints regarding my coworkers and managers."
good,I was there as seasonal and the store location was a good location to work at. Only thing about my manager was she would post the schedule then the next day she would change it so I would show up on a day off but would still make me stay (I would stay because my commute was 30 mins) She would also demand me to stay longer. There was also a lack of coverage in my department. Other than that as a seasonal job it was okay
good,The overall interview at Macy’s went well. The manager who interviewed me was very positive and easy to speak with. I was very excited to work at Macy’s. I loved my job and I loved my hours. I would definitely love to work at Macy’s again.
good,"Macys upper management has the right idea, yet do not provide enough support. Each quarter hours get reduced for staff on floor yet goals maintain high and so does expectation. Management have to do lots of the work to pick up for the cut in employees, this really affects your ability to work and coach staff."
good,Great client focused career path.  While working there I developed a few long term clients that I still service.  I miss the training and perks. I had an overall great experience.
good,"It would have been a great experience for me. Except I was disgruntled by how I was treated. The work that I got was easy. Putting stuff on the shelves, I loved doing it too. I preferred doing that than been a cashier! The person that supervised me was very nice."
good,I learned a decent amount about retail with my time at macys. It was a good first job. Its a good company to work for if you are interested in retail. I worked receiving which involved early mornings.
good,"The environment is calm but can be very busy when we have special sales. I loved helping customers pick out jewelry that matched their tastes, and I loved the commission from making jewelry sales."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Seasonal position but enjoyed working there and the people there. I found a permanent job elsewhere so I left at the end of the season. Would recommend.
good,"I worked at Macy's for 10 years. the first 7 was great then corporate started changing management, then they started to force out full timers that were there for 20,30 & 40 years with the company. They gave them the option to go part time or leave. I left after 10 years because the politics."
good,"Fast pace business with so many different task you can learn. great opportunity, great management team, diverse work place. the job wasn't hard at all, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"Overall, Macys has many opportunities to learn, advance and grow your skills. Other than basic training, you will have to be pretty self sufficient.  The company needs to do a much better job of investing in long term employees.  The top level executives focus all their efforts into recruiting and developing newbies/recent college grads.  "
good,"Macy's can be a very challenging place to work at times, yet can be fun. During the holidays, it gets very busy and that's where the challenge comes in."
good,I mostly worked in the receiving area and it was actually really busy but fun most of the days. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind hard work and can motivate themselves.
good,"A typical day at work includes meeting and greeting customers, being prompted to ask for new membership with the Macys Credit Card, and handling returns for customers who have items to return."
good,"fun place to work with. with a lot good managers and a lot fun employees.and a lot fun customers with promotions, great enviroment and leadership. good flexible hours"
good,My time spent  at Macys was very rewarding I learned a great deal from the company and I was never bored always had something to do. I learned how to put out merchandise . I learned how to communicate customers and build a rapport with my customers so I could help them with what they needed.
good,"Macys as a big corporation you would thing that working there was a real pain, however working here was a great deal of fun for me not just because the work was varied but the people working there were all very welcoming and nice"
good,"Christmas help worked four ten hour shifts. Lots of walking. I only worked  through Christmas but it seemed like a very goog job, would like to have worked there longer"
good,"I started working as a seasonal, but ended up as a part-time flex employee. When I first started there,I felt so unprepared when I was put on the floor for the first time. They dont really train, they just have you watch videos then go on the floor and watch someone,which I don't believe is enough. Overall though, it's a nice environment and the managers are super nice.  There will always be a rude customer here and there,or a stressful day with a lot to do but it's not bad at all."
good,"Daily sales needed to be met. Opening new credit cards was an important"
good,"I was hired to fulfill one position, but ended up all over the store with little training or supervision. Lots of busy work handed to me with hardly any purpose, and I never knew who was in charge."
good,"I had a great experience working at Macy's. It was a fast-paced environment since we had to sign the whole store in 4 hours with only a few people. Otherwise, management is great and it's a fun environment."
good,Wokring at Macy's is a fast paced enviorment. My experience was great you get to meet new people and learn new things about merchandise and history of the store
good,"If you enjoy clothing, Macy's is the best place in the valley to work.  The employees are friendly and work well as a team.  For the most part, the customers at Macy's are great.  I enjoy helping them fulfill their needs and find just what they are looking for."
good,Always enjoy helping customers locate and find shoe sizes and colors they would like or be interested in. Keep a friendly and warm attitude with everyone so they will come back and shop at Macys.
good,"It was an ok place to work.  I was contracted through another company, but it seemed ok.  I liked the variety of calls I took.  It was never boring.  The system was complex, but once learned it was ok..."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working here was quite easy, depending on which department you worked. Only issue was advancing within the organization, I stay a sales associate for years and was never offered the opportunity to grow."
good,"The best part of my job was absolutely my coworkers.  The store seemed to really make sure to hire people who were fun, energetic, and mostly easy to get along with.  Just a typical work day was usually somewhat fun with my coworkers."
good,Know your employee rights keep in contact with human resources and be well-documented any events. Also keep work interactions well for assistance with any work.
good,"I loved working for Macy's! I love fashion, and shopping, so it was perfect for me. Working in fine jewelry was great because of the hourly pay and the commission. Macy's allows the employees to make administrative decisions to keep the customers happy, and things running smoothly."
good,its a great place to get many hours each season. they typically hire people for temporary jobs but they leave room open to be hired onto the main team.
good,"cool company to work for. The job is pretty straight forward and the management enforces the rules. The lunch breaks are too short but the work environment is casual , yet professional."
good,"Yo estaba encargada de los provadores lo cual era tener un trato amable con las personas y asistir amis compañeras con cualquier cambio de tallas y prendas de ropa."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's backstage. Backstage is a ""Macy's outlet store"" inside of a normal Macy's. It's designed more like an outlet store than a department store, its lower prices than normal, etc. Because of this, it was like working inside a small store inside of a Macy's. I got the benefits of high starting pay (over $10 an hour), picking your own schedule, etc, with the benefits of working in a much more natural feeling environment then a department store. The best part was making your own schedule, I prefer mornings and was able to actually work mornings with this. It was as simple as going online and picking available shifts from a calander."
good,Nice people easy work I enjoyed it while I was there seasonal part time I would consider returning back the management was awesome and the work time was reasonable
good,Overall employees are given a lot of autonomy. It helped me gain confidence in my abilities to run a department and oversee what happens there. They pay very low and they give customers too much leeway with returns and other demands which is probably where they lose money which leads to lower pay for employees. Management is usually very helpful and is good at teaching you new things if you take initiative to ask.
good,Okay company but not a company to grow with. Enjoy the team I worked with.  There was a goal you had to reach everyday and plus if you weren’t commission based the sales would affect you
good,"Offload truck, after that take clothes out of boxes and organize clothes by brand and take out to be put out in the sale floor. Very chill and easy but during holidays it was horrible."
good,Macy's is a good place to work. I was happy with my schedule but no with the benefits offered. I enjoyed my coworkers and discount. Friendly managers.
good,"Was a good place to work.  Was there during the dot com crash, full time employment was not available. Also was downsized.  Moved Macy's West to New York."
good,"My position at Macy's allowed me to continue my full-time paralegal studies.  I did enjoy the feeling of camaraderie with both team mates and customers. I became well versed with hiring and training procedures for new associates. Took responsibility for daily cash handling and balancing of all registers, opening and closing procedures."
good,Overall pretty good experience! They offer a lot of hour to pick up or give away. Sales incentives are good if you work in certain department. Management does well keeping the store organized.
good,Very customer friendly very safe with the coworkers very enjoyable place to work to learn new things to learn more experiences every day was a learning experience learn something every single day working in the back we’re going to brunch with you with customers
good,"Started off with the company before the recession. They offered tuition reimbursement, employee events, and lots of opportunities to advance. Over the years, Macy's have eliminated their tuition reimbursement, cut back on employee events, and eliminated many jobs."
good,"Had daily sales goals to reach, although my particular sales role was not commission based. A great perk being a department specialist was a monthly clothing allowance if monthly sales goals were achieved."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I was on a delivery truck delivering furniture all over Maryland Virginia and dc. I must greet all customers in a respectful way. Also I had to wear shoe covers over my feet on hard wood floors
good,I loved working at Macy’s. It gave me a good experience. My co workers were overall very polite and professional and helped me whenever it was needed.
good,"I really liked the job I would have stayed if I had been paid better. The work was fun and rewarding. You can move up the ladder, but only when there are openings."
good,i learned a lot about asset protection from the sudden movements and clue down too different types of technology used to help prevent lost of products.
good,Great company to grow within even while going to school or holding down a second job very flexible and pay is great and they also help with school finances
good,The work kept me busy but it was a fight tooth and nail to get any hours.  Otherwise it was an ok place to work.  Nothing special about it either way.
good,a day at work was awesome and really cool wish I can go back to Macys and work again so I can be in commission again but it was good while I was there manage meant was good
good,"The warehouse was disorganized, and it was hard to find things. The lines were long and customers would get disgusted and leave. The management was not so great compared to Target. But I always worked hard and did what was required of me and treated the customers fairly and in a kind way."
good,"I worked for that company for 15 years.   I enjoyed being on the register.  Had really nice customers.  I worked in many different departments throughout my years there. The hardest part of the job was the holidays, but it went so fast."
good,"As an Sr Analyst , my day can consist of caring for Network related issues, such as poor bandwidth, no wifi connectivity , replacing switches, rebuilding desktops, repairing high speed ticket printers, reloading hand held scanners. to trying to identify why applications are not functioning,by following the process through either network packets through switches and routers, checking router settings through the provider, to contacting applications owners to see if processing on servers are running correctly."
good,"Macy's was a decent place to work, although i was only a seasonal employee, it did have potential for growth. My team lead was very helpful and patient with teaching me my job description, she made the super busy days unstressful. My only complaint would be that my working area was alittle small during busy packing times and that some of the equipment used needs to be updated."
good,"they are good in training. they don't train in everything, but at least give you a job without experience to start a career. i like my job, overall not bad"
good,"I applied for Macy's for a part-time job but instead I worked seasonal. I wasn't use to the long crazy hours but I learned how it is to work in a retail store during Christmas time, which gave me good experience."
good,"they dont care to get to know the staff, simply hire many people so they dont have to have anyone full time.  and give out very low hours, except for their ""favorites"""
good,"This potions was a temporary potion that I worked to make some extra money for Christmas. This job was based on a flex schedule, which was perfect because I got to choose the shifts that I wanted to work."
good,"Never had an issue. Enjoyed my co-workers. I liked the flexibility of work scheduling. Management was fine, but not enough supervisors and managers. Store became very crowded when the mens and home departments were merged with our store. This made it messy. Also, they should have a single area for their super reduced price items."
good,"Fun and friendly place to work. Poor compensation for expected loyalty. Great discounts, and collaborative work environment. Overall store layout could be better managed. Too many coupons to honor. Price points could be competitive with other competitors and eliminate the need for coupons."
good,Great team culture and atmosphere. Management fires you up every morning with an uplifting and energetic team cheer. Face paced and fun working with great people.
good,"Macys was more serious work environment had to look presentable , more attention on our elder customers, and always having to get credit cards or its frowned upon."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"job wasn't so bad just wish management was better. don't pay much. I believe Macys needs to raise the pay especially for having employees doing so much. have to monitor fitting room, make sales, open credit cards and place orders."
good,"Hard to advance if you havent already been there 5+ years. Did the job of someone else for 5 months without the pay and was still not offered the position due to ""lack of experience"""
good,"I was employed only as a temporary seasonal employee.  The work environment is relaxed and my role required little supervision, which I enjoyed.  The experience of working in a security environment was a worthwhile application of my time and one I would consider again in the future."
good,"Brand loyalty didn’t mean a thing until I learned to really listen to my customers, and heard how important that sense of belonging was to them."
good,"Typical day included go backs, cashier, recovering the store and open credit accounts. I learned how to use a register and how to work with difficult customers."
good,"Good management and coworkers."
good,"Management is alright, generally speaking a small town store won't always get the attention or funds it deserves, and within the asset protection realm that means you will typically be low on cameras and associates."
good,Macy's gave me hands on experience dealing with middle class customers. I was able to stay up to date with trends that were rising and falling. Great place.
good,Macy's is a good place for working students. There is a lot of flexibility and you can pick up hours in different departments.  I worked in various departments. I enjoyed working most in there HOME department there is a lot of great items. I enjoyed assisting customers in the home department to help them find what they need and recommended some great items for there home.
good,"I work as a cashier part time, in different departments in Macy's. I looked help people find gifts for there family. The hardest part of the job was Christmas time."
good,"it's a simple job that wasn't too demanding, perfect for part-time work. The downside was that getting your schedule was always a pain since everything was handled by a computer. switch shifts was a pain."
good,"Productive fun at times, learning new products, management could have been more friendly , enjoyed working with different culture, being score every month on my performance, and getting job done meeting new people."
good,I work several jobs at Macy’s on 34th street in Manhattan. My first job was a stock runner for Lancôme makeup company on the first floor. Then I got another job in  maintenance cause the position was  permanent which benefited me with better weekly hours.
good,Lots of meetings but productive.  The culture wasn't always the best especially during tough sales.  Great community involement and opportunities to contribute.
good,"I enjoy working at macys, managment and colleagues are respecful and nice, the company offers benefits and paid time off. Comission areas can be stressful and shifts can be long and exhausting. Sales are goal oriented and it takes energy and alot of disciplin to adapt to. Work and private life balance can be tricky because of the work load and stress but that is expected at any retail salea job."
good,"Working at Macy's was an excellent experience for me, especially working at the Chanel counter.  I enjoyed working for a Prestige Cosmetics company.  I love the beauty industry and excel in sales and makeup/skin care."
good,"Coming into work depending on who worked before would decide how my day would go.  Also the day of the week, I worked in the juniors department so of course it could be a mess.  Hardest part of my job was managing the dressing room.  The best part of the job was knowing what was going on sale, and I was in the department where I typically shopped."
good,"I worked in this job for 10 years. During that time, I was able to develop new skills and use some skills I  had previously. The people I worked with are like a 2nd family."
good,"I was disappointed when this store closed after such a short time there. Being groomed for management training after just a couple of months was flattering, but it brought out the resentment of a few long term but ""unsuitable for management"" coworkers. However, management was aware and handling the conflict proactively. The clientele in the downtown store was high-end, discriminating, loyal and very pleasant to serve. When corporate closed this very successful historic location in need of major renovation, I chose to return to college at Boise State, rather than relocate to the new under performing outlying store in Nampa, Idaho where the ranks of management were full."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Productive and very diverse culture I enjoy working at Macy's and it is close to home. I am the Jewelry Clerical Supervisor.  I love the hours I have Monday thru Friday 20 hours per week
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part . Retail isn’t made for everyone . Daily complaints from customers and recovery at closing time can be too much especially is left alone
good,The work environment at the store I work at is one of the best of the retail establishments I have worked at.  Some of the corporate practices are mind boggling.
good,You either have so much work to do or it's a slow day and you're trying to find something to do. Overall it's a good place to be. My favorite part is being able to satisfy a customer.
good,The culture with Macy's was good.Come in see the daily task and would start on the task that was asked  help seek and assist customers. The management team was good thing could've been better but as a team leader i helped my team to reach a positive attitude and respect to my whole team. The hardest part of the job would be not having a mall so the foot traffic was not as busy so I would be creative make signs and advertise of sales and deals to help flyers to improve sales. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say is have a difficult customer issue or problem and would resolve and have the customer leave happy and satisfied.
good,"Nice place to work, good employers discounts but low salary. Great work team  .Sometimes Macys bring breakfast for the team .The hardest part of the job was the work area was to small."
good,This was a very exciting job. I love the customers i helped. Loved the fan system where i can be customers stylist. Was very excited with being in the department i shop in. Learned more about the history of the store than i thought existed. Overall good experience. Nice and supportive supervisor best one yet.
good,Only certain departments were paid commission and other departments were paid hourly. I've worked in both but the commission departments were pretty cutthroat. When customers don't know a department is commission and you don't give them your card you better bet they will go to someone else if you aren't there and you will lose that commission.
good,I left this company because it was hard to balance work and my children. There was not a lot of flexibility but it was fun when it was Hecht's. It was more like a family.
good,"My typical day consisted of keeping my work area clean and stocked with product. Cross selling, friendly smiles and excellent customer service were very important tools of the job. The atmosphere was of a friendly competitive nature with my co-workers."
good,Ability to have a flexible schedule. Working on commission is hard especially in a smaller store. Awesome employee discounts are available even to Part Time Employees
good,"I enjoyed  working at Macy’s, although it was just seasonal, the employees were friendly, pay was decent. A good place to gain some extra cash for the holidays."
good,"Work hours 7:00 AM - 3:30 PM and on call for 4 stores every weekend.  Good people to work with locally at 4 stores I was Maintence Engineer for in Albany area.  Do PM's for stores, safety inspections, building maintenance, and work orders."
good,"As a Flex seasonal employee I worked in many different departments and did various jobs. Often, I was pulled from one department to fill in for someone in another department. The managers were very personable and available to help if there was a problem or if they needed to help on the sales floor. Most of the employees were pleasant and easy to work with. The hardest time was during sales and promotionals because it was usually busier then and sometimes shorthanded. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers and helping them select their purchases."
good,Really good Job for customer service and retail experience. You will always have alot of fun talking and meeting new people. The time be going fast because of how busy it be getting.
good,"They are VERY strict about the fast-paced nature of the warehouse. They did not allow you to sit at all unless you were on break. They would often pull up and check your numbers to see how quickly you are working, while some (the ones in my department) sat on their chairs at the computer. The supervisors had us complete mindless meaningless busywork for no reason other than to have us working. I was there for the seasonal period."
good,Working at the Macy was very fast pace and brakes was suitable to hours of work shift. Managers was legit and worked suitable to workers pace. Workers there are slow
good,I like working at Macy you get a discount paid weekly flexible hours. Only thing pay not good at all if you are new employer if you only work 20 hours that will not be enough to pay your bills and if you have a child.Its like working for pennies.
good,"Poor training too busy to get us on the sales floor .. very competitive to open credit card ... stressful !! Fun place to work though for the holidays .. good discounts ..    some"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,this job was like any other retail job. if you like clothes and talking to people all day this job could work for you. the management in my opinion were to focused on credit card openings and not enough on customers service
good,Macy's is a great place to work especially during seasonal time. They tend to hire many associates and allow lots of opportunity to get overtime. The people are great and easy to get along with.
good,If your looking for a job that gets paid weekly and love doing customer service then this job is for you .Your job is what you make it .Try to stay positive and make the best out of it. Retail can be stressful just remember to have fun
good,Nice place to work. Good culture  they treat you with a lot of respect and value your opinion I would highly recommend this person for work the atmosphere one Fessional is him and respect I am very happy . A person could do a lot worse and be miserable but that’s not the case at Macy’s it is a collaborative and enjoyable working
good,"Macy's wasn't the worst place I have worked and at this particular store the managers were friendly but very incompetent. As a seasonal, I worked receiving and as support on the selling floor. I applied for a permanent position in a different department, since I wanted to continue working there and was promised the job by the manager who interviewed me. I later found out that they couldnt hire me till my seasonal was over which was only several weeks away, but they never told me that and made it seem as if it was no problem. When it came time for my seasonal work to be over I asked the manager about the job and he went ahead and hired someone else and then told me no positions were open anymore. "
good,"It was alright at most times, a lot can be done to improve working conditions. A lot of fights between the workers and no oen was there to really control them"
good,"Analyze existing freight contracts, rates, vendor documentation, tariff regulations, and proposed or government approved "
good,"macys is a great place to begin a career although management was poor putting that aside they really do acknowledge you it's a fun environment with an awesome team, and supportive, great growth opportunities."
good,great people to work with. they do train you for what ever position you were hired for and you get paid training as well. macys always on the go. its a very good place to work.
good,"It was just bad timing for me personally. Management did not like to work around my schedule, and they were sometimes rude. However, the job itself wasn’t bad. It was an easy job, the pay wasn’t bad, they give out bonuses as well. You can work your way up."
good,"All around good great job"
good,Macy's is a great place to work.  They are flexible with the hours.  You can advance in certain areas.  Macy's recognizes and rewards employees.  You have the potential to earn Macy's money for opening credit applications.
good,"Work environment good, busy for the most of the day therefore always keeps you on your toes. Great job for part time member atmosphere."
good,We got to pick out shift depending what shifts are available.  You might be very busy most of time so make sure you take your break and let manager know.  It was fun wrapping the fragrances and stocking.  Good exercise.   I just wish there was more trainers as most of it was getting training from other seasonal workers and sometimes you might have to figure stuff out on your own on the cash register.
good,"Macys was a great company that helped me make the transition from consultant to FTE. "
good,"work environment was fast pased."
good,would drive daily to locations and load and of load truck and go to locations assigned to and make my deliveries go back to warehouse and do anymore assignments
good,I learned lot at this company and the managers and executives take their mentoring and training opportunities very seriously they really took me under their wing and fostered all of my capabilities.
good,Love the store itself from the layout of new prodcuts and merchandise love to shop there. Working at Macy's was okay but the only think I didn't like was the fact that they kept changing my schedule and hours which made it very very hard for me. Sometimes I feel the store don't care about other peoples home life there is life outside of Macy's I know stores are about competition and  making money but you have to care more about your workers too they do the best they can especially around the chaotic holidays in retails. I really think people deserve to be home with their families instead of working in a store all night its unfair to workers/families. It's not worth the buck and competition in my opinion. The employee percentage is not that great when buying merchandise I think as hard as retail workers work it should be more percentage off. In the end its a job and some people don't have a job period it helps to build skills and work ethic no doubt but I think it has its advantages and disadvantages.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Fun and friendly environment.. love the workplace...flexible work schedules..great pay.. hardest part is to work on holidays and weeeknds..happy to be part of it..
good,"If you like retail, you’ll like this job. Everyone was pretty friendly. Hours were steady if you log in early to pick them up. It was a pretty relaxed environment but sometimes fast paced."
good,"The store was struggling at the time and as such, I cannot provide an adequate review. Also, that particular store was negligent in providing a complete paycheck. It was not unusual to find your paycheck was for less hours than you actually worked. However Macy’s promptly rectified the problem if the employee brought it to the managers attention."
good,i work 10 to 6:30 Monday through Friday in the Billing Adjustments Department.  My department's jobs are being moved to another regional office and I am currently training for a Customer Service position.  The people are very nice.  The hardest part of the job is having to learn as you go..the training only provides about half of what is needed to handle the customer service position.  I do not like not knowing what I'm doing and having to put a customer on hold while I seek answers.
good,It's a shame that online retailing giant Amazon is forcing many Macy's stores to be closed. I had a very good experience over there as a support manager.
good,"It's nice working, as it's not always busy but you have to do other jobs like folding men's t-shirts and putting go backs to their proper places cleaning up the mess before you leave."
good,"On a sales day, staff was at their station when the doors opened (we were located by the doors). Visitors would ask where certain departments were located. Hardest part was trying to meet the sales goal of the day."
good,Working at Macy’s was a different experience for me. I had to stand on my feet for long periods of time I always got the job done. You need to be consistent and able to work with lots of people.
good,"Pricing around store, changing labels, and floor set ups.  Also doing decorating and set up for Holiday time, Merchandising and organizing. Unloading trucks."
good,Seasonal sales associate during the holidays was fun and exciting working in a busy environment. Attentive managers there to guide and answer any and all questions.
good,Great job good people  good hours although ut was overnights  learned more everyday  did alot of overtime met serious business minded people got to experience the parade for thanksgiving.
good,"Good company as far as benefits. Poor management.  Working in commission based pay area is good for you. I learned ho to audit things, manage large groups."
good,"I've worked for Macy's at 2 different locations for the Holiday Seasons as a Recovery Associate (or Support). Basically, all I did was fluff and fold, returned merchandise to the appropriate areas of the sales floor and assisted customers who needed assistance. I had to go to my supervisor to find out what department I was needed in and it's mostly the men's section because the men's section is the only department that needs the most help. Although sometimes I wished they let me work the register. "
good,"It was very busy,there was no time for slack, you were ether"
good,"everyday was different, typical day full of suprises dealing with multiple customers. i really enjoyed it. had more than enough freedom. most enjoyable part was dealing with customers from all over the world."
good,working at Macey's is real nice you get the chance to cross train in diff departments has while has a chance for advancement. it is a lot of standing and walking around
good,Macy's takes care of their employees with great health insurance options. Macy's offers great incentives to their employees and have contests frequently
good,I learned customer service skills from this company. The managers were always able to help if a problem arose. The monthly birthday parties for the employees made everyone feel special. I enjoyed working with other associates and learning about where they came from
good,"If you’re a people person who likes interaction with customers, this is a good place to work. Good discounts, and always something to do even on slow days. If you love fashion this is a good place for you."
good,"You never know what is going to happen.  The goal is to make the customer happy, whether by assisting with a difficult return or helping them find the perfect item or helping them get the best deal."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed customer sales and relationships with my colleagues. I learned about jewelry sales and the hardest part of the job was unlocking counters for watches.
good,"It was an amazing experience , it all depends how locky you are with a good manager , i loved i worked with great people, that to day l still miss a lot ."
good,"Be prepared to be flexible. If you are willing to dedicate yourself to your job in retail, this is the place for you. Not many career paths and pay is mediocre."
good,"I was there as seasonal employee.  During that time we worked in a fast  pace order picking, packing ,and restock. I was able to move from one area to another."
good,I don’t want to write a review about this job. It was nice meeting the workers and staff. I had a long run with the company. I am not employed there anymore
good,A typical simply consisted of keeping the sales environment presentable for costomers by keeping the dressing rooms cleaned and refolding clothes. I also helped customers at the register by completing transactions.
good,There isn't too much I can say about this company. I only worked here a couple of months doing a seasonal position for the Christmas Holiday seasoning.
good,"i enjoyed working here i learned a lot about retail from merchandising sales products. fasted pace at times ,you need to be able to do more than just 1 thing."
good,Macy's is a good training start for young children to get experience in retail and a workplace.  flexible job and you can work in different areas in the store.
good,"be vocal in your career direction"
good,"This is a good, fun place for younger people to start off their careers. Most positions are part-time so don't expect more than 20 hours. The best time of the year to work here is during the holidays."
good,Typical days at Macy's would be your daily meeting with staffs and managers on what your goals would be for the day and how to improve the place. Management were always flexible and understanding to employers. Hardest part of the job would be the weather when its either hot or cold since it was a warehouse.
good,"decent job, fair to work around and flexible with schedules and hours. lots of good business, great customers, great coworkers, fun place to be, nice clothes."
good,friendly staff helpful bosses learned alot through out my experience such a diverse working place which i absolutely loved improved my skill in customer service
good,"its what you would expect from any ordinary company, they have goals and you need to meet those standards, now here you do have to deal with more because you have to call like this credit company they deal with for their own macys card for any customer having an issue with said card, and when you're a watch specialist with their own counter and no backup and you are on the phone for one customer, while there is 3 other customers waiting on you, get frustrated because its taking so long and leave and you miss out on possible commission it kind of blows.. despite increasing my watch division by over 30%, they still canned my position and I was going to have to be a fashion specialist for both my watches and the fine jewlery counter which I totally didnt want to have to deal with not knowing that section and also Fully knowing how people can be when shopping for an engagement ring and not having to want to deal with that drama. When people came for my watches I knew what it was for...Fathers days or Birthdays. That was it. Easy sells."
good,"Its a great place to begin but its easy to get stuck there for years, have a plan when starting there don't just settle. most managers are cool, really hard on feet"
good,The working environment  at Macy's  was very slow paced.  It only picks up during the Christmas  shopping season and before kids start school.  It was slow between those times
good,Good work/life balance.Ever changing environment. Advancement is steady in most areas of business. Opportunity to utilize elearning tools to advance skills.
good,"Lots of work and very little pay. I also did not like the management as much. They expected you to work at least one inventory shift, which is not convenient( 9pm to 6am)."
good,"Overall, I'm happy to work for this company but I feel like managers don't actually listen and are very much pushed to get results. Getting people to sign up for store credit cards is an absolute must if you want to stay employed. The associates on the sales floor are nice to work with and can create lasting friendships but management is a revolving door of faces."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a great place to work if you're looking for something temporary and/or part time. Definitely pays if you're looking for extra money to earn around the holidays.
good,"Not difficult, but sometimes quick paced, customer service job with regards to retail clothing. Lots of friendly employees to work with, got decent breaks."
good,Working here was fun and a new experience and I would recommend it to anyone willing to do the work. It was a nice place to work and I wouldn't mind working there again.
good,It wasn’t fast enough for me some days where way to slow I love to have a plan when working they don’t have set things guidelined for them to do o I would see staff sitting down in their phones.
good,"I got as many hours as I wanted the pay was okay the coworkers were professional. they allowed overtime it was very flexible as a job, never boring. and provided opportunity for advancement."
good,"Not bad  a place to work for even they don’t pay enough not enough hours but I can’t complain about the work I do I love it , talking with customers helping and answering questions"
good,"The job was pretty simple. I had to restock the clothes, check out the customers and help the customers, near the end of the year they put me in the return department and that was the only stressful part of the job. Dealing with heaps of clothes every hour bringing them back to their places in the whole store. But besides that, it was a decent experience."
good,Worked during Christmas season and of coarse it was quite busy. The hardest part was keeping up with which sales were going on. The workplace was nice and other employees were helpful to newbies.
good,Recent changes have affected business because of the lack of leadership skills in management area. Not really sure where company is headed by over working their minimal staff and not providing a good direction and lack of resources at the store level.
good,Repetitively fast paced work on your feet majority of the time in a warehouse packaging boxes and placing them on a assembly line which goes to a truck to be loaded and shipped.
good,Went to work for different shifts. seasonal. fast paced. had to give out exemplary customer service. introduce new items and help check out the customers
good,"I worked here for about a year and a half and it was great some days and awful other days. The customers honestly were the worst part, but I loved my coworkers and the job itself wasn't too hard."
good,Here I worked for application development and worked with really cool people. My role is to initiate Macy's coupons to the well spent customers and manage in providing discounts
good,I was able to keep up with all my work while making friends with my coworkers. Even the managers treated me as someone who was important to the company. Macy’s made me feel at home and it was always possible to express myself.
good,"at macy's distrubution center, the job was temporary and it seems like everyone was temps. the managment was not the best by the end of my working cycle at macy's the made you work the time you said you were available and not your acualy scheduel. good if you need the money bad if you dont want to work 60+ hours"
good,Macy's is a high fast people friendly environment. It is a place that understands the lives of the people that are employed by them. They work with your schedule for school or work. I will miss this place a great deal
good,"Sales associate during the holiday season. It was hectic at times but the hours were manageable. However, the location that I worked at is no longer around."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed working with customers each day.  My co-workers I worked with were very helpful and willing to assist me when I first started.  Very friendly environment to work at.
good,"The hours were VERY limited, the senior employees got first dibs on shifts. The discounts were okay, I feel like they could've been a bit better considering you are an employee. The workers were not very inviting to new comers, they would literally allow for the line to get super long on busy days. If I was ACTIVELY helping a customer and other customers were around they would let the customer wait, simply because I helped the customer. Petty about the commission and things of that sort. I would recommend this job for any in college or high school definitely a starter job."
good,None really. It was fine and you have the potential to move up. Stay focused and try not to spend your check buying everything in the store.Otherwise I liked it and be on time!
good,getting shipment and taking them out there boxes then mouthing the together and then taking them out and putting them on the floor helping customers   ..
good,Employment culture is fair and the most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and my co workers.  I do not agree on their policy for relocating in house employees.  They are not considering the statistics of each department and the value the employee has on the customer.
good,"The management team was so-so, the customers were hit or miss. Sometimes it was overwhelming being the only one working a certain department and the managers are not willing to help."
good,"Mostly going in checking on cameras and store items."
good,They need a lot of improvement in every department but it needs to start with managers first .. Then they need to hire more employees because there is rarely somebody in every department
good,"this job can be easy going somedays or overwhelming on others."
good,"What I learned from working with both employers Macy's and Century Twenty One. communication between management and employees is important. We must be able to meet company goals and expectations through open communication. Happy employers create a happy team and work environment, that the customers can actually see and feel. A typical workday was to maintain a fresh clean look by merchandising, and keeping the department clean showing casing new trends. On a slow day, I took things out of stock and made sure the shelves and racks were filled. The hardest part of the job is when there is no cooperation from management and your co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers, they become more like family, being honest and sincere is why I was able to sell and build a clientele."
good,manager was disingenuous with me . I would greet her and she would not even respond at times. also I noticed new hires she would take under her wing and give guidance with me it was different.
good,You have to have a thick skin to work ay macys. Never call in sick. Customers are always right! Always smile and just do your job. Management cares only about numbers!!
good,"Can be very fair and can be very unfair."
good,"I like working at macy's, I worked and meet some great people there made lots of new friends. I've also won a few awards for top salesperson of the yr"
good,Some of the workers don't know the meaning of team work they need to be trained more on customer service they wonder around the store they have hour breaks sometimes and they go over and never let the other person go on they break until the last minute management is great a little rude  hardest part of the job was trying to figure out where the clothes go it was like a scavenger hunt
good,"I worked in the shoe department which was also enjoyable to me being a shoe lover. This also allowed me to become good as sales due to my love of the product. Some days were hectic and very fast paced while others were slow but overall, very productive. I wasn't to fond of the manager but I was also professional and respectful."
good,"Macy's is a very fast paced environment.  There is not enough staff and it gets frustrating for both the employees and the customers.  The company has taken more management reductions and put more on the sales managers plates."
good,"I enjoyed most everything while working with Macys. The only thing was the job security, especially right now. Not the best if you have a family/want to know your future."
good,"I had fun working at this department store.  I enjoyed interacting with the many customers I came in contact at every shift.  Some shifts can become intense, after large sales and there is major merchandise movement, where there is major clean up and merchandise reorganization required"
good,"would recommend work there nice place nice people , have benefits , paid isnt high but get lot experience , team work , good management  , friendly customers and coworkers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This is not something I would like to do. I hope that the question that I have already answering will be too your liking. Thanks so much have a great day..
good,"The people who work there work together. There were celebrations and our ideas were heard. Unfortunately, there are many cutbacks in employees and hours due to poor business."
good,There were many long days that did not equate to the salary. The experience gained was still valuable and attributed to my skill set and ability to multitask.
good,"I worked in the cosmetics department, and I truly enjoyed the customer interaction and the work spent with cosmetics. "
good,This employer took time to accommodate me after post-surgery.  All paper work was submitted to appropriate team members. My Supervisor was helpful with accommodating my schedule.
good,"Get to meet lots of interesting customers, determine their needs & find an appropriate fit. Good place to come out of your shell and interact with a variety of people."
good,I never met any mangers so when first working here it was hard to catch on. I had to learn certain systems on my own due to no mangers being around to set any guidelines.
good,"pleasant working enviroment breaktime is very short  mangers"
good,"Exciting, requires a lot of physical activity, standing all day. and I am very happy because I lose weight. I don't need to go to the gym or park for exercise."
good,"Getting to know customers and products was great. some of the coworkers were great to work alongside. "
good,It was a nice envronment to learn from working in the retail industry for the first time . I liked their drills to build morales but it was overall too stressful to make sales goal. I also hated that you had to compete for a good station there while not being paid enough unless commission was achieved.
good,"Lots of activities, great co-workers, always busy,  large clean office with plenty of parking. Most if management is good buy others boy so much. Work life balance can be hard"
good,Macy's is a big established company so it's a given that it's so fast paced. Everyone is supportive and helpful to work with. The management could have been improved quite a few managers left their positions and we were left to fend for ourselves.
good,"It’s always busy.  Therefore, one is constantly challenged to improve and compete.  We are in a customer service environment.  Customers’ needs are a priority.  We need to keep them coming back to the store.  Hence, the challenge."
good,"In all my time at Macy's was pleasant. A typical day consisted of sales ,go backs and being a cashier. I learned a lot about the products and quality of the goods. The management team was very and cooperative. The hours were appropriate and worked well with my other job. The hardest part about the job was leaving and the easiest was working with the people there."
good,Had so much fun working there. Everyone is welcoming and friendly. Work organized and clearly defined. For someone who is very flexible nice place to work in.
good,"Macy's Credit and Customer Service - Cincinnati, OH - Has an amazing culture filled with several great leaders and a solid opportunity for growth. Being sure that you are in the correct part of the business that best suits your strengths, is key to your personal success and growth within the company. Employee compensation and benefits could be more competitive."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Started working there  when I was 19. I have leean alot from macys. This is a great place to work to grow. Went from working in the back to being a specialist
good,"Macys has been a great experience for me. In recent years, I have really learned to workload plan all activities to get my job done quickly and efficiently."
good,Busy days during the holidays. Can get stressful if you get backed up. It is a fun place to work in and you meet a lot of interesting people. The management is awesome and help you become a better sales person.
good,"Visual is full of wonderful creative people. No body works harder and cares more about their workplace than retail people. At my level, Macy's is inspirational and exciting. Sadly, upper management in NYC lost touch with their brick and mortar stores and is compromising the most fundamental core of their business."
good,"This job was very stressful with horrible hours, especially at Christmas time.  Constant demands daily for getting store credits, making your sales goals and still maintaining a pleasant attitude."
good,"learned how to assist customers when they needed me. Stocked, made sure floor was presentable.Watched my station as well as checked each customers with their items when they were ready to be ringed up."
good,I liked the company but I was only seasonal so I was let go earlier then they said we would be. Besides that I liked it. Boss was very smart and nice.
good,The Mangers was good but just thing's wasn't fair & My hrs Would be alright But My check wouldn't be the same The environment is Good.Good people Also the amount of days I'll get
good,"I have been with Macy's for two holiday seasons. If your looking for hours over the holiday season - this is your place, but dont expect to be getting any hours once the holiday is over."
good,A good environment to work in unfortunately store closed. Plenty of opportunity to advance if the right attitude and determination were noted. Hardest part of the job was to keep all customers satisfied
good,"Over the last 10 years, it has been a very good experience. I have had lots of opportunity for advancement. We are currently changing our culture to allow leaders to be more focused on development of their teams."
good,"Macy's is an industry leader in retail. Macy's has great management teams and vision. Like most retailers, Macy's has struggled with the advent of online retailers."
good,"Enjoyed for the most part worked then was offered a full time position, not for the original area. The people who worked on commission though they made full pay were absolutely rude."
good,Macys is a fast pace on your feet environment its a good job if you are looking to make that extra money for the holidays but very exhausting. You get to meet new people and gain new friendships.
good,"Can be a pretty chill environment good people to work with can be fast paced during the holidays, management kind of lacks and sometimes lacking hours"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of jumping to different departments to help reduce large wait times for customers. I learned the importance of speedy and effective service that satisfies the customer. Management was decent, but I had little room for growth. The hardest part of the job was finding ways to stay busy when business was slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning to work with my co workers and figure out ways to improve sales in the store."
good,Easy and very quite place to work ! My coworkers are very helpful and easy going. I learned some tips and tricks on how to work faster and less stressed. Management was also helpful and respectful. My hardest job was lifting boxes that were heavier than me but i loved that i learned how to do things i normally wouldn't do !
good,"It was a pleasant place to work, but the pay was too low."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys was a great place to work but I barely worked there I was hired by a friend to help fold and hang the clothes in the downstairs department I appreciate the staff for being so helping and understanding
good,I was only a seasonal worker but the management and co workers that I came in contact with everyday were helpful and easy to get along with. You learn a lot about the retail industry and if that is what you want to do I say go for it.
good,The coworkers and managers are all great and understanding. They are very flexible on scheduling. However the system and store is somewhat disorganized which makes working somewhat difficult.
good,"This employment was a seasonal, temporary job that ended.  I no longer work for Macy's.  I very much enjoyed the interaction with holiday shoppers and assisting them with their purchases.  It was a very active position that I also enjoyed.  I was able to receive a discount on my personal purchases that I appreciated.  I learned their very complicated computer system with regard to check-outs, returns, discounts and coupons."
good,"learned to use handheld scanner and tag merchandise from the sales floor. early morning shift had to get used to, got discounts on highly priced clothes..but overall good place to work"
good,"Great place to work if you want a little extra money in your pocket. Job is not demanding and the work inst hard, its easy money. Holidays are a bit hectic but that is expected."
good,Around the holidays workers get 50% off of all the merchandise. You get to pick your schedule. Can be stressful because of the holidays but overall a good place to work at.
good,"Working at Macy's is a hard job, you got to have patience to work there. All the customers aren't as friendly and polite as others. Some come in right before they have to pick their child from school and in a hurry, others come in with time in there hands. It depends on the person whether they can handle the job."
good,Great training in coaching and management.  Loved working alongside associates and continued training.  Met goals and continued to drive business.  Relocation is offered;
good,"I met a lot of people that I wouldn't have had I not worked there.  You saw the good, the bad and the ugly.    The discounts were very good."
good,"For the few short months I worked there the company seemed very fast paced, You had to learn on the job, and move from department to department. The job was overall not very stressfull and I would recommend for anyon looking to go into retale."
good,Managers are nice which is interesting or at least for temp staff. It is a fun work environment during the holiday season due to everyone being able to make money (it's their biggest payday of the year for the Co.). Pays ok for a low end job.
good,I loves working with the girls at Macys and all of the fun activities that management would involve us in..I was in charge of keeping the fitting rooms clean and checking out the customers when they found what they needed. Also closed down theregisters at closing time
good,It was good but everyone was fake/  I dont like fake nice. I work to hard to give my all and I dont get that back.  I loved working with people and training.
good,Working at Macys I found it to be stressful for me because I personally do not like sales. It is a very competitive environment where you constantly have to meet your sales goal every day.
good,a day at work at Macy's will be a team meeting before you start working at the team meeting you will get your assignments for the and the goal of the day. after the meeting you will go to your truck and start loading it and sorting out the misorts.
good,I started in the clothing department and advanced to the Jewelry department. I absolutely loved my managers and coworkers. No day was the same. It was either super slow and you couldn't wait to go home. Or the day was so fast-paced that you didn't realize it was time for you to go home. I was very sad to leave but it was such a rewarding experience.
good,"Folding Clothes"
good,"Macy's is a fun place to work, with amazing managers; but I personally feel like they expect too much out of you for only $9.00 an hour. You are expected to dress in business casual attire everyday and that can get expensive."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My typical day starts in men furnishing, stocking, reorganizing and putting out shipment. If I was finished with everything I was directed to assist in other tasks not yet finished. Other times I did store markdowns, preset sales signs and when it was inventory time I helped that ."
good,"COMPANY VERY FAMILY ORIENATED "
good,This job was very competitive but a good environment to work in. I had great benefits and advancement opportunities. I did not like the hours due to having small children at the time. I needed to be on more of a set schedule. I would recommend this job if you like an adrenaline rush.
good,This is a major department store.  It is exceptionally busy during the Christmas season for obvious reasons.  The center city location has a legendary light show which doubles as a tourist attraction.  The period influx of large crowds make loss prevention more challenging than usual.
good,For a young person this is a fun environment to work in. You get to meet new people and learn from them. Having your pay based off of commission was tough.
good,"Macy's is a great company.  Just found out they are outsourcing my department.  "
good,nice place to work. a great environment for the holidays.  the pay seems fair.  the work seemed easy enough.  the trainers were willing to help you out
good,"Very fun creative work place "
good,"Macy's is a good place to work, but sometimes not enough employees are available to cover the tasks required to correctly support the customer base. However, most employees do everything they can, and often more, to get the job done."
good,"Sales!!! All we do is sell... Competitive fellow employees always trying to sell something to a customer, but i mean that's what we get paid for right??? Overall nice company to work for and they offer good pay and kinda okay hours."
good,"Its always busy at the women shoe department in macy , if you like standing on your foot for hours and love to move around  then this is for you, but if you don't then i wouldnt"
good,"Macy's was my first job, I found it fun and educational. a typical day at work would include working on the floor, selling to customers,  keeping your working area clean, and folding clothes. management was fine there I never really had any problems only thing I would say that I had a problem with would be the hours the working hours were not good."
good,"The company is going through a lot of changes and there is a lot of job frustration in every role. That being said, there are considerable opportunities to learn and develop and become a true merchant in the retail industry in the U.S."
good,Recent decisions have caused job insecurity for me. Also recent decisions the company implemented do not seem well thought through that have caused a downtrend with overall results.
good,work off of a pm system some days there are more things then other days. but you always keep busy . Not enough hours in a day sometimes to complete tasks. Have to take care of a couple of stores .
good,I like the job as the company catered to a more upscale clientele.  There were some full time employees who were rather snobbish in that they looked down to the temp employees.Other than that I liked the job.
good,Macy's is a very good company to work for. They are very professional and the work environment is very balanced. Management is kind and understanding. The only reason I didn't stay is because I married and moved. I also  went back to school.
good,"Selling women shoes.  providing customer service, the manager was out going, knew how to work with his employee. its was fun working with some co-workers."
good,"A typical day at Macy's for a sales associate consisted heavily of customer interactions and service for all types of inquiries and transactions. I learned to hone and develop my customer service skills to a fine art while also interacting with my fellow coworkers who were all mainly young adults - making it very cohesive. Management was relatively flexible and understanding. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with troublesome customers, but on the flip-side the customers were the most enjoyable aspect of the job because most interactions were cordial and often times satisfying - for both them and I."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Nice holiday job in the heart of downtown Chicago. Good management, but limited management in the evenings. Store hours are better at downtown store. Closes earlier than stores in the malls. Convenient job coupled with a full-time job."
good,My employment was during the period when the company was called Federated Systems Group. This was much earlier in my career and I enjoyed my work experience.
good,"Many times it was fun and very interesting to work with the many visitors from around the world.It was an experience to see the wooden escalators, they are amazed with the history of the store."
good,"When i first started macys i really loved my job, great managers, a great team that i worked with and i learned alot about Asset Protection. What I didnt like was the lack of benefits, and when I got a new manager she was not a very good one. She favored her employee, didnt recognize the teams accomplishments, and didnt leave room to grow for detectives that were doing a great job."
good,"It was a good place to work starting out, I graduated from bellus academy and for hired at Macy’s right away. I worked for Lancome cosmetics for 3 years and it was great as my first makeup job. Great experience just wanted a change."
good,"was a call center, over 50 calls an hr, especially during holidays. closed down to lack of sales. most supervisors were pleasant to work with, some not so much."
good,I've liked working at Macy's because I like meeting different people and working in a Fashionable environment. My co-workers were also pleasant people to work with.

good,"I enjoyed working at  Macys, because i love working with people and love to do makeup. The most enjoyable part of working with this company was helping the customer feel and look their best"
good,"Many tasks each day from recovery, cash register, customer service, returns, inventory, picking merchandise for online orders. Sales is a big factor. I received alot of sales training and goal setting instruction."
good,It was fun working there because you don't really have to do anything but watch the cameras. They give discounts as benefits and you take an 1 lunch break.
good,"My position was flexible and I was able to give back to the communities on a national level.  Other than compensation and lack of advancement, my experience has been great."
good,Some managers are rude but most of them are nice and understanding. For the most part it is a relaxing environment and you have range. You don't have to worry about managers unless there is a customer issue.
good,"Making sure you know what you have available for consumer purchases.,A back up item if you do not have a particular item.I learned that the scheduling was not created for a life work balance.Negative Nancy's that one must disregard gracefully and remain focused on your  tasks and goals for the day,to reach and achieve targeted sales benchmarks.The hardest part of the job not being able to control the stock you need in your area to keep up with supply and demand.The most enjoyable part of the job is making someones day by giving them a shopping experience that they will always remember and want to come back for me"
good,Working in a retail environment can be fun depending on your team. It is customer driven so customer service skills are a most. You must know your product and your customer base to succeed in this area.
good,Excellent customer driven retail organization. Macys provides an opportunity to build a solid foundation in every facet of the business whether at corporate head quarters or in the field.
good,"Working in the shoe department was a lot of fun! Paid commission so the harder you want to work the more income you might have. Management was not great, but we were pretty much left alone."
good,"Shipping an receiving af all aspects. A good place too work for a few months. Laid back, but fast pace environment. Enjoyed my time there for the most part."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This particular Macy's is has an open door policy with management. Staff is pretty close knit and openly accepting to new comers. Our customers are for the most part warm, friendly and easy to become familiar with. Overall Macy's at the Tippecanoe Mall is a nice place to work."
good,Gets busy at times but can be a manageable to shop . Learn lots of retail knowledge experience throughout the store . Enjoy the culture there as it is very friendly .

good,Just be respectful to the customers at all times and just do your job an you would love it there. The coworkers was great people to be around they was like an extended family
good,although i worked for them many years ago i don't have a bad thing to say about Macys. All the managers i worked along side of were great individuals. I would work there again.
good,"Macy's work environment was fun, friendly, and educational. The pay was great, and hours were consistent. I enjoyed the time I spent while working there immensely."
good,"Friendly co-workers and management.  Managers know workers by name and are always visible and readily available to help, if needed.  All trainings are paid and on-site.  Flexible schedule, you can work a full time job while working part-time."
good,I didn't have to many issues working in the position I had with Macy's. It was just for the work I feel that there should have been better pay and hours. I love working with people and the competitiveness.
good,This company can become overwhelming to work for.  They expect alot from there employee  and to always be available to work. They environment can become hostile
good,The location i worked was really busy especially on weekends. Sometimes get stressful and tired. The hours are flexible and good for those who has school or another job.
good,Great place to work if you are looking to make a little extra cash for the holiday season. Very flexible with hours and lots of departments to chose from.
good,I really loved working the sales floor and talking with customers you were well paid and got great benefits. Sadly there was a very limited amount of hours aside from the month of December and though most mangers were fantastic my particular departments was not she didn't want to work with people's availability and picked favorites
good,Great experience working there. Customers friendly. Hired to many teenagers who did not like to work. Loved the environment just didn't suit my needs.
good,Typical day ate work starts by chekcing the store is presentable and our inventory is more than is ready to be purchased. We then had to do a morning rally which is where everyone met and talked about the daily tasks and the deals/promotions we had for that day.
good,"Busy, so the day goes by quick, I learned how to do cash drops, management was wonderful. The culture at Macy's was inviting. The hardest part of my job was getting the magnetic devices off the clothes. My whole day was enjoyable, it was just very unorganized."
good,Working with makeup is always fun and being in a department store you always had the people who can make your job something worthwhile. Definitely a fun place to work
good,Overall it was enjoyable for those who like the fashion type of environment. Me personally it's not my ideal job. The benefits and employees are remarkable.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked in the woman's shoes department stockroom and i had to get the shoes the sales associate ordered. I didn't learn anything valuable. The management was not good overall, which led to unproductive workers and a miserable workplace. Hardest part was it was a lot of walking (upwards of 10 mi per 8 hour shift). Best part was the breaks."
good,I enjoyed working there. They went out of business this year. training was good. Sometimes management were not there.    I got along with manage and staff well.
good,Macy's was a fun place to work. my coworkers believed in team work when you work as a team the days go very fast and the job become easy as you go. Macy's is a pleasant place to work.
good,"It was a good part time job and a booster to your sales experience. If you are working at Macys, you will be able to grasp the methods of how you need to make sales about things that you do not have any idea about. The work hours were long, but it helped me learn how to interact with customers or different types of people. There is a lot of competition. Hence it you will know how to cope with things."
good,"good work life balance"
good,"The employees I worked with were kind and helpful. Being a large store, customers would frequently take items from one department to another department and leave them there. So there is a lot of back and forth."
good,"Macy's is a good part time job.  I loved working their, the people, the sales associates I worked with.  But it is not a job for a sole supporting worker.  But each associate has an opportunity to express the greatness that MACY has to offer its customers!"
good,"Nice atmosphere, friendly associates and managers. "
good,"I loved my job. My day would typically start at 5:30am. I would help with Mark downs, signing, help with some floor moves, replenish clothes/floor items, help with fulfillment and a lot more. There was always something to be done. I loved my team manager. They were very flexible and understand of my schedule. There are a few things that started to turn bad like a week before I was about to leave. Like hours started going down. I would typically get 35 -40 hours. Then it turned to 28 hours... luckily I was already leaving. I have been there for a year and a few months. My start pay was $9.00 got a raise up to $9.50. In a year. The pay isn't good for the work you do... But I loved the environment and the people I worked with. Unless you want more pay right away and start off with a high pay, this job isn't for you. If you like some what fast paced, a lot of work to pass the time, wanting to learn new things and just over all like to help out. This job is for you."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's..... very fast paced and diverse environment with a wide variety of styles and prices for any"
good,"Loved working at Macy's, only did a seasonal position but the atmosphere was great and loved the holiday spirit. Working here taught me how to work with people and get more sales."
good,Macys is a good company that values their employees. When emergency situations arose within my home life they were more than accomadating allowing me thw time off to deal with these matters
good,A regular day at work for me is just stocking shelves and helping customers. I learned that other associates sometimes have difficult with things so I come along and help them. the most fun part is when I go on break.
good,"A typical day at work would include securing the jewelry cases, opening the cash registers, answering questions from customers, and showcasing and selling merchandise in fine jewelry. I learned that every customer is different, and you have to tailor your customer service to each individual in order to satisfy their needs. The management at this particular Macy's was wonderful. Each supervisor was helpful and able to assist in any situation. The workplace was very friendly; everyone was like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance my work schedule with my personal life. The exciting and fast work pace was always fun, and that was definitely the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Difficult to move up in management. But overall a really fun place to work. Co workers are usually great unless you work in a position where you receive commission.
good,"Good Sales"
good,"I was a seasonal sales associate in the men's department. So my experience might be very different from the full time associates. But it was a good experience. It helps with social skills and dealing with stressful situations. My second day on the job I was left the handle the whole men's floor on Black Friday, and it was a great experience. It helped me realize how I deal with the stress and my abilities under great pressure."
good,Good environment. Great company. Not enough advancement opportunities. Too many supervisors not communicating with one another. The benefits were ok. Better than any other retail job I've had. Lots of cash handling experience. I liked the scheduling process. Attendance crediting was slightly unfair.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Good company to work for when needing a second job. Great overtime opportunities offered, as well as flexible hours. Not bad for a warehouse, will recommend to a friend!"
good,"It was a great place to me people who would come back and shop just to see the associates, because they felt like they were treated special. Most of the time it was a great team effort in the things that was accomplished."
good,It was a wonderful place to work. Learned new things. Learned customer service skills. Learned how to balance a cash register and also learned how to wrap gifts
good,Working at Macy's during the holidays is crazy! But fun made lots of friends and learned how to ring-up items and fold clothes properly. I was only there a short time but it was definitely fun to learn how all that goes
good,the environment was very nice and the people were very nice and helpful. the only thing I would recommend they do is to give the workers more floor experience before making them work on their own.
good,Management was a revolving door with high expectation put on the receiving lead and team. The wages for the team are not competitive to other receiving teams and there are little to no hours. The hardest part of the job was finishing the workload in the allotted time.
good,Every morning there was a meeting letting us know what our numbers should average for the hour. After that we would go to our assigned stations and properly pack the items. It was very laid back with good pay.
good,"Typical day was opening of tills , put new furniture together and place on floor according to corporate/district map."
good,"I honestly did enjoy working at macys. My coworkers were the best, most customers were friendly but managers were the worst.They do not know how to communicate well with others, they can be very rude and disrespectful. The micro managing is overwhelming."
good,"The task are easy but is a very competitive environment and the payment is not  fair."
good,I ejoyed working there very much. I liked the people that i worked with and they made the shifts go by quickly. Managment was approachable and friendly
good,"Good managers.....                                            "
good,Its a safe environment for anyone to work at. They treat you with respect and give you a chance to prove yourself as a hard work right out the gate. I would go back and work for them with no problems what so ever.
good,"I have only been with the company six months and I have already been promoted. The department I run is pretty laid back, but we get work done. I love the early morning hours."
good,"A good means of getting some retail experience. Had to rent out tuxedos to parties and individuals for weddings, proms, etc. Really helped with dealing with my being an introvert."
good,People are happy with macy's It is a family atmosphere. The break room is amazing. There is room for advancement. technology is great and helps you keep track of your customers and repeat business. Dicounts are nice. Company really cares and provides good rewards system and rewards accoplishments.
good,I worked in the women's shoe department and I learned a lot while I was there. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good job in retail.
good,The pay was very low and the hours were even lower but I enjoyed going the staff was encouraging and tried to help however they could with the work load.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Management is not that good. They don't know how to effectively use the employees for effective work. Some supervisors are great and efficient. Overall is just like any retail job.
good,Macys a humbling experience. It was my first retail job and taught me that people work really hard for the money. In this job I realized people go beyond there expectations for a simple minimum wage job.
good,"I got to learn a lot from Macy's, co-workers are excellent,  management hoedown out of their way to help you, very one of a kind work place, definitely would love to work for them again! A great place for starters."
good,I learned a lot about being a leader with A Construction Maintenance Group. I enjoyed my time there and I will take all my experiences with me throughout my career life.
good,working as a sales associates. I had the opportunity to interact with other and help other to get the job done on time. The management was great. and great schedule opportunities.
good,Macy's was a wonderful place to work at. The group of people I worked with were very productive. The work environment was fun. Management was always there to lend a hand.
good,I would go downstairs and work in the off priced clothing section of Macy's called Backstage. All sales were final after 30 days. A lot of customer interactions.
good,Macy's is one of the excellent client where it provides a good environment for the employees to work.The management here is very good so that it provides an environment to work effectively.
good,working at macys was not bad at all. the manager I had at the time was really nice and they always looked out for their customers. so I have a good time working there
good,Macys was a nice workplace although you didnt get much training but you learn after so long i love the discounts and they let you build credit with them .
good,"This company has fostered a community of caring and friendship. I love working for this company, I have off and on for the last 15 years. It is a very enjoyable place to work if you have the right personality."
good,If you have a positive attitude and a driven personality you can have a great work day. But if you need help from a manager it can be difficult to get them to come help you or to be an advocate for you in certain situations.
good,"Provided customer service and selling skills, worked as the cashier, keeping the selling floor stocked with merchandise and ready for sales events, and organizing the selling floor and stock areas. Very busy and messy environment."
good,"Not much money can be made but still makes a little above minimum wage, like 10 something an hour. Works weekends. No benefits. Difficult to get full time positions."
good,Macy's Is a good company to work for if you're looking for a part time position. The whole Macy's team is friendly. They work with your school schedule as much as they can.
good,A typical day at work would be finding a station and hoping that you can pack out your quota for the shift. Having interaction with other co-workers while working your shift
good,"Good place to work, flexible schedules and not too bad customers. Managers are sometimes difficult to work with. Compensation is not that great. Not a too difficult job, but can get repetitive. It's always great making an impact on customers."
good,i would look at cctv to check on the store to see if i can see someone stealing. i would sometimes get a change of scenary and go to the floor to observe what i would see
good,"The company cut my hours down to less than 15 hours a week.  I am still eligible for rehire, however I am looking for a full time positions and guaranteed pay."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked for Macy's several years ago before operations were centralized to New York.  Macy's was a great company to work for in those days but I can not speak about today's culture.
good,Good place to work very professional and hard working staff.The pay is also at the higher pay grade. I would suggest Macy's to many people as a future career
good,A typical day is busy and full of excitement. I love the environment of this place and the staff is great. I would recommend this job to college students or high school students. If you don't like to sell this isn't the job for you.
good,one of the most hard working places ive ben at. takes pride in their work and likes to have a safe enviroment. management is very friendly but work always comes first
good,"Macy's has its perks, long lunches, decent pay and a 20% employee discount. However although the environment feels nice and elegant there is a lot of stress to make sales goals, which is manageable, but the real stress comes from having to get customers to sign up for Macy's credit cards, which can sometimes be a hard goal to meet."
good,"they provide a variety of services, from helping you pick out items to ringing up your purchases. Like cashiers, retail sales associates use cash registers to process transactions and are responsible for keeping track of all the money inside."
good,I liked working for Macy's. Very fun company. Flexible hours. Great discount. My manager was fun and very professional. The pay was okay. It became very busy at times.
good,"my experience was good working at macys"
good,"-always busy and always learning new skills."
good,Working in retail can be challenging at times.  I feel that Macy's is a very good company to work for.  I worked in Women's Shoe Department and Casual Wear and enjoyed it.  The company has excellent training and the managers are very willing to help an associate if they need assistance with a customer or situation.
good,"Macy's is extremely busy during its high season and can be a bit stressful at times. Overall, it is a great way to start your professional life and learn to handle customer service accordingly."
good,"Fun and hard working customer service is number one, you build new and old client tell, meet monthly plan gold and quota kept track of what stock is needed."
good,"It's a nice job with nice people to work along with, it's just some managers aren't that nice. But overall, great workplace. Would like to work there again."
good,Good intro to sales job. You have quotas but that doesn't really make or break you unless you are doing absolutely nothing. You learn basic interaction skills.
good,"This job taught me a lot about presentation and being friendly and personable. Learned about different cultures and having patience, understanding and compassion ."
good,"	Developed a personal clientele through effective use of consultative selling skills, proactive client outreach and use of client book to efficiently and genuinely cultivate relationships with clients."
good,Coworkers and executives tried to make work a good experience. Monthly events happened to match holidays during the month. Great people to work with overall.
good,"At Macy's, I built a fundamental knowledge of retail, the industry's landscape and nuances, and developed a passion for analytics. I made career-lasting relationships with my immediate team and senior leadership. The company's expansive opportunities allowed for younger associates like myself to be active in the process of growth at the company."
good,great part time or even full time job. The macy's environment is a fun flexible place to work. The people are great and so is the management. I enjoyed the time I worked there

good,It was a fun place to work because of the different customers and their needs.  It was fun to help them find exactly what they were looking for.  The incentives at work were also great.
good,Fun environment fast paced. Very goal based. Decent leadership. Can work your way up from an associate with the company to executive positions. Overall good learning experience.
good,i enjoyed working at macys. its a fun environment where you can make money its a professional place to work where you learn alot the manager staff are very down to earth
good,"Very productive workplace, fast paced. management was excellent, great work environment. The hardest part of the job would have to be standing for eight hours straight."
good,"This is a great first job to have but don't plan on staying too long. Everyone leaves quickly. High pay will make you want to stay, but don't! Lots of young people because of this turnover rate."
good,Working here gives the benefits of meeting new people and service them with their purchase needs. Friendly staff and learning what other departments expertise is was helpful as well.
good,typical work day in retail is includes working cashier register and going around the store and fixing tanks and making sure everything is in the right place
good,"Hard to take breaks because they never have enough people to cover you and managers are barely anywhere to be found when you need them. They barely train you and just throw you out on the floor with no help, and if you mess up they automatically mark it against you. They will have you cover a whole floor and ask you to work extra hours at very last minute if they are short and if you deny they mark it against you."
good,Overall lovely workplace. Really enjoyed coming into work. Environment very pleasant and challenging. Loved management because they treated our team like partners.
good,"One of the most enjoyable experiences. Best customer service experience. Co-worker environment is friendly and energetic. Teamwork is A+, sales are great if you are knowledgeable on merchandise, customers are ready to buy if you're ready to sell!"
good,"if your looking for a first job its great but if your looking for something to pay the bills i suggest you look else where, close to minimum wage page and little hours."
good,"Macys was one of my favorite jobs, the staff was amazing. The stock area was huge, there always were shoes to find. I also had fun delivering shoes and meeting new people"
good,the work is hard and fast pased you only have 30 minutes to clean a room and you have do be able to be on your feet for long peroids of time and you have to be nice to the guests know matter how they treat you

good,A place where if you are work oriented you'll have a good time. Alot of physical movement in the support department. if not physically able to move things around I would not recommend it.
good,This is a great time and place to learn about everything you need to know about customer service. Holiday season is busy and hectic for everyone. You'll learn to be patient and how to please customer at the same time.
good,"Working at Macy's was definitely enlightening, and gave me the experience i needed. However there is little growth within the company, especially when you start out as a cashier."
good,well retail is retail. You have to be prepared to work holidays and sometimes long hours and Otherwise sometimes it is a good place to be depending with location but top management seem not to really care to talk to employees when they visit stores they just pass you by like they don't see you

good,"Fun work place.  Need a fixed weekly hours.  Hours per week vary from 29/hr to 35/hrs per week, which makes it difficult if you are a regular full-time employee.  If pay and hours for full-time employees would be better employees would be happier."
good,"On the go, never a dull moment. Always a fun time with co-workers, associates, and customers. A lot of daily tasks and distractions. Must stay focused on what you're working towards. Learned how to deal with difficult individuals and situations. Must love problem solving. The hardest part about the job for me was keeping a work/life balance.

good,My experience in Macy's was different but easy. I learn how to multitask and still get the job done at the end of each shift. Great experience and working space.

good,"Dealing with happy customers rude customers mean customers but i always know how to satisfy them all and save the day. I've learned that you cant always make everyone happy but its worth the try, and i always try my best to please my costumers. I always get along really well with my employees. I'm a friendly and out going people's person type of women. The hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy and keeping it that way.But be good to your job, and it'll be good to you. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing my best to make everyone happy even when they don't plan to be, If they come across me I'm guaranteed to make them smile."

good,Overall good job some management issues. A lot of discounts for employees and incentives. not a lot of opportunities to move higher in rank. But good.
good,Working for Macy's has its ups and downs but it is an overall good place to work. Macy's has easy access to scheduling and nice break areas.
good,"Macy's was a fun place to work until I noticed a difference in treatment for those of us who were seasonal associates as opposed to those who were regularly employed there. They ran things not based upon fairness, but seniority rules and that's one thing I didn't really enjoy. Other than that the discounts were nice and most of the employees were friendly."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Enjoyed interacting with all the customers and working with my co-workers. I liked seeing all the new fashion designs when they came out.

A lot to learn about different clothes, considering there is four levels from clothes to household essentials. Love the environment, a lot of great people to work with. Management always took care of their staff and always seeking for room for improvement."
good,Overall Macy's is a wonderful company and they treat their employees well. They are pretty flexibly with your scheldule and are willing to work with you.
good,The best place to start off and build.  Loved the friendly staff and wonderful benefits that was offered as an employee.  The work was very organized and instructed very well.
good,Working one on one with customers as well as the associates is the best part of the job. Teaching new associates how to get through difficult situations is a great learning experience not only for them but for the teacher. Customers present many great scenarios for new associates and are extremely understanding. Macy's is a community providing plenty of room for advancement within the company.
good,Merchandising in macys was an easy job. I personally liked the hours I had which was usually 5:30am-2:00pm. I liked working without all the customers in the morning.
good,Enjoy my morning coffee with co-workers; enjoy talking to people;satisfaction of customer is my top priority. Provide pertinent information to Management.
good,"They really give you the opportunity to work with customers and truly help you to please the customer. They give you the ability to work with customers to make sure that the customer is happy, which is a great point cause then there are normally less returns."
good,This job compliments people who enjoy working in a fast paced environment. It is easy to create bonds and expand on excellent customer service skills with our regular clientele. Management and fellow co-workers are always friendly and welcoming. My current position taught me how to manage inventory and I've become an effective developmental leader.
good,Would have to open up macy's accounts and help people with purchases. We were required to meet a daily sales goal. While maintaining a clean work environment.
good,"Macy's philosphy allow for integration of personality plus.  I have been employed in two California Macy's and now the second Macy's ever opened.  While they were each unique within themselves, Macy's MAGIC philisophy is universal."
good,"Had and experience of how retail worked,  merchandising  of products and where they belonged in the store. Hardest part of the job working back to back shifts on Black Friday."
good,Hectic and chaotic place to work. Provides skill and experience necessary for real work. Great customer service experience. Fast paced environment.
good,"I enjoy my daily routine at the fulfillemt center, co-works and supervisors are all easy to get along with. Most enjoyable part of working here is the people that I am able to work with, also learning about this side of retail is very interesting."
good,"This was a good job for people looking to have a little more pocket money during the holiday season. I enjoyed working here. Only downside was that when there wasn't any tasks, you had to make yourself look busy."
good,A typical day at work consist of educating clients about their skincare needs and offering every client a facial. I have learned everyone is different in what they want for their face and how they take care of their needs. The management with Origins is very personable and listens to any concerns anyone might have. The hardest part of my job is being able to hit numbers because sales are not guaranteed always and sometimes people do not buy product. The most enjoyable part of my job is making people love their skin by using Origins.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Typical day at my job, was to open the department. Then take counts and get ready for the day. I would be there to help customers make choices for gifts or for some piece of jewelry to finish an outfit for an occasion. I learned about different gemstones and different metals. I learned the different reasons to give jewelry. I learned about different cultures, people I worked with and the people I helped with their purchases. "
good,"Working at Macy's is great,I can honestly say I enjoy everything about working there. I have learned a lot about working in the retail world and must say it was easy with the help I received from co-workers. I must say the job is easy if you stay on task and have good support from co-workers."
good,I worked for Macy's for over 5years and it was a great experience. the company allowed me to develop and learn how to work in a group to meet the company's' expectation.
good,"Really enjoy working for Macy's. However, they do have a rather odd and strict attendance policy that makes it hard to balance life and work. Only looking for new position cause I recently had a baby and need a night schedule (which they will not offer/guarantee me). Management is awesome in the way that they will always listen and help where they can."
good,"Lovely Company, No major complaints. i have had a few schedule change issues but nothing to major in which that has had effected my performance over my time being here."
good,Good cooperation between co-workers which made for an enjoyable work day. Different tasks kept the day interesting. There were opportunities at hand to learn more about Macy's and each department.
good,"I will always be grateful to Joe, my supervisor, who hired me and taught me a great deal about merchandising and operations within the company."
good,I love working their it was very organized.The people were very helpful the mangers were excellent.I had very good help when I first started we all communicated Good.
good,It was an easy job which they eventually eliminated the need for. Macy's is a pretty much a monopoly now. Decent discount.
good,Good for students or people who are starting fresh after college. It requires to meet goals every month. Shoes department can be a good start to meet goals and make more commission.
good,"Fun Environment., not that physically challenging, met interesting people.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.   Copmensation - the hourly rate for the seasonal was good,  However, I would have liked a higher rate and benefits.  Job Security - I was seasonal and was looking and currently looking for permanent work."
good,"Its enjoying working in Macys. Macy's has good return policy so customers are happy with their returns and shop more."
good,Overall great experience helping to pioneer a new program. The job is really what you make it. If you come in with a positive attitude your experience will be positive
good,Company was pretty good. I wish i could have been @ a bettet location.  It was very hard to meet a sales goal with the location being so bad. Selling makeup was awesome
good,"I love working at Macy's and making magic to my customers. I love working with some of my co-workers. I love working with the ones that are a good team player. Some co-worker are not Team players and that make me not want to come in when i know they are working ,But i make the best of it. The most enjoyable part of work at Macy's is making magic with my customers. I like to make them leave with a smile."
good,"Good workplace with flexible hours but its tough on feet all day! The discounts are great and you can get tons of hours if you check in with the computer system. However, fellow workers can be hard to deal with and not everyone is treated the same."
good,"Great discounts ! Great place to get your make-up and hair cut all in one day ! Makes me feel proud to be apart of a winning team ."
good,"Seasonal work. You learn a lot, but its temporary. You need patience and a lot of determination to help people. The holidays can be hectic, but if you enjoy a challenge, you will be just fine."
good,Learning how to do shipping and receiving also inventory. Provide excellent customer services. Training and teaching others. Management treated everyone equally.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed coaching the employees on a daily basis and meet some pretty awesome people.  I had the opportunity to meet a lot of customers and several became my personal friends.
good,Many managers were going around and helping on the holidays and it was a very enjoyable job. The hardest was learning about a new department on the selling floor.
good,Sometimes going into work can be stressful. Depending on how the area looks from the night before and how many clothes to put back can be stressful and tiring if you don't have another co worker to help you.
good,"Really busy environment which is something I really like. The pay could be higher, but you really know where you stand at all times with the organization because of the way the system is put up online."
good,"Macy's is an Ok place to work if you don't mind repetition in you day. The Management team must be great or it can be a hellish place to endure."
good,"This was a fun temporary seasonal job to have.  I was allowed to setup my own work schedule - work as many or as few hours as I wanted.  I learned quite a bit about fine jewelry."
good,It was my duty to assist costumer's and help them find what they were shopping for. I kept each department organized and appealing to draw customers in. I learned a good sales tactic for making money rather than pushing the customers a way. I treated my co-workers as teammates there to help me get the job done rather than as competition for sales. The hardest part of the job was when there was a huge sale or holiday that attracted more business than usual. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being a part of each customer's unique experience. It was fun helping someone find the right shorts for vacation or the perfect sunglasses as a birthday gift.
good,"It seems like any where you work especially in retail you never really feel your secure because it's always a revolving door of people. Managers have it a little better because of the percs that comes with it."
good,"great company , managements is excellent, hours , able to work as many hours and money , great people. goal oriented , fair, reputable company"
good,"most fun retailer job! The managers are uplifting and always positive. Black Friday was the most hectic but fun night, me and my co worker were shoe runners...if you did not know there is a whole new world in the shoe department."

good,"Work is fast pace."
good,"Working at Macy's was enjoyable. The management was fantastic, although the employees didn't always communicate well as the day became busy and they were focused on sales goals. It was nice to have a set goal to meet and work towards. The experience I gained by working in a fast paced environment was great. I learned to give quality help at a good pace. the best part of the job was knowing that you satisfied the customer and the job."
good,"nice place to work , the employees are really nice and helpful and so are some of the management team. love when they have the days where they have catered food for the departments"
good,"Early morning start to day most days  setting up store displays, receiving merchandise.  Each day brings new challenges, new people,  some late hours."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet lots of different people from different cultures from all over the world who traveled to Orlando. I have a great relationship with my managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the stability. Right now we are a little slow given the fact that it is summer and there hardly are any hours for me to pick up.
good,the atmosphere was great when it came to working alongside fellow associates but the management was terrible and there was NEVER a stable manager to rely on
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"every body is always busy, good communication skills, manager was cool as well, teaching everyone how to do their jobs."
good,"Macy's Logistics was a fast paced job in a conveyor belt filled logistics facility, which lasted between 10 and 12 hours, depending on the day. The job was simple, and the people were nice, but the dry mechanical heat mixed with the static from the plastic floor was nearly unbearable. I would come home and take off my shoes and my toes would still be shocking the floor under my feet. As a job was concerned, it made decent money for what the job was, but the heat would suck the constitution right out of you over the 10 hour day."
good,very busy fast pace work environment . I enjoyed working on the cash register and meeting new people.it was fun helping people decide on what they wanted to buy and save.by watching and observing  people you learn how they acted and you learn better ways of approaching people.
good,I would give Macy's a good review. It is a fun and busy place to work. There is always something going on new dealing with customers. Helping the customers is the most rewarding part of the job.
good,The workplace was tolerable but the management was very organized and fair. My co-workers were goal-oriented and outgoing. Overall I enjoyed this job.
good,This was a wonderful place to work. The managers were always helpful and extremely nice if you had a problem or question that needed answered.
good,"Its a good environment, you are always on your feet, always busy, you had to be very organized and keep your area tidy. The only thing I did not like were the sales goals you had to meet."
good,"A typical day at work involved interacting with people, associates and clients, on a day to day basis. Customer service responsibilities, being a cashier, placing and receiving orders, and opening credit card accounts. I learned how to be hands on in the retail filled and friendly yet effective people skills. My co-workers were not hard to get along with and they did their fair share of work. The most difficult part of the job was cleaning up fitting rooms after super sales but that was not too hard to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with so many diverse people each day."
good,"I was always excited about my position.  I could never anticipate what the day would encounter.  I thoroughly enjoyed working with the clients as well as developing a wonderful rapport with them.  I looked forward to assisting them with their purchase needs and educating them on new and inventive ways of achieving their goals.  "
good,When I work I will help any costumers that need help finding anything or have anything they need help with. Also I sometimes handle some costumer phone calls calling with any situations they need help with or even when we close.  A lot of people had questions about returns and if they could return the item if they lost the receipt. The co-workers are very nice and most of them are college students. The hardest part of the job would be keeping the fitting rooms from being messy. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the costumers and talking to them. I love being able to help people and to find the best solution for them.
good,Macy's is a fast paced and challenging place to work. Each day is different and keeps you on your feet. They pride themselves with lots of different sayings that keep you focused on the customers. It was difficult to balance work expectations with continued reduction in staffing levels. The pay is not very competitive.
good,Great team and opportunity to excel in each department.The ability to be recognized for a job well done is almost routine and helps build the supportive and hardworking atmosphere that delivers outstanding customer service reflecting their spirited mission statement.
good,"EL APRENDER A PRESTAR MAS ATENCION, el trabajar con muchas personas pense que se me iba a complicar o no me iba a llevar pro nada que ver , se pasaba bien los dias."
good,"A typical day consisted of arriving to the workplace reporting to management then finding out the task/duties at hand. Management was very employee friendly, co-workers where very good. The hardest part was learning a new trade and the most enjoyable part was the work environment itself."
good,"The work place was very comfortable and somewhere you could be very successful in and move up to a better position.It taught me more about retail than I already knew.The managers and fellow employees were a pleasure to work with and very easy going workers.The best thing that i liked about this job was helping people on their sales and finding the correct clothes to buy.My coworkers were a great help and everyone is extremely friendly.Everyday I always had fun talking and interacting, with co-workers and customers."
good,Very fun and competitive place to work.  Friendly competition.  Flexible hours with very few restrictions. Usually friendly co-workers.
good,"When I worked for Macy's, I learned a lot about the sales area. The only thing that I disliked about working for Macy's was the fact that my coworker, who was an older woman in her 40's was so blatantly mean for no reason."
good,"sometimes it be busy at work, it depends what kind of specials we are having. i learn to reach for my goals when it comes to busy day. my coworkers always helps me when they see a lot of customers talking to me or wanting to check out. the hardest part of my job is to reach my goal on a slow days. what i enjoy most at work is to be friendly to all customers and help to find what they need."
good,"Macys is not a bad company, there is enough time and positions to grow within the company. The manger are pretty good at gaining the inspiration to get the best performance out of their employees. Co-workers majority of the time came work together to get the task done."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Pros"
good,"Typical day at work would be unloading a truck, getting all the products floor ready and putting them out by there department to be put on shelves."
good,"Fast Paced, independent, multitask in other areas.  Little recognition.  Able to work with sales associates and department managers.  Familiarize the whole store.  Interact with customers."
good,The company has a great retention of employees at the corporate offices in Cincinnati and I enjoyed working with all the associates at Macy's.
good,the hardest part of the job was having to walk back and forth with clothes weighing diffrent amounts trying to keep five departments stocked. i leard how to keep my stations and departments looking clean and organized. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to still help out customers that had questions or comments. my co workers were on the younger side like me so we always had something to talk about.
good,"fixing the store before it opens "
good,"A typical day at work included meeting and exceeding departmental sales goals, establishing relationships with clients to ensure returning clients, and signing up customers for company credit cards. I acquired interpersonal skills and a more extensive training on customer service."
good,the best part of Macy's is the camaraderie that exist between sales associates.  It is very easy to be accepted.  the hardest part is the scheduling during key days which does not allow you to miss days and the point system that does not excuse sick days. the management tries very hard to make you feel like you matter and encourages success. I really liked working there and had to quit because I moved.
good,I would normally start out cleaning any fitting rooms that needed help on if other associates were busy with a customer. I learned how to manage many things at once. Love my fellow associates very nice and fun to be around.
good,"Clock in go to your register,  tidy the store while waiting for customers to arrive. I was working as Manager of the Fine Jewelry County so setting up jewelry each day does take some time. "
good,An overall great place to work.  The people that run the business need to have a clearer understanding of what the employees are going  to want to know. Not give an i don't know answer.
good,good pay good benefits always offering good hours and as much overtime as you need with this job you can expand within the job and the employee are auseome
good,"Always busy and helping out customers"
good,"Human resources is still very much involved in customer service, providing optimum service with a small is what I've learned most from may's. I have enjoyed the Human resources aspect of the position more so than anything and how sensitive information can be and should be respected as such ."
good,"The only word to describe the Macy's environment is friendly. Everyone was very nice and it felt like a big family. A typical night at work would be either picking the beauty products to give to packers, or i was a packer myself. the managers were on they're game, always keeping us busy. i met so many amazing people and created friendships, the coworkers are friendly. the hardest part of the job was trying not to send a package without its sending information sticking. what i enjoyed about the job was meeting new people and getting to experience the work life."
good,The Taste Bar was a pretty good work environment when it was there. The manager was very caring especially when I started school. I had a strong bond with a couple of my coworkers. The hardest part was when we had a busy lunch or dinner rush and there wasn't enough employees to cover the rush. I learned how to handle difficult customers with ease and humanity and how to make a good mocha.
good,"The coworkers and most of the customers are quite nice. Therefore it is a good environment to be working in, but the management's expectations are a little too much. On a busy day if you win over the hearts of 20 customers and only one gets disappointed, then all your good work = 0 and you are to blame and at fault as an employee."
good,"It could get busy but it was always a good side to being at work.The team always got along and was like family. We were all able to help one another, even others in different departments."
good,Macys distribution center in martinsburg wv has an outstanding maintenance team . We have four peak seasons without a serious mechanical failure . As a team we were proud to address all of operations concerns as quickly as possible to keep product flowing .
good,"Friendly environment, mixed employee pool, very goal oriented, however driven by a non site specific management system that left no room for creative solutions to reaching goals.  A very different environment of retail sales and product receiving than I was used to, but my experience enabled me to to perform at an optimum level even though our department was suffering from lack of support."
good,"Positive environment, laid back, summer fridays. The company cares about its employees and does what it can to please them."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work and learn about the business market."
good,management and supervisors were always there to help with any questions which made it easy to do my job. I made my own schedule so it was easy to adapt with anything that may have happened outside of work.
good,A typical day at Macy's for me was at the beauty counter. I was able to use my love for cosmetics to use and sell them and use them on customers. win-win
good,I enjoyed my working at Macy's.  My supervisor was very friendly.  I would start the day very early.  I put merchandise away in the store before customers would arrive.  If employees did not finish he or she would have to work while the store is open and this would sometimes be difficult especially on a sale date.
good,"Macy's is an ever-changing environment adjusting to the needs of the customer.  Because of the size and structure of the company, sometimes there is instability that cause slow adjustments and unstableness for the associates.  "
good,"It's an alright place to work, they work with you in terms of scheduling for school and family time...management isn't always in sync with one another, I enjoy working in the team that I am in, everyone helps each other out, even though it is sales and commissioned we all help one another out and aren't catty."
good,My days consist of makeovers as well as full customer service. I've learned in all of my job experience you need knowledge and a strong communication system in order to run effectively. My managers overall have been good at keeping our employees as well as our day in a clear order. My coworkers are all very different which helps learn how to work with a range of personalities. The hardest part of my current job in a work place of commission based people is making sure we all have a respectable understanding of maintaining our sales. The most enjoyable is building a relationship with my customer and exceeding each need they came in for.
good,"I learned many aspects of customer service, merchandising, and training while working at Macy's."
good,"Macys was a fun environment to work in. I enjoyed working in all of the departments! I love the flexibility they give you in being able to create your own schedule. Great discounts, as well!"
good,I have been given the opportunity to grow within the company. The retail sector is a very fast past environment. In the Women Shoes department I had many opportunities to work in teams. Overall it is a well rounded workplace.
good,Macys has given me the opportunity to learn different skills and meeting so many different people from all walks of life. Every day is something different.
good,"A typical day at work is interacting with customers"
good,"Overall, great company.  Really enjoy working with everyone. Would recommend to anyone. I really being with my team on a daily basis and enjoy help bring great talent to the team."
good,Macy's is a phenomenal place to shop. Working there was quite an experience.  Some management should get a course on how to deal with their employees with respect.  Not not enough pay to even be treated unfairly.
good,People here weren't too helpful when i first started. Some were even rude. I had three people who helped me and i connected with them very well..
good,"Working at Macys I was a shoe salesman, which is pretty much whatI did all day. I learned to be attentive to peoples needs and listen to what they have to say. The management at Macys was horrendous, never having there stuff together."
good,"work was great but the person who made the schedule didn't speak English good. i learned a lot of stuff how to do ticketing and separating clothes. the co workers were friendly and polite,"
good,"Great every customer, help them pick out an outfit. Open new Macy's cards and inform customers the benefits of the card. Open and close registers. Organized the sales floor, maintained a clean, safe place for clients to shop and ensured a satisfied customer experience."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Although management was quick to help when in need, they didn't really train us very well prior to the first day on the job, making work life very difficult and most of the time hectic."
good,"overall the experience I had working at Macy's was pretty neutral. The benefits and pay are definitely too low for it to be a long term career, but if you are looking for something easy and short term or you're a student who just needs a part time job, then its the best fit for you."
good,"Productive workplace; good group of people to work with. I really like the fact that Macy's COs., gives back to the community through charitable efforts."
good,"Everyone's helpful on your first week in; showing you the ropes and guiding you through the job."
good,Fast paced environment. Goal oriented work place. Team building encouraged. Customer service is always the first priority of the company.
good,"Macy's offers a very flexible schedule for those who just want to work part time and you still get holiday pay, pto, and overtime when the holidays are around.  The main issue with Macy's is that they are very reduced on their staffing, if you don't mind overworking yourself and getting used to doing a job that should be tailored for 2 or 3 people then you will be fine.  If you're willing to work, you can count on having a secure spot, there are different positions for advancing as long as you're interested and willing.  Great hours for the holidays but when the slow seasons are around, hours drop so if you're not looking for a living wage, it's reasonable."
good,I will miss Macy's. It was a great place to work. Layoffs are hard to do but I understand the business needs. I hope to find another company like them.
good,There are a lot of cool people to work with and the day-to-day work life is fast paced most of the time and you have the ability to create long lasting relationships with customers and coworkers.
good,Great company to work for. Good people to work with. Diverse environment gives the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life.
good,Good experience learning about commission sales. Leaned about several different lines of cosmetics and fragrances. Unfortunately they do not have the hours that I need available in their budget.
good,"What can I say? Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy place. The staff was amazing. This Macy's is always super super super busy and it was alot but alot of fun working here. There was no time to goof off but it made time fly by."
good,working at macys was an amazing experience they duty of assisting customers with any and everything they needed done. Working with the public in a retail position was exciting for me because it taught me to learn the whole department store and each floor.
good,Arrived before store opened and immediately began unloading trucks. Learned about the different departments in the store. Co-workers were knowledgeable and helpful. Management was very friendly and seemed to really care about the support team.
good,At Macy's fulfillment center we were very productive and overcame any task given to us in patrol. It was tough but at the end of the day I could go home and be satisfied with my work done.
good,"All you have to do is to provide a good customer service. Knowing the product, what it is, and knowing the product. Need to working in a team. Giving better service."
good,Macys santaland was the most fun job I've every had. Volunteering at Lutheran Augustana and there was a bit of a struggle but I enjoyed it. Fun people.
good,"understanding work environment, patient and caring co workers, flexible schedule. incentives for helping security."
good,I learned a lot more about retail especially the business aspect of it and did a lot of projects I had not previously had the opportunity to participate in before. I have to say it was a nice and positive environment overall.  I got along really well with most of the employees and especially my boss however the pay was not satisfactory and it seemed the lazier and more condescending you were the more you were considered for a promotion.
good,"I had to drive my forklift truck to pick up items that had been lost. I had to do that in a certain amount of time. It was difficult at first, but I ended up getting it done quickly and got complemented for being fast."
good,"Fun environment, great feeling at the end of the day knowing we put people in the perfect outfit. Whether it was for a party that night, a wedding, or a first date."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Working at Macy's allowed me to step out of my own comfort zone and learn to relate to both customers and other associates. You are encouraged to be the best customer service representative that you can be and the management is there to give you advice and assistance on improvement in whatever areas needed. I would say the toughest part of the job would be working holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people everyday.
good,Whole team has great goal. Gives a lot back to community. Associates themselves with great organizations and loves to help out.
good,I would come to work and do my rounds complete what I needed to complete. help who I needed to help and be as courteous as I could be.
good,"responsible for associate performance merchandising schedules. Coaching, hiring, meetings, standards. working with Manager, Asst, Mgr and MTM."
good,Over all it is a great place to work. All the employees seem to be happy there and always helpful to others. As they say the Magic of Macy's.
good,One of the best places I've ever worked at. Overnight manager was extremely helpful with the processing and great guy all around.
good,Typical day consists of helping and assisting customers with making purchases. Very busy during holiday season which requires accuracy and patience when handling inventory.
good,"The people are friendly and courteous. The employees are the best ever, hard working people, care and people oriented who make Macy's a great place to work. The best part of the job: team work time and see customer's smiles ;)"
good,"Being that I am a full-time student, it is hard to receive hours as a seasonal employee. A typical day at work is greeting and approaching customers, watchful of any suspicious activity, a continuous explanation of store policy, especially regarding the use of coupons, and assuring that the customers had an enjoyable experience. The co-workers were very friendly and willing to help me on my first few ""new"" days. Macy's is my first retail job and the co-workers were understanding of that and helped me learn the system and policies for retail associates as mandated by the company. The hardest part of the job was working the weekends when I sometimes would get stuck behind my register because I was constantly receiving customers who were ready to check out. It becomes a bit demanding, especially when no one is there to cover your shift so that you can handle your other assigned duties such as refolding or hanging clothes, cleaning dressing rooms, or take your mandatory breaks. Overall, I enjoyed the experience."
good,Challenging environment. Very developmentally driven. You are responsible for bottom line profits and outer metrics.
good,"great place to get job experience! Great for younger people who are just getting into the work field. Like a big family, not a hard job at all. Just show up on time and do your job and you'll be fine."
good,I was one of the top sellers on the floor. I built a clientelle that depended on me to contact them for sales and to buy shoes and ship them to them.
good,Every Day for seasonal Sales associate position with a very nice team at the watches department with commission. It was very good experience to make goal every day at work.
good,A typical day at work consist of cleaning the sales floor and handling sales transactions.I learned how to multi task. Management was supportive. My coworkers were friendly some of whom have become close friends over the years.
good,"Macy's is a fun place to work especially when you're in the kids department! Just get all of your work done, make the customers happy and you'll be fine."
good,"Great customer interaction, fun work place, always hyped and positive environment. Always willing to help customers but, very competitive."
good,I enjoy how we are never just standing around and their is always something to do. My coworkers are very friendly especially the older women I work with. The hardest part of my job is probably learning where everything goes as soon as possible.
good,macys was a exciting place to work. I learned how to better deal with people.how to better manage my time.my co-workers were fun to work with.the hardest part of the job was some co-workers tried to make work diffcult The most enjoyable part was dealing with the many different people
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,great enviorment and very convient employees are allowed to create their own schedules. Hours are available and managers are professional.
good,Great place to work especially if your open to the idea of change and a fast paste environment. There is always something going on inside the store and its a great place to expand and network.
good,"Minus the aggravating coworkers and the weak training, i actually love working at Macy's! But just starting out, i wasn't even taught how or where to clock in! The pay is okay for my age."
good,"Assist customers in all aspects of service fulfillment by demonstrating proficient use of proprietary devices and applications; proactively create enhanced shopping experiences through the heightened use of tools, technology and collaboration "
good,Very nice place to work at. Comfortable. People are very nice.Lots of opportunities to Grow and learn. Fun place to Work.
good,Management and associates are supportive and fun to work with.  There is a good team spirit.  Building is outdated.  Wide variety of people to work with. Lack of set schedule can be challenging.
good,"challenging company that unfortunately values unexperienced college graduates more than seasoned professionals.  Management is well compensated, but there is little work life balance"
good,Nice company to work for.  Pay is great.  You meet a lot of people .  Walking to and from is a good exercise.  Promotion is far from reality.
good,"Spent the summer working in the fine jewelry department.  I learned a ton about sales, service, and fine jewelry.  Hardest part of the job was the inventory process at the end of a shift."
good,"As a fine jewelry saleswoman, if I opened, I would pull the diamonds and put them in the caseline, making sure they were straight and tidy and clean. I would then open registers. Then, once the store opened, I would greet customers and offer assistance. I learned a lot about diamonds and precious and semi-precious stones, as well as a lot of security measures."
good,early start work early finish. flexible scheduale. lots of time management and quick thinking needed. Patients is the key to get through the day
good,"It's an okay place to work until you need a manager. Managers seem to never want to help and when you ask them for assistance they tell you to handle it basically. They also never back you up when there are problems with co workers. They have favoritism with certain employees and let them do whatever they want; leave early, take really long breaks all day, and they don't help clean up. The best thing about the job is that it's really flexible, can be fast pace at times, and the Macy's money. There are also some really nice people there besides the employees that don't do much, but I guess that's something you can deal with at any job."
good,I enjoyed working here as my first job. My co-workers were very helpful and the customers were understanding. I caught on very quick and became lead.

good,liking it so far. just getting started but work with a good group of people. only a few weeks in. busy work so shift goes fast.
good,"A good place to work in. Was able to build relationships with customers. Co-workers were very nice, was a pleasure working with them."
good,"Macys was good but they do expect you to sell so much and if you don't make your sales goal, you will fall in deficit. It's a good company, just don't fall behind or you are screwed"
good,"exciting and goal oriented carrer minded .fun place to work ."
good,"Set up displays and arranged mannequins. Computed sales prices, total purchases and received and processed payments. Ticketed, arranged, and displayed merchandise to promote sales."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Typical Day at work would be cleaning shoe display, ringing up customers, provide customers with shoe products such as: insoles, show cleaners."
good,"Working at Macys is definitely laid back environment, but often times stressful for us sales associates trying to make ends meet at work and at home. if I recommended anyone to work at Macys I would say be prepared to be the best customer service associate you can be, its a very competitive environment."
good,"Lots of opportunities to show you care about your fellow man, big on volunteering and charity.  Big on diversity, too.  This year we lost traditional insurance and went to High Deductible only insurance plans."
good,"The daily responsibilities helped you learn to drive individual businesses and strive to beat set goals."

good,Macys is a awesome environment to work for to learn many experiences. The people are friendly and the customers are reasonable.
good,Was a fun Job to work. It was a big company but they make sure you don't get lost in the mix of everything. Corporate manager himself would just come ask you or reward on on your day of work. I worked there during the holidays i was unfortunately did not continue there after the holidays.

good,The Macy's customers are exciting and ready to shop! The authorizations team is the best! They have a huge cantina for the employees and they have lots of events to keep you busy!
good,"Retail on a large scale.  Store nine floors big.  Management are great people to work with and supply great training, and a great place to move up."
good,"Macy's was a great experience for me, I enjoyed the variety that it brought me since everyday was different; I had a great relationship with management and felt motivated to work. The hardest part of the job way the pay which was commission based, I could work all day and leave with having made a few dollars, I didn't like the uncertainty in that."
good,Work consisted on providing great customer service to guests.  We created new guests profiles and relationships every day.  The highlights were to see returning guests because that expressed how enjoyable their experience was.

The managers and the co-workers were really fun to work with, the co-workers were always asking if someone needed an extra hand and were great at teamwork. The manager was always available to talk if anyone needed to talk, to encourage people to do the best at their work.

My Co-workers and management were both amazing, kind, knowledgeable, and helpful, they made working at Macy's even better."

good,"Sales associate, fitting room attendant"
good,"It was always something to do. If you finished your work task for the day, it was always something else to move on it next. I've learned how to really organize and communicate with customers. Management was excellent, all the managers were understanding and reasonable if possible. My co-workers were also friendly and approachable if you wasn't sure about an task. The hardest part was trying to make an unhappy customer satisfied without any problems. The happiest part was just meeting people."
good,I had fun working for this company.Everyone was respectable and professional so it made it very easy to get along with everyone.
good,"Internal and  external apprehensions. Audits, training associates. Manager meetings, inventory planning. Great for training and teaching and preparing for possible future advancements"
good,"Good people to work with, good work environment, helpful coworkers, steady work pace, tough work but also fair, easy if responsible."
good,"Macy's is a very fun place to work, you don't have to do much except clean out dressing rooms and get people to sign up for credit cards.  As long as you meet your daily goals and get people to sign up for cards you are good to go! Customers can also go online and compliment you and if they do that manages really don't care if you aren't meeting your CC goals."
good,I had a lot of fun working at Macy's. I meet a lot of nice people and learn a lot about the company. Some area in the store is very boring to work in but overall it was a great exp.
good,"•	Exceeded daily sales goals by $50,000."
good,"My co-workers is what makes this job worthwhile. Most comfortable people to be around and make the day go by faster. Management is hit-and-miss. While not bad or harsh, they often don't give enough training to new hires and can't answer some questions that they should be able to."
good,Working as a Macy's employee gives you the opportunity to learn how to work well with different types of people whether it be fellow employee's or everyday customers.
good,Great job to start for retail sales. High volume and fast paced. Great co-workers. Loved the customers. The hardest part was working holidays
good,"Macy's constantly motivated the employees to enhance and improve their skills. While working there, I learned to always use positive energy, regardless of the circumstances."
good,"Working there was great i miss it wish i got more hours so i could have stayed there longer. Management was great, employees were good. Hours and pay were good."
good,A typical day at Macy's consisted of me folding and cleaning the fitting rooms and if need be I worked the cash register and we had to make daily goals of selling items and getting customers to apply for a Macy's card.
good,"Working at this location was full of ups and downs.  While I truly enjoyed my job for the most part and loved my coworkers, there were unrealistic expectations held of the people employed in my particular area of the store. As commission sales associates, they on one hand wished us to supply excellent customer service, but alternately wanted us to do the merchandising and support work for the area, which took away from our sales, with little to no aide from support or merchandising from those whose job assignment was as such."
good,"I would do stock and sales for toys and luggage, for example of i needed to fill in the luggage that was missing i would go to the stock room and bring down what i needed same with the toys, when i wasn't doing that i was making sure i would take good care of all my customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is all about personal growth for each sales associate. When you work there you truly feel like you are apart of the family. Training takes about a day and a half then you are thrown out into the water. But don't be frightened because they don't expect you to know everything right away. Working here has taught me a lot about customer service and what it means to truly make sure you give 100% of your self.
good,"Provided excellent customer service, sign and merchandise department, restock and display maintenance, perform support audits and markdowns, trained new hire team members "

good,"Great co-workers and managers, everyone really looked out for each other and managers were keen to work in a very positive way with employees."
good,"Productive, good team players, great bosses! Worked organizing accessories and clothing by various designers. Learned the Magic of Macy's."
good,I learned a lot and grew so much in such a short period of time.  I wish I could have stayed longer but the position was seasonal.
good,"Management created a team environment. The work was exciting, but management did not have systems in place to capture lessons from unsuccessful ideas. It is a team environment in a very competitive business market so individual accomplishments sometimes diluted by higher performance by competitors."
good,"Fast pace and great associates.  Had to locate, find and ship merchandise to customers in a timely manor as well as ringing up and helping customers when ever it is needed."
good,"Sales, you will push credit cards. Credit is all management cares for, you get 3$ macys money for opening a credit. I learned how to ask questions that tailor to each person individually"
good,I really enjoy working for Macy's because I enjoy meeting people I enjoy being a Sales Associate. I'm only a part-time employee however when I'm at work there is never a dull moment. Because I end my shift I always meet a very interesting customer.

good,"handling fine jewelry"
good,"I always learn new stuff at work have more self confident in myself"
good,"Macys is always busy. You get to interact with customers, meet people. Most of the employers are very respectful and easy going. Work area is clean for the most part, cashing system is up to date. And most managers are really nice."
good,"I only worked a seasonal sales associate position so I wasn't working long enough to get the best feel of the work environment.  I learned that people take shopping way too seriously and will throw clothes and shoes all over the place for no apparent reason.  My managers were nice and so were most of my co-workers.  However, there were a few long-term sales associates who were rude, unwelcoming, and overall unhappy people who I was surprised had a job there for as long as they have."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I really liked working one of my favorite shopping store. I learned new skills and mea lot of different people. I enjoyed the holidays with people from different countries.

good,I loved working at Macy because you never knew who you were going to meet or check out. The co-workers and staff is fun and upbeat.
good,You will meet many people form many walks of life. The couples are fun to work with. The environment is a fast pace. However the staffing in the department is poor and managers seem to care more about the company credit card program then their people.
good,Great company to work for. I would work for them at any time in the near future. I enjoy shopping so Macy's was a good fit.I enjoy helping customers.
good,"Spent time working with executive team.  Walking the floor reviewing merchandising, recovery of floor and fixture placement.  SPent time with the sales managers and associates while on the floor coaching and working on product knowledge and customer service.  Spent time daily reviewing business what is working and not working.  Putting together strategies to course correct opportunities and leverage wins. Work/Life balance was hard as it always is in retail.  Favorite part of my job was any opportunity I had to coach and develop the team to grow and move on to bigger jobs through reviewing reports, supporting them on how to drive their business, helping them think outside the box when necessary."
good,"A typical day include stocking clothes, having lunch and working at the register. I learned the management of money and providing good customer service. Management was okay. Coworkers were okay as well."

good,"flexible hours, great working environment, often very busy around winter holidays, professional but fun. Great if you like interacting with people. Be prepared to wear black everyday."
good,Every night before staring the register I made sure the area was neat and ready to go.  I had to start putting a code in the register.  I learned that the customer is always right.  The hardest part of the job when it will get busy. the most enjoyable part of the job when I had control of helping customer.
good,customer service and fast paced establishment.  Work will under pressure.  enjoy meeting new people and structured environment

The most enjoyable part of the job was problem solving the huge workload, and making the stockrooms functional."
good,"I started out as a sales manager and moved around to larger departments of responsibilities.  When Foleys became Macys I was selected as the stores MTM (Merchandise Team Manager).  Over the years I have trained, coached and developed many people that not only grew with the company but also advanced their careers out side of the company. I have been in retail management with this company for 18 plus years.  In the last eight years the job has taken many different roles to include total store sales, profit, and loss along with responsible for all back off office work and logistics. The hardest part of the job was not being able to focus on one area more then the other.  The merchandising sales aspect and the store operations side needed the same quality of time yet the job seemed to not permit it to be possible at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the training and growth of employees and all the different things I have learned through the years in all areas of a Department Store."
good,"Making sure the clients are taking care of while review their party"
good,"Macy's employs people of all races, ages, and abilities.  The work environment is cordial and the store is kept up to date with fashions to satisfy the general demographic."
good,"Train new employees with the day-to-day internal operations, prepare the materials needed to support professional development, and instruct the teams on how to navigate the company’s ICM and MSA system. Conduct and guide the training on multiple business divisions, such as the retail services, collections department, and on-line ordering."
good,Pay is not great and they will run you in to the ground about credit card applications.
good,Had hoped to be offered permanent employment at the end of the holidays. Enjoyed the fast paced work and fellow employees.
good,"Some of the people are great, but no one responds to feedback unless it comes from a customer which majority of the time still does nothing. There are also a couple of managers who are very nasty and take advantage of the fact that they feel they have more authority."
good,"A typical day would be to Walk with VPSM (store manager) to see the needs of the store and to get partnership from the SM's to recovver there areas."
good,Great team work.  Love the flexible hours.  Coworkers are very helpful and attentive.
good,"It's what you would expect working at Macy's would be.  Co-workers were great, management can be a little stuffy."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Macy's Inc.  I was always busy, helping customers and maintaining my department. I had great co-workers who where helpful and friendly.  I did not like the way schedules were made, but they did have online accessibility to change, pick up or trade shifts with other employees.  The hardest part of the job would be irate customers and dressing room clean up during peak times.  I really enjoyed helping customers find outfits, and items they wanted or needed."
good,II enjoyed helping the customers  and convincing them to buy items. I learned so much about people there. The hardest part of the job was the mandatory days we had to work.
good,good experience but declined job offer. Good exposure to higher ups but sometimes substituted for missing sales associates.
good,everyone is nice and there is always someone to help you. i liked working there because it was easy and understandable. I use to work on the dock and that was pretty easy except when it use to freeze in the winter time. The co-workers and management was very nice and friendly. I could always go to them if i ever needed help. Other than that it's a good work place.
good,The hardest part of the job was making sure I could appease every customer I had in an efficient amount of time.  Always busy which made the day go by quick. Sales goals always almost met and exceeded.
good,Macy's offers great benefits and focuses on work life balance for associates. They have an opportunity to do a better job with staffing for customer needs and need more managers to lessen the work load and create a more feasible work load for all.
good,At Macy's I was a women's shoe sales associate. I was ranked #1 at my position throughout my time there. Hardest part of the job was when the store was busy but regarding compensation that was also the best part of the day.

good,Macy's likes to promote within and provides an opportunity for those who want to advance.

good,"The most enjoyable part of working here was working during the holidays. Seeing all the new faces come through the door with smiles on their faces was enjoyable. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, working with them made work so much better."
good,"A typical day was very easy, the store was very big so there was some stressful days. Management was up and down because of the department i stayed in.

good,"load/unload trucks, help others with work areas, keep work area clean"
good,"It could be fast pace, but most of the time it's slow."
good,Macy's is not bad but all the work you do is not worth  just $8 an hour. But most of the associates I work with are really nice.
good,"Overall, you're able to meet sales goals. "
good,The turnover rate is high.  A lot has changed in the last few years.  sounds like the employees are becoming more like just a number and are losing valuable employees.
good,great place to work added bonus for open credit accounts great employee discount
good,Would come tomwork and pick up and pit clothes away from earlier in the day. Customer service and more.. nice company to work for
good,"Macy's is one of the best retailers that I have had the pleasure of working for. There are constant updates that not only work with pleasing the customers, but the employees as well. "
good,They have teams for everything like inventory and organization so you feel you don't do much as an associate. You get compensated and they are very sales driven. Very little training so you have to learn quickly.
good,I learned to balance a register and made employee of the month the first month  I was hired.
good,Macys provides you with a ever changing fast paced environment that requires you to make sound business decisions on a daily basis. However while it is a good company there are not a whole lot of opportunities for career advancement.
good,"I started working at Macy's as a seasonal sales associate. It was my first job in retail, so I was excited. Being a seasonal hire, I got to work in various departments. I learned how to lock up valuable merchandise, organize inventory, and handle cash registers. I learn and adjust fairly quickly, so once I was a month in working there, I was often put in charge of teaching the Macy's protocols to other seasonal hires. Doing this, I learned a lot about management and multi-tasking. Thought it was difficult to handle at times, I pulled through and got the work done. I am very grateful for that."
good,Learned a lot about the Calvin Klien company. Co workers were nice and the work was fun.
good,"This company is very profitable and provided me with good customer service, sales, and management experience."

good,Macys is an ok place to work if your in college without a lot of bills to pay. A typical day is working with an copious amount of customers who are sometime very impatient so you must be able to handle different attitudes quickly. Must be able to smile even when you dont want.
good,"A typical receiving day had me coming in to print the load information for the crew and reviewing the production time limits.

good,This was a great job for college students. flexible hours and managers worked with you. I do not recommend this job for people who are lazy and only show up just to get paid. You have to be active and engaging to make your goals in the commissioned areas.
good,unload grocery truck and restock dairy products. answer any questions a customer had
good,"Macy's is a great place to work.  My co-workers are fun, knowledgeable, and are definitely a part of a team. My day starts with opening the register, attending the morning rally, and getting my counter ready for the day. Our team advises customers on skin care, makeup advice, and provides one-on-one consultations. We prepare merchandise for selling, handle stock, organize our products, and interact with all customers. I love having a customer come in, asks questions, and together we find a beauty skin/makeup routine, and they leave feeling better about themselves when they first came in."

good,team members are hard working. Mamagers really work with you in great detail concerning training.
good,"As a macy's associate we're given a sales goal to reach each shift worked. That in itself creates competition between each associate. It becomes ""cut throat"" associates taking customers from one another. "

good,Macy's is a great company - flexible and interesting work environment
good,Greet every guest with polite manners and enthusiasm. Learned entire product line through very educational training courses. Management was great. Co-workers were team players. Credit card applications were the hardest part of the job. Best Part was helping our guest leave satisfied and become a loyal customer.
good,"the day started by opening 5 registers,checking current sales of the day. Walking the sales floor looking to assist customers and tidy"
good,Flexible hours if you are a student.  Making Sales are very important.
good,Macy's works very hard to ensure a quality customer experience. From high level exec's to the housekeeping department they train will with a single directive. They also participate in a large amount of charitable work and encourage associates to do the same. And don't forget about the parade!

Such as the difference between cotton sheets and sateen sheets, the knowledge of stainless steel 18/10 flatware, non stick versus stainless steel pots and pans. China and luggage just to name a few. As well as learning about lingerie. Macy's is a good job to be able to connect with customers and create a clientele. A regular day at Macy's is usually a fast pace always a busy day, making sure customers are satisfied and more. Working with customers, a variety of customers with different styles and attitudes is the hard part about the job. But if you take your time, spending time with them, making sure you understand their needs, it becomes one of the joys of working on the job!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Working at Macy's as a commission employee has been a new and valuable experience. The ability to sell isn't easy to everyone so it's best that i go in every day with a positive and confident mindset. I've learned great multitasking skills and operating a P.O.S performing functions in which usually managers are only allowed to perform in other companies.  We experience a high volume of shoppers so at times it may get a bit overwhelming. The management team does a great job at encouraging us to out do ourselves and assisting us with problems or questions we might have during the shift. What i enjoy the most about the job is being the reason for a customer leaving happy.
good,"A typical day for me involves replenishing stock, managing inventory , unloading stock, supporting sales associates and management. I have learned great organizational skills, customer service and patience in a high volume environment. I often found that some management were very difficult to work with and bias. The quality of my work as well as my initiative were often overlooked and under appreciated. There were virtually no chances for advancement. Most of my co-workers were very supportive and enjoyable. The hardest part of my job on a daily basis was dealing with harsh management practices and the best part of my job was coming in contact with so many people from all over the world every day."
good,"I love working in a nonstop environment.  This position taught me how to be more competitive and to stand up for myself.  Unbeknownst to most, selling shoes is very competitive because your pay is relevant to the amount of personnel you attend."
good,great place to work and there is never a dull moment. Co workers are amazing and aways willing to teach. I am part of the management team and we do everything we can for our customers and associates.
good,"Open Boxes"
good,It is a fast paced and always changing environment.  But it is fun to be there and coach and develop the team members.
good,"1.	Greeted customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs."
good,"You have many responsibilities at Macy's. There are personal and team goals that are required to be met daily, weekly, and monthly. There is a good amount of structure within management but you are also very free to do what you need to do. It's a good place to grow as an employee."
good,Advising customers on purchases. Selling and recovering merchandise.
good,I enjoyed working for Macy's. I loved being able to work around clothes and putting stuff together.
good,"Fun but nerve wreaking. Co workers were cool people. Managers were scattered between cool and complete ""blanks"". Just dealing with that and all of the consumers was nerve wreaking enough and was hardest part of the job."
good,"A typical day at Macys was fast paced and there was always something to do. I learned excellent customer service skills. The managers weren't very hands on and they weren't all on the same page or very knowledgeable about certain things. My co-workers were easy to get along with, some of them didn't work and others did. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers and some of their attitudes. The most enjoyable part was helping those customers who did appreciate us and providing them a wonderful experience at Macys."
good,On a typical day at Macys I would be in the girls junior department helping customers find outfits that suit their liking. Most times I would engage with the customers and the happiest days were sale days in which I got to be a small portion in helping the client save money. Management was really good. There was not a very hard part of the job but the most enjoyable part was meeting  new customers.
good,I enjoyed the daily challenges of my position at Macy's. They were reasonably accommodating to my family needs and the schedule and location worked well for our needs.
good,I love the fact that I can help my customers on each call with whatever problem there having with there medications it makes them more happier to know someone cares
good,"They are constantly training the employees, giving them more information about the brands they sell the most and giving them daily briefings about new offers, sales and encouraging them to open new accounts. it is a peaceful environment and you have the possibility to have a good interaction with the customers and making them your clients getting some of their personal information so you can call the clients when you find out the company has a good offer that fits perfect with their likes and needs."
good,"A typical day at work would be me working,making sure customer is satisfied no matter what"
good,I enjoyed working here very much the staff is great and the patients are very down to earth too
good,This was a good starting job that gave me an opportunity out of college. My co workers and managers were very nice and helpful.

good,"Day @ work start with open the registers. check prices and sales on the floor."
good,Working at Macy's has taught me more than just excellent customer service. I was able to reach my daily sales goals and my weekly credit goals.
good,"I worked in the handbags and accessories department. It was my first job and I liked it a lot. I was nervous at first, but surprisingly to me, for a large store and big company, everyone was really nice and welcoming. It was only a seasonal job so I wasn't there more that 4 months, but it was fun learning about sales, how to use a cash register, and all the workings of a big store like Macy's."
good,"a typical day at work involves me always talking and making customers happy while working with fun people. Sometimes things get hectic , but that's when problem solving comes in. Its great to know that you've made someones day because you have product knowledge and are aware of what you can do to make a customer happy and satisfied."
good,"Like the job for ease on slow days. At my location an average day wen by with no major issues. It was typical to retail. You did always have to pay attention to what's going on for the day, week, month or event period."
good,"I loved working here because of my customers and my co-workers, but overall, it was a frustrating place to work. Scheduling was tricky - shifts could be added to your schedule 24 hours prior, even though the schedule was released a week in advance, and they only opened  it up for you to change your availability twice per year instead of as-needed. We were also often understaffed, and constantly got complaints, but despite that, nothing changed. I also felt like credit cards and other promotional material were pushed far too hard, and too much was expected out of us. They were more concerned with the numbers than our well-being."
good,"Giid people, nice place of business, would've stayed longer."
good,"This job required me to multitask between assisting multiple customers, and helped me better develop my people skills; a invaluable asset in any job."
good,"Life a Macy's is different each day.  As a Flex Team member, I chose to work in various cosmetics and fragrance areas, depending on the hours available.  The management team expectations and rules are not consistent with all team members.  The rules vary according to what the management with team members who open credit accounts.  At times, the management has put associates on the spot about their performance in front of customers and other associates.  However, the compensation is much more than a hourly wage.  Associates receive commission, incentives for contests, and discounts on merchandise."
good,"The company has many positions with different requirement of work hours for each quarter. Can add shifts, switch shift, and get rid of shifts without going through management. "
good,"The employee discounts are awesome. The online scheduling system is so convenient and provides you with so much information. The pay was not very good, barely over minimum wage. At the beginning of my employment I was giving a lot of hour right off the bat due to sales, and I was not expecting that."
good,improved my customer service skills as well my computer skills.
good,"the transportation that time was not in my favor . and also dealing with school, also  money was  not to good."
good,I enjoyed my seasonal job. My team players were very cooperative and supportive. Great environment. Loved helping the customers.

good,helping customers find what they're looking for and also working as a cashier
good,During my time at Macy's it was easy and enjoyable. The managers really cared and tried to help with everything that you may need.
good,"The Magic of Macy's is real, from the people to the environment. Customer interaction drives this fast paced goal oriented company. The employees are dedicated, smart and driven. Each day is packed with fun, and plenty to do. One doesn't get bored."
good,Macy's was an okay employer. The management was friendly at times. I got to learn new skills.
good,My coworkers are the best. They make coming into work each day bearable. The customers can be difficult but the management is the worst part. Not consistent and favoritism is played.
good,"Learned about conflict resolution and diplomacy when dealing with customers. Wore many hats in that position, from making connections with customers to doing go-backs of the merchandise."
good,"short hours"
good,"I like working for macy's as a counter manager my responsibility  are..make sure counter is always clean,product knowledge, and sit customers down for makeover and skin consultation. Also,direct my help at the counter to sit customers down and show products and clean up after so we always have a great look at counter. I learned that everyone is different and to listen carefully to what customers or co-workers are saying ..not everyone see things my way ... need to get a long and have fun which i always have.The hardest part of my job is getting through to some workers how important it is to sit customers down and create relationship and trust so customers will come back. I have a make up certification and worked for over 20 years selling skin care and makeup."
good,long hours with ok pay ...its a good job to start at and move up in the company
good,"Working for Macy's has been a very educational experience for me.  I was able to develop sales skills on a daily basis, as well as build a customer clientele.  Overall I would encourage other students to work for Macy's due to the flexibility of your schedule and the fast paced, fun environment.  The pay is minimum wage but the employee discounts are a huge plus and can help build a professional wardrobe for your future business needs."
good,"hard to communicate with co-workers and managers but working was very fun, fast, clean"
good,no real benefits but cool place to work for a single person with no children

Management was nice and always made sure you were on top of your assigned area. Co-workers were good as well if you needed help with something they would always be willing to help you. The hardest part of the job would probably be finding where everything goes in your department.

good,"Fun. Nice co-workers, nice supervisors. Enjoyed assisting customer."
good,The hours are the best! The people on my team are great and are all team players helping one another.
good,"Working for Macys can be good and bad at the same time. You have a great group of co workers who make the job a lot of fun and enjoyable. At times though the management seems confused a lot of the times about policies or they pick and choose when to enforce certain rules according to policy. Overall its good for building relationships and constant exposure to customers, but as far as how its ran the management needs to be consistent"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I would pick orders for customers and I would have to do it very quickly and had to be accurate to avoid mistakes in the shipment process. Also, I replenish product so that the merchandise was there for the picker to pick up. I also did packouts and returns in my down time, Went down aisle to keep neat and organized. "
good,managers did not stick up to customers that have a certain thought of how a sales associate should work. people dont always go to other peoples jobs and complain but if they did at macys it was like the end of the world for the manager

good,Macy's/Bloomingdale's is a great place to work for.  If you are looking for a job or starter career this is the place to be.  I worked in retail services this department is all about the customer.  No matter what department you are in under this umbrella you are right there communicating and interacting with the customer one on one.  Which is great.  I was a chatter so I dealt with customers via I.M.  This had its ups and downs.  Though is was great that you typed all day and did not have some one screaming in your ear all day.  The downside was that you had to assist up to 3 people at a time.  Which if you are not the best multi-tasker was not good.  But it is adaptable and can easier become a career.
good,Enjoyed working with customers. Typical work day was fast paced and rushed. I enjoyed helping customers to shop and get great deals.
good,"If you like retail jobs, it is a good place to work. "

good,It is good company to work for. good learning experience for fashion and brand names of clothing. Great discounts for employees.
good,"A typical day was very long (10-12 hours) and challenging.  Functions had to be monitored constantly. If deliveries were cancelled or running late staffing would need to be reassessed immediately and associates reassigned to different department or sent home.  This was a constant moment by moment challenge.  "
good,During the holiday season it is very active and busy also fast pace. I learn to handle customers issues and problem when needed help. The management department was okay.

good,"Only worked part time, I learned that good customer service is very important,"
good,"So much to do when you work at Macy's Clinique. Put away stock, consult with customers and call clients for replenishment are all in a days work. Your job is what you make it so we have a lot of fun with each other and the clients as well. We are competitive amongst each other but we are a close knit group on and off the clock so its healthy. Hardest part of the job is when something is out of your control like coupons not working on cosmetics. But when you create a positive environment and provide an excellent experience for the customer those obstacles are easily overcome. The best part is working with clients and building lasting relationships. When dealing with something so personal like a person's insecurities in a public setting you have to be understanding, non-judgemental, and knowledgeable. It's so rewarding when your client stops by just to say hi or she requests you when she returns for replenishment."
good,My first job was at Macy's. I learned a lot from working there.

good,"Working at Macy's was fun at times and have met great people along the way. Every place you work has its ups and downs but at Macy's, the environment and the people are very friendly and will lend helping hands and customer service is very good. The hardest part working at Macy's is thier are only a few people working in the morning (one person at a register)and the night shift there should be more closing and not have one employee straighten up a whole section and count the drawer down."
good,get to pick your own hours and it was fun interacting with customers.

good,"The position was actually really fun. From the opportunity to learn of different fashions, to satisfying a customer with what they are looking for, Macy's was the perfect balance of professional and fun. The only reason they did not receive a full 5 stars is because you could not guarantee job security."
good,"A normal day at Macy's Stockton has slow traffic. The usual customers during the day are senior citizens and college students. During sales days it can get a little more hectic. I've learned how to be a better listener and how to a little more patient. It is definitely important to stay neutral and calm in this position. It is also important to be able to work quickly yet efficiently to help the flow of traffic go smoothly. My co-workers are truly hard workers that provide good customer services and go out of their way to make the customer happy. However, in doing that, it can cause the flow of traffic to go slower and create long lines. Management is always professional but still try to keep the atmosphere fun by having contest during the day/week. The hardest part about the job is dealing with an angry customer or a customer that doesn't speak English. We don't have many bilingual associates so the language barrier can sometimes take away from getting a good sale. The most enjoyable part of working for Macy's is when a customer is truly satisfied with their experience and show true gratitude to you for your assistance."

good,It was a temporary job but a really good company to work for.  Not enough hours or pay.
good,"everyone has a positive attitude, fun friendly environment."
good,Great place to work. Extended store hours can be stressful.
good,"I trained my co-workers on the details of all the watches we carried.  Unfortunately the new manager was out of his league and unable to control the employees he had.  I felt my job was at risk daily because people were not take security measures properly, and this made everyone's job at risk."
good,"Days at work varied depending on day of the week either by setting sales or taking them down.  On major sale days the customer in need was the important thing to work on.  Making the sale was important, but making them happy was more important."

good,"Assisted costumers with merchandise locations and queries."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I  really liked it there, especially once the other associates warmed up to me but with the work environment upper management creates and the minimal hourly pay/ commissions it took three months to be accepted and taken seriously. I did however enjoy it as long as I didn't take the indifferent and sometimes a bit hostile attitude of my coworkers too personally. Not a place for overly sensitive people to say the least."

good,"A typical day at work consists of keeping busy, getting tasks done and assisting customers as needed. I learned that everyone has patience to a certain extent, as well as you grow close to the people you work with. Management was alright, managers seemed to come and go and didn't stay for long. Co-workers make you want to show up to work and others don't. The hardest part of the job was being alone on a busy day. When you have so many things to get done and not help, it is hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends and getting the things you needed to get done, done."
good,"Great place to work,Greeted store patrons by making a connection: asked questions and listen to shoppers' needs, then gave options and advice on meeting those needs by provided knowledge of men’s suits and shoes and other store stock. Inspired the customer to buy, and created a positive impression of their shopping experience, and the purchase. Established a customer relationships and loyalty through personal interaction and the maintenance of a client files. Ensured fitting rooms were ready for customers by promptly clearing out merchandise and returning it to the proper area of the selling floor.

good,Learned a lot regarding the workings and behind the scenes of how us consumers are protected
good,As a part time Visual Security Officer I learned a great deal for the  almost 2 years that I was employed with Macy's. My typical shift was to patrol the floor for any obvious hazards to customers and associates. Checked for any obvious safety deficiencies (ex. missing fire safety equipment etc.). The next responsibility was to patrol the floor or being posted at one of many entrances/exits and observe any suspicious activity - associate or customer. If any activities I deemed suspicious I would call up (via radio) to the CC office to begin surveillance. At times it became difficult to watch for suspicious behavior when dressed with a distinguishable jacket that stood out like a soar thumb (it was red). When the floor became very busy during sales and holiday's it really kept you on your toes because of the many nooks and crannies on the floor. But it was most of the time enjoyable.
good,A great workplace to build internal and external relationships.
good,"A great place to work, warm atmosphere. co- workers were understanding and helpful"

It's called making Magic, not all customers know what he or she needs upon entering a store it's our job to ask the right questions.

The co-workers stayed on their  task so it made working with them very relaxing and settle. I learned to handle return while i was here.
good,"a typical day consisted of making and prepping food the concessions stand, taking tickets, cleaning theaters, stocking and customer service. This is a great job for a first job, the staff are friendly and very diverse, the management are on their job and work well as a team.

Everyday i restock merchandise from the fitting room, greet customers and answer any inquires they have. Work together with co-workers to keep the store clean and organized and help each other make our daily goal. The management is encouraging always pushing me to meet my daily goals, and always there when i need help understanding certain programs or if i have any questions.

good,Good place to work. Very fast paced. Sometimes a challenge when things were hard to pack in a box.
good,"Having worked for big name retailers such as, Wal-Mart and Target, Macys is definitely a nice change. They really show that they care about the employees working the ""front lines"". Management does not walk around on a ""high horse"" and make you feel inferior. Everyone there is also very friendly and easy to get along with. While everyday isn't always the very best, management doesn't wavier in those times. They like you to know that they are there in any situation, and for that I'm very grateful."
good,"Macy's has a great name, but not a lot of opportunity for internal people"

Management would let us know of any special deals going on that day and recommend some selling strategies. Then each section would prepare their area to the best of their abilities. Once customers started arriving, we would help them locate any item of interest and make recommendations on how based on what we thought would be in the customers interests as well. "

I learned the sales side of retail when it came to helping customers make decisions on their purchases. I learned how to manage the workplace while multitasking and taking care of every other aspect of my job. I mostly worked alone in the men's department but once in a while I would work with other people and it was a good experience. There really wasn't anything hard about this job in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of this job was just interacting with so many different people. I love people and I am very outgoing so I tend to enjoy working in a team environment. "

Taking what I've learned at school about online marketing, I am able to implement some of that to people in real time by observing, assisting, and openly suggesting what the customers should try next. Working with co-workers and customers alike, I was able to understand how relationships are built to maintain trust. Internal trust as an employee with the company's management and work ethics, also the trust between the customer and the company's values. The hardest part of the job would have to be staying awake through all the long, slow-moving training videos that are mandatory for employees to watch. What I enjoy most about this job is the location - it is in the very heart of Oahu, which makes it an idea tourist trap. I'm able to meet people from all over the world by staying in one place!

I worked here for 2 years, I never hated it, it was a job, and I was always surrounded by great coworkers, there is a huge ""compliance"" hype with Macy's, so be prepared to spend your entire life there.

I've also learned other things such as how to tie bow ties, how to measure/fit for male dress shirts.  The hardest part of working here is meeting sales quotas when their aren't many customers shopping in your department.  The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's is the discount, and being able to see the fashion trends of the season first hand.  The thing I really love is the ability to swap, and advertise your shifts for any departments; their scheduling system is the best."
good,"Assisted customer with all store product as well as promotions within  the store."
good,"I would say I enjoy working at Macys, However the pay doesnt come with many advances/raises. It takes greater efforts to get past the goals that are high. The environment can be hostile with associates against associates with goals, sales and loyalties. Management is good however pushed much harder for results which in turn gets taken out on associates at times. Security is also a more difficult thing to control. Associates are almost like the stores LP with little assistance at times trying to stop those who take advantage of the systems. "
good,A typical busy day at work consists of assisting customers with large and small transactions while also assisting with credit card payments. It can get a little messy behind the register but with help it isn't hard to clean up. I've learned how to work as a team and fast paced.

I learned about different cultures, different ways to improve my customer service skills, and the software that was recommended for the customer service position. The management was okay. My co-workers were okay, I had the opportunity to make some amazing friends while employed. The hardest part about the job was satisfying the customer when they were in a bad mood, in a hurry, or on there cell phones. The most enjoyable part of the job was the reaction on the customers face when they were 100% satisfied. "
good,"Went to help customers find what they needed, organized merchandise."
good,"Every day was different which created new challenges and learning experiences.  The hardest and least enjoyable part of the job was the erratic scheduling system which became less and less flexible.  It does not allow for work/life balance and interferes with productivity.  The most enjoyable parts of the job were  (1) the relationships that developed among co-workers and with clients, (2)the satisfaction in helping people, and (3) the enjoyment of building and growing a business."

The coworkers are really nice except for a few people with not so nice attitudes. I love the customers and just love helping people. Its fast paced which is something I really like. I dont like how the system sometimes pick up shifts for you considering I know what times work best for me. Overall I really like Macy's.

good,"Macy's is a fast paced environment with fun coworkers and managers that are relatively easy to work with. A typical day at work consists of opening the registers, checking the fitting rooms, assisting customers on the floor, fitting customers for bras and checking customers out at the register. While at the register you can ring them up, return an item or open a credt card, pay a bill and check their balance. The hardest part of the job was learning the items and the easiest was selling said items."
good,Working at the Macy's company in Downtown Miami was a great experience I got to meet alot of great people the staff was very easy to get along with and great to work with
good,"Working at Macy's felt like shopping there. I mean you couldn't find anything for example the bathroom. No one was helpful it was just crazy working there. I did learn how to manage big crowds but I also realized things that Macy's lacked. Macy's forgot about customer service. When I would great the customers they would be shocked. Others completely ignored it but some of the customers their faces would light up like Christmas and even though I knew they weren't going to buy the perfume from me, they did stop and smell it and allow me to talk to them about it. The management teams to this day I can’t remember any of their names. I didn't know it working there and I don't remember it now. The people working there they don't care who you are because to them you are just another seasonal worker. Just being there I always felt like I wanted to go home it was way too competitive. The only thing I enjoyed was watching the makeup girls transform the costumers."
good,My manager wasa good guy but he knew how to get his employees working hard. My co-workers were kind people . The most enjoyable part of the job was bringing merchandise to the customers.
good,"A typical day at Macy's was a little nerve wrecking. I learned how to keep clothes and racks organized in the proper manner that they should be. I learned how to communnicate better with people when dealing with customers and meeting their needs. Management was unorganized and they didn't treat their employees fair. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. I kept everything professional and not personal. The hardest part of my job was working with customers who were rude and disrespectful but I still managed to be okay. The most enjoyable part was being able to work in retail and see the different clothing, jewlery, and shoes that people liked."

good,"My overall experience with Macy's was a learning experience. A typical day at work entailed morning meetings before the store opened to review the daily sales goals, promotions, and customer details. I learned the more credit sales, the closer the company is to the sales goal, which is consists of team work. The hardest part of the job was to remain in control of your finances, due to the advantages of the employee discounts and other perks. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was to challenge yourself to exceed the expected amount of credit card sales per individual. It could be quite competitive when management has inside employee incentives to motivate us as team players."
good,"Pricing is only for a few hours per day maybe a couple days a week. Nothing is guaranteed, but they do put you through the paces to see how well you can adapt to new settings and see how well your endurance is. With so many people with too few equipment, it sometimes became a hassle, but with teamwork everything got done. The hardest aspect was to learn the floors and sections and efficiently sorting/pricing the merchandise in each section. The enjoyable part would be the perks that come with the job, if only you earned enough income to use such perks."
good,"During my time at Macys, I worked in three different departments. I was on the sales floor as a Sales Associate on the FLEX team, which meant that I would be contacted to work some hours if I was needed in a specific department.

She was all business but in the best kind of way. She provided us with a fun and productive work place."

good,"I work in the Starbucks department, which requires you to make high quality drinks and provide stellar customer service. The management really wants to see you succeed and the co-workers are team-oriented. The worst part is when you have to complete ""dirty jobs"" because business is slow.

good,"Good job for the holiday season, very fast-pace environment."
good,Quiet during the week for Macys. The weekends are the busiest for Macys where you get a lot of fitting room and put backs. I learned a lot from Macys like how to respond to customer's that's having a bad day and I also learned how to add to the purchases and most important making the customers feeling welcome! Macy's employee's are great to work with. I wouldn't say I had any hard time at Macy's. I enjoyed coming to work and been around the customer and my co-workers.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is that you get to make people smile when their having a bad day
good,Assisted customers with their personal accounts. I learned that everyone needs to be shown sympathy and empathy when dealing with anyone about personal issues.

I learned that the job is really open to anyone and they give you a chance your prove your skill. No management I attended. My co-workers would be relaxed and focused. We just work like we are supposed to. The hardest part of the job is to know how to operate every machine they give you or let you try. Almost as if you know how to handle any machinery. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team that you have in common with. The store is so big and spaced out that not everyone of us is clogged together bit working in different departments.

good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my interaction with customers; occasionally there will be one that you can't please but as a whole, they are nice and friendly and just want to be treated the same. The hardest part of the job is having to apologize for the quality of an item that is being returned or for someone in the store being rude to a customer and they share with me. It always works out for the best if I handle it by saying that customer service and the customer always come first. Perhaps whoever was rude, was having a bad day and I would like to be of service to help them now."
good,"Very straightforward work, interacted with all other associates throughout shift ensuring supplies [boxes/bags/etc.] were allocated to the correct registers. Removed extra hangers and sensor tags from registers back to receiving/processing to be re-applied to new products coming off of truck that was unloaded upon me arriving in morning.

good,"The day starts with a morning coffee meeting walk, the team would talk a walk to the nearest coffee shop and discuss and important or pressing issues. the rest of the day was spent preparing and evaluating reports, participating in meetings, and developing plans to reduce financial discrepancies."
good,"A typical day at work included tending to the daily barometer, keeping track of my counter's daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual sales performance, coaching my beauty advisors, making appointments with new and existing clients, selling our fabulous products, and building client relationships. I learned so much about leadership and team building during my time with Macy's and Estee Lauder. My co-workers were very helpful, a pleasure to work with, and had all been with the company for a significant amount of time prior to my transfer from Bloomingdales. The hardest part of the job was getting everyone on board to book appointments for the events that we held at our counter. They were not accustomed to my persistence that we make our appointment goals for each event, however persistence pays off and we always got it done! The most enjoyable part of my position was working with the clients. Making a difference in someone else's life and how they feel about themselves is incredibly rewarding and fulfilling."
good,Good company to work for. Have to have drive and passion for what you do.
good,The constant traffic and the melting pot soceity is seen clearly here in Herald Square. It is amazing how many celebrities and people from different cultures you'll meet.
good,"starting out in retail, macys was the best thing for me it being a very big department store you learn so much and I feel as though it prepared me for A LOT in the retail world. Learning how to deal with co workers, customers, and staying level headed through tough times is great it not only bettered my experience in a working environment but it also helped me in the real world, outside of work, I'll never lose that drive to want to better any situation I'm faced with and succeed in whatever the task is at hand."
good,"Macy's is a good company to work at. The only thing, sometimes one feels like they have to live there to make everybody there happy. If one has a family, they will get real hard time to balance the work schedule and home schedule, when the schedule system is really bad. The money that one gets paid is not enough for the bills. That increases more pressure in life. One can enjoy working with the people in the same department as them. Not every department is the same. In general working there is not so easy."
good,Interacting with customers while providing assistance in finding what they are looking for. Received daily sales goal to obtain by the end of the shift.
good,Learned about the many products in the fragrance section
good,if your lookng for a cool place to work this is the place. good people to work around
good,"Have gained several experience while working at Macy's. For example, customer service and time management skills."
good,"Very tedious and time consuming work, very nice lovely people, options to advance that come rarely."
good,overall macys is a nice place to work but ijust dont think they really pay attention to the people they hire
good,Many opportunities to grow within the company
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Overall, it was an OK place to work. There were departments that one liked better than others."

good,Work with 50 to 100 other associates a day.
good,Terrific sales teams in a constantly changing enviroment.
good,"Helped customers find products, answered questions, ask if they would like to sign up for a credit card, rung out customers. Stock and cleaned the department I was working in. opening and closing procedures."
good,"It is a good company to work for, lost of opportunity for movement. The office is quite and not always exciting but the co-workers are great. A great team to work with, very supportive."
good,Busy.
good,Macy's Heral Square is a great company where the potential for growth is excellent. They always have some charity event goin on and include its workers in the process
good,"Work starts as soon as the lights come on with retrieving clothes from the fitting room, greeting and attending to customers. The phone is very important at Macy's so we have to make sure that we answer the phone in a timely and respectable manner. Working at Macy's I learned a lot about fashion with both females and males. I learned how to look up merchandise and send it to the customers house. Management was always available when they were needed, they knew how to handle a situaation respectfully and with a smile on their face. They were always coming up with ideas that would better the business and would always keep our customers coming back. There was no hard part working at Macy's. Helping customers and working with the other teammates was the enjoyable part aworking there. Learning about the new fashion was also an enjoyable part, management made it so much better with the activities we did to. It was an wonderful learning experience."
good,"I can complain with my job i love it coworker are very nice and friendly. We do what best to saver our customer, with good manner."
good,"A typical day is me going in, greeting customers and making there shopping experience wonderful."
good,It gives you flexability so you can balance work and personal life.
good,Macy's is a great company to work for. My coworkers and supervisor was what made my day. I really enjoyed going to work. Working with other Macy's stores to keep the facilities working and safe for customers.
good,I love working for Macys.The smile of good customer service goes along way.
good,everything was starting good but they started to cut alot of hours to the employees
good,I mostly work early mornings as Merchadise associate which was required to come to work with a focus and stable mind set.everyone was hardworkers at times but many people pick up others stack.I love putting new merchandisse out to order and shop I believe that was something I was good at and accurate.
good,"help customers, cashier, clean up dressing room, put merchandise back onto sales floor"
good,sell credit cards. merchandise products. cash register. 3 hour shifts. extended hours during holidays.
good,"Enjoyed working with people, I wanted a fulltime position but it was only temporary."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a creative person i got to create presentations, and sales of B@B"
good,Fun place to work and I enjoy it. The only thing that isn't great is that the managers don't treat employees fairly.
good,"Managing a team in a department store setting, where you are not only in charge of training and developing your people, but have your finger on the pulse of everyone else in the store, is not the easiest retail management position. If you can conquer this, however, being a general manager or even an area manager of a smaller, boutique-style store, becomes infinitely easier."
good,"Typical day of work was taking floor inventory, keeping counters clear of shoes and other items. Daily credit and sales goal was encouraged to be met and surpassed. Co-workers were most enjoyable part of the day."
good,"the job is enjoyable, you get to meet a variety of people. Talk to customers and finding ways to help them with their Macy's experience is my best discription of the job"
good,"Macy's Corp. (Cincinnati, OH) is a very friendly and welcoming employer, especially within the corporate world. My co-workers here were very helpful and congenial at all times. I gained a new appreciation for the work that goes on behind the scenes of the national retail giant to make strong and safe real estate decisions all while keeping the brand of Macy's in mind. Some aspects of the company are a little dated however that make for small frustration. However, overall the company was an absolute blast to work for. Thanks for the opportunity!"
good,This being my first job in retail was different. I enjoyed the staff but I felt that when they train you they needed to make some things more clear.
good,"If you have disabilities that keep you from standing for long periods of time or prefer customer call work, it is a great job for you. It is an incomming call based job so the people you talk to want to hear what you have to say. It is much better than an outgoing call job. I learned a lot about credit cards and their functions while there, the hardest part was talking to someone who did not want to hear what you had to say. The best part was actually being able to help someone when they couldnt leave their home to go to a store and figure it out there."
good,"The job was a lot of hard work , setting up merchandise according to vendor specifications."
good,"I would come in sign into the cash register walk around my department put misplaced items back but mostley helped with the customers. I usually went to three or more departments to learn about the product so i could be more useful for my customers. I learned more sales skills than I already had.The managment was not really around, they were usually busy with something else. The co-workers were great! They always made going to work exciting. We always had a bet who was going to have the highest sales goal of the day. Sometimes, I would come in first but i was always second. The job was not all that hard just when we had some customers would come in upset with their purchases."
good,A typical day at Macy's you will answer 60-100 inbound customer calls. You will be audited and scored on the quality and customer service you have provided. There are standard goals you have to meet and rewards for exceeding them.
good,I love the company but I want to work somewhere where the employees are more supportive of the company
good,"The Store, its products are great, but the management is weak and at times is understaffed."
good,"Lots of room for advancement. If you have it in you, you may grow very quickly."
good,945-10 arrive and have employee meeting in the lounge. After meeting open cash terminal to start business as usual.
good,"Work consists of unpacking merchandise and placing it in its appropriate areas, looking for possible mark downs or return to vendor merchandise. Ive learned a lot about myself, I know I love to work with people now that I love to work with watches. I have great coworkers who are always postive. The hardest part of the job would be days that are not so busy and the best part of my job is knowing that I can help find customers find exactly what they are looking for and leave satisfied and not disappointed."
good,While working at Macy's you get to see the magic happen with customers. It's an overall great place to work if you love retail. It can be frustrating at times when trying to meet your sales goal but where there's a will then there's a way!
good,macys was very busy face paced as soon as you clock in your working until you clock out
good,"Typical day was just selling shoes and helping out the ladies. Learned how to work a cash register and how to handle money during closing time. Management was good, they were there when you needed them. My coworkers were great. We all got along great."
good,I liked the environment but they were trying a new way of scheduling and it was kind of a mess. If worked great for seasoned employees as they had first pick at the best shifts. The new employees got stuck with nothing.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I learned great communication skills and selling techniques while dealing with hundreds of customers a week. I was surrounded with a very helpful staff to start me off right. Great management at Macy's makes this job a good start to gain some experience in the sales world.
good,I loved working here. Macy's has a innovative business strategy that makes them a very competitive company in America's top department stores. My co-workers and mangers were friendly and helpful. They were very flexible with my schedule. Macy's is the best retail store I have worked for so far.
good,My typical day at work was bascial typical its not nothing special.
good,". A typical day at Macy's, We are Magic sellers we give great customer services and we are a team."
good,Learned current & new promotions
good,Management is very outgoing and handles situations with respect... Co-workers were fun and easy going and loved going to work
good,"A typical day consists of greeting and helping customers find what they were looking for, plus more, to your best ability. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you're able to really connect with the customer and have a nice conversation."
good,A typical day for me at Macy's is to make sure that my area is clean and that i create Magic to every costumer.
good,"As an employee at Macy’s some of the job duties were selling merchandise to customers, organizing clothes and returning clothes from the fitting rooms and redistributing them to their proper department."
good,all my co workers were very friendly
good,"I learned the cosmetic industry and that it is a difficult field to work in, not the dream job of most young girls. I love the management aspect of the field and to help associates get ahead and be their mentor. Lots of drama in a cosmetic department but you get through it because of the associates you become friends with."
good,A typical day working at Macy's corporate involved data entry projects designed to increase work efficiency for the company
good,"Since it was the holidays, it stayed busy my entire duration there. It wasn't too difficult, however the hardest sales were Black Friday and Christmas week. I enjoyed working with and helping others keeping the store neat and ""shoppable"". It was always a pleasure assisting customers."
good,I learned how not to manage a team. How not to treat your employees. Also I learned that Macy's as a company is a good place but lack of employee advancement.
good,I love Macys. Its a beautiful store to shop in and work in. Has stylish clothes for the everyone. The Home Store has everything you could want or ned for your home. A typical day at work is to keep your store safe and clean and sell merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is the customers! Its not a hard job in my opinion.
good,"However in trainings, I did learn more of the expectancy from the managers, How to handle more of angry customer"
good,"Fun group of people to work with, I like the fast pace, I learn new designs of clothing, hardest part was keeping up with folding and stocking when we were slammed"
good,"Productive and fun workplace but could be better. At the location where I worked the managers weren't fair. It's a great company, but it all depends on which Macys location you work."
good,Working at Macy's I learned a lot on how to be a great visual staff. My mentors made eveything possible for me to understand and find my creativity in me.
good,"great interaction , not flexible due to SET schedule , very stric workplace"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,-hours not so good
good,"Great atmosphere, very friendly enviornment. The most enjyable part of the job was meeting new and diffrent people from all across the world."
good,"Very demanding but rewarding. Learned a lot about the buying/planning side of the retail business. A lot of travel involved, but co-workers were like family."
good,inventory cashier floor set search and send order transactions sales goals customer service fitting room and stock room cleaning
good,Good place to work if you have another job. Only a couple days a week and very early mornings
good,"assist customers with excellent customer service, promoting products and closing sales, provide education to the customer on the product, work as a team with other employees"
good,The job is cool. The only thing that can get quite annoying is the people. People who can't make up their minds and people who know they aren't buying but still wasting your time.
good,I enjoyed working in the Children's and Men's departments. These were the areas of the store where I had the most fun and productive work days.
good,"A typically day starts with getting the numbers from previous work days, making sure weve made the day and where we are in the month. Then traffic stop and get people in the chair, build clientele and get the sale from point A to point B."
good,"Meet daily (shift) sales goal, interact with numerous amount of customers, interact with team on the floor to provide a productive and smooth shopping experience for all."
good,There isn't a whole lot of room for advancement or increased wages. It's still great if you need flexible hours and people willing to train you. great for a first job
good,"A decent place to work. The company pays fairly but, less than other department stores except for certain departments."
good,"As my first job, Macy's was challenging, interesting and at the same time fun. I was able to learn from the professionals who not only delivered their best but also were willing to share their knowledge. As an employee of Macy's, I was fortunate enough to work with different clientele which not only enhanced my skills but also enabled me to learn skills I would use not only personally but also professionally."
good,I loved working at Macy's! They offer their employees great benefits and perks. I just wish they offered more hours.
good,I would've stayed and worked here but I couldn't due to the fact that they offered me a full-time position but I had to refuse due to the fact that i was in school and they were unwilling to work with my schedule.
good,it was great experience working with customers. very helpful and educational
good,"I worked for Macys as a Visual Merchandiser, and i Have to say it was one of the best experiences of my life."
good,"Every day was a new challenge to build relationships with customers, make sales goals, and learn products."
good,Overall great work experience. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. The pay could be more but the people that work with you make it worth it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"When I started I was A bit scared but determined to learn about the jewelry business, after a year and a half I have earned awards for sales."
good,"This work-place was okay. There was alot of help -from managers, when deeded. Most customers were satisfied with the products they were trying to purchase."
good,Macys is an is a fashion forward company that has has contributed to my growth and skill as a merchandiser.
good,"Busy dept. store, great employees, management has a lot of responsibilities."
good,"days are fast paced, and closing are chaotic.. the morning are smooth the store is beautiful and managers are helpful I enjoy helping customers and there is pressure on the employees for  opening credit accounts for macys"
good,"I felt like a hamster in a wheel that kept being turned by my managers. They thought they were helping and only had good intentions, but I still felt dizzy."
good,People on my team get along with each other. We work well with other associates and help when they it. I like that my schedule works with my son's schedule for school.
good,"Very supporting environment.  Big downfall is management. They are constantly changing areas and positions.  No mentorship, goals and yearly reviews for employees."
good,"Flexible hours, nice employee discounts, ability to swap shifts with other associates, good workplace environment, job satisfaction. Job advancement is possible for all employees."
good,"You can definitely climb the ladder but you need to commit to it. Overall its a nice place to work, the schedules are consistent and fair when it comes to being full time. Tough for part time."
good,It is a great company.I really feel imposed on because you are making feel out a survey on all my work places.  I am seeking employment and it feels like you are forcing this on me.
good,Working at macy's was alright. There wasn't that much of training. The employees were friendly. The only problem was working 8 to 10 hours with short breaks.
good,"Every day work is a chalenge and fun.Good customer service experience."
good,Good friendly company to work for but they don't want to pay a decent wage. Tolerant of your schedule. Willing to work with whatever issues you might be having.
good,"This was probably the easiest job I have ever had. I worked in the Back Stage section during Christmas of 2019, and it was very busy I always could find something to do (most of which were remedial task like picking up clothes and keeping everything clean and strait). A typical day would mostly be one or two task like matching shoes back together, and once you finish that you pretty much just walk around the floor picking up after shoppers."
good,Work days were 12 hours long and work was usually done alone and by myself. Operating SP 3500s and making sure customers got what they ordered online.
good,"Horrible wages, benefits are slim to none most direction given is not clear,during the holiday season they don't have enough hours to pay workers to clean its just a mess"
good,Macys is a seasonal job offer. To those whose dont have transportation.. It is good money if you can work the hours... Located in martinsburg Wv.. Good job all around
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Need to pay seasonal workers more money and give more hours of training.  Train seasonal workers in all areas of the store. Great co workers. Would like to work their on a permanent basis
good,"They have so many seasonal employees, it almost feels like a competition each day for the department you work in. Job wasn’t bad, but with so many employees, breakroom, time clock, parking lot, restrooms, feel VERY overcrowded."
good,"I worked weekend shifts during seasonals. You basically just try to do your part like meeting individual quota. Packing, you stand, and others such as active, you have to walk for hours. Comfortable shoes are needed. They are strict too. They have dress codes and you can't use your phone or listen to music on the ""floor""."
good,"Working for Macy's was a good first time work experience for me. I had no prior experience but the company does not over complicate the way they work. I caught on very quickly to the products and how they wanted their cases to look. The hardest part was the customer service but as time went on I got better with it. While I was there I loved my managment"
good,"A great seasonal job, and nice way to meet friendly employees and excited customers during the busy holiday season, perfect aerobic workout for seasonal recovery associates, great employee foodies like pizza, candy, cupcakes, chocolate, and many more employee yummies for opening credit accts as well as employee teamwork too"
good,Macys works with your school schedule. I learned organization skills at Macys and how to work with a team. Management often hears you out if you need to talk. Employees from every department mostly become friends. You always have something to do at Macys because it's a busy department store for the most part.
good,"Macy's is always busy never have time to socialize which is ok, I believe when an employer pays you to work that's wha we shouldt do.  On holidays, they gave us treats and it was fun,"
good,The interview was quick and fun.I loved it!I was very serious walkin in but as soon as i started speaking w the manager it became fun over time.i also loved the environment.
good,Much better if you were in management; great if you posses good customer service skills. Lot of standing and walking but this is a plus healthwise. Any job is what you make it!
good,"I loved working at Macy's."
good,"Overall, great experience. Learned communication skills and organization skills. The management and environment was outstanding to be around. However, I became a full time students and had to leave."
good,"Macy's is a great working experience, you learn a lot about working with a team and working toward a goal. The management has trust in their employees and push them to do their best."
good,Its not bad pay but do wish pay was more. Also fraud investigations is also on inbound phones and that function works best if there was a team dedicated to the phones and not having investigators taking calls.
good,Macy's was a fun place to work and game you the tools to get the job done. Unfortunately they no longer have an in house IT department for support and everything is now outsourced.
good,"It was interesting working at Macy’s in general. Problem was roles were limited, therefore, the learning curve was not sufficient to warrant gainful experience."
good,Very so-so. You do learn some new skills. I was seasonal and it doesn't seem like they tell or train their seasonal employees very much. But its easy enough work.
good,"I worked at Macy's as a sales associate while I was attending college. I liked it because of the flexible schedule, and the management was good. Typical retail work environment."
good,It's a decent place to get your feet on solid ground but not as a career. Good to put some extra money in your pocket. Great environment for young adults
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a temporary associate, you have to fight for your hours online."
good,"Really enjoy working with the public."
good,"I would welcome a chance to work there again."
good,I would  suggest that someone work there but only during the holidays you will have a great time working but  your schedule is all over the place and you won’t have a set time to be able to get into a routine. I will say if you want to have a set schedule work somewhere where you can control that.
good,I enjoyed working for Macy’s. It was only a seasonal temp position so I wasn’t there long. Human Resources were always there to answer any questions and were very friendly.
good,Fast pace fun to many bosses and not enough workers to get the job completed.  Hours management is unrealistic.  You need to have the employees that can work within the hours given.
good,"A typical day at Macy's means ensuring that your customers find great deals and anything necessary for their shopping needs. I've learned time management as it is important to accomplish all tasks given per department per day. The employees are friendly and helpful, especially when an extra hand is required in an area of sales not pertaining to them. Perhaps the most difficult part of the job is attaining daily credit applications or keeping up with sales but it is possible."
good,"Never boring, nice people to work with, management good.  Job description seemed different than what was presented.  Enjoyable part, learning about retail."
good,"I enjoyed working at macys and would. Love to work there again,  I have worked overnight and day time"
good,It has been an amazing experience with a good diversity of people. You meet great managers that care about you and want to give you hours but cant do so. I learned in the Receiving area we are the foundation of the entire store and we play a huge and important role for everyone including customers. The workplace is average but the people are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is the very minimum amount of hours they have to separate between all of us. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and knowing the mangers really care for you as they were once is your shoes. Overall my experience here has been enjoyable and a great learning curve.
good,"Because it is a huge department store who wouldn't love the discounts.  But, there comes a time when you just have to move forward if you can't or choose not to move up."
good,You have to speak up if you are looking for promotion. You fight for pay. Added responsibilities and not enough recognition. Scary working for retail when the competition is closing.
good,"The Macy's sales associate must be flexible as the company is never static but changes policies and procedures and organizational structure in order to stay competitive and viable in a retail market in flux. Associates must embrace technology and change and in big ticket in a growth store, deal with rapidly changing situations without any notice. Attendance policies are strict and subject to change with little warning, change is so frequent and management staff changes at every level also subject to change so keeping abreast of events and changes can be challenging as the experts may be either terminated or reassigned to a different district or region with new responsibilities.  Despite that, the top management are committed to keeping Macy's viable and successful, so as long as employees can deal with change, they can also expect to be part of an ongoing business that is not stodgy or mired in old ways.  The company also embraces diversity in a very real way. The negatives are the unpredictable hours, lack of sick days, and inability to plan ahead for vacation and time off work.  The health insurance benefits are excellent, as is the 401-K match, but this is still retail with long store hours, 7 days a week.  Most of the managers are very kind people who respect the associates, but most of the managers are stretched thin with their jobs."
good,I enjoy working here. good people. let you work at your own rate. in shipping trailers can get a little warm in summer but there is water coolers in each department area.
good,"As much as I liked being here there were a lot of things that were unappealing. The customers were unreasonably nasty. One girl came in to buy glasses as a wedding present and cried and threw a temper tantrum because ""all the glasses are ugly"". There are parts of retail that are fun, but many employees would not lift a figure to help any customers that just put a strain on everyone else."
good,The people were great to work with. Some management were rigid when it came to work/life balance and there was some favoritism but overall it was a satisfying experience to work there.
good,"I worked at Macy's on and off for roughly 2 1/2 years and it's honestly a pretty alright place to work at. I had some really chill managers and all the coworkers were nice too. There is definitely potential for advancement if you desire and you'll get paid more if people see you put in work. For me, it was just a job to make some relatively easy money in a relaxed work environment."
good,Enjoyable working with my co workers.  Better trainers as you were had good initial trainers but they were overworked during peak season. Managers were somewhat distant which may it difficult to approach them. Others were sincere and approachable to ask advice and additional training.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I love all my coworkers. They are some of the best most loving people I know. All the sales associate look out for each other. If someone needs help with something someone else jumps in.
good,"The employees share a nice bond and the hours are flexible.  There is a generous employee discount on Macy's products.  Shifts are occasionally understaffed, however."
good,its a great learning experience is the only reason i recommend the job to anyone looking to learn how to be out going or how to be an agressive salesman/woman
good,Macy's is a very diverse company. Many cultures working throughout the facility. Very hard to move up within the company. Best part is you're able to get someone to cover your shift without being repremended.
good,"Macy's was not a bad place to work at, just the pay is very low. Grant it, I worked in Frederick, so the foot traffic was light and the job could get boring especially if you have a long shift. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Macys when I could have flexible hours that fit my childrens school schedule."
good,"They expect a lot from you. From getting credit cards , presales and even fulfillment in the morning.  They give you opportunities to grow with the company but don't usually follow through. Everyone at the stores works as a team. We all help each other out and communicate with each other for lunch breaks. That and the employee discount ( which can be used on top of coupons) was hands down the best part about working here."
good,I was a part-time sales associate at Macy's during my college years. It was always fun to go in to work and engage with customers and help them find wardrobe. I enjoy fashion so it was enjoyable for me. You do have a sales goal and a number of credit cards that you have to get customers to apply for. All these counts towards you yearly raise.
good,"A typical day at work for me as a seasonal sales associate is I come in, clock in through the computer, clean registers, do go backs, check on fitting rooms, help customers at the register and do fulfillment (online orders). Working at Macy's, you learn the basic customer service skills. Most customers were nice and others were very rude, but it's retail so what do you expect?"
good,"At first it's a fun place to work at until I realized I was doing nearly the same amount of work as my counter manager and not getting compensated. The scheduling got mixed up so on days that the counter manager was supposed to be scheduled, I was scheduled. Which meant I did her job. It was not her fault but HR had everything to do with this. Most of the time, management and HR were not as professional as they should've been. Over all an okay job would have stayed longer if I felt management took their employees more serious."
good,"Started as a seasonal associate, now I'm currently a manager. The hours are manageable and the benefits are amazing. Continuing to grow my career within macys."
good,"Macys was a good place to work, the scheduling was at your control. you could trade schedules with other emplyees and not be pinalized. great work life balance.  The hardest part of the job was standing for the entire shift, and the pay was not  good. Even after hitting your targets and having a consist clientele, when it came time for annual review they only gave raises very low increments"
good,"Hard work is not awarded as much as I would like but that's not to say it isn't awarded at all. The work environment is reminiscent of high school, where manager' favorite employees advance in the company regardless of merit or experience. The pay lacks especially for the workload that you are expected to carry. Employee morale is average. It's a great place to work for the holidays as a temp. Outside of this, a career at Macy's shouldn't be your go-to for full-time employment."
good,"It was an interesting place to work it wasn't fair to its employees that had personal problems but had hard working employees that deserved more for everything that they had to go through. An incredibly credit card driven environment and our ""Reward"" being a dollar and a pat on the back. Poor use of employees of people begging for more hours when we constantly received complaints about not having enough coverage. I loved my fellow employees I just wish they would have had better benefits."
good,"During peek seasonal  schedules you’ll be required to work long, hard hours.  As soon as the perk seasonal hours are over your schedule will be reduced to barely a liveable wage."
good,"It was a good experience. I worked in shoes and it is a good department to earn commission. I worked as a part time sales commission associate during the winter break, therefore it was crowded and alot of work."
good,"Working at Macy's was rewarding and helped greatly in furthering my career. It was a difficult job with high expectations, but the perks (discount, salary, flexibility) made the workload manageable. Unfortunately, the traditional retail environment is volatile and I was laid off twice in two years. Therefore, job stability would be a concern when working for them."
good,The company is very structured.  Schedules are set by you and you have plenty of time to change an existing schedule.  I really loved the employee discounts and the work environment.
good,"This place is an extremely fun and great place to work for someone coming into the work force. Flexible hours and people from all walks of life I highly recommend to anyone looking for a part time job,"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,You will have to be ready for a fast pace environment. You are challenge with sales goals on a daily basics. New people everyday. Great place to learn how to be the best at trouble shooting.
good,"Great discount and flex hours, opportunity for advancement if willing to relocate to other stores.  During the holiday season hours are a bit hectic but that's retail"
good,"Not bad management, but they ask for to much and little pay. Work multiple positions, sometimes on the same day.  "
good,"the managers were mixed... some were good and some were picky... like even if you were doing a great job they werent satisfied...they push heavy about opening new accounts which at times can be tough to do... it is all about the numbers to them. on a regular basis though i was constantly moving whether putting clothes back on the floor in their designated areas, at the same time checking fitting rooms regularly so they dont get full or out of hand and also keeping an eye on the register for any customers that might show up. i have learned alot and am proud of myself... i learned the most in fulfillment though b/c the steps are different with packing and i actually felt more accomplished in that area over all b/c i knew the items i packed were going out across the country to peoples homes. it was busy work but calming at the same time. you could really focus on what you were doing."
good,"Overall, the company is a good place to work in except when they did the lay off, they gave us notice 2 weeks before Christmas so the people who worked there was not happy. They could have done it after the holiday and let the people enjoy the holiday first."
good,"I’ve only worked there seasonal but wanted to stay long term, no one told me that I had to fill out a long term survey that they emailed to us at the beginning of the job so I missed out on that opportunity. My actual mgr in the jewelry department left and went to another job so we had a temporary mgr from another department try and help us out. But I continuously asked her was there anyway I could stay PT but long-term but she claimed she had to check out the budget since after the seasonal holidays were over it started becoming slow."
good,"While working at Macy's, I was given many opportunities to work as many hours that I can. They are very flexible and encourage a family environment in the store."
good,Overall a great company to work for but not much of a work life balance.  Great opportunities for training and advancement.  High pressure work environment.
good,"the managers were aware of everything that happened, very aware of their workers, they updated us weekly with the different offers of the store."
good,"Outstanding wonderful people and great atmosphere"
good,"l loved my job and team members, my boss included. The benefits were good, the pay wasn't good enough to continue in the field unfortunately. It is the one job I loved going to even thought the pay was insufficient. I had a great boss, who aloud and encouraged innovation, independent thinking and creative license within specific guidelines. I would say that this would be a dream job if it only carried a higher pay."
good,"Seasonal work at Macy's is fast-paced but enjoyable.  Shifts flew by because you're always running from fulfillment to various departments and back again.  Store manager was often curt, and expected fulfillment employees to be robotic--i.e. no talking!  The assistant managers are much more lenient provided that you maintain respectable productivity levels.  Department supervisors were great and training is fairly thorough.  Pay could be better, but in a cutthroat retail environment, you can't expect to receive a salary that will accommodate the cost of living in this area.  Great opportunity for local high school and/or community college students to learn new skills while on vacation."
good,Macys was very intent on providing the best customer service to all. It was a welcoming and friendly environment. It definitely teaches you how to deal with all types of people face to face.
good,"the shipping and receiving staff is phenomenal and very hard working ,they offer flexible hours. it will involve many task as a fulfillment associate."
good,"Macy's was a fun, fast paced place to work with a nice atmosphere. The people who work there are polite and friendly. The only downside was low pay, no benefits, and not enough hours. I was offered a full time position after the holidays were over, but they couldn't offer me enough hours in the off season, and the pay was low."
good,"My favorite place to work was in men's fragrance, the women whom work there are great! shoe department was fast paced and good too. Clothes area had plenty of rushes throughout the day and kept me busy."
good,"Macy’s is definitely a good company but I’m looking for another job to keep me busy throughout the day, I am very responsible and the best fit for the job!"
good,I was a sales associate that had some reasonable sale goals and then at many time unreasonable sales goals.  At times it was impossible to increase sale by the time your schedule because of outside occurrences.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Typical day included unloading truck"
good,They were willing to train people in other areas so you never felt stuck in  one position. i started as a clerk and worked my way up to manager. There was some of my favorite managers there
good,"Positive culture, very inclusive environment. Training is minimal, but most associates are helpful in training new people up to speed. Good discount and available health benefits(for full time) help offset lower pay."
good,"The job at Macy's is very convenient but I wished they had a bigger discount on things partnered up with Macy's. It was really sad, honestly it made me want to leave the job."
good,Macy's was the first company I worked for while still going to college. It was a great opportunity to practice customer service and earn some money working part time while going to college.
good,Working At Macy's has been a pleasurable job so far. The other Staff and management are friendly and helpful. Store merchandise organization could be better.
good,"I worked there and really enjoyed it, it wasnt a year later until I notice how taxing it was and how it felt like i was in high school again beccause of the drama."
good,Saturday are very busy at Macys. All people come looking for all different types of item that they need. even though is a little stressful time go by quickly and your in a department where you are comfortable with working with the department supervisor the  day goes smoothly.
good,The Macy's environment is very friendly and welcoming. Macy's has little ways of making you feel involved and cared for. They are big on team work and very hands on with you when it comes to there training styles which is very helpful.
good,"Stressful, especially this time of yr. Nice to work for a company that cares so much for their employees, the community and the environment.  The best thing about working there is the satisfied customer."
good,Very stressful at times. Overall was a good place to work at. Most people are friendly. Manager are not all that great they tend to play favorites with the associates.
good,"The customers made my day at macy's. I've learned how to become a better sales associate and communicate better. I feel like the management at macys can be approved ,the managers don't make the associates feel successful . I did not enjoy the culture ,the workplace can be better if the managers had better communication skills. The hardest part at Macy's was dealing with the recovery on black Fridays . I enjoyed the customers the most at macys , if the managers and the associates were as pleasant as macys . Macys would be a better place."
good,Loved the job but they don't pay you for what you are worth! Worked every weekend and all nights. I would have loved to stay if I had better hours and pay.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Macy's. However, with recent job changes that were enacted this year, it ultimately forced me to part ways. The company combined the Operations and Asset Protection Managers into one role and created a position that has unrealistic expectations coupled with poor training. Asset Protection essentially was placed on the back burner and the focus became 80% operations based. Coming solely from the AP background, the company provided extremely poor training for the role. Expectations from Store Managers and lack of patience or cooperation became toxic. I eventually decided that the work environment had become too toxic as it took over every aspect of my life. Whether on PTO, Vacation, Bereavement, or just a day off, my phone never stopped ringing, mostly due to minor store issues that could have been handled by the on duty staff or delegated to someone on call."
good,"Perhaps other store locations may be preferable to the Southland location. However, in all it was a job with a paycheck.  Not the best, but not the worst either"
good,"I only worked for MACY's for a short amount of time but the work environment was pleasant. The coworkers were overall nice people and did not mind stopping what they were doing to help you."
good,I learned so much working for macys.com great place to gain experience and to get uses to the work culture. I had my first management opportunity here.
good,"Learn a lot "
good,"I was satisfied there, but the issues that came up were sometimes not addressed, due to the fact that they had contracted drivers all over the country, who were not responsive to my calls."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The Macys I worked in was a new store so the staff was new and so was the management. It was clean and well stocked with limited customer traffic.The staff worked well together and there was a lot of training in various departments.
good,I have nothing negative to say about this company. Treated well and management is great.and is not  stressful. Just need more hours and a better pay. Overall its a nice company to work for.
good,"Macy’s was a nice job offering a 401k , great pay and weekly pay management was just a lil rocky. A bonus was enployee discounts on food. Macy’s pay is always minimum wage or greater"
good,"the company is ok to work for, it is the management that can make things difficult.  If you have you like an challange and dont mine being over worked and under paid this may be the perfect job for you."
good,Macy's is a great place to work. Friendly people and a hard working environment. Sometimes it get overwhelming when there are multiple tasks that need to be done.
good,"You are always on the move either stocking merchandise, rearranging the store, doing inventory or checking people out. Typical retail job, but the merchandise made it a lot of fun. The workers were great. Not really a career type job though."
good,"The position was that of a non contracted laborer of a contractor for Joseph Elletto Transfer under the contract of Macy's Furniture Distribution Center. Given so the position of helper (Furniture Delivery Specialist) was considered expendable. Therefore, it was the goal of the helper to prove themselves reliable, knowledgeable, and honest enough to earn the right to full fledge contractor after so many years of dedicated service. However, given the salary of a contracted associate it made the path very cutthroat."
good,"My work experience there was one that was pretty good. The work pay was good for the hours and the work itself wasn't all that hard to do. Although my job involved going around the store to see if there's anything unorganized, I still had a good time working there and would like to do it again."
good,"I have worked there for 10 years, it was a great place to work for many years - has benefits available & good vacation day system.  However, there seems to be a lot of changes in management & upper management & which makes for an uneasy work environment."
good,Can't really say much other than I wish they could have kept me or gave me options. They didn't tell me I was laid off when the season ended. It was my first experience in retail despite for only working at the back.
good,"i left in 2014, remember working often, so youd get pretty decent hours. you were rewarded for how many credit applications you opened from each customer"
good,"Moving merchandise from stock room to correct area in the store, Organizing clothes racks . Putting the sizes of clothing in there proper place either on the clothes rack or shelf. Management was ok."
good,Work was great. had some great staff when I was there. Sad i had to leave but i learned a lot when i was there. I really liked finding where all the clothes had to go in the beginning it was hard but after awhile you figure it out. Working the fitting room was new to me on how customers were not to bring their items out and put on rack but i kept it clean and put it all back where they got it from which was fun.
good,"They were excellent with the attendance point system, good attendance for 2 weeks you got half a point on some holiday seasons a bonus point. Sick days available to avoid getting pointed, lots of room for work life balance."
good,"I enjoyed my employment because I knew it was temporary. I knew I would stay for awhile and I would know when to leave. If this was my permanent job I would have been miserable. I am so glad I was grateful for each and every day I was there. The staff were fun, knowledgable, and great team. The standing around drove me crazy lol. So I meditated while standing to keep my energy up. "
good,This is a stressful place to work at especially around the holidays. It’s a good way to work on your communication skills with customers and coworkers
good,I enjoyed working for macys.When the team managers and associates worked together the atmosphere was amazing and fun. I was a mens shoe sales associate. The job was easy at times ad hard at other times but overall id work there again if my schedule allowed it.
good,A typical day at the Macys warehouse is fairly bland.  First thing in the morning is your team meeting where you discuss the goals of the day and safety.  Youre then sent to your respective area to carry out said tasks.  My job was to pull items from a conveyor system and pack them into big-rig trailers for shipment.  Long 12 hour days but only 3 to 4 days a week.
good,"Selling Furniture to customers who visit store. "
good,"I enjoyed my job there, except for the very early hours sometimes 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. Inventories were very long and stressful. I did not like inventories."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was like high school I kept to myself and was still bullied by supervisor and coworkers. The management tried to help but somethings were out of their hands
good,"I enjoyed working for macys , this place is very flexible and a fun place to work at. Store management never really cared to acknowledge workers but some of the other managers were really nice."
good,"Macys has been fun and challenging. I have had ongoing training in all areas of customer sales and service including conflict management. Macys retail schedule suited my lifestyle. Macys helped me deal with cash, and doing multiple tasks at same time."
good,"Great job for part-time work. Team member atmosphere, good incentives for submitting credits.Good work environment and overall good managers. Great benefits even for part-time workers."
good,"While out of work, Macy's provide me a way to provided for my family.  It was during the Holiday seasons so there was a push to sell.  Just because its on the rack, doesn't mean it get sold, so I had to meet sales expectation.  I did, far longer than expected"
good,"poor communication with employees, at times. Did have great flexibility with work. Also 3 unavailable days every month came in handy as well, would recommend working there."
good,"I was generally satisfied with my job at Macy's. Management and upper management was good at recognising potential in its employees and utilising their strengths, reprogramming their weaknesses and training them for advancement."
good,"Was given the opportunity to reapply with Macy's for my job when the contract with Finlay ended, but I didn't reapply. I enjoyed working there and the customers were so gracious. I still miss it."
good,This is a high paced work place with a great feedback system.  Great co-workers and management staff.  Enjoyed the experience and the collaborative team environment.
good,Working in retail comes with a lot of changes. Macys is trying to figure out where it needs to go next while still focusing on their customers. Sometimes they make a wrong choice and try correcting it.
good,"Work hours are determined by need, there are times when hours are plentiful and time when hours are scarce, That is the problem you can't count on steady flow of hours. It's a retail environment,ebbs and flows."
good,"Low pay, rude management , inconsistent hours , impossible to spend time or give attention to your children . Can survive off of $11 an hour . Schedul8ng is horrible , if you pick up a shift and need to vall out .. you have to pray that a co worker can pick your shift up or else your stuck ."
good,"Diverse company, many part time employees with flexible hours"
good,"It was a great place to work for many years. Became confusing and difficult as company went through changes, financial challenges and layoffs. Wish all the best as they reinvent themselves."
good,Macy's during the holiday season is not something I would honestly recommend to anyone just starting in retail. The managers tend to care more about the staff selling items and availability rather than also worrying about the well being of the worker.
good,Good working environment in the company. There is Employee Value in the company. Rule and regulations are very strict. It was very good working experience with Macy's
good,"Overall a great place to work.  I miss it.  The discounts are off the chain and it's a comfortable, fun environment.   They do require you to sell their charge card but even that can be fun because they reward you for each card you sell.  I enjoyed working there and it was one of the better jobs that I've had."
good,Well run productive business with good managers and helpful co-workers. Customer base was outstanding. I did not have any real problems or controversies.
good,Whatever you applied for is your job they dont move you around unless you apply for those jobs it was seasonal when i was there so it was very busybut they kept everything rumning smoothly so you didnt get overwhelmed
good,The store culture is fun and engaging in most locations. The scheduling for associates is flexible. During my time with the company I was provided the opportunity to advance several times.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Just like everything there are pros and cons....vacation time is great...benefits are good...usually great people to work with lots of opportunity for growth and development. Relcoatability a plus
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys.  Once again, I was able to meet and greet many new faces daily.  I enjoy speaking with people and helping.  Macys is about sales."
good,"Very fast-paced work place and can get over whelming at times,however fun place to work.I wish the pay was more however,  I enjoy going in early and leaving early."
good,Company is a great believer in “work life balance “. If customer satisfaction/service and growth is your desire in a work place - this will be a perfect fit.
good,"Customer were nice and fun to be around. Sales days were awesome. Miss shopping and working there.Co-worker were awesome  as well. Love the coupons and items,"
good,Macys was comfortable foe those with families and had flexible schedules. It allowed me to spend time with family and always tried to keep incentives for working.
good,"Clocking into the time management system. Doing the fulfillment for the store for customers who have purchased products online.Workplace is very attractive , the hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day."
good,Good environment and big place to work at. A bit of a long walk to walk to but other than that I enjoyed my time there though it had only been seasonal.
good,Very friendly environment with employers and managers. They are very comprehensive about your needs and flexible hours. They always respect your hours of work and congrats your efforts if you do a good job.
good,"If you go to work regularly and do your job, you will be fine. Do your best and you will enjoy it. Avoid the drama and the drunk people and the people on drugs. Sadly, they are in every department!  Management turns a blind eye to them."
good,"They knew I was a full time student first and I had another job as well, they were really good at working around that. They trusted me to get my daily work done and I trusted them to keep everyone in the department up to date. The hardest part of the job was the communication between the associates. I really enjoyed helping customers find the perfect shoes whether it was for their senior prom or the governor's ball."
good,An average day at Macy's is we surveillance the store and look for behaviors of internal and external theft. I learned to work with a team and being able to communicate with each other to be able to stop theft in the store.
good,"A balance of holding Orientation classes for new associates and also leading Powered Equipment Operation and Safety classes for associates, as well as maintaining training records, reporting to accidents, and hands-on equipment and process training as well. This position is a particular sore-spot with me and Macy's because it was a seasonal position I loved and hoped to move into in a full-time capacity when it became available at a future point. The company liquidated this position along with many other Human Resource positions, laying many of the people in those positions off. This decision on behalf of the company definitely shook my faith and confidence in the company, which is why my rating is lower overall and in the areas it is lower in."
good,"They were paying minimum wage ,but required you to work nights, weekends as well as holidays.  You could not sit down all day (unless you are on your break). If no customers, you HAVE TO find something to do ."
good,"A overall pleasant place to work, employees were friendly and team based. Although management was a bit subdued with poor communication at times. "
good,"good management, but sometimes managers change for good and the new managers need time to understand employee's problem and other issues. overall a good work place."
good,"A typical day at work during the holiday season consisted of folding clothes, picking up clothes and keeping the are tidy. My responsibilities included helping customers have the best shopping experience and assisting them in any way possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy and satisfied customers!"
good,"I enjoyed to be part of the team at Macy's, coworkers and everybody make it easy for you to work there without stress and pressure,the hardest part its to keep checking the schedule if you can get more hours,but its nice working there"
good,macys was an alright working environment. they have alot of different varieties of clothes and discounts were not bad. location was perfect commuting.
good,Everything went pretty smooth on a daily basis. The associates that I worked with in the shoe department where the best part of the job. I would work at Macys again given the right circumstances.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The managers were pretty nice. Working with customers was pretty easy with my skills and experience. We were always productive and I felt welcomed there.
good,"Discounts"
good,"A typical day at work is usually fast paced but not too stressful."
good,"Macys gave me the room to grow, in did many differant types of jobs. "
good,"At the Ingram mall location, it was a seasonal position and a great learning experience. I actually had fun working there. Everyone got along with everyone and help each other. Management made you feel like you were at home. Had loads of fun dressing customers, teaching them about new styles and you get to be very creative. The North Star Mall location had a few ups. I worked in the suit department. The creativity was there. I got to learn about suits and different professional styles. Learned great values there. Wish that the management could have been different there though. HR was terrible and some of your peers would do anything for commission even if that meant stealing your sales."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work for a first time job in retail. You learn a lot about sales, merchandises, and the latest trends. Customers can be rude at times. You can get up to 60 hours during Christmas season meaning you can get a lot of hours in overtime. However, during Christmas Season, Macy's extend their hours of operations up to midnight.Most employees do not want to work late shifts, so you may be called in to work unwanted shifts. You can pick up and advertise your shifts, so working at Macy's can be very flexible if you have class, have another job, or have children. Furthermore, the job duties can be stressful if you are working alone. There is a lot of recovery needed throughout your shift in terms of clothing and merchandise needing to be put back very often. Pay is horrible. I was paid $8.50 a hour. The only good thing about pay at Macy's is that you get paid weekly. The biggest thing I loved about working at Macy's was the 20% off employee discount. The Macy's I formally was employed at had very nice managers and the managers showed good leadership.Overall, I would recommend anyone to work at Macy's."
good,"I was constantly being critiqued for sales levels I couldn't control if it was a slow shift.  Mountains of clothing from the dressing rooms to putaway while you needed to ring a certain amount of sales. Sometimes performance goals were impossible to achieve. Constant pressure  to sell credit card applications.  There are cliques and it's better not try to fit in. Otherwise you'll get used to fill unpopular hours for the popular associates.  Lunch room is nice;employees keep it clean and homey looking.  Restrooms are kept clean.  Full time cleaning person was nice to have around.  Employee discount was good and working conditions were acceptable.  I had customers who used to come in asking for me in particular to assist them, which was nice."
good,There was pressure to sell products and meet you daily sales goals. Coworkers were pleasant even when there was pressure to sell. They offer no benefits for part time workers.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's.  I didn't expect to enjoy working retail, but to my surprise, I loved it.   Like most other places it has it's ups and downs.  The hours were a bit tough sometimes and also very long during the holiday season (sometimes 12 hr days).  I loved helping customers and putting a smile on their face. I would still be working there if it weren't for online ordering.  The salary is too low and raises are inadequate (never more than .50 an hour)."
good,I worked as a bra specialist and we had seminars that explained the new products and we were also given samples to try for ourselves (which was great because it helps to sell products you can stand by). I loced that we had flexible scheduling (they give you a set schedule if you're full time or part time but also the option to trade days with another coworker or pick up other shifts in your department or other departments in the store). I did not received any benefits and the only way you receive the discount is if you have a Macy's credit card.
good,As a company Macy's is not a bad employer. You do take one call after another.  The management team has changed frequently since I started. They do their best with what is provided.  The workplace culture is diverse. There isn't anything hard about the job for me.  The most enjoyable are the people.
good,Hard working place but great team environment  with good customer service great place to learn and grow in your career to become better at any position you work at
good,"I enjoyed my position as a Beauty Advisor, loved the people I worked with in the Cosmetic Department. I left Macy's to pursue school and other interests. My biggest complaint comes from the store manager, I routinely heard her create drama and put down employees."
good,the atmosphere is pleasant and coworkers are friendly. Most managers are wonderful and easy to get along with. It is a relaxed environment for the most part but there is a push to sign customers up for credit and make your sales goals. All in all it is a good work environment.
good,Opened and closed cash registers
good,"I really enjoyed merchandising at Macy's because I loved working with the merchandise, although I wasn't fond of the early morning hours required for the position. It's a pretty standard retail environment with employees of all ages and backgrounds. They also offer a nice employee discount to shop at their stores."
good,"MACY'S, was my first company paying job. Macy's, taught me social, and physical skills. Working at Macy's help me improve costumer service and some sale skills, that I had not had, prior. Although Macy's, was a fun place for a little while. The management lacked basic morals. Macy's tried taking advantage of me. Despite my little knowledge of working in a corporate company. Macy's proved to me, that I was only a number to them. I would not grow if I had stayed there."
good,"boring most times "
good,Opportunity to learn most any new technology was available. Worked on new storage arrays both filesystem and block. People were very professional and helpful.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was a Fun and Crazy place to work, but what do you expect when you work retail! Working for a company like Macy's / Bloomingdale's, have a lot going on. It's always a sales or savings, whether it be in Homes, or Shoes.......The turn over seems to be extremely high, however, it was a nice place too work!"
good,"Overall the job is okay. I was seasonal for the most part. You get decent pay. They don't have the decency to inform you, that you were  let go. Typical."
good,"It is a very good place to work I have many years in the company I have never had any problem, I like to interact with people and have the best customer service and take a good impression of me and where I work."
good,"I liked the job at Macy's except I did not like working 12 hour days, that was a little too much for me. And I had to finally quit because they would not find me a better schedule."
good,"its a fast pace working environment , people are generally friendly and work as a team. The company does provide good amount of training to grow their employees."
good,"Exciting environment as you're working with the public. No two day alike. Responsible for a variety of responsibilities on a daily basis. Sales, customer service, product demos, prepping for sales events, strategizing sales goals."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work, but the company is making a lot of changes due to the change of retail climate.  Family atmosphere and enjoyed working there."
good,Macys was a great company to work for. I have 22 years with this company. I hate that we are closing. My store was a fun fast pace store. Recognition  is important to both the customer and the employers. I was our partners in time captain. We were involved with the community.
good,"Associate engagement, structured training.  Ability to move around in the company.  Focused on giving back to the community.  Several projects that allow volunteer opportunity."
good,the job is good when your working seasonal employees are in high demand so you can get a lot of hours if you wish too. Once the season is over your hours decrease and everyone is basically fighting for hours.Which can be an unstable job hen you have bills to pay.
good,It was ok to work at macys had alot of lazy ppl working there good breaks depending on what dept u worked in majority of full time ppl were ok pay was really good
good,"Typical day at work would be greeting allot of customers recommending products, sell allot of watches and fashion jewelry, management could have been better, culture was diverse, hardest part was dealing with irritated customers, most enjoyable part was meeting allot of people."
good,"Macy's is an exciting place to work for the holiday season.  It is always busy and your time is spent helping customers, merchandising, and doing computer work."
good,"Macy's is a great place for employment. It is a fast pace retail environment, I enjoyed working with the executive team on talent development, I monitored the employment process and turnover."
good,"A typical day at Macy will include taking care of the online shoppers in the morning before the store opens. I will have to print your area pick list and find every item listed, than turn them in. Once that was completed the next task will be handling go backs. These are the clothes that accumulated over night that were found in the fitting rooms or returned. I had to put each item in its designated area. Once the store open the remainder of the day your greeting and helping shoppers and maintaining the area so that shopping will be easy for everyone."
good,It’s lots of drama there and sometimes they can be very rude and unprofessional that’s is management I’m talking about and they are very unorganized And place ppl on other ppl jobs
good,"I worked with a wonderful group of sales associates, managers, etc who would show you how to do things beyond the scope of your job so that you would understand why you were asked to do them that way."
good,"Fast paced work environment, lots of team work involved when its time for closing , co worlers have to work together as a team in order to fix up the store for the next business day"
good,"It is a good place to start working, the pay is not the best, but the people are good. Management is good, they have markers that must be met, but they aren't aggressive in pushing it because there are incentives."
good,Full time employees and managers are not helpful with part time employees. I had very hard time to get help at the beginning. Managers and full time employees showed attitude when ever I asked for help at the beginning.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,We have frequent meetings. They are typically quick and somewhat enjoyable. Employee recognition and diversity plays a big part of our culture. My job is fairly easy and enjoyable. I wish I earned more and I honestly worry about the future of Macy's and job security. I recommend working here for the experience.
good,"The managers I had were very helpful especially because I had no retail experience. The training you received didn't necessarily prepare you for the on-the-floor sales but my associates were helpful and taught me what I needed to know for the point-of-sales system the store used and gave general customer service tips. On-sales is literally for people who only need a side job, which was what I needed."
good,"I loved working here, met alot of people and I loved my supervisors. It was an amazing opportunity to work here. The employees were very helpful, felt like a family."
good,"I really enjoy working at Macy's, the flexibility, the attention to customers, the work environment."
good,"I was with Macy's for 8 years which was my entire professional career so far.  I has thankful for the opportunities and was excited to progress as far as I have in a short time.  I worked with amazing people and traveled to great places and was thankful for the position I loved.  Unfortunately, even furniture was not invincible to the .com   boom and tough results were met with multiple layoffs that affected my career.  I am sad to say goodbye to Macy's but look forward to the next chapter of my professional career."
good,"I love the environment and culture in the building. On a normal day, you are greeted by all types of people in a cheerful mood. I've learned great ethics while at Macy's. I've learned to further my organizational skills. I've learned to better prioritize. I have learned humility. "
good,"Macy's was a  decent place to work at. The managers were nice, helpful co-workers, money was decent, especially since I was being paid weekly. "
good,"I liked a lot,  I worked in men's dept in Beverly hills .ca,  so to shop and dress diffe ent ppl was fun to change up our dept was fun as well.  I had to leave because of family but I enjoyed my time there."
good,Macys was actually my first legit job. I learned a lot. Although it can get overwhelming (especially during the holidays) but you learn to cope with it all.
good,i liked working here it just didn't pay enough for me to support my family but overall i liked it all the people were awesome and friendly great for someone who is just starting out on a first job or even someone would needs a second job.
good,"My manager that I most recently had in my department is a little more difficult to deal with- and the customers are not very fond of her either- but the general job is still enjoyable. I think the customer service is my favorite aspect, from helping with returns to finding new gifts and personal items to wear. it's a good job with a sub-par manager."
good,"My daily job duties put me in contact with caring coworkers and customers.  The manager of our location (we are a leased department) has become a mentor to me and made the work enjoyable.  I have gained confidence, leadership skills and experience that is not taught in any school."
good,"Macy's is a constantly growing company. Very hands-on and customer oriented, customers and customer satisfaction is to be prioritized. This was my very first retail job so I learned so much from how to interact with customers to learning how to do all the background work in the stockroom. A usual day at Macy's customers come in waves one moment you will be busy and another you would just walk around the floor making sure everything is in place or making tags for our shoes that were sold from the displays or shoes that were marked down. The work culture was great the environment is very friendly and interactive with each other. communication is key within associates to perform exceptional teamwork. Macy's is a company that does not discriminate, profornace is key. The only hardest part of the job was just being understaffed but the most enjoyable part of the job was even if we were low in staff my coworkers and I have a great bond with one another and were able to not just be coworkers but also friends."
good,Fun environment to be at. Lots of management skills learned. It is usually very busy on the weekends. Hardest part of working at Macy's was dealing with cranky people.
good,Working at Macy's is fast paced during the holiday season but very slow afterwards. The starting salary was low at $9 an hour with a 1% commission but if you sell a lot of jewelry you can make decent money. A bonus to working at Macy's is the employee discount and hours.
good,"Great people, stressful work environment. The hours for working cash office were frustrating and the store was often understaffed which made things difficult for the administrative/HR team."
good,"Good people to work with, very friendly environment. Can move to other departments to somewhat advance your job, not career. However very short on benefits and hours to work."
good,"This job advanced me in my compute skills, as well as a better understanding with the shipping process. "
good,fast paste of work but fun. a lot of team work and its a clean place to work in. supervisors are very understanding and helpful and respectful. I really liked working there.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"loved learning and working wth skin care! Lots of customer service. I dealt with new and long time customers. Gave mini facials, sold skin care and some make-up.Hardest part of the job was not getting enough hour. Most enjoyable part of the job were the products and assisting people."
good,Great job to get a good experience in the workplace. My department manager was great but the store manager definetly could improve. She lacks respect and doesn't seem to be on top of things as she should
good,"One thing that I didn't like is the environment changed with the management that was scheduled. With certain managers you could get away with more and then with others you couldn't. Also the loss prevention at the store was a complete joke, you are supposed to be rewarded if something is compromised but that never happens because half of the time the LP guy isnt there or he just doesn't do much but walk around on the floor. I also didn't like the fact that we could leave the store a wreck. Yes it was good not having the stress of making sure the sales floor is absolutely perfect especially after a busy day but the way in which it was left sometime would completely turn me away if I was a costumer."
good,"It was a seasonal job so you take it as that. If you think it's a way in, it may be. Seasonal jobs are just seasonal no reason to get overly excited. Just come in and do your job and go home."
good,Macy’s was a good experience for me in the few months time  spent. I would love to recommend this company to another person. I learned a lot of stuff that I️ could put forward to a new job.from the pressure my manager put on me.
good,"Being a sales rep at Macy’s was a wonderful experience , the other employees made you feel right at home. The managers were helpful and the pay was fair."
good,I have met some of the best people through working at Macy's and they are kindhearted and amazing. The executives of the company need to compensate their employees more. For the hardwork and dedication we put into the company we need to feel like we are appreciated through our pay and not the minuscule amount they try to pay.
good,"Macy's is a good place to work, but i'm a single parent now, and the retail hours are hard on my family. I work at lease four nights a week, and one day shift. As a single parent it's difficult to balance a good work and life."
good,Working for Macy's is a stressful environment you don't always get the hours you need to live comfortably. It has a competitive vibe that pushes people but doesn't drive them.
good,"Macys is a diverse and wonderful understanding company that really believes in its community, until you work at the Twin Falls store; of course this store is closing and we can see why. Not only do you see associates and managers gathering around the make up counter talking most of the day, but they lack the basic ability to actually manage, never enough t- rained employees that actually enjoy working and  maintaining anything up to the Macys standard- no theft scanners to detour loss and it always comes down to management when a store goes under- and boy is this store under by about 10years considering the apparrel and general appearance of the underrated store. It makes me very sad but this is the only exception all other locations are promising!"
good,"Macy's still has old world thinking and it inhibits new world thinkers from making headway. There is still hierarchical bureaucracy. Overall, great place to start a career. They have phenomenal training."
good,Very high paced.  Corporate goals seem to change very often so it makes it quite difficult to organize yourself.  The job cuts and store hour cut backs make it very difficult to get job done at the level of expectation.
good,If you apply yourself and work hard you will go far. The retail culture itself is face paced and business most days and holidays.  The beauty is the new initiatives to grasp to win.
good,"They will never ever give you hours they hire to many people and have only limited hours to give. You must call and check daily to see if there is any opening in any department, if you working regular retail excluding fine jewelry , cosmetics , fragrance and shoes in those special areas you will find and be given hours, everywhere else no and good luck trying."
good,"Macys offers a variety of positions and is flexible with hours. Management varies by department, but there is a strong sense of diversity within Macy's."
good,"Macy's is a minimum wage job, yet it feels like everyone there is a highly paid professional because of the culture of cheerfulness and professionalism. I would rather work there for $10.50 an hour than anywhere else."
good,"Be open minded and a people person, fast paced and you encounter a lot of different people and types. Overall I really enjoyed working with Macys and got along with my manager and co workers well"
good,Being one of the first jobs that I had I didn't get very many hours here. However I remember the discounts were great and mostly everyone was friendly.
good,"the hardest part of the job is recovery. The job itself is pretty straight forward. You will acquire great listening skills, and memory skills, as well as interpersonal skills as you interact with guest and let them know where to find products on a constantly changing floor."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was pretty good not to bad , get to help people makeup their mind on what to buy , and talking with your coworkers, the best part was working for the holidays and getting in the holiday spirit."
good,Dedicated to creating a fun and safe work environment. Pay is decent but could be better for the amount of work that you are putting in. Great people to work with.
good,"I loved--LOVED--my job but had to leave for health reasons. Great coworkers, helpful managers, pleasant atmosphere, energizing music. Because retail is suffering these days, staffing is minimal, so lots of customer complaints about not being able to find help. You have to be in three places at once sometimes. I embraced that challenge! Training is minimal, mostly on the job, but your coworkers have your back. Communication isn't great, especially if you're part-time. Low pay. That's retail for you. But if you enjoy retail, I highly recommend Macy's."
good,"I dont want to include any information about this company, All I will include is that Macy's is a good place to start your first job, I have learned so much in this company."
good,"Macy's working experience really opened my eyes to how diverse our world is. Working there showed me all kinds of people and how friendly everyone can be. Working there also improved my pace, being quick on your toes is always a great way to enjoy your job, it keeps you busy."
good,"Working at Macys is good if you like meeting new people, which is good because you get to do that every day. And people from around the world come everyday. It might get frustrating sometimes when a customer speaks little to no english and is dissatisfied with service, but it can be nice to share a human connection with people no matter where they come from or what language they speak."
good,"A typical day in the warehouse, early morning and a lot of work on your feet. Steady and constant pace great pay. The hardest part is the long shift on average 10-12 hrs per shift."
good,Macy's is a good company if you put your head down and do what you are told you will get your minimum raises and can retire from there in a matter of 50 years.  They strive to get people included in activities and clubs and make it a fun place to work but when it comes down to it its just a social club and if you are not in the exclusive part you will never advance past mid manager on an hourly level.  They have a ton of loyal employees that bend over backwards and do not ever get a chance to be anything more than hourly.  If you know someone in the upper levels you will be brought along ahead of others and place in a role that you have no experience in.  Most people that work there figure it out with in a few years and others hang on hoping to break through or try a million different departments in order to get noticed.  It really is a sad thing and after awhile it just steals your soul.
good,Using MyClient list has enhanced my overall experience at Macy's.  I am able to text or call customer to communicate sales events.  Capitalizing on each customer visit can create a loyal customer to the store and brand.
good,"Almost always, not enough staff on any given day.  Pay is less than most retail stores for amount of work involved.  Great group of coworkers, diversity in workplace."
good,"As an adevisor in the fragrance department, my main job was to observe a customer's preference and,believe it or not--personality, to figure out the perfect scent they're looking for."
good,"This was a seasonal position. Very fast paced. Most calls were from unhappy customers who had been victims of fraudulent activity on their accounts. It was Christmas so people were a bit more agitated."
good,Pretty much working with women all day. Helping them find shoes they like. Going to the stock room and using a ticket scan to find the shoe in the correct area.
good,Very big a lot of departments have to know everywhere in the store learn the ins-and-outs learn how to use the register as well for all employees I have great customer service
good,"I enjoyed working there...the people were nice and it helped me improve my skills set in customer service.............,................................"
good,I worked a seasonal positional and I was moved around from boxing items to stocking.  just be ready to learn multiple things as quick as possible. Have fun
good,"Too stressfull , lot of work , dont pay you that much.too much targets too much politics , my management was the best and very supportive.  But I would expect them to pay a lot more."
good,I enjoyed the upbeat and fast pace environment that Macy's provided. i was fun place to work. there was rarely a dull moment. I had the opportunity to meet people from all over the word.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with Macy's. I found the Burnsville Store and Minnesota staff to be easy to work with and for.  The work culture was what you would expect for retail.  I considered working for them after I moved to the Pacific Northwest, but found the group here to be not as easy to coordinate the transfer with.  I believe that if I would return to Macy's it would be on a part-time basis but I currently do not intend to return."
good,"Macy's is a great place to develop your AP skills. If you're willing to put in the work, you can be an all star. Sometimes the stress level can get pretty high."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked for the holiday season at Macy's, so I really didn't have the chance to stay and experience everything that came with working for the company for a long period of time but within the short time that I did work there, the scheduling system was great, the work environment was fast paced but it was worth it for how much you got paid. I would work there again if I had the chance."
good,Good part time job. The sales associates aren't paid enough so they have to work 50 plus hours to make a decent check.  It could be a good place to work for someone with no responsibilities.
good,The team and some of the customers are mostly what I miss about the job. My old manager was amazing and cared for us but the new manager did not come around often and rarely listened to our criticisms or needs. He would often disregard our availability and schedule us for hours that we couldn't work so we'd have to juggle hours around amongst ourselves. Most of the other managers were amazing and respectful. The team made it worth it to come back everyday and there were some amazing customers that would come in so most days were good. You may have to deal with some situations that they don't train you for when it comes to customers so you must rely on your judgement.
good,"Retail is retail,,, the hours, holidays ,weekends,  "
good,Busy environment. Fun if you like to be busy. Love the people I work with. You become like family. Discount is great plus they have special discount days where you get more off.
good,"Fun to work ,friendly environment ,job security ,team work ,learned new things,friendly managers,workers, safe place, good variety, attractive salary package."
good,the ability to work in different departments was nice as it was always different. The management team are willing to work around your schedule. A good place to work!
good,"Seasonal or Flex. associates get to pick their own shifts and work areas, training is hands on and working there you do get discounts. I enjoyed working in juniors, children, intimates and jewelry areas the most."
good,"Macy's is good place to work.  Management  good with strong group of employees. Company fairly good,  they cut back on staff and were in area by ourselves. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement and you can pickup extra hours. Unfortunately our store closed."
good,"Just not very understanding when it comes to health and family care. "
good,If your a people person then you should apply to work for Macy's. Also works great if you are going to school they will work with but its best to be part time.
good,"Was a great place to work. Great associates and good management. was a fun place to work, great people to work with, on big sale day we were provided with everything from snacks to and entire lunch. "
good,Working at Macy's was different. Being my first job I didn't really know what to expect. The managers were not really resourceful when need and the workers kind of kept to themselves.
good,"I started working at macys in 2015 and worked there until 2017 when my location in Athens, GA closed. I enjoyed working for maycs. The pay was decent ($9 an hour) and I was in a commission department (2% of every shoe sale) "
good,"Great workplace. Management is good. Benefits are average. Sometimes, not enough hours for associates. 3 to 4 hours per day for PT. But encouragement from management is effective, to drive sales and bring out the magic from all associates. Glad to be part of the team"
good,"As an on-call, no matter which department you are in, you  get to choose your own hours. As a cosmetic on-call, you also get to choose which counters you work at for that week. On top of your hourly wage, you also earn commission on each of your sales (cosmetic sales). Managers do pick favorites, and based on that, they choose who gets a permanent counter position. But overall a great job for someone who goes to school or only needs a few hours a week."
good,Macys was a typical sales associate position. Make sure you do as they ask and require and you will be fine. My location didnt seem to offer much in terms of progression through out the company.
good,"Excellent place of work"
good,"I worked in the men's section during the Holidays and while I only worked there a couple months, when the season ended the pace went down and being the last hire I was let go. The employees thrived on Starbucks and utter happiness, it was a friendly workplace with a diverse culture. I learned so much from several managers, they really took the time to properly train me and they didn't hesitate to help me."
good,I like that place. co-worker are friendly . Easy to work and helpful environment. Everything are fine. handling customer is easy and talking with them in good manner.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I think that this was a very adequate job, so as long as your are decently fit or can at least walk a whole lot. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about applying."
good,Coworkers made the day much more bearable whenever we had to encounter difficult customers. I do wish the managers were a little more understanding especially during the holidays.
good,"I normally work 4 hours per day in a fast paced environment, processing and maintaining all merchandise and records pertaining to the fine jewelry complex. "
good,The education provided at this company helped shape us in the retails industry. They paid great attention to detail and explaining fully on products and sales. We used our time to focus on customer needs and how to achieve goals
good,"This was my first job, worked early in the morning. Usually at 6-10:30 AM. Then would go to my second job. Usually got around 16 hrs a week. More during the holidays."
good,I recommend working at Macy's to anyone. It is a great company to work for with opportunity to move up. They have a very comfortable open door policy.
good,"Not applicable store closed. I worked from December 1, 2016 until March 11,2017. Macy's closed their doors at location. No other positions were made available to me."
good,"I didn't work there very long, and I worked in cosmetics, and I was pretty face paced, so I guess I'll say it was some what rewarding and educational at the same time."
good,"Frequent change of manangement and supervisors. Never seem to have enough coverage, sometimes you didn't even get a real break. On calls never showed up to releave you."
good,Worked in fine jewelry department. Great team members.  Ability to work a varied schedule and would have schedule three weeks in advance! If you like change retail is for you!
good,Macy's is a good place to work during the holidays. The employees are awesome and okay to get along with. Some of the managers are a little ugh...but others are great and down to earth. I would recommend this job to someone looking for extra money during the holidays. After the holidays it got pretty slow and they cut a lot of people and since I was only hired for seasonal holiday I had to go to. But if given the chance I would reapply and work at Macy's for the holidays.
good,"gooooooooooood place to work and fun. at times and get really busy and stressful but if you can handle than you will be just fine.Also, the benefits are not bad"
good,"Macy's was always fast paced , and it was the holidays so we were constantly busy , so most all the days went by quick. Opening and closing registers also went by quick , as long as everyone did their part individually then as a team it wasn't hard at Macy's."
good,very nice pay and commison and I like the fact that I get gratis along with training on different. my manager is nice and very helpful she always gets the job done
good,if your a student who just want to make money and don't care about growing in the company then macy's is the perfect place for you. I worked my but off at macys and never received any recognition.
good,"Macy's was a great place to work, especially during the holiday. You stay very busy because of all the orders that need to be filled. The packing department was the best this year."
good,"Macys always prioritize there customer, without customer we are not able to work or get paid . Be a good listener a good proveder of service try to help customer the best that you could."
good,Working in my department is fun and filled with adventures all the time. I enjoy my coworkers. We are truly a team. Working with the associates is fun and helps the day go by faster. We all help each other to get the work done.
good,"Just a customer service job that I had that wasnt willing to work with me when i has trouble switching classes with school and my child, Carry on......"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"loved working there, the management and fellow workers were nice and very informative and supportive.Great working environment and easy to learn, great benefits."
good,Great for senior who have other support as well as for college students.  Demanding holiday schedule.  Staff changes frequently; causes inconsistencies as to standards being maintained.
good,"A very nice place to work, I like all the jobs that I did while there. I would recommend. They have different shift hours available to suit your life style."
good,"I was not lifting anything over 35 pounds  which was comfortable for me, Great breaks . I liked my work schedule , it did not interfere with my social life."
good,"In my case, I worked off-stage unpacking and placing stock for tabletop, housewares, children's wear and coats/swim/Christmas during the retail season.  It was a fun job but very physically demanding."
good,"The best part about Macy's was the coworkers I had built relationships with, thus allowing for a more intimate work environment; we could always laugh with one another and share our experiences, both on and off the clock."
good,The job itself was fun but the stores were all short staffed and it was a challenge to get the job done while being distracted by a million customer issues. The customer culture at the store is not appropriate. Customers can be very rude and demand unreasonabl things. I had some incidents where a customer was so offensive towards me but nothing was said to her.
good,If you work in a commission department it can be cut-throat. They work you as much as they can. I was part-time but 7 and 8 hour shifts were not uncommon.
good,"I no longer work for this company,  the company closed it Mission Valley store."
good,"I worked as a support specialist so i came in in the early mornings before opening and scanned and changed signs, set up promotion and sales. You could work up to 40 hours, but standing on my feet all day did get tiring."
good,"Macys warehouse does not shy away from how difficult it is to work there, that you will be walking for miles upon miles every day.  This is a good thing because the recognize that what you're doing is difficult, rather than acting like it is easy and people are just lazy."
good,Okay environment to work at. Very tiring and a lot of work. Have to work on holidays and thanksgiving which is hard and a lot of work. pay is not so great but offer insurance plans.
good,Macys is a great company. they do put a lot of pressure on employees to make a certain amount of sales which can be difficult during very slow business days.
good,It is a highly competitive work. I work on commission that's why it is harder for me. Too much pressure. What I like about the company is that some managers and co-workers are really nice.
good,A typical day at macys for me was jumping around to every department and covering or just helping out making sure everything went well i wish the position wasn't only season because it was truly fun.
good,"I worked here when I first started in the work field. Good pay, personal time and sick time. You can build your own schedule depending on management and location. Discounts too! ;)"
good,Working in sales or merchandising can be stressful. A nice place to work but the rate of pay isn't worth the stress it can create. Christmas time like every other department store can be very hectic.
good,Job was a good one even though it did not last long. I was a temporary sales assistant at the Herald square store during the Christmas season. I enjoyed helping customers find the right ornaments and gift items to buy for their families.
good,"I had my good days and my off days, macy's was a learning experience it forced me to step out of my shell, the employees were helpful the managers were fair, the hardest part was getting a customer to open a macys credit card if they did not already own one"
good,"Training is consistent and well thought out. Yes you do have to sell but that is the nature of a capitalist economy.  sales goals are not that hard to reach.    There is the AMP program that promotes from within and there are job postings internallly that can move you on and up.  Depending on which store you go to you kind of hit the roulette wheel when it comes to management.  I have 2 out of three great management teams. The latter was passive aggressive and made me appreciate the management in prior two stores.   focus on the positive, because its easy to get caught up in talking about pay.  Unless you are management or a supervisor its not advisable for a young person to do this as a full time job, its not able to provide for that.   let it supplement your income if you are not going to be in retail as a career choice."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked a seasonal/recovery job here, but overall it was pretty nice.  I was responsible for picking up any clothes that fell, and putting out new merchandise. Sometimes the manager was pretty strict, but my co-workers were nice and fun to work with.  Most of the customers had questions that were easy to answer, and when I first started working, the manager gave me a tour of the place so I could know where each section of clothing was.  I was happy here, just wished they would have kept me longer than for seasonal work."
good,Providing customer service and keeping a clean work environment. Also answering a questions to the best of my knowledge and confident persuasive sales.
good,"sloppy compared to Vegas store, appreciate them for all the opportunities they gave me but I needed to excel. should've stayed longer but even if I did I feel like I wouldn't be noticed."
good,"A typical day at work was getting shoes for customers, making floor samples and keeping the store clean . The management was very good and they were nice overall people."
good,Some days can be really stressful and some can be really slow. You never know how the day going to be. Over all macys is a really good company to work for.
good,"I liked working here. I don't really have anything to rave about, or complain about. However, one thing that I did really like was the ability to arrange your work schedule on through their online system; by being able to pick up shifts or advertise ones that you couldn't work. The management was good. The compensation was alright."
good,Seasonal can be overwhelming and hrs are hard to come by not very consistent work but everyone is nice and try and help and encourage other team members. If you are strong willed and can deal with rude and impatient customers its a good place to work.
good,On most days I worked at one register and helped customers choose or locate merchandise. I put away clothes from the fitting room. On occasion I would work in different departments if needed. There was a target sales goal I typically met. For the most part it was a good job. I met a lot of wonderful people customers and co-workers.
good,If you want to work more than 40 hours you are able to at Macy's. It is an enjoyable place to work and is competitive at times as there are personal and store goals that need to be met.
good,my experience at macys was overall positive. the diversity and sale oriented environment created a good atmosphere. I learned a lot of new skills as well as improved my own skills. the only thing I would consider improving  wages especially for there inner core and most loyal and productive associates. its seems a bit unfair for an associate to ring up 7k in sales for $10 bucks an hour. offer sum incentive a bonus a commission a spiff sum theater tickets a lunch.
good,A cafeteria made it convenient and the coworkers were like family. Pay was low at the time. Picking and shipping worked on a per piece system. I learned good warehouse skills and numerous forklift operations.
good,I worked there for the seasonal rush in the mall.  I enjoyed my time there learned a few things and had to leave because i got accepted to college which was abroad.
good,"I enjoy interacting with customers.  The hardest part of job is juggling many roles as stock person, fulfilling online orders, manning the register and assisting customers and trying to boost sales."
good,"I worked at Macy's Systems & Technology as a contractor (Less than a year)"
good,"A usual day at work would be showing up and clocking in. Then watching cameras (CCTV) and hoping to find someone who is trying to steal. When you find a suspecgt, you want to make sure you have all your steps and process in order, so when prosecuting and detaing shoplifter you are accountable for what happens."
good,"A typical work day was meeting and servicing so many customers.  Most of them were very interesting. Always greeting and making a connection with the customer to find out their needs.  It was very important to always engage by asking open-ended questions.  Also, asking customers about opening an account. Sharing  information with the customer how they could save money on their purchase(s).  Recovery of merchandise and keeping work area clean from cutter were very important.  I learned the importance of listening and understanding the needs of the customer. The work place culture was very friendly.  I will truly miss my former coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was recovery. The most enjoyable part of the job was celebrating the purchases and the customers being Approved for a Macy's account. Management was okay.  At times it was a lack of communication."
good,It was nice place to work and management was fine. I liked its schedule however no benefits and very minimal commission. Hiring rate was also very low.
good,"Very boring, but I was once again; ""Blessed with work."" I was standing all day, looking for discarded items. My duties were to keep the store displays, up to Macy's standards."
good,"I learned how to manage my time better, and be a great multi-tasker while keeping a smile. I never had a hard time, everyone was so polite and helpful. I loved working there and seeing old customers every time."

good,"It was a pretty easy job, I liked the benefits that came with the job. I would recommend it to other young people. I met a lot of cool people , but the pay was low so I moved on."
good,Cool employees and managers  A flexible schedule very hands-on will help if needed . Very cool pay you will get paid every week HR is very helpful .  Overall the environment is pretty good
good,"I loved working there, but be warned, they follow a ""NO FAULT POLICY"". I hit an elk and between not having a car, calling in late (still coming to work), and calling in because of the 2 feet of snow blocking my driveway, I lost ALL of my ""attendance points"". I was told point blank by my manager, you could call in from the HOSPITAL after being hit by a car, and they will take your points!"
good,"macy's last act is a very busy but sometimes slow place to work in, always messy but associates gets the job done. the management in this department is okay to work with but can be overwhelming at some points in times. i enjoy working with my coworkers"
good,Most of colleagues are nice and hard-working. Good work environment but the hardest part is working on holidays when it's a little overwhelm. However it's a good experience and make time flies when it's very busy.

good,"fast paced, could get help if needed managers were very helpful and knowledgble. fun to work with clothes and friendly customers"
good,"I've had an amazing time working for Macy's. They only hire the absolute nicest people on planet earth. They're always offering Macy's money, snacks and meals to their employees, so it seems they spend a ton of money trying to keep employees happy. My question is...why do all that when you can just offer them an even greater incentive...like a good hourly rate or salary? Better benefits? More PTO?  Another thing is, every Januray they are closing stores...so no store isn't at-risk for closing un;ess they're considered a ""Top 150 Door"" store. Even these stores may be at risk, in the future, when another nearby mall or store get's remodeled. I also don't understand why they tell us that Full-Timers get 2 weeks vacation per year. That is not true...vacation is based on hours worked. I work close to 40 hours a week and I get a total of 8 days vacation...that's why I rated the work/life balance low. Either way I am still considering continuing work with Macy's. Even though my store is getting shut down, they work diligently to get the majority of employees placed into positions at other stores. The only ones not promised placement are those who don't want it (they're getting a new job, elsewhere), those in bad standing and those who are leaving and taking the severance/retirement package."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"If you want to move up quickly and don't mind leaving your personal life at home and standing on the backs of your employees, this is the place for you! Great compensation, great benefits, rapid advancement. Other than that, those who make the real decisions have been in the job and the industry their entire lives and they are fully prepared to eat their young during a time of weakness. "
good,Very good environment it is also a good place to expand into a different position the staff is very kind and welcoming they are also flexible to other schedules you may have
good,"Every morning there would be an associate meeting where you can bring up anything to discuss, although the main conversation is about the goals for sales of the day. The other employees are very friendly and willing to help. Always was encouraged to be customer driven, as in make the customers experience pleasantly memorable."
good,"Teamwork is a must, I love helping customers find what they came looking for and knowing that they will feel like they can always come back to Macys knowing our service is the best!"
good,This was a great opportunity at the moment but I always know there would be an end date because i had larger ambitions to own my own company and help others get an opportunity they may not of had elsewhere and to grow my business to the same level of success.
good,Liked this job but was not there long enough to reap any benefits. Very structured work enviroment. Job tasks clearly delineated. Work space was a little cramped. Open minded people to work with
good,"Alot of Merchandising. Great people to work with. Not much room for advancement. Learned to be available whenever is needed. Good Management. Hardest part is it's only a 12hr position for part timers,so you don't make much to live on. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with."
good,Overall working for Macy's has been a positive experience for me.  I have always looked forward to going to work because of the people I get to work with each and every day.  The company and workplace has evolved and consistently reinvents itself to keep up with the forever changing environment which makes me proud to be a part of.
good,This possition give you full time hours as seasonal which can become permanant. There are prize drawings for a chace to win a TV or game systems during the season. If you get spectacular numbers or performance you can become a permanant worker.
good,a typical day at work would be having daily meetings before starting our work. Then doing what you are assigned to do for the day. Whether that be picking or replen.

good,"Great part-time job.  Need to committed to your sales goals.  Able to learn new skills in sales, especially observing techniques with seasoned sales team mates."
good,A typical day is a good day at work. I learned that no matter how tired i get the job will be over soon and i shouldn't give up. the enjoyable part off work is being able to clock out once your job is done.
good,It's really nice to work at Macy's. Their management system is great and my co-workers are so helpful to each other. They work as a team. the hardest part of the job is to manage some crazy customers.

good,"The staff there was incredible, always very helpful with helping me and just making the work experience a fun and desirable one! The pay and hours were also very good as well!"
good,Macy's has provided me a good place to begin working again after staying home and raising my children. I was provided with quick advancement opportunities and received good training.
good,"Macys is an ever growing retailer which strives to deliver luxury convenience to its clients through maximizing the omnichannel process. You are trained to do various things including merchandising, visual set up, fulfillment, inventory management and associate development."
good,Full of energy and positive attitudes.  Pay is terrible.  Managers are helpful and accessable. I wish there are more hours per week and better payper hour.
good,"Felt a lot like being in school because every week, your manager/supervisor would speak to you about your scorecard, which included how many times you met your sales quota in a week, how many items per transactions and how many credit cards you were able to get. If your scorecard didn't improve, you would not get a raise and you could possibly be fired."

good,"same as on the last review all was good to work at this Macy's my first job in a very long time."
good,"Busy, demanding customers, at the end of the day it all stays there."
good,The managers were always available when you called. I was able to work well with a large group of co-workers. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers and the hardest part of the job was closing time when we had to fix the clothes.
good,I loved working there.  Everyone was so nice and always in a good spirit. People really enjoy seeing everyone successful. Everyone helps each other out.
good,The atmosphere at Macy's is great. They truly believe in teamwork and welcoming new team members. The seasonal jobs typically do not last as long as might be expected.
good,The manager and assistant merchandiser are rude.Working in the morning is not good. You can be assigned to a lot of work and can be blame if not done when you have to assist customers left and right. You can be send home when you have a loud voice related to work but those who are just talking and talking with a friend customer for about 30 mins are fine. The management are unfair even an associate bullies co- workers they remain to work and are treated nice while you who works hard are always wrong and the manager always find faults  in you. The manager can break the rules to favor a co- worker
good,"Policies and practices were transparent, supportive staff and management, low pay, ability to move up in company, productivity standards are difficult for a less assertive individual."
good,"Meet & greet vale customers and supply to their shopping needs etc.  Assisted with variety types of payments.   My passion for fashion demonstrates an enthusiastic and energetic positive"
good,"was an okay place to work, wasn't horrible but wasn't always easy. More fun during the holidays though. Also good discount. My manager was nice but not all the managers were."
good,"Exciting and fast paced work environment. Would still be there if not for company lay offs. Worked with some good people, miss them already. Every day a new challenge would come our way, what with the volume of customers, but it was great to ask them where they were from, and tell them about products that we had at our store, but that they may not have had at their localities. We had a good and experienced staff who were willing to switch gears when needed. Loved the job."
good,"A typical day includes greetings with smiles, helping customers obtain their merchandise with the most detailed search and find system ,processing payment transactions, keeping work stations and floors clean, removing items from dressing rooms, and organizing and replenishing counters, stands, and racks. I've learned various responsibilities, professionalism, and how to get the job done and have fun doing it. The management team leaders were very stylish,  inspiring and experienced. My co-workers were good workers, and lensed me much assistance, advice, and pointers when needed. The hardest part of the job was finding items within the stock rooms, and the most enjoyable part was being part of a team."
good,Macys was a fun place to work. People are great to work with and they helped you when life gave you a curve ball. Only thing that sucked was there wasnt enough hours to go around. So only got 20 hours aweek.
good,the good thing about macys is that you meet great outgoing people how has the same intrest as you. there discounts are worth it especially during the holidays.
good,I loved my job at Macy's.  I worked there almost three years and during that time I grew within the company from a small booth to a large counter and then from part time to full time.
good,Meet new people everyday. It's a good experience but the pay should be a little more. The best thing about the company is the flexibility with your scheduling.
good,"a typical day was greeting customers, helping with outfits and checking them out at the register. You also get the opportunity to work in other departments."

good,Love working for Macys - never bored and people are amazing. Lots of flexibility with your schedule. You can pretty much work around your personal schedule.
good,Everything is awesome except the level of drama brought to the table. As well as the feeling of distrust between the management as a company and the associates.
good,For seasonal managers are somewhat hard to find. but other from that it was a nice job. Working with customers was very nice and rewarding.
good,A lot of down time during the week but often picked up on weekends. I worked with a great team who were professional and put customers first. Learned how to deal with different types of people which in turn helped me deal with the real world.
good,"Fun people, vibrant environment and easily delegated task. Learned important of efficiency. Respectful managers. Helpful co-workers. Making a customer smile is very enjoyable. Cleaning and putting things back in tip top shape after customers mess them up every second."

good,"macy's is okay to work at"
good,"Management was decent, a typical day was busy and learned how to efficiently multi-task. My co-workers were friendly and nice. The hardest part of my job was during the holidays when there were tons of customers. The most enjoyable was getting to know all the customers I met."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"I only worked at Hulen Macy's for 2 months, I learned little about it besides what I learned at Ridgmar Macy's. the company is okay, not much to say, focuses on the customer more than the employee."
good,Great place to work and a great atomosphere. I absolutely loved working there. Learned alot about selling and magic customer service.
good,Would've liked to stay at Macys longer.it was a seasonal potion I really liked it love the clothes. Just in the holidays things tend to be different more people longer lines of what people want to buy and they get on my nerves. But that's what they (company )paid me for.
good,I met a lot of great people almost everyday on the job due to the high hiring rate during the season. The work is fast paced and keeps you going for the hours you are working.
good,"The store itself was not that great. Management didn't have organization."
good,"Great place to work, just wish the pay was better and the managers did not change frequently. departments could also be more organized."
good,Support Monitoring network traffic.  Making changes to security files for new employees. On call for nightly job processing.  Correcting store level communications
good,"I love working retail, and Macy's is a great please to work if you enjoy working as a team. Yes its fun, but its also a lot of work to be done like keeping the store neat and shoppable. the down fall of this job is the pay and hrs. I can't and many can not go far with what you are being paid even if your working full time or part time , but a lot of hard work is being put in. overall Macy's is a GREAT company and awesome team to be apart of if you would like to work in retail."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I have worked for Macys since 1998. I started seasonal. I was called back after the holiday season. I have worked in several departments. I have worked in 2 different stores. I have been able multi task several positions over the years.
good,I enjoyed my time at Macy's. I learned a lot while there. My coworkers were awesome and always willing to help. Management was attentive and supportive.
good,"Early morning job, remove items of the truck, and bring into the store. I learned that the store can go through a lot when sales begins and ends. Management was straight forward. coworkers were Long time employees and temp employees like myself. Hardest part of the job was completing a task before the doors opened. Enjoyable part of my job was the learning process of setting and removing sales. It was the most important part of the job."
good,Great company to work for. Tons of potential for advancement. Work life balance is great. I would recommend Macys to others.
good,"Nice managers who work hard to be sure there is adequate coverage and to be sure employees know safety protocols.  Music booming overhead and repeating every couple of hrs is annoying to everyone, including customers."
good,Great job for students. Although the hours varies a lot and you might have some good weeks with great hours and a week with little to no hours.
good,"I was very happy to work with Macy's , however a change in hours required me seek employment elsewhere. The mens suit department is an enjoyable department in the store, as we all can interact with customers to build long lasting and friendly relationships."
good,"Macy's is not a bad place to work, and I actually enjoyed most of my time there. Training in ""Macy's Magic"" is good. But the culture stresses work and sales over everything else. The managers are stressed and under a lot of pressure, and that pressure is passed down the line to the associates. I would work there again, probably, but would rather find a more fun and easygoing environment."
good,"Located in Mall of America was a very interesting and attractive place to work as had clients from different cultures.  My co-workers were very helpful and friendly, very easy to get along.  I mostly enjoyed dealing with people with different backgrounds and countries and being able to help them with my language skills."
good,"Productive and interesting place to work.  People set their own pace, but do have a require processing amount.  People were nice for the most part. I kept myself busy working most of the time.  The RF gun was the hardest part of the job to learn, but I caught on fairly quickly.  Management was nice.  They remembered my name which surprised me with so many temps running around. I loved sorting merchandise and checking, packing and sending out orders was enjoyable.  I like busy work.  It makes the day not drag by."
good,"Keep happy all your clients and users(customers)."
good,"Providing customer service, cashier.  I would great customers, ask them what their needs are and help them find their need.  Then start a fitting room for them, check on them to see if they need different sizes, colors, or other items.  Then I would ring them up and welcome them back. I had several regular customers that would seek me out to help them again.  I learned how to provide outstanding customer service.  I enjoyed working with my management and co-workers.  I have worked in clothing for many years where I didn't find my job hard.  The most enjoyable part of my job was having regular customers that would come back and I could help them again and they were happy to see me or asked for me."
good,Managers were very attentive to ones needs. Variety of different cultures seen on a daily basis. I learned to be very positive no matter what outcome.
good,"A day at macys can be boring or busy. My co workers are fun and also the managers, but they can be very strict when it comes to customer service as they would always check us if we open a new credit card and loves us if we did."
good,A good place to work that incorporates work life balance. Fun place to work as well. You earn credit weekly. The hard part about the job is the Benefits and pay are not the best.
good,Macy's is a nice first job to have. Working here has helped me a lot for the job I currently have today. I took whatever I learned from Macy's into my work environment. I thank them for all they have done for me to this day.
good,"I adore working at Macy's, it never truly feels like work. Everyone is pleasant although working holidays can be a little hectic. "
good,"My average day consists of loading valuable products into bins and ensuring security of the product until responsibility is given to someone else. I have learned a few basic skills and boosted my ability to work with others. The job is quite enjoyable when more shipments come in to keep busy, the only difficult part of the job is the wait time between shipments."
good,I have learned to work with a team and have felt the great sense of accomplishment by achieving goals together. I have been pushed outside of my comfort zone many times in this job but it has only made me a better worker. I have felt great satisfaction from helping customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,You are a part of a team that drives the Macy's brand to valued customers as well as possible new customers.  Greet people with a smile and be both sales person and product professional to make the customer feel like you are a true genius when it comes to all things Macy's
good,"-The work place was fun to work."
good,"I love working in the Ballston area. We get a lot of different kinds of clients from all over the world, and there is always a lot to do."
good,"Covering floor and replacing items on racks. Attending to customer needs and helping the best to my abilities, whether its finding certain items or helping them obtain credit card."
good,"Fun place to work if you love people."
good,This is a strong Retail Company with generous Employee discounts.  Workload and expectations are high and the management is always focused on results.
good,"As a direct to consumer facility, the workplace is hectic and seasonal in nature. The general feel to the facility is positive."
good,"Help out customers with what they needed. I learned how to develop skills with sales, helping others, opening Macy accounts. Management was very supportive and pushed us to do more sales. Coworkers were awesome when i first started they helped me every step of the way."
good,A day at work is very productive and we learn different sales techniques . My co-workers are pretty friendly. I enjoy helping others
good,"I enjoy working at Macy's. I work on the support side the the store, which means making sure the store the presentable for the customers to make purchases. I take pride in making sure my areas are neat and organized. Also to see all the new fashions come in each season. However, the best part is helping shoppers feel good about their appearances and themselves."
good,"supportive co-workers"
good,I enjoyed the different people that I got to meet and the wonderful supervisors that I had. I also formed great friendships with my coworkers that I still communicate with today.
good,"This was my first retail job and it sticks out from my restaurant industry background. A very self motivated work ethic was needed in selling certain products, credit card plans, and promotions. Management gave some resources on how to be a successful salesmen and I learned much on the subject. I excelled until it got to a point where my customers just weren't interested in what I was selling and it was disheartening at times. What i really enjoyed was assisting buyers with their selections and offering sound advice on what products would work best with them personally. In the end, the job offered too little hours and pay for me to stay properly committed."
good,"Macys is all about MAGIC, making people come back to its store. This company is all for customer service. I enjoy making customers feel hospitality."
good,"I have many duties and each day I do something different."
good,I was at the company the longest. It was the place I grew up in. I was the youngest person in the group and the other co-workers had been there over 15-20 years. I learned a lot of important things about business and how to be great in customer service and vendor comply.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target in the beginning. Some of the challenges I faced with the company was they never really offered any advancements. I worked here since I was 16 years old and never was late, or have I ever been wrote up. I never got recognized for that. I did enjoy interacting with the guest and helping out new employees."
good,"Macys is a good place to work if you are looking for good pay and flexable work hours, as well as benifits when it comes to still going to school and other at home needs."
good,Fun workplace with supportive suppervisors. Very little area of growth. Promotes outside the company and almost never within.
good,"The typical day at work is routine, just as a retail sales position should be. The customer interaction is encouraged and you are well trained by their program to do so. It is by the best training you will receive to excel in any sales position. This job helped me to build great communication skills, problem solve, and work as a team. The management is quite effective. You are given weekly goals, and the managers will work with you one-on-one to achieve the goals. They give you tips on how to improve your skills. The hardest part of the job for me was strictly in my department (which was the mattress/furniture department). It was short staffed. I was the only associate for a while in the department. Although I was a full time associate, I had a challenge to help all customers on a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help customers achieve satisfaction on their purchases. Lastly, working with a great group of coworkers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"okay place to work, scheduled is a bit annoying. changes every day and some 3 hour shifts. besides that management is reasonable and the work environment is good enough."
good,"Conducted investigations regarding suspected incidents of external fraud, employee theft and embezzlement. Patrolled the facility and served as a general security presence and visible deterrent to crime and rule infractions. Responded quickly to medical emergencies, bomb threats and fire alarms. "
good,"1, A typical day in Macy consist of receiving merchandise,logging all the inventory along with merchandise, organizing and putting merchandise in display, sales of merchandise, finding online orders, costumer service, and assisting managers."
good,It's good for a first job but after a while you will probably want to find something new. Coworkers are pretty cool and the place is pretty chill.
good,"I would clean the department, help customers, open credit cards. This is how i got all my customer service skills. Macy's is big on customer service and they have training all year around. most co-workers are ok. hardest part is keeping department clean during big sales."
good,Clinique is a great company to work for. You get to be around people all the time but at the time that I worked for the company there was no advancement opportunity through Macy's.
good,Macy's is definitely a great job to have. They strive for Quality above all else. We have a very diverse work environment. Macy's is very big on equal job employment. Id definitely recommend it to anyone.
good,"A typical day: come in punch in, start working with customers on the floor, and trying to inform customers about our products, make sales, handle money transactions, try to sell Macy's credit cards/cards to customers, count down the drawer at the end of the day."
good,"A typical day involved arriving 1/2 hour before the store opened and opening cash registers in my work area and counting the money from the night before, and then attending an employee rally.  (If my shift ended after the store was closed, I would help to straighten my area and then close out registers.)  After customers arrived, I would assist with them with selections and ring them up.  The hardest part of the job was keeping clothing racks and stacks neat while customers were sorting through them.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was helping customers who didn't quite know what they wanted and I was able to help them make choices."
good,"it's long days with routine works like folding (esp. on weekdays) and there's nothing else to do. I have learned to have respect for customers, how to approach them and I also learned what retail business looks like."
good,"Handled boxes, open and dispose all boxes in trash. Strip all plastic on clothes, and tagged all clothes. Made sure all dress shirts was tagged and placed on the right floor Decker."
good,I learned the ins and outs of the cosmetic industry. I loved the discounts and working with some great individuals. Great environment.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's because of my co-workers. We each did our job effectively and made the experience great. I really enjoyed customer interaction and being able to showcase my organizational and time management skills. This company was very flexible with employees schedules and understanding. I was able to work my entire pregnancy with minimum call-outs and stress. I really enjoyed the calm work environment and the way the company always made the customer a priority. The only negative thing I have to say, isn't really a negative from a business stand point. The company puts very hard pressure on staff to gain credit card entries, even if no credit card was awarded to customer, an appilication was still required, and we were written up if we did not have set number by the end f the week."
good,"The work I provided for online customers was necessary, and productive and I had fun doing the tasks, Management was very helpful when need and the environment was friendly and safe."
good,"Although there is repetition in the product development process, each day is typically different.  Macy's is a great place to start a career in the fashion industry as the Intern and Executive Development programs are detailed and competitive.  The hardest part of the job is usually the unanticipated line changes or buying plan changes which  are typical in the industry.  My co-workers are the best part of the job, giving you a great sense of comradery during stressful times."
good,"A typical day at work is providing customers with outstanding customer services. I am a specialist in my field. when I come into work I have to check the computer for any orders, fill them if needed, ship them out if needed, run the fitting rooms along with putting clothes away. most morning I am opening alone for two departments, which means I do the above twice, so I mulit-task a lot in my day. I have learned many things product knowledge is one major one. if I did not know my two departments inside and out I wouldn't be able to help my customers as they come in. not only do I have co-workers but we are a team not just co-workers. we treat each other with respect and help out each other when ever we can. the  hardest part of my job would be running two department alone for a period of time. I can run them both alone fine but on key days I feel I cant give the customer the full attention they deserve. the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I am helping someone feel good about the way they look. I work in plus sizes and intimates and both areas are very sensitive areas for woman. people usually feel they don't look good but need new clothes because they cant fit into the old. I love making that connections with my customers helping them feel good about the way they look. by doing this it lifts there sprit up and you can see that in their personality when they leave. I especially love helping people who have had it hard in life with cancer or funeral exc. if I can help turn a bad day into a feel good about your body it makes my job very rewarding."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of selling the product to your customer while remaining consistent in customer appreciation. I was able to improve my skills in multitasking. Management was always focused and goal oriented, along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was assisting other employees when working with customers, but the most enjoyable part was being able to get the customer anything that they need efficiently."
good,Best part of the job is the employee discount. worst part of the job is the pay and benefits. I love the job culture and the people I get to meet through my job
good,"Staying alert and aware of your customer's need as well as, keeping your area neat.  I learned that I was an excellent sales person."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I socialize with amazing customers!"
good,the over all environment was up beat and fun. management was always nice and there to help you out when ever you needed something. very flexible
good,"I enjoyed the job and the people, unfortunately ,they were only hiring people for part-time positions. Supervisors were very helpful and worked with you on the schedule in case you had appointments."
good,"Overall co- workers were great I learned a lot in this job and mainly to interact with people more, and assist they in anything but overall it was a great environment."
good,Just a typical retail job with good staff. Although some co-workers treat this as more of a hang-out spot and slack off while you pick up their slack.
good,"A typical day at work is usually unloading trucks on to the sales floor. I also mark down items for clearance.  I maintain the women's shoe areas. I stock the shoes by type and color. We also set aside ones for seasonal areas- ie boots or sandals. I am also involved in making sure the clearance gets pulled and ready for the sales floor. "
good,"Walk in and it feels like family."
good,"I was really surprised with the environment , they really support the employees as long  as they provide the best CS to the Macys customers , I've worked at places were people earn at least $10 more an hour than  Macy's Card center and are not as willing to pitch in $$$ for good cause /fundraiser or even just a birthday cake & these guys here at macys are just so giving and happy"
good,"A nice place to work and a warm work environment. Retail is a finicky business, there a lot of changes that are always being made with that you are always learning. I loved meeting people, and the people I worked with were awesome some of which I'm still friends with. An overall nice experience."
good,"Every shift was different, which I loved.  I never knew what I was going to come in to.  I enjoyed finding solutions for customers and the associates.  The hardest part of the job was when I couldn't make the client happy.  I loved all the different people I worked with."
good,"you don't need to join a gym if you take this kind of position at MACY'S. Liked that I didn't  have to directly deal with customers.  But wish there was a distinguishing uniform so customers can tell the different between an actual sales associate and a floor merchandiser/stocker.  "
good,"It is a good place to work. It will provide valuable experience to persons' looking to gain experience within the fashion and retail environment. There is flexibility with the work schedule, therefore associates can balance personal life and work life. The coworkers I have at Macys are now considered my friends. They are great people. We rely on each other to get through the bad days and make the good days better. The hardest part of working at macys is their is little autonomy. Also, their is a lot of things being implemented that an associate has to remember and is judged on. Lastly, it is difficult to manage giving superb customer service as an associate should along with having to do the duties of other departments such as support. The most enjoyable part of the job is growing your sense of fashion, meeting new people, and making someone's day with good customer service."
good,it was relaxed in the sense of it being a huge department store. management was hard to come by.i met people of all ages and was lucky enough to have been given wisdom from the cutomers i really made a connection with.
good,"I loved my job as a shoe specialist, what can I say I love shoes. working at macys I handled money from credit cards to checks to cashiers checks to gift cards I was able to manage two customer at two registers at a time while placing orders on the phone I was good at my job! I was able to take up to five customers shoe orders and memorize their size and color while also offering them recommendations of what I felt they would like more. My customers almost   90% of the time purchased my options if they had not already picked it themselves I especially loved to help older women who had feet with more complications  finding them the perfect shoe that was not only comfortable but also stylish and inexpensive. the least thing I liked about this job was the competition I was not a fan of the sale tactics much as I was in to just wanting to be helpful  to the customers who really need it"
good,"You are able to pick a specific day off each week and the schedule is computer generated. Management is nice! Compensation should be a little better, but not horrible."
good,"A typical shift at Macy's during markdowns is a breeze, starting at 6 am . I'm sure to most the hardest part of the job is waking up early enough to make it on time (especially hardest when catching public transportation). Operating the technology is easy to learn, it took me no longer than 2 minutes to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate with co-workers; everyone displays excellent teamwork. Management is very good, the communicate effectively exactly how they want the job done."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's, especially with the perks but I felt at times, I wasn't appreciated as much. I wasn't always thanked for my good work but constantly condemned when I did wrong. Some managers could care less about our well-being."
good,"Working for the company was a learning experience for me. If you are looking for full-time work with benefits I don't think this company would suit you however, if you are looking for part-time work, and a generous discount then this is the job for you. Everyday is a different day working for Macy's. With all the constant sales and promotions at times it may be somewhat confusing keeping up with it all, but this company will certainly make sure you work and are always busy. I think for the amount of work the staff does the pay AND benefits would be better. The staff are underpaid and that certainly needs to change."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Day can be busy or slow depending on the customer traffic.  I have learned about how retail works, a different side of customer service.  Working as a team management often did not need to supervise the area.  Co-workers worked as a team, covering each other as shifts  were different each day and overlapped.  The hardest part of the job was to convey many different types of information (sales, discount, specials, community events and product knowledge) while others stood in line. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that a customer came in to make a purchase and left smiling."
good,I love my job in events and there is a lot of opportunity to grow but you must be able to network and make a name for yourself.
good,The hours mixed well with my schedule. I would clock in and usually stock and organize. My co-workers were good. It is a fine part time job for the summer.
good,"Conduct morning rally. "
good,"Sales, service, merchandising, managing of employees.  I learned that working in retail management is very difficult and time consuming.  One must have great patience and be willing to make sacrifices to work in this industry. "
good,I enjoyed being a Fit Specialist and getting to know my clients and their stories. I built lasting friendships with my coworkers and we worked well as a team. The hardest part of my job was clean up at closing. You would receive little star award pins to display on your name tag when a customer gave your manager a compliment about you.
good,"I arrive to work and sign in using computer system with my personal ID #, count cash drawer with correct opening balance, and attend daily rally as the store prepares to open."
good,Overall a great company.  Have fun working for Macy's and everyone in the company was great and incredibly helpful.  Work life was stressful but the management team was always there to help.
good,It was a good place to work and I learned a lot about the retail business. I worked 20 or more flexible hours a week . Store Management was good and customers seem to be satisfied with the service they were getting.
good,Opportunity that requires a dedicated and educated professional utilizing high level of skills and experience. * Dependable * Organized * Excellent Costumer Service Skills.
good,"great place worked with macys for 5 years make your own and edit your schedule if needed, not so great pay for the work doing."
good,"A typical day at work is a very well organized and diverse workplace, I learn new things on a daily basis. The management is great and co workers a productive eager to work and help customers and new team members. The hardest part of the job is the holiday rushes, and the most enjoyable part is being part of a team that helps behind the scenes to make the customer happy."
good,"Working there was a headache when they mess up your hours 20 or more ,not cool,there were some great people there. Great morale for newbies."
good,"Working at Macy's was a new experience because I had never been a merchandiser before. I had to learn to read a planogram and the layout of the store in order to place the items in the different departments. I usually worked the 6 AM to 10 AM shift with the occasional 2 PM (if we had a sale or another event). I was cross-trained with Pricing and Signing and Markdowns so whenever there wasn't a truck, I would be on either team. My coworkers were fun to work with and made the morning go by quicker. The hardest part of the job was towards the end. Each department is given two merchandisers, depending on the size. Since I was in the Women's department, I was part of a team of two (even three sometimes). The two ladies on my team found other employment, so that left me to tend to the whole department. While the merchandising manager would sometimes help, she would depend on me to finish the whole department by a certain time. It became to much too handle."
good,Working at Macys gave me a better understanding of how to deal with customers. I had a great time being able to help everyone in whatever they needed. The environment was also very friendly.
good,Very Busy Up Beat Store With tons Of Personality No Drama. You Build Up A Great Clientel List Were They Only Want to See You Or Come Back On Another Day Just to See You.
good,Macys is a fast paced and extremely challenging environment to work. The training is best in industry and the company prides itself on its ability to stay current in todays ever changing business trends. Being able to be organized and time management skills are essential to success.
good,If you are working in cosmetics/ fragrance those are the best areas to work because you have a better hands on relationship with customers
good,"I worked in Women's Shoes. It was either crazy busy or absolutely dead. The managers pushed you to get costumers to open Macy's card and to hit your sales goals. They would give you small gift cards called ""Macy's Money"" if you did something good. The customers weren't bad for the most part."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This was a good experience not my first choice of employment though. I did not like the way managers interacted with employees.
good,"Unfortunately this was a seasonal job, but other than that I have no complaints at all. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a part time job around the holidays."
good,"It was great working here, however I didn't like that it was commission because it made everyone hate each other. I did like the long 1hr breaks they gave us"
good,"Working with Macy's was a great experience. Great Co-Workers, also great benefits. It may had a few downers but every job definitely have their cons. Overall Great Company."
good,"It was a great job opportunity, flexible hours, and overtime if needed. All of management were nice and the co-workers were hard working employees"
good,A typical day a work involved working at least seven hours assisting customers in the restaurant and getting them seated. Management was great and everyone was nice
good,"A typical day at work would be opening up all the registers in my department, greeting customers, assisting customers. Management is okay, not great they don't back up their employees. My co-workers were pleasant, enjoyed working with them. The hardest of the job would be during holiday season."
good,Management is okay and they never give you recognition for what you do but its a good first job. The employees are super diverse and extremely outgoing. Love the hours. I would not recommend it for anyone that is not looking for a first job.
good,"self starter job opportunity, work without intense or constant supervision, opportunity to interact with customers. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is angry for not getting what he/she wants. The most enjoyable part is when the customer leave the store with a smile on the face."
good,"I typically assisted in pushing merchandise from the stock area onto the sales floor. Organizing, folding, and arranging the merchandise for the convenience of the customers. Dressing mannequins, and ""look"" hangers with the latest fashions on showcase in the department I was assigned to for the day. I met with customers and assisted them with locating and choosing the best merchandise for their particular needs. The co-workers were very helpful and kind, and always looking to help."
good,The Company Profile is good but sometimes it is hard to look for right person to ask specially in HR department. The work is not really hard to learned because of compitition  between co-associates some will not really share info. One of the discouraging issues if the supervisor or manager will answer back to an inquiry I DO NOT KNOW.
good,working with people with new people love to meet new co-work
good,"A typical day would consist of answering an extremely high volume of calls, and trying to resolve customer issues and complaints. The most rewarding part of the job was the satisfaction you received in resolving a difficult or recurring issue for a customer. The worst part of the job was the constant layoffs and never ending changes."
good,"Great Training."
good,"CEO of Mercantile when we were sold wrote a reference letter to Macy's several other companies telling them about me an that I was an asset to Mercantile for 23 yeas,  I was hired as Executive Assistant worked for a year, then went to the Marketing area as a Financial Specialist. In charge of receivables and payables for the paper department ,for all catalogs that were sent out in mail  Sent out reports to all the divisions in the company on expenses of paper and print.   Had a great Boss  Hardest part of job is getting vendors to send in there bills to be paid on time.  When I went back to the paper department they were months behind in paying the bills.  I called all the vendors built a relationship with them and had everything back in order."
good,Customers come generally with what they want to buy already but it is a blast to get to know these people and learn how cool they are and that you can help to make their day just that much better
good,"My day involved unpacking boxes and loading them into different storage rooms. The management and workers always worked together as group without abusing authority. There wasn't anything hard about this position, but it did take a lot of labor. The job was most enjoyable because of the friendly and easy going staff."
good,"Pricing items,stocking items to back stock area helping move sale items and serving customers and we gotdiscounts on cloyhes which was good"
good,"Lots of manual labor. Very fast paced, not for slow workers."
good,"Lovable Job but its no joke, you have to be on your game. Its cool to get paid to shop. I like the freedom in the job but it is a little unorganized. May get stressful when your trying to obtain outstanding sales goals. Some other personal shoppers can step on your toes if you are not careful. Other than that, this job is pretty cool and I like it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's was very welcoming over all. a good place to work with nice employees.
good,"I loved my co-workers we all get along great. The work envorionment is always fun, there is always a lot of incentive. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly helping customers. Having conversations with them and making sure they leave the store feeling better than they did walking in. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the sales, espically on slow days. The management is great, everyone is a true leader and pushes you to do your best without being to hard on you. I learned so many things not only of the product that I was working with but that customer service is really rewarding."
good,Great place to learn grow and expereince.  You are sure to find new inspiration daily.
good,"- improved sales "
good,"Go with the flow type of job "
good,"promoted company sales, had excellent interpersonal skills, maintain a clean work area and accurate in managing my  cash register, P.O.S. skills"
good,"Learned line of clothing and how to present it to customers, opearted cash register"
good,"I do fulfillment at Macy's and it's basically a scavenger hunt every day, so that's pretty neat.  I gained skills in management, organization, and patience.  My team and I work very closely with our management, they listen to what we need, etc.  The hardest part of the job is letting go of the idea that a certain item can be found and giving it to another store.  The most fulfilling part of my job is knowing I left with a great percentage."
good,"A typical day included opening the registers in the morning, cleaning up any clothing that was not on the racks (recovery), working point-of-service cashier position/checking out customers' purchases, answering questions, etc."
good,"Clocking in/out for shift, clean and rearrange items to fit plans, fashion jewelery and watches, womens clothing. the atmosphere is fast-paced."
good,A typical day at work involved scanning a product and placing it into the box that it belonged in to complete the orders.
good,"my job was ok I was a sales associate where I would assist customers with finding items. Managed lines while checking out the cash draw, Also did recovery fixing up the stores floor."
good,The management could you use a little bit of work and improvement. Communication with the employees would be another thing to improve in.
good,"Although, I was there for a short amount of time, It was somewhat stressful because the managers just throw you out on the floor with very little training and expect you to be perfect at everything."
good,"nice place to work, great products, scheduling a bit of a problem"
good,"I loved working at Macy's! A typical day involved working with customers and your co-workers to clean and keep up with customer demands!"
good,Macy's is a well run company that has managed to evolve from a group of seven regional firms into one national firm with a minimum of disruption.
good,"This was only a temporary cashier position for the holidays however, co-workers were fun to work with, the time flew by and each day was just a pleasure to go thru.  Management was always there to assist with any problems, the customers were for the most part, wonderful to deal with.  The not-so-good part was that the job was only temporary - very disappointed as I really enjoyed working at the store."
good,"As the day started I would be assigned to a clothing section and I would proceed and recover the area.  Duties also included handling a cash register, consumer guidance, and the occasional inventory count. Macy's helped me understand consumer's better while introducing sale's experience in a fast paced retail environment. Management was efficient and helpful, very focused and always promoted strong sale innovations. Co-workers can be chatty, yet all were friendly and highly motivated. Closing time would be considered the hardest part of the job, due to the fact that the entire store needed to be recovered for the following day. At the end of the day I would feel improved because, I helped many consumer's as they did help me grow as a seller."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Interacted w/ customers daily and provided customer assistance when necessary. Maintained a clean, presentable floor. Management was always present, giving feedback about performance, which I admired very much. Not a very difficult job and the most enjoyable part was the constant interactions w/ customers. It was good practice towards appropriate social behavior."
good,"Each night starts by setting the pace and agenda for my teams. "
good,I worked for Macy's for 4 years and it took 3 to finally get a promotion and the ironic part is that I liked the job better before the promotion. The work is fun but Holidays are crazy and the work hours are unstable.
good,This job challenged me a great deal.  I came into this job thinking it was going to one of the easiest jobs ever.  Well I wrong and I was pushed to work hard and fast every day and I thank my manager for that because it made me the best sales associate I could ever imagine to be.
good,"A typical day at work is spent developing product knowledge for customers. A large portion of our clientele live in the area or in the building, so when they shop with us, they have a general idea of what they are looking for. Another large portion are tourist who often need something out of necessity or the item they want is less expensive or exclusively available here. Both parties depend on us to know what they need, how to find it, when, and where it's available.  "
good,"was a nice place to work, with very nice people. was a little disorganized but fully equip with everything needed to get the job done."
good,I loved working at macys when things got business we all camed together as one
good,"The truck arrives at 6 am; the afternoon crew begins unloading the truck for the evening crew to prepare the merchandise and place on the floor."
good,Great Place to work there is always something to do I enjoy the interactions with customer on a day to day basics because you have those loyal customers something new everyday plus a goal so it make you work other than that I enjoy my work place and coworker love management always there  which Is great to let you know how to build from where you started to become  better person
good,"people are great to work with, well at least in macy's queens mall store. i am working there for about 2 months, and i there was not a single time that i felt the managers are on my neck, which i did so in my other jobs. however i do see much growth potential. and considering the size of the business, their wages could have been higher"
good,"Each day was good, except for slow times. During the sales, the busiest times associates were all running chasing shoes for customers/clients. During this time, all purchases were pushed for goals and competition was always keen. Cleaning up after a long day was the most tasking, some associates didn't want to pull their share of the load."
good,"i was working there as a seasonal employee @ downtown san francisco. "
good,"I am assigned to a dept in which i am responsible to scan merchandise and sign all merchandise that is on sale."
good,I had a great department manager to start my position here. i learned all policies within first day and was set training other seasonal workers the following business day in all policies/procedures. my next manager was a bit more challenging to work with as i was not guided as well in how to succeed. my coworkers were great in managing to get the work completed and teaming up to ensure all was done well.
good,Working with poorly trained associates that are not fashion savvy and lack the customer service the company renders. Short of help to REALISTICLY exceed sales and customer service expectations. Managers display favoritism. Lack of emphasis on assisting with career advancement
good,"Work is fun when you have the right manager and supervisor."
good,"Enjoyed working with Macys on a flexible schedule.  The best part of working was being in control of your own schedule.  Enjoyed the customer service and cashiering aspects of the job."
good,I love that you can practically choose when and at what time you work. It's a great place to work at if you are a student looking for a part-time job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Focus on each customer as if they are the only one."
good,"It's corporate retail.. Up and downs hours. I train new employees, scheduling, visuals and floor sets and supervise employees."
good,"Responsible for increased sales through use of aggressive citywide marketing campaign and more attractive department layout.  Daily operations included cash deposits and inventory control.  Designed more attractive merchandise presentation strategies and special marketing campaigns, resulting in increased store traffic and profits.  Trained sales staff.  Increased store inventory and expanded merchandise purchases.  Responsibilities included purchasing, merchandising, customer service, and all facets of running a department store."
good,"Fast paced, challenging, and always giving back to the community. I learned the importance of showing others how their job essentially relates to outside work life, provided that candid correlation. I worked with co workers who were helpful, and was always challenged, in which is a great thing."
good,Macy's has a fabulous culture and excellent business plan that is setting it apart from other retailers.
good,It was exciting to plan events at Macy's and I enjoyed the exciting job culture.
good,"My job involved serving customers as far as help with their selection of jewelry and completing the sale at the cash register.  There were several bays in this large department, and responsibilities were on a rotating basis with the other co-workers.  Mostly, I circulated out on "
good,"Fun environment, but busy busy busy. So busy that your break might get cut short because lack of employee coverage."
good,Helping customer find what they need. Being friendly to everyone. Putting out the new stock. Making sure merchandise is all out and looks good to buy.
good,"The organisational body of the company is trustworthy. I mostly enjoy working with my peers, they are very supportive and i have a phenomenal staff, which makes my job comfortable."
good,I love being in cosmetics. I have learned a lot working here and want take these tools and use them to grow within a cosmetic company. The one draw back from working for Macy's is the pressure to open over 20 rewards accounts a month.
good,"Cashier"
good,"It would be slow at times but it would it would busy around closing time."
good,A typical day at work consisted of cleaning up and organizing the section I was in be it children's or shoes. I also used the register and checked people out. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that were having a good day and were just super enjoyable to be around.
good,Work was very fast paced and phones were constantly ringing. I learned the switchboard operation and transferring calls using the computer. Management was great. They were always there to answer questions and coach us when needed. My co-workers were great as well everyone was friendly and always willing to help when needed. We worked together as a team. The hardest part of the job was being able to stay calm when angry customers were cussing and calling me names because of a store situation that was out of my hands.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get customers the right department they needed and knowing that they told me I did a great job providing them with the correct information.
good,"Unloading boxes off trucks and packing boxes and separated into sizes and departments. Repriced wrongly priced clothing changed out the sale signs on the display racks and to put security tags on clothing."
good,"enjoy the physical part of the job most."
good,"Interacting with different customers daily, Really creates the exciting work environment."
good,I enjoy working with others and enjoy the challenge of dealing with customers and succeeding the goals set for me by management such as sales and etc.
good,"Job which is on call to arrange clothing in its proper place be it folded or hanging on a rack. Management though not shown enough in the short temporary months my position allowed, no comment. Rush hours when customer bustle in through the clearance racks dropping clothing as well as misplacing them all throughout the two story store. Easy job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I would clock in then start immediate. after that i would check the fitting room. assist customers to find clothing.
good,"As a security guard you learn to do everyone's job and then how to check and make sure they are doing their jobs correctly, as well as having to do your own duties. Management always was willing to work with you on the job and get you moving as soon as you came in the door."
good,"For the most part and enjoyable working environment, located in a mall so that has its perks and downfalls. I learned how to comfortably use a store merchandising system to change sale prices, add new inventory, etc... I liked being able to sell fine jewelry pieces, but I didnt like having to unpack new inventory in the watch/costume jewelry department. The POS system was easy to use/understand. Management was very good, critical but good."
good,I learned many skills here that are invaluable. Fashion Bug was the foundation to my career and I will always be grateful. I met many amazing people and not only consider them colleagues but friends.
good,people are nice. hours were very few.told they had a permanent position for me that was lies.had to do inventory for the store that was intense.
good,"I love macy's for the nice clothes at an affordable price due to being an associate. I also love the culture, it fun and they always employ plenty of beautiful women. My only complaint is they can't really pay you what you are worth. Everyday i come in I make them $3,000 on an 8 hour shift and I am also really good at opening credit cards. Macy's makes a ton of money off credit cards, people owe them for life. But I get paid like, $2 per credit and every month the number goes back down to 0 so I never really get credit or paid for all the cards I've opened. And I only get paid $9.50.... So they make alot of money off of me."
good,"Typicak day at Macy's is busy. Management was nice and understanding. I enjoyed work with my co-workers. The hardest part is fast pace + a lot of responsibilities, but it's very possible. If you want to work for Macy's you have to be a hard-worker."
good,"I love working for excellent managers and team players. I learned more information on cosmetics products. met all cosmetics managers and store managers for the Florida Mall, Orlando, Florida."
good,"Worked the sales floor and the register to make sales enjoyable to the customer. learned how to use registers, hand bag sales, jewelry sales. Being seasonal gave me the opportunity to work different departments which was great."
good,"maintaining the highest standard of cleanliness in compliance with company protocol in all areas including multiple levels of selling floors and departments, offices, break rooms and restrooms."
good,"Good employee discounts. Early hours. on your feet all day, short breaks"
good,Is alright to work at Macy's. You get to see the new clothes that are coming.
good,I love Macys but work/life balance in retail business. A typical day at work is supporting management with every day fucntions
good,"Associates in the department are knowledgable, fun, and artistic. There is always something new to learn in the cosmetic department."
good,a nice environment to work at new experiences . fun and a lot to learn good place to start your working life.
good,Being able to interact with the customers is such joy and being able to spread magic to their lives when shopping at Macy's
good,Working in a friendly environment is the most fulfilling. It's a team effort everyday to push sales on an individuall effort. Management and co-workers alike are excellent people to work with.
good,Working with at-risk youth is  rewarding and requires dedication
good,I assisted customers in finding the right shoe and size. I did enjoy learning about shoes. You were almost like your own boss. Managers were only around when they needed to be and had you use your judgment on how to handle things.
good,"Macy's was a good part-time while attending school. the benefits were pleasant, you get to see the discount merchandise first. i learned a lot from inventories to customers service"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's provides invaluable exposure to people.  If a person is looking to engage with others or improve their customer experience services then this is a great place to start.  They have a very diverse market which allows you the opportunity to meet with many different cultural backgrounds.  Being apart of this team will significantly enhance your people skills as well give profound sociological insight not only in your own community, but of those around the world.  Many travelers come specifically to Macy's and the stories you hear are the ones you take with you forever."
good,I liked working at Macy's because it taught me how to be close to customers but not get into there personal life i like the fact that i knew my customer was walking out happy. My co-workers were the best we help each other out and we made sure we worked as a team. The reason why I loved Macy's is because everyone was close over there we worked together and got along with everyone.
good,work was always fun but i was their for the season then let go.
good,"a typical day of work consisted of going to your respected department and immediately jumping in where needed, be it register or grabbing what product had been left laying around and putting them back in the respective places. Most of the time its hard to make really strong, genuine friendly connections with co-workers due to the sales goal and in some cases double commission goal for others. Though I have no problem thriving in a competitive workplace, unfortunately I feel it leaves some with what should be a natural consideration for others. Even with this I've always enjoyed the constant changing of environment, the need for quick responses and the satisfaction of helping out a friendly and appreciative customer."
good,"Definitely liked working somewhere different for once. Opened my eyes to a lot. If I could get paid mrs to work here, I'd be there in a heart beat!"
good,"A typicle day would be to greet, assist, and checkout coustomers."
good,Was my home for a lot of years . I felt comfortable there. The building the culture especially around the holidays.
good,Making people happy is well worth it. I have only worked there a month but have enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"sales associate roles were changed, worked as a flotar, in different departments,mens,women's clothing and shoes, coats bags and perfuem. i sold everything and got a better sense of style handeling different products."
good,"I have only been here a very short time. But so far a typical day includes recovering the floor, assisting customers and ringing customers up."
good,"Cleaned floor"
good,Management really cares. easy to move up if you do your work. customers are fun and love to shop
good,Macys mangement seemed to be all over the place.  Took forever for them to respond to a page.  Customers were rude.  Only good thing about the job is being able to pick up extra on your own inside of their online scheduling system.
good,Nice clean environment to work in. Good customer experience.
good,"Great people to work with. "
good,I like the interaction with the customers. A lot of the people who shop at macy's are foreginers and i like learn about where they are from.
good,I didn't work here long due to the fact that the hours were bad and the management sucked. I was thrown into a dog eat dog retail atmosphere and never met a manager the whole time i worked there
good,Arrive at work and get straight to work such as checking or folding clothes. My co-workers were quite friendly. Hardest part of my job would be having to finish go-backs at the end of the night because there would be so many. Most enjoyable part of the job would be helping customers when they needed it.
good,"Product Knowledge responsible for selling products to customers."
good,Not enough interaction with clients during the busy days. Pay was not enough for what they wanted you to do.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,The job was good. You come in meet your goal and enjoy the day.
good,"A typical day at Macy's would be working in the men's department fitting men for dress shirts, selling various top label clothes, sizing and fitting men for shoes and suits, and taking and recommending exchanging's. While working here I learned everything about men's clothing. I came into Macy's knowing nothing and picked up everything a I went.  The hardest part of my job is when women come in and shop for a man and have no idea the dress shirt size or blazer size they are looking for. I have to try and gather all the information I can about the person they are shopping for and go from there."
good,"it was an amazing place to work, especially since I was only there for the seasonal time."
good,"Work environment is fast paced but well organized. Being located in downtown San Diego's famous Horton Plaza, allows for the interaction with customers from various parts of the world for it is a popular tourist stop. The pay is based on draw back so making high sales is important. "
good,My current position is Administrative Support Team Associate. I do human resources and cash office. I have learned so much more about the hiring process and how to manage a cash office. On a typical day I answer phone calls and distribute the correct information to the correct people in a timely manner. I go over applicants for the next day and disposition the applicants for the current day. I organize and file the applications. I access the appropriate reports and distribute. I do I balance the vault and replenish the registers with the correct change. My co-workers are awesome. My supervisor is very easy to work with and is very helpful when I need a day off. There are 3 people on our team. So I would say the hardest part of my job would be the communication since we are always passing each other. The most enjoyable part is that; although I do basically the same tasks day to day it is still different and always changing. 
good,"When  I come to work I have to run the morning meeting reports, Update the manager stats board and our customer delight board. Take all in coming calls from employees or customer that are calling with questions or concerns.  Open both cash offices balance the vaults and replenish registers in both building as needed.

Update any time edits and or corrections for the managers and associate. Distribute all incoming mail to appropriate areas. "
good,To complete sales is a typical day on the job I learned how to promote and how diversity is a challenge as a sales associate.The management was very cooperative with assisting with sales. The hardest part was clients whom prefer to shop lift. It was enjoyable to make a complete sale in commission sales 
good,I have no desire to review Macy's. I love Macy's New York. Macy's Ohio is completely different. 
good,"job was good back in 2009, but since all the cut backs seems like 1 person does five peoples job. the economy has made them cut down"
good,"What I learned on the job was that the Macy's staff was very friendly, particularly the human resources department. After the first day, I did not feel like a stranger. Overall, I had fun working and being a team."
good,"its a company that you would think looks highly into customer satisfaction, but that's secondary compared to making sure that the numbers they want get out. it is a company with room for advancement. "

good,"Early morning shift was the best, I would have loved to have more work hours, co-workers were very agreeable."
good,"On a typical day i would sell clothing to customers. i learned different ways of communicating with customers, how to help in different situations. I often learned about new things through other coworkers rather than from my manager. my co workers are diverse and most are hard working but others slack off. the hardest part of my job is dealing with my co workers who dont pull their weight. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers get just what they were looking for when they came in. "

good,A good place to meet interesting people. Also a good way to network.
good,I've learned how to deal with various types of people and quickly and calmly problem solve.

good,"Working at Macy's , was a great experience . Meeting new people . Management was very nice they actually know you by your name ."
good,"I have worked a couple of different shifts for this company, they were both interesting. The managment team is very close and responsive, the co-workers are very aware and help out when needed. The hardest part of this job is the pay, and the most enjoyable part are the customers"

good,It was fun and exciting. Was able to meet new and diverse people from different backgrounds.
good,"Macy's is a good company. I've learned to communicate more with people and help customers. The management at the Macy's I work at is ok. My coworkers are great, love working with them. Hardest part of the job is maintaining the departments clean all the time because it can get busy and messy. One minute Im fixing clothes and 5 minutes or less later it's a mess again. Enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers and work with my coworkers."
good,This job is long hours of standing and walking.
good,"Enjoyed learning about all types of Fine Jewelry. My co-workers were great, and very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers. Finding out what they were buying for, anniversarys, birthdays, weddings. The hardest part of the job was inadequate training."
good,i wanted to grow but it didnt happen so i left. its just not the store for me maybe someone else would love it. they dont care about you as an employee
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day would have been just like every other day. Meet different people, try to help them if needed on what they are looking for. Socialize a bit with others. Here what they think about products."
good,Its a great place to work if your in a major store like 34th St. and Roosevelt. But in small stores like sunrise mall very little room for moving up in the company.
good,its a nice job to work at with good pay had fun working the dock the manager was some what a good one the work day there wasn't that long
good,"Everyday at work was always something new. The only thing I would do everyday that was the same was picking up the sales floor and putting out back-stocked merchandise. Depending on the amount of merchandise on the sales floor at a particular time, I might have to rearrange the floor to accommodate new merchandise, yet still create a smooth transition from brand to brand."
good,I worked in the make up department so that was always fun. I didn't like working alone all day sometimes because it would be boring and I would be standing there alone. I did like making women look pretty and selling them a great fragrance.
good,sales floor helping customers out. helping people find what they need.
good,"A typical day at work might be slow steady pace. Easy going, but there is always something to keep moving, such straighten you area and keeping it presentable for customers. You learn patience and to deal with any kind of situation dealing with customers and their concerns and questions. Co-workers are very respectable and fun to be around. The most enjoyable part is knowing your customer walked away happy with their purchase."
good,this job was exciting and payed well i would love to continue a career there .
good,"Visual Merchandising is a great department at Macys which provided regular 9-5 weekday hours, allowing me the weekend to be mine. Loved working with my manager. Loved the unpredictable trend forecasting that occurred every month."
good,"Overall it was a great experience. Had lots of fun working with customers, interacting with them on a daily basis. I love retail, but the management team wasn't the best. Not going into details but they need to get rid of a few managers,"
good,"a typical day at work in the fragrance departmenat was to help customers find products that they could give as gifts... informing the customer about the product , finding itiems within their buget, and listen to what the customer needs were and giveind the best services were what I enjoyed most.... The management was open to suggestion . My co -worker were friendly, but could use some training on customer services, they should partiality to some of the customers."
good,"I enjoy my job and all of the things that I have learned. As far as management it needs some work, there is no follow throigh and lack of communication."
good,"It's a fine place to work. A typical day at work was busy. I've learn a lot. Management was okay. Co-workers were sometime difficult, but this is more evident of the area the sales person works in and thhe strategy in how their manager leads the team."
good,"A Typical day would be perpareing for store opening. Checking schedules,Money counts.Checking e-mails, call outs,making sure Depts and the store was set and ready for opening.Greeting and meeting the Public, Outstanding Customer Service. you learn everything that has to do with Customer sevice. Co-worker were great and we all work as a"

good,Great Place to work with lots of opportunities. Great exposure to multiple facets of the fashion industry.
good,A typical day would be watching the cameras looking for shoplifters. A exciting day would be finding a shoplifter and catching a shoplifter. Learned that timing is everything and to have patience. Management is helpful. Co-workers were easy to work with although teamwork lacked. The hardest part of the job meeting the quota for the month. The most enjoyable part of the job was catching a shoplifter and saving merchandise.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Great job, over all its a good place to be for a second Job or part time"
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and interacting with my co-workers. A typical day was very busy due to Holiday sales.

At day at Macy's consist of Making a connection with customers assuring that they are receiving excellent customer service as well as all savings. I learned that there are different ways to approach customers based on there needs. I think the most enjoyable part for me is helping the customer and making sure they are satisfied.
good,- A typical work day is busy setting up cosmetic counter for appointments for the day
good,I don't know if I had a better all around job. It could be the location but management was great
good,"A typical day is going in and seeing and talking with your co-workers, see who is taking care of what, and taking everything from there, handling things as they come and changng this up if needed or advised."
good,"It was a good place to work. The people were nice. Pay was mediocre and the hours were long, especially around the holiday's or major sales."
good,Good retail job with a lot of flexibility with scheduling. I loved my co-workers and management was okay.
good,"I've had a great opportunity to work in a permanent position in a department and a flexible position. Both worked well for my needs at the moment, I enjoy getting to know all departments, co-workers and making great connections while transitioning into the DFW area. There is pretty much always something to do and learn in each department with products - type, care and value. During the very slow moments it's great networking with customers and co-workers. I enjoy the networking the most. The hardest is standing long hours and constant moving on really busy days, but it helps pass the time and I feel really productive."
good,"A typical day at work would be a fresh start with a cup of coffee, and greeting everybody as I walk in. Coming to work with a positive attitude."
good,"I've held three jobs here and in each role I've enjoyed working with my peers. The culture is fun, diverse and creative. This place is really fast past both in store and the corporate office. If you can keep up with the workload you would avoid a lot stress. Your expected to be sharp and productive worker. If you are a lazy person who want to glide by in their job than this is not the place for you."
good,Must not mind working long hours on your feet.
good,Great place to be hwlping customers and learning new things everyday
good,"Loved working with coworkers, fun, vibrant team. However, pay was not great."
good,"A typical day is greeting each customer we saw. Assistant them with their purchases. Listening to their needs while building a relationship for a return customer. I learned that you need to multitask in order not assist your customers. Management basically left the Specialist of a department alone because we were capable to display the new merchandise, assist out customer, and phones and ring up the sales while be professional and courteous."
good,"My thoughts on working for Macy's were great experiences, that fact I was in school at the time the work schedule conflicted when my schedule. I would recommend someone to work for this company."
good,"Great place, good atmosphere, and all the managers are nice and do not have a problem looking out for employees."
good,Macy's has a great environment and attitude. However advancement is a little bit difficult and discouraging if you are a flex team associate.
good,great place to work. great team of people. very nice place.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I'll start my day at 6am by going to the office and getting a scanner.Then going to my department (kids department) and seen how big or small my truck is.Then i usually have one co worker or none working with me.After that i'll separate my merchandise by brands and put them out on the floor untill im done with my truck.The hardest part of my job is finding hardware for my fixture.And the enjoyable part is getting my work done and helping the customers with any questions.
good,"Its a good place to work, good employee discount and people are nice. Need alot of patience for this job and easy to learn"
good,Macy's is a GREAT place to gain work experience. The managers or friendly and willing to work with you. They treat you like family and dont badger you as long as you do your job.
good,"At work I learned that not all customers should be treated the same, once you learn who your daily shoppers are it will be a little easier to understand what they are looking for, and for customers that do not seem familiar, approach them with a positive attitude and that you know what you are talking about. The managers at Macy's were very enthusiastic and sometimes helped employees if they did not understand how to do a certain task if they were new. The hardest part of the job was telling the customer that we do not have a certain item on floor or in stock. The part that I most enjoyed while working at Macy's was being able to help the customer find what they were looking for and leaving satisfied!"
good,Enjoyed helping customers. I enjoy helping others and being around people
good,Hardest part of the job was selling people credit cards.I liked that they have sales all the time but some of the older employees were unwilling to help and very rude.
good,Overall nice place to work changes could be made but every system has flaws
good,"If I have an opening shift, the first thing I do is put in the trash, open the registers and attend the morning rally. Once that is over, if they're is stock, I start working on stock. Opening boxes and putting away the merchandise (perfume) that we receive. I've learned new cashier programs. The hardest part of the job is working with limited merchandise. I love working with my co-workers. They are great team players. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and give them excellent customer service."
good,Sales consultant worked closely with customers needs. Cashier work handled and balanced register.
good,"the management team was great and very accomidating, a few weeks after i started working there i had to have surgery and they were great about giving me the time off i needed and having the position open for me when i got back."
good,It's not a bad place to work. If you didn't know sales Macy's will make sure you learn it.
good,"I was a fragrance counter manager. I checked sales, and helped with customers. There wasn't much to it. I dresses up for work everyday in a suit and tie, and helped people decided which fragrance they wanted. I didn't have much interaction with the upper management. It was calm and fun environment.. I met lots of great people and enjoyed working directly with customers."
good,"Flexible company with diverse staff. Quick advancement, great team work, and long term employees."
good,it was a good place to work recieveing dock was a good workout and will call i got to be my own boss with decent pay
good,Macy's is a very good company to work for. They truly appreciate their employees.
good,A typical day involves working hard to solve many problems to make the customers happy; number one priority.
good,Working and engaging with customers with the opportunity to be yourself as well as provide fashion advice was fun. The environment was all about customer interaction and making things presentable. There wasn't anything hard about working at Macy's the only challenge was making sure every customer was satisfied.
good,I love working at a fast pace while working at Macys. A typical day at work will be going to each section of the store to make sure neat and clean. I learned that customer service is the most important part about any job. The most enjoyable part of my job is that you meet new people everyday.
good,Macy's
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I loved my job but was unhappy with the accomendation with schdueling. I was already a full time student when hired with a current class schduele so work took an unfortunate backseat due to the lack of flexability.
good,"It had a very busy and productive culture, but it didn't offer me enough hours while i was working there. The managers we're generally helpful and easy to talk to. The most enjoyable park of the job was being able to help out the customers."
good,I enjoyed working for Macys but in my opinion i was not getting paid enough.
good,Fast paced fun environment. Company believes in promoting from within. A lot of room for growth.
good,"The best time of the day, when you have a guess who is really happy, because you help her."
good,"Macy's is an extremely demanding job description, both physically and mentally for its management staff. We are responsible for several areas simultaneously, with very limited staff at all times."
good,my first job and i loved it.. It now has me seeking more jobs in the retail/clothing department.
good,Great experience from the standpoint of the challenging presented in the location I worked. 3 level building in a thriving mall. Store produced sales in excess of 65 million dollars. Fast pace
good,i like working at macys but i need a better pay job to maintain my family
good,"Management was especially fair and helpful and making your own schedule (the flexibility) was nice. Overall, it was a great place to work."
good,it was an good experiences working at Macy's. Everyone was respectful.
good,"It's a great place to work, the environment is nice. Management has been a little rocky. Your hours can be all over the place. There are fun events to be a part of and they make you feel welcome as an employee."
good,"I love my job at Macy's. "
good,Not a bad place to work if your doing sales they will push you to sell macys cards. When I worked there the wages weren't the best but I'm sure there has been an increase on pay.
good,"the job environment is OK, very nice coworkers. management needs improvement: their system to pickup the schedule is very confusing . they keep hiring people without having open positions ."
good,"Frankly, I think I should be PAID for the time this exercise is taking!!  But I see that I have a 150 character minimum, so I will fill this space until I reach 150 characters."
good,I enjoyed working in my group very much. Great team work and camaraderie. Good communications within the group and from my immediate management. Our group was able to focus on what we had to get done and were able to consistently get it done.
good,"Working at Macy's was lots of fun. Managers are very helpful and nice. I learned a lot from my co-workers and managers. I am a people person, so I enjoyed enteracting with the customers and helping them. I like the company culture. The reason I left : pay is not good, commuite (25 miles) from my house and my shopping habits.Overall, it is good"
good,Macys was one of my favorite jobs. The people in my department were nice and we became family. Management wasn't the best. It was very difficult for them to communicate with us
good,"It was nice working at Macy's and getting a good experience and a lot of things to learn. Nice management, flexibility for students, helpful colleagues."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As seasonal security, my job was to greet customers at entrances and deter possible thieves. I however had no ability to stop or impede thefts in progress."
good,"It was fine working there but if you wanted more hours you would have to sign up immediately after schedules came out, overall a good experience and you had a paid break"
good,Nice place to work while going to school. They work with your school schedule.There are some great manager's that will help you grow if you want to. You learn a lot about the business.
good,"Unorganized, manger only used me when the people that been working there longer calls off. Would called me in last minute or an hour before so I would have to rush to work"
good,"Great retail environment, with the best work-life balance in the retail industry. Must be self-motivated to learn and grow. Training is an opportunity. But overall simple onboarding."
good,"Honestly, working in the beauty department is a much different experience than the other departments. It's more fun. You have more freedom but you also have sales goals that you need to me and depending on the location, you may find yourself struggling."
good,When i was working there from my personal work experience i can say it was worth the money they was giving me and I also enjoyed coming to work as well
good,There is a reason why Macys has withstood the test of time. There attention to customer satisfaction is second to none. Advancement with the company is fairly easy as well and there is a great mixture of veterans and new blood on most teams.
good,"Fast pace. Friendly environment "
good,"I would not leave my job unless for a family sick leave."
good,"Working at Macy's was enjoyable. Employee turnover is low and support was high. As a seasonal worker, I was well trained and treated with respect. The staff was helpful and friendly. I eanted to stay, but was released early February.  There were no openings."
good,I loved working at Macy's. Macy's was always a childhood dream of mine to work there. The job itself was very diverse. I loved it a lot. The hours were very flexible. My co workers were also very nice.
good,"I worked friday, saturday and sunday 12 hours a day loading trailers with merchandise going out to them."
good,I really dislike working every weekend and getting only 12 to 15 hours naturally on your schedule but if the managers like you and you work good..always on time.. they will find shifts for you.. this I also disliked . But my managers were very supportive friendly and encouraging!!!.. I enjoyed them all😍😍
good,Pretty good job I recommend people working there only if people are willing to work only the days they give. It’s hard to find some days because then it gets to a point where people need to ask other people for there days and it’s hard for us
good,"The macy's that im working at is pretty chill for the most part. The work days usually go fairly quickly since im working in the back, away from the customers and there doesnt seem to be any pressure to rush to get the job done quickly since they focus more on doing the job correctly. My co workers are very friendly and help you out if you ask for it. Overall, i recomand trying macys out."
good,I liked working there but it was really boring doing the same thing every time I worked there the best thing was being able to pick when I work.......
good,"I think they we should get paid atleast $10.00 an hour. I am a great working and whenever and whatever they need of me it's done. I love working in fulfilment, we are responsible for getting the packages out."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Everyone working for Macy’s must be a team player, available and ready to take lead to help manage a smooth ordering process and customer experience. Must have good communication skills, mathematical skills, listening skills, and motivation. Working for Macy’s teaches you a lot about detail orientation, paying special attention care to customers needs and wants for a certain product. Here at Macy’s you need to help a well rounded mind and must be informed about products and where they may be at in the store."
good,"The job is pretty simple if you know what you are doing. The stress level is low and on the busiest days time passes quickly. While i do have two managers, i am not under constant supervision. During the holiday season things become busy at the same time fun."
good,Overall I feel Macy’s is an OK place to work and would work there again part time or seasonal. Like any job there where pros and cons but the good outweighed the bad !
good,"Merchandising Specialist (seasonal)"
good,Loved being there but it was hard work not easy schedule my age was factor but i was doing the job supervisor were great driving out was tough meet great people learned more areas loved vto days
good,"Macy’s promotes growth, inclusion and diversity. The benefits are better than anywhere I have worked in the past but the pay is not on the level of other retailers."
good,They were good to work for. Most people had a good attitude and worked well as a team. This was only part time work and I had only seasonal job as floor sales person.
good,"At first, everyone looks at you like competition but once they get to know you its fine. Employees were telling ,e false information or were very territorial, HR sucks and doesn't reprimand, management is very shady, asks you to come in extra hours."
good,"Motivating and fun. Liked management and co- workers. Diverse workplace"
good,I loved working at Macy's. It is a fun atmosphere with wonderful staff and management. Great one on one learning opportunities with management in order to fulfill your goals.
good,"If you're considering working here I STRONGLY suggest you get into the ""Home Department, 2nd shift"" every other department will have you on your feet for 10 hours constantly walking on a very hard concrete floor. "
good,I enjoyed the job only because it kept me up to date as far as fashion goes. I loved to shop & be the first to buy clothes for the new seasons so that was a big piece to the puzzle of why I stayed for as long as I did.
good,"I enjoyed the different types of things that you needed to learn in order to be successful at this job (in addition to the future). They also had a lot of bonuses to keep up motivation. However, LITTLE TO NO opportunity to advance to management!"
good,colleagues are lazy and don't clean up after themselves or follow simple instructions such as breaking down boxes which in turn makes it harder on you when you are trying to pick an item that is buried by 6-7 empty boxes that often have a tendency to fall into the middle of the small aisle.
good,Decent place to work. Wages start low and hours aren't that great during big sales but scheduling system does allow for some flexibility if people pick up your shifts. A good company to work for to gain experience in retail.
good,I liked working at Macys I had a great team of people working at my department and over the years we become a family really high pace job and unfortunately if you have a family its hard to balance working nighst and weekends specially when you have a small children.
good,The colleagues are exceptional!  Advancement is possible yet being compensated equal to efforts in non managerial roles can be a struggle.  Overall I joyed working here my 2 negative marks are wages and some of upper managements lack of store operations.
good,Backstage is an outlet store inside Macys. The fast pace environment is a pleasure to work in and serving the community with special events. Although it's a great place to work there is no room for advancement.
good,Management left us seasonal employees alone on Black Friday.  Was a very stressful day.  I guess they had had enough of the holiday shopping season and went home early.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Great for people with little work experience. They do brief training, but the employees are very helpful. Most employees have been there for years and know what they are doing, although sales can be a bit competitive. All you really have to do is engage customers, try to get them to buy things, and clean up/straighten your work area. Pay is decent, could be better. Management is nice. PTO is difficult to earn. Breaks are generous. Dress code is business casual. There is room for advancement."
good,"It is hard work at a store with many customers who needed or wanted products and attention.  I enjoyed helping the customers, learning the product information so I could do so, and representing my store."
good,Management in the store I worked at are very supportive! It was a overall great experience working at Macy’s. They’re are flexible with work availability as well but I had to work almost every weekend.
good,"(This review is for the  jewelry and subscription box ""beauty box"" areas of Macy's warehouse, in South Sacramento) There is no AC, and when the weather is hot, that warehouse is torture. Horrible anti theft policies. You have anything with metal? That being anything from buttons to jewelry etc you can't get into that certain department. You have pockets? You have to sow them. No phones. Cant bring dark liquid drinks. Cant leave that department with any liquids in your drink, so they make you dump your drink in a small garbage bin that has been collecting everyone's drinks and bodily fluids. YUK!  AP think they are hot stuff, specially the AP managers. employees SHOULD not be forced to sow their clothes, Whats the point of the metal detectors? That department made me feel degraded and like a prisoner. Macy's needs to review a lot of their policies. They invest more of their attention to other things, not to hard working employees and their needs."
good,"The best part of Macy's was the scheduling website, which made it super flexible for your hours. During the holidays they would let you come in on days off if you needed the money and wanted to. Each department has a very different environment, some are better than others. Same goes for management. VERY pushy for credit signups but I had never heard of anyone getting more than a lecture over not getting any. Always a ton to clean and put away, and depending on coworkers it could be a lot as some people there don't do their share. Some customers are great and some are terrible as Sales Associates have little power at the register, so calling managers for help is a frequent occurrence. Overall, not a bad place, but does have its downsides."
good,Loved the job and working with people but they promote people that should not be in management. Should require managers to take a class on people management.
good,"I worked for the fullfilment center at that time and it was great! Good management and a chilled place to work..only time it got stressful was during holidays because of all the orders that came in, but this was by far the best retail place out of many that I worked at."
good,A fast pace working environment with constant cash and credit transactions. You provide customer service and aide people from all around the world. management is always available to help and solve day to day problems.
good,Macy's was a very exciting place to work which allows you to grow in areas needed to do your job.  Also working there it was always short of employees or help which took away from having a good experience as an employee.
good,"Even though it was hourly +commission in some departments workers stole customers,hogged the phones so they would be the only ones to get phone sales, & backhanded things like that. Management was aware & did nothing. + with Macy's return policy, if there was a sale the merchandise could be returned(which would result in the original seller to lose sales & the new seller to gain commission)"
good,"Fast working environment, strong management, reaching your goal for the night, training new employees, and making sure all your products are getting shipped correctly."
good,It's a fun job if you have a good team to work with. Busy days will be stressful and hectic and depends on location. Sometimes have to stay late after closing depending on how many customers there are. Occasionally have to run in order to respond to grab and runs. Management was good and great teammates.
good,"Holiday sales were great, staff was great , hospitality of having access to rest and have lunch in a nice clean lunch roomy.  The stock room was nice to retrieve shoes Thanks"
good,"While Macy's is a hectic and fast paced environment full of corporate rules and structures, it is still an amazing place to work.  The people/talent is unparalleled.  The devotion Macy's has for the community, diversity and inclusion is admirable.  While every day was not a happy one I was always proud and happy to be a Macy's employee."
good,"I only worked a seasonal position, but I loved it and got all the help I needed at anytime. It is a very positive atmosphere. Every once in awhile you can do overtime. Some mandatory and other voluntary."
good,"I like working here except for the amount of hours. Sometimes I will have 1 day for the week and sometimes 3 days. Otherwise, everyone is nice and the work is easy."
good,"It was a good working experience, loved the job, only reason i don't keep going back for seasonal is because its far from home."
good,For 8 years it paid my bills I had great work life balance and compensation was okay. I enjoyed being able to advertise shifts moving up in the company is a little hard . Management is okay to talk to I kind of miss my old job.
good,Working there was enjoyable but since I was seasonal there were times where they wouldn’t have enough hours and i would only work a little bit. But other than that it was a good company to work for.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Almost everyday the floors where busy and there is always something that can be done to make improvements. The managers were fair and reasonable not to mention they also try to work with you on your work schedule.
good,"off-loaded trucks.  Unpacked items and placed on racks to be dispersed"
good,"Unload trailers at an hourly rate or quota and place on pallets to be shrink wrapped and load on another trailer to be shipped out. Sometimes we are required to stop conveyor belt lines when there,s a jam in which a red light will be turned on until the jam is cleared."
good,This is a great job if you are a student or have multiple jobs. Very flexible scheduling and overall good environment to meet new people. they do have opportunities for management positions for current lower level sales associates.
good,The most enjoyable time working there was during the holidays especially Christmas. Just seeing the little kids faces while they are shopping for their parents are preciuos
good,In the Registry and Housewares department a number of employees have been with Macys for long careers which has made it an enjoyable learning experience.
good,"You learn how to deal with people from all walks of life, time management. Do have to handle multiple responsibilities but they are not unrealistic. Good discount on merchandise"
good,"On a typical day at work i would clock in and speak to management about what area i would be working in. I would unload boxes, pin security tags on clothes, or organize the clothing on the store floor. i learned that you have to have self motivation, patients, and be very quick pasted. the work place culture was very professional, and somewhat organize. the head manager was very professional and nice. the supervisors were very lazy and unprofessional. the hard part about the job would be stacking the clothes by brand and size."
good,"I liked my co-workers because they were nice people, I wouldn’t mind working there again and I am thankful for the experience they gave me as well as skills."
good,"A typical Day a work involves greeting every customer with a smile and making sure everyone feels welcomed and is attended to. The day starts with our morning meeting where we get rallied for the day and then its time to open . As an associate you must always maintain a presentable work environment for yourself the customer and your fellow colleagues. As we attend to the customer and make sales for the company we are also making sure we complete whatever daily tasks we have on hand, we do these until closing time."
good,I was only at Macy's briefly as an HR rep but my manager was competent and the environment and culture was fair. The task are straightforward and work was manageable.
good,"Macy's was an interesting place to work. Work started as soon as the doors opened. We serviced a variety of different nationalities. It was interesting learning some of the customs of the different cultures.The  co-workers were very nice and helpful in my department and of various cultures as well.  Management was alright for the most part, although they did come and go often.The hardest part of the job was keeping the displays stocked and neat."
good,My main duty was to enforce new rules to which coworkers were not very receptive to. Don’t know if it’s the education level or what but some were physically responsive to minor requests such as having to show is for receiving paycheck.
good,This is a great place for flexibility & making your own schedule pretty much. However I wouldn’t depend on it for your main income. It’s a fun place to work.
good,Very productive. Friendly coworkers that also help when they can. Loved working here. My manager was helpful and overall amazing. Got help any time I needed it.
good,"Macy's is a great organization with many opportunities for advancement and expansion into other positions including: security, logistics, data entry and management. Management is helpful and willing to work on employee development as well as foster a diverse workplace culture. Work is challenging yet rewarding and meeting goals as a team is a top priority. The hardest challenge is the overall lack of immediate advancement as positions for promotion are few and often far between."
good,I worked at Macy's during the holiday season and it would get really busy. Working at the customer service desk during the holidays sounds hectic but the coworkers and the managers were very helpful at all times. This job gave me more customer service experience. The workplace was very welcoming and so were the coworkers. I would highly recommend applying at Macy's.
good,"Management is fun everything gets done, They are pretty fair with a lot of things. The only hardest part with macys was just working in the handbag section. A typical day at work can either be fast paced or slow depends"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I have worked for Macy's for a number of years.  Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"Energetic and friendly work environment, but not for me. Fragrance gets little to no customers at the Cary mall and it got boring during shifts. Overall nice place!"
good,Very good experiences and family based structure work.system. learned alot and had opportunities to experience new things and better ways to do things in every day life.
good,It was a great place to work. The pay for lunch on holidays. Management is very flexible with hours. Only down side is they don't give out enough hours. Most co workers are easy to talk too & get aong well.
good,Macy's is good if you need a flexible schedule. I'm a full-time student and I make my own schedule as an On Call employee and you only need to do a minimum of 8 hours a month.
good,"Worked with 2 other loss prevention personnel, all was good, manager was very reasonable and always available.  Healthy competitiveness between employees. Worked for Burdines, which was later bought out by Macy's, a couple of years after I left.  The hardest part of the job was all the paperwork that needed to be completed when a shoplifter was apprehended."
good,"It was a cool experiencing, I got to see behind the scenes."
good,Macys was my first job the company worked quickly hiring me and worked around my school schedule. I quickly learned the ropes and became passionate about my job.
good,Always sent home early and no hours  only got 10 hours a week sometime 20 if i wasn’t sent home early cause they barely had any work and poor management
good,"Depending on the department you work, there is a decent work life balance which is healthy for the company. The hardest part of the job is the political climate where decisions for technology are based on politics and not what is best for the situation. What I love most is the team I have, working for a good boss always has its perks and having a good team is the best feeling."
good,"Working at Macy's provided me with a great back bone for rude customers. A typical day you'd be able to expect 3-4 very rude customers trying to argue with you over pricing, sales, or the product in general. My management team provided me with the skills I needed to be able to diffuse those types of situations as soon as they present themselves."
good,"Staff should be acknowledged more for their performance. Increase in pay for those who work later hours and are Bilingual."
good,I loved working st Macy's although it was very stressful sometimes. Especially during the holidays. But I enjoyed the team and managers. Always something to clean or restock.
good,"Very unorganized. Not enough hours, poor schedule. Would schedule people to work with nothing to do. Barely seen or spoke to managers. Would have to pick up shifts"
good,I worked at Macy's for two months during my High school for my credits and my paycheck for programming. I like how the programs can teach students to learn how to be in their jobs. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I like to organzine and making new friends. The hardest part of my jobs is dealing with customers who had anger issue for some reason. Because it's hard for me to handle them on my own. It's better I want to work with employees who are friendly and defensive.
good,"almost every day that I went to work.i went with a smile on my face"
good,"Everyone is great to work with. The ambiance is great for the location, and the workers are friendly and always there to lend a helping hand. Your go-to for top of the line products"
good,"Typical work day at At Your Service (AYS) - AYS is the work area where all customer returns, online orders and customer disputes are handled.  A typical is always heavy, lots of customers, complaints, etc.  I enjoy working with my customers and providing the best service that can be provided at all times."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys was overall a good place to work and experience. What I didnt like about macys was the low pay rate and the switching things around as often. The fun part about the job was i met new people and was about to interact with the customers.
good,working was a little stressful around holidays and made it a little difficult with lack of staff and even more when you didn’t speak the language of certain guest. But it was a great experience and you are able to joint the parade and other special events!
good,"very fast paced but the customers are loving and loyal"
good,"the pay wasn't really good. I quit to find other job with better pay, I am still doing shopping from there, I would recommended the job as first job for fresh graduates."
good,Call center is closed but it was very fast pace with many changes in a years time.  Work environment was friendly with many opportunities to work in different areas.
good,"I was there for 12 years. It went from Hudson's, to Marshall Fields, to Macy's. It seemed like every year more perks were taken away. I stayed there cause I worked another job and they worked with my schedule. I also got vacation and health benefits (at the time) for part time work which was really nice."
good,"If you are a morning person you will love being a merchandiser at Macy's. Early start, done by 3pm, plenty of time left for college, or the gym, or a second job."
good,"Macy's was my first job post-graduation. I worked at the Customer Service Center and accepted the job because I needed some sort of income. It is a good job and pays ok, but if you have a college degree like me, it will not provide you career satisfaction unless you are in a managerial role. Great benefits and the discount was ok."
good,i was only  part time sales associate and i can not form any opinion on Macys as a whole.  I only worked 15 hours a week.   i was heppy with the time i was working at MACYS.  Pay is just minimum wage.
good,Its a normal paced work environment with a busy work load as far as theft is concerned. Resources can be limited due to low staffing on a regular. Supervisor is great with working with you for personal days and the atmosphere is friendly with all staff members.
good,"You can learn quite a bit IF you really want to. That said, a couple months hands-on with a good supervisor prepares you for much of the (tedious) work. Great environment, clean (for the most part) bathrooms and lunch rooms. They even have a room to relax in if your feeling down that day. My favorite part of the job is the people though. Lots of interesting and genuinely good people working here. Never had a bad interaction with a fellow associate. We kinda understand we're in the same boat, so to speak."
good,"I enjoy working with the team, the working was challenging and its a learning experience working at Macys."
good,"Had a really good manager for my dept. Great guy, good temperament for all the stress he was under. My department was the least of his worries. My team mate and I took care of everything within our control. Ordering was done within our dept. Special orders were great. We could get the client pretty much what ever they wanted. Had one gentleman come in one day, said two beds he had purchased at Macys (9 yrs before) had been ruined in a flooding incident. He asked me if I could find out if they were still available or comparable item. Found the original purchase, thanks to Macys incredible record keeping. Ready to set him up with the most comparable set available. His wife walks up and says no Peter, I want somthing better. Did that day not see that coming! Great day, 365.00 bonus.                                                            "
good,"macy's is a nice place for work. i worked with a great people, nice team, very helpful manager . i had a good time and i learned a lot of things. i had a good time"
good,worked with 2 other persons in the sewing department . was not a pleasant experience. one of my coworker was not a very pleasant person. besides that was a decent place to work
good,"Culture highly depends on your manager, they have some amazing ones and some that are in way over their heads.  The company does little to help out or fix those managers that consistently prove they can't manage people well."
good,"Management and the actual job itself were great, but the pay was meh. Scheduling had a few hiccups but it was overall pretty decent. Very diverse team of employees."
good,Macys is an excellent place to work. I feel cared for and like my time and services matter and are appreciated. I have been working at Macys for a little over a year and have yet to get a raise.
good,"There was always something to do, and you usually had moving traffic. You did have your slow days, and your fast days, but there was always something to do on the sales floor."
good,"I worked my butt off there to get the job permanently. I stayed late, came in early and on my days off. Even came in when I was sick because they were short on staff. Also they still let me go. Plus they didn't let me know till 2 days before my schedule ended.  They said that they'd know the middle of February. They didn't tell me till the end of March. I'm pretty upset about that but life goes on."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"fast paced, great motivation, weekly recognition, room for advancement if you really wanted to grow within the company, competitive environment, achievable goals."
good,"Very team based, fast paced company to work for. They are big on loss prevention and teaching you how to spot shop lifters. I was only there seasonally for the holidays so obviously it was very busy. Not much independence or responsibility."
good,macys taught me a lot about the retail business and how a store is ran. being a task team member my job was to make sure the department stayed neat and not over crowded at the register
good,"I am a type person who always like to do something. The only busy days were Friday, Saturday the Holidays and sometimes Sunday. If you are old or even like slow pace environment then this is for you."
good,"Macys in a great Company to work for when you're just starting your professional career. This has been a great experience to work for such an awesome company. If you are looking for stability and a positive work environment, then this would be a great job."
good,It was a good experience everyone was nice but there was quite a bit of unprofessionalism. The pay was good and the management had a bad turnover rate.
good,Ever changing atmosphere but always provides a unique experience every day. Sometimes it can be stressful when there’s a sale or holidays but it’s overall a fun experience
good,Worked for Macy's for over 20 years.  Had the opportunity to work on the sales floor and back-of-house.  Fortunate to attend training seminars to extend my product knowledge. Was recognized for my achievements received awards and bonuses.
good,"Team was amazing, keeping the atmosphere alive. Hours weren't offered as much, but you can ask your coworkers. They were more than willing to give up hours."
good,"Overall macy's has a good environment. Managers do not care about employee request they just want to solve the problem quick and temporary. Those who work in commission department make more money.Over worked and over used. Do not become reliable, not at Macy's. You will get used beyond belief. I learned that it is a cut throat environment. Management doesn't care how the job gets done as long as it some how gets there. Not relaxed, constantly tending after others."
good,"I was quickly cross trained, enjoyed my coworkers, typical day started in one department and because of my drive and motivation i wanted to gain the knowledge and work experience to move ahead and offered to stay late most days, my managers took it upon themselves to ensure that i was trained and able to accomplish my daily goals along with challenged me to achieve more than just my daily expected work duties."
good,"Macy's:"
good,"The manager was always trying to accomplish the organization goals."
good,the job itself is not difficult but management is poor and very lacking when it comes to helping employees. if youve been their for years youre fine but new and starting out sucks.
good,"I worked with the Parade Crew, so it was extremely exciting and colorful. I really enjoyed the workplace culture. Since I only worked with Macy's for their Thanksgiving Day Parade (preparations and post-parade duties), my time with the parade crew was short and sweet."
good,While I was working with Macy's I had the opportunity to grow in my role based on new technology used in house and acceptance from management of making decision for my team.
good,"I loved my manager she was wonderful, she knew that we were adults and could work independently and effectively. We worked hard and fast in order to ready the store for the next day. We had fun though we all knew what we had to do."
good,"You get customers that are rude & some quite friendly. Regulations & rules are mostly not met. ""Privileged"" customers tend to get what they want just by a call of a manager. Store & department managers push their policies, yet brake them just because ""they didn't want to deal with the customers"", which makes the associate pushing the policy feel ""dumb"". Sometimes those same rude customers tell you ""You see, you just don't know how to do your job."""
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Team would come in staggered shifts or as a whole to process truck. I would check in with my manager to review tasks for the week and address any issues."
good,"Macy's is a work friendly environment. As a sales Associate you are able to work independently and always get help when the need arise."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy the factory environment. Not much room for advancement. The management team is not willing to work with their teams. In the interview your previous skills are not taken into consideration. They hr is only interested in filling the seasonal jobs.
good,the schedule was the most stressful..... no set schedule- that went away after last year and i learned about customer service and how to deal with all kinds of walks of life here.
good,"Management at our store cares about the employees and performs on a very professional level."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys, I liked the role I was in and I made a lot of friends working there. The discount was a nice bonus while doing what I enjoyed for a living."
good,"A pretty simple job, pay was decent and when peak time hits you have pretty much all of the hours you want. my only issue is that some shifts there will be basically no work and they start sending people home, other times there will be way too much work to get done in one shift, but thats just the nature of the business."
good,"On an average day I could help merchandise new products, help run our fulfillment center and help our visual merchandiser with various tasks such as changing mannequins and wall displays around the store."
good,I worked in a Starbucks kiosk but I was employed by Macy's I liked the Macy's discount and the independence we had. The hardest part was we were fully a Stabucks but certain restrictions we had for running on Macy's computer system.
good,"The management here was always helpful. Staff were treated very well and the work hours were good. Pay was not the best. The supervisors did not micro manage therefore you had to plan your work day accordingly."
good,"The atmosphere at Macy's Merch Group is great. The offices however are not up today. Pay could be better, but there is room to move. Management is great!"
good,"Macy's provided me the tools to explore retail, with the ability to share ideas and work towards being promoted to shop captain. Work days are usually busy, especially on week ends. Big sales drive in lots of customers, sometimes too much to be able to focus on each customer's needs. Short staffing issues which may be resolved in the future, as changes are being made.  Company has overall positive team spirit."
good,"Wasn't that great to work at. If you need a ob badly at okay then work there, but if you have other options go to them. The managers breathed down your neck for everything, sales, customers, etc, but would walk around doing nothing and only helping when it gets really busy. co-works gossip to much and to move up in the company you have to kiss butt."
good,Macy's is a great place to work. I learned a lot and enjoyed coming to work. The environment was positive and the employees were supportive. It was a joy coming to work.
good,"I don't remember much I Just remembered enjoying my time there. I remember the staff were really nice, so to say easy promotions, and the managers always looked out for me."
good,"I didn't work there long but I did like that everyone was friends or friendly with each other. Had I been there longer, I know I would've developed good work relationships with the people around me while providing exceptional service to Macy's customers."
good,"Worked with great people, customers were nice. Store shut down, maybe get better management? Nothing much else to say, great job for young people, especially while going to school."
good,"Good leadership from management, teamwork among sales associates, and flexible schedules made this a great place to work. I worked in men’s suits, and the other associates were very accommodating explaining our merchandise."
good,"-Fulfillment of online orders."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This company is a great place to work and keeps you on your feet. helps you improve your customer service skills. The hardest part about the job is customer satisfaction.
good,"Macy's is one of the leading retailers in the market today. Their online service provides many opportunities for customers to shop with their mobile devices and computers. The customer service department is kept quite busy with addressing questions and upselling and giving recommendations to their customers for sales. Additionally, their delivery service provides great convenience for their shoppers. One drawback for the company is constantly playing chess with the various departments in moving them to different locations throughout the world. This causes the workers to feel very uneasy about their jobs, many of which have had their positions for many years."
good,Great place to work and great opportunity for advancement. Enjoyed working alongside veterans and helping customers with a smile. Management team trained me to become a great supervisor Durning the holiday season and I felt confident.
good,The people in Loss prevention were great. Training was very informative. The job can be a bit stressful at times in the beginning but is very challenging in a good way.
good,Macy's was a great company to work with. They had a great team that got a chance to work with. The only thing is the long extended hours for holiday's. I absolutely loved working with beautiful jewelry.
good,As a part time employee my day goes by quickly because there is so much to do.  I've improved in my math skills because there are so many sales.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer with a purchase they are really excited about.
good,"On a regular day I am challenged by the management team to go out and ensure that our customers are having the best possible experience while also making sure that they leave with the best possible deal. I have learned that patience is very important to have because you never know what someone is going through behind closed doors. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with customers. We tend to get customers who have either been in our shoes or people who just let loose, those are the people who make my day."
good,"Fun and interesting for fashion buffs. A typical day starts with opening registers. Then, we look for items bought on-line to send out to customers. Then, the doors open and we have alot of customers. The day goes by fast because there are alot of things to do. Always something to keep busy. We fold items on tables. Reorganize merchandise when out of place. We constantly approach customers to ask if they need assistance in anything. Ordering sizes or colors we may not have on sales floor and etc. It feels good to be of help to others. I really liked my manager and the store manager I would like as a mentor, very approachable and considerate."
good,"Busy office, Great Staffs to work with. Management are fair - Team work rule/ There are lot of team work which is great ! sometimes challenging but manageable. Always open to learn new things. The greatest feeling is to able help someone and  make their day brighter and shiner. Which is always the magic of Macys."
good,"Nice team and friends to work with. No benefits for a personal option of me. But the management is very motivated, creative, and helpful.  It makes the environment excellent to develop good seles."
good,"It was uselly busy if not it was slow. They worked with my schedule since I still attend high school and participate in after school activities. Managers are friendly and understanding, everyday is different."
good,"The pay is super low for the amount of work you have to do. However, the managers are great and handles stress well. You will mainly be unloading trucks (depending what you get hired as) and scanning/sorting clothes."
good,"Don't care for the benefits. You are based on a point system. And everything goes through the online employee insite website. Have to have a device that runs a browser equal to a PC browser. If not you cant veiw your check stubs, can't open the my time off/PTO options, you can't use alot of the functions."
good,its a fast pace job and you have to be on top of everything. remember costumer are the number 1 priority. i learned how to deal with people better. a typical day at work can start  of slow and then pick up or it can be the other way around.
good,"Working as a Sales Associate at Macy's was my first job, and I truly believe everyone should consider getting a job in retail to give them experience in the sales industry. This opens up a lot of opportunities because I have acquired experience in sales."
good,I was looking for a short time job just to make a little money before school and Macy's was hiring people just for that very spot. They liked my work ethic and they offered me to come back if I needed another short term job.
good,"The typical day at work was kinda stressful but good at the same time cause you were getting paid but it was good. i learned that no matter what happens macys is there for you when you need help,& my hardest part of the job was they hours"
good,"You cannot expect to be employed here and not work...if you do not mind the fast pace, Macy's Woodfield is a fun place to work. Coworkers, though some may be crunchy, are a small family within each department. Management was fair and never unreasonable when I was there, but that was a couple of year ago. Growth is a very plausible option and based on merit, not necessarily years of service, which I found to be very fair. "
good,I was very disappointed to leave my job at Macy's Inc. I enjoyed the work environment and my coworkers. They also had a lot of team building events and mixers.
good,"Very fast faced, good place to interact with customers, new employees are not trained very well on the floor, training is only done on the computer but still a nice place to work, good employee to employee relationship. Managers are very flexible and understanding but work schedule is not permanent, very big turnovers, new employees tend to stay only for a short period of time, not able to work second job because of inconsistent schedule."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A typical day at work was standing guard where I was instructed. My visual presence helped to deter any theft. I learned about body language and behavior of shoppers. The management was fine. The workplace culture was typical of a retail store. The hardest part of the job was standing in one location. The most enjoyable part of the job was observing people.
good,"A typical day at work for me was to handle all monetary transactions per the computerized cash machine,, assist customers when needed, occasionally tidy up the work area and store, replenish items such as shopping bags and if needed, I would switch to another department."
good,"- Preserved location appearance; kept areas neat while working and return items to correct locations."
good,Get to meet all kinds of different people and the opportunity to work in other departments in the facility.  Then you could pick up extra shifts to work in other areas
good,During the seasonal holidays a typical day at Macy's was hectic.  I enjoyed getting the work experience and i learned a lot about sales.  The hardest part of this job was cleaning the dressing rooms.
good,"pay was well, I got a raise every 6 months after review. Strict on timing. Inventory was crazy. Not that fun of a work environment I will say its a mature work environment."
good,"I learned to work better as a team and how to manage the cash register with purchases, returns, holds, and deliveries. Everyday started with making sure that the clothing racks looked presentable and that if more stock was needed that it had to be brought out."
good,"Macy's respected employees and clients always nice. Without asking, I could leave my post to help others. Working possible in nearly every department. We felt like a co-working family."
good,Macys can be a highly competitive environment but also rewarding too. It's all about what you make it. So always bring your best self to work everyday
good,"days started early it was very busy, at times there were many markdowns that had to be finished and in a small amount of time had 8 people working on my crew, management needed to be more hands on to understand the job. the hardest thing about the job was the revolving door. the most enjoyable part about was the customers"
good,Assist consumer with checking out and informing them of current sales and promotions. Keep your area neat and clean and complete all tasks before going home.
good,Coworkers are very envious. It is a clean environment. The discount is okay.  Sometimes manageable but coworkers take advantage of other coworkers. Managers always busy.
good,"Company is very organized and has training for employees for all aspects to keep them safe and efficient.  Management was great, very positive experience.  Coworkers always friendly and willing to train you to make you a better employee.  Employees received a discount on store items.  Store offered flexibility with shifts and you could view shifts online and submit requests if you wanted someone to switch or if you wanted to pick up extra shifts."
good,Solid company feel like they are moving in the right direction. Incentives are being initiated for all associates. Continue tontake care of the associates and keep them engaged.
good,"Macy's is a enjoyable work site. I started with seasonal and they are bad with jon advancement when they told me they want keep after seasonal.Amd nw I have part time"
good,"Collaborative environment, room for growth, fast-paced. You must be able to multitask, prioritize effectively, and establish positive relationships with customers."
good,"Great atmosphere, great clients. Typical day was satisfying customers needs, assisting in orders, shipment, sales, meeting quotas, and going above and beyond for the customer. Macy's has a solid management team and a solid reputation of being the best in retail sales consistently"
good,"I don't have much to say. I might still be there if the new manager liked me. I missed my old manager, ultimately I was let go. I would actually enjoy going back but not if the same manager is still working there. I'm not even sure I can reapply considering I was let go. Everyone else I truly enjoyed working with."
good,My manager was very interactive with his employees and always tried to make sure we were having a good work experience. He regularly provided incentives such as free pizza or treats for meeting department goals.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very flexible hours and management were clear in their expectations. Great place for a part time job. Dead suggest this for people in need of a sessional job, students, or people who need extra cash on the side. Hours are limited but flexible. Work load was lite."
good,macys has a great environment and the people i worked with were really easy to get along with. Its a great placed to work and they have great benefits.
good,"I worked for Macys for 5 years as price change lead.It was a very satisfying job I am glad I had the experience I am a person who likes to keep busy, so this job was perfect for me,"
good,"Great Management and Leadership."
good,"long hours, low paid, low opportunities to grow, hard to get benefits, you pay 100% of the health insurance, no incentives, nor rewards for nothing, hostile enviroment, bad management"
good,"Typical day you're doing go backs and at the register. Hardest part was dealing with customers who would get upset about expiring coupons. Other than that fun place to work especially for discounts and if you are a student. Flexible hours and availbility to pick up, offer or swap shifts."
good,"Sales associates do simple tasks to keep their departments clean and organized, management works well and keeps in constant communication with all employees, and it's enjoyable to be able to help someone find what they might be looking for."
good,"I enjoyed helping out customers I learn to gain my communications skills, confidence, multi and paced job, I was so lucky to work with great coworkers and managers"
good,Work in a great department with great manager and coworker's. Great mall to work at. Had special incentives for the employee's like you get a great discount on your shopping some of the employee's seemed like they just worked to shop.
good,Extremely competitive environment with average benefits. The management will not be supportive of anything you do. They only care about opening Macy's store cards and meeting goals. Which is understandable but it drives people to fight with other co-workers about sales.
good,Nice place to work very organized and lots of standing recomendede to take comfortable shoes.  Always surrounded by restaurants so for lunch no need to go far
good,"you meet great people, awesome place to work but they didnt give out a lot of hours it depends what position you apply. other than that you would have a blast working ."
good,"Macy's is a fairly standard employer. I worked a temporary part time position, so my benefits were limited to an employee discount. Obviously the position was temporary, so job security was basically non-existent. A permanent position might offer better security."
good,"I learned a lot about what it was like to work in a department store on a day to day basis, which on as interesting or fast paced as I would have thought. I did learn a lot about what it takes to work in the different departments and what I would like to do I could stay there permanently, I really enjoyed the fashion jewelry department and the women that worked there were amazing and welcoming as were most people that worked there I found. One thing I didn't enjoy however was the sale quotas we all have to meet every day that part I don't like but everything else was okay."
good,"nice place to work, wish i could have been paid more"
good,"hard for me to balance, but the management works with you . chanel is a wonderful company to work for.training is excellent. booking appointments is most difficult as people do not want to schedule them."
good,"I graduated in psychology. I always worked at school. My previous job as seller was my first experience it was excellent,and I really enjoyed and liked that teamwork."
good,Working at Macy's was okay overtime hours were very flexible and was always available. for the most part if there wasn't a major sale going it wasn't to busy except for if you worked in the shoe department it was a zoo there.
good,"Working at Macys, while my responsibilities remained largely the same, every day was its own unique experience. I learned a lot about dealing with people and managing time."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great seasonal position with a good discount and incentives to reduce the price for associate purchases. Can basically pick your schedule and can work up to 60 hrs a week during the holiday season.
good,Macy is very exciting place to work always have plenty of thing to do and you make great pay and bonus if you are a specialist .If you are not a go getter and cannot not up sale this is not the job for you you do have to open a certain amount of credit app a week there it at time can get a little stressful from that other than that great palce to work with a lot of friendly people
good,"great comp[any to work for they offer a lot of great benefits. "
good,Easy place to work but you pay for it with your hours if your part time you won't get above twenty-five hours in a week. The customers are very nice and I enjoyed helping them with their shopping experience.
good,"All the people were incredibly nice and welcoming, even though it was very fast paced there was always a manager on the floor who would have answers to any questions."
good,"You can expect to work long hours during the holidays. In the beginning, they had someone walk me around and get me accustomed to life at work. We learned how to work the register and how to sort and merchandise clothes. Some managers and coworkers can seem very icy while others treat you warmly and validity. I always tried to keep my nose clean and treat myself as an investment to them so that I might be able to become a permanent employee. My position was seasonal and ended just a couple of weeks before they said we would need to reapply to be considered for a permanent position."
good,"Average day includes using mulitple systems to assist customers for online ordering. Good workplace, decent management, fun to work with employees. Hardest part is being around negative people."
good,"Great opportunity to make money for a seasonal period.  This position was not difficult however work days were long, walked approximately 14 miles a day in this warehouse for 12 hours a day is hard physically."
good,Most associates are team players; decent management; the hours during the holiday season are brutal and the dressing rooms should have an associate to give out the numbers and to ensure clothes are not left on the floor - that was a very difficult job picking up all of those clothes.
good,Benefit's counter at Macy's was a fun and positive counter to work at. Pulling customers to try on new products or casually engaging in  conversation to bring customer back into the chairs.
good,"Management changes often. Building unique relationships with each clientele, one makes our job rewarding. They work with your schedule, for example school schedule."
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for if you are willing to work hard and have the drive to move up the ranks; however, this means devoting your entire life to your work."
good,"Being a sales associate, it was fun being able to interact with customers.  However, my store was very slow and did not see much traffic.  The workplace environment was good and the management was amazing!!  If you want to work at a Macy's make sure it is a busy, high traffic store or else you will find yourself very bored.  I am very sad my store closed."
good,"Good for people who need a flexible job."
good,"Working in Macys had some pros and cons, one Pro being was the different events they sponsored, also, the incentive's some cons were no short breaks, and minimal wage ."
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for."
good,"Never a dull moment during the working day. Managing the associates and keeping the customers happy was done on a daily basis. Answering the phone, making store deposits, advertising for the up-coming sales was also part of the duties."
good,"A typical day at work for Macy's was simple and straightforward. Customer-oriented thinking and attitude is important for this line of work. Being organized and neat is also necessary. As neat person, I enjoyed the constant organizing and cleaning that was required in this job. Management was a call away if needed."
good,"You work about 10-11 a day (or night) and start out at 11.50 an hour. There are many departments to choose to work in such as pick, pack, beauty, msl, etc."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My time at Macy's has come to a close and I am not  really sure what i am going to do next for work. I am sorry i will no longer be working in the Rochester,MN store with amazing group of people!."
good,"my first job where taught me how relate and work with challenging situations when customers were not very satisfied. very fun to work with the team organizing the floors and preparing for holidays events with the depts. "
good,very understanding job about work hours and personal problems. non judgemental place and everyone is nice and very helpful. if in need of help they will help you even if the task is very easy.
good,i think macys is a great job for anyone looking to work retail. there are  so many different areas to work in you can learn and benefit from them all.
good,I enjoy working for Macy's but it is hard to advance within the company. The work load can be hard to handle but the people within the company are amazing to work with and you will make friends.
good,"Not a bad place to be employed for the holidays,plenty of hours and a decent work environment. management is not perfect but I haven't met a rude superior yet."
good,It is difficult to get a full time job.  Most of the jobs are about recovering and putting together the store to its best look.  It has many positions available for employees.  But difficult to become a regular emplyee.
good,"I sold shoes in the women department. I used my customer service skills  to receive high ratings, Every customer that came into the shoe department was important and was treated with respect."
good,managers like jeremy hernandez from sale tech needs help. he is so self centered and only cares about himself and his progress he does not care who he puts down on the way. he works in herald square macys
good,you meet people from all over the world fun events on most of the weekends where kids can go and have fun with their parents..They have a flower event every year which is pretty awesome you get to see all these creative plants.
good,"This company taught me the value of setting sales goals and to calculate This year sales compared to last year,  and to know what's trending in comparison."
good,Working at Macy's was really easy once you learn the floor and where to put items and unloading the dock was easy due to the helpful co workers that all work together to get the dock cleared when trucks come in.
good,Breaks at Macy's compared to my previous job are longer. You get 15 minute breaks and if you work 7 or 8 hours you get an hour lunch. All of the managers are pretty cool and understanding.
good,"it was a good summer job!! Great discounts and very friendly but definitely fast paced. I learned a lot. they work with your schedule."
good,"The 2 best things about this job are the discounts and the flexible hours. The pay is low but you get to move your shifts around to fit your life. That being said, holiday hours suck."
good,"Great for a first time job. Everybody that works there are friendly, helpful, and understanding. The job tasks were complex at first but once you go through it on a daily basis it becomes simple."
good,"Some time very stressful, Management is not as strong as other company , presell could make it even more stressful,Compatative work environment , Good discount"
good,This is a massive place with lots of different departments. The department that I worked in was a little slower paced and boring but speaking with others in different departments it just depends on where you are.
good,"You will learn how to be working with a lot of people, all different."
good,"Was a seasonal hire and still got 40-50 hour weeks regularly. Great co workers, great paid training as well. Also multiple employee discounts. Would highly recommend working here"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"fun place to work and interact with many different people, great job if you are in school since the hours are very felixaeble .  you also have the option to pick up more hours if needed."
good,"I had fun working for Macy's. Not only was I able to pick up the hours needed for a decent paycheck, I was able to work on the floor when they needed shifts to be covered."
good,"Macy's is a great part-time job to work at because of the flexible hours and they are understanding if you have school or another job. However, while they are flexible they also don't have many hours. I only work about 2 days out of the week but during the holidays is when it picks up."
good,"Working for Macys was stressful. They were not shy about telling you where you lack in performance constantly. The people were okay to work with, but very high school environment. People really took part in talking behind your back instead of telling you up front."
good,Macy's was a fun place to work. I enjoyed my co workers.  I love the morning shifts and I loved been off on the weekends and holidays. A nice place to work
good,"no work life balance, the Lp team and department was great, I left because of my husbands health issues was told that I could be rehired but cannot..."
good,"Typical work day"
good,Working at Macy's is a great first time job and also a great in-between job. It is also a great place for picking up a part time second job. the people you work with can make it fun so being their is not a bad thing.
good,I honestly was happy with Macy's except for being under staffed and given at least 5 to 10 hours overtime because as a group are unable to process all new hire information of normally 50 to 70 people per class with only 4-6 trainers and 2 trainers don't have access to programmes they need in order to process the new hires.
good,"most people are friendly. What i like the most is that you can find diversity, many people came from different countries, if u want to have co-workers from everywhere go to macys"
good,Okay company to work for. Our location had a great VPSM. Pay is mediocre at best. Discounts and stock options are a good perk to the job. Would recommend this job
good,"Processed orders"
good,I loved working at Macy's. I stayed there for six years. I met so many wonderful customers and really learned how important customer service is to being successful in retail.
good,lots of standing but they have a soft mat for you to stand on so that helps out at lot.i learned why they put the big tags on higher priced cloths.the best part of the job was going home at the end of the day knowing you are the reason the store gets its products.
good,"I worked Macys  for over 15 years and not much advancement there"
good,I didn't work here that long I was basically on call so I didn't get to have the full benefits. The managers were okay and pretty fair. There was times were hours got slow and I wasn't coming in for a while that's why I had to find another job. The hours were mostly before the mall opened which made it easier to work because you didn't have customers coming up to you asking questions. Everybody was a team player they would help you with your task if you weren't done they had finished theirs. I liked working at macy's because it was an relaxed job.
good,"Some managers were mean. But it was stressful, yet balanced, relaxed and efficient. Certain managers didn't care about our"
good,"I was with Macys for 9 years starting as a sales associate working my way to Dept Manager. I was the first manager in over 20 years to manage the entire childrens dept. Prior to me, there were 3 managers in the dpet. My associates were great & hard working. I left because the hours were becoming too much & more demanding."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,On a typical day it could get busy from the minute you walk in until the minute you leave. you always have to be ready for what ever the day is about to throw your way
good,"I drive 15 hours a week to and from work. The expense of gas and tolls is about $500 a month. I do not get reimbursed for any of that. I have tried to transfer but nothing has been done to help. My General manager does not stick to her schedule, she does not treat all her managers the same as far as her expectations for each of us are, and she is not held accountable to her actions."
good,"- reply e-mails, organize documentation "
good,The overnight shift that I worked was comfortable. The management staff where helpful and supportive. Working there during the holidays was unique experience.
good,"1) There are no typical days - each is different and exciting."
good,"Nice store to work in , very organized , great customer service . Not enough hours ,  horrible pay , need more cashiers , need better work attire . Better communication"
good,"work everyday you never knew what to expect but helping people walk out a feeling better about themselves was always the best part.  Management was always there for help, including co workers."
good,"I really enjoyed Macy's and I genuinely would go back to work there to work! Once you're there for a year, the benefits are amazing and you really get to know your department and its customers."
good,"Work load is balanced."
good,"- On a daily basis I was in charge of reviewing merchandise sales results and employee performance metrics . I had to walk the floor and ensure the merchandise was being displayed accordingly. I had to coach my associated and help them improve in key areas. "
good,Day started off busy and was like that for the rest of the shift. We started with a work plan to determine who would do what. Management expected highly of us.
good,"Depending on what you do here, its pretty busy with lots of regular customers. I loved helping people with their purchases and dressing them. I like managing people and teaching new folks.  They hire everyone but pay is still too low."
good,"Being since it was during my winter break, I wasn't there for the longest time, but overall it was pretty average, not too bad but not the greatest. I did make a workmate or 2 that dint go farther than that"
good,Friendly staff and managers. Overall a good place to work. Flexible hours and good benefits. Earn paid time off yearly based on hours worked. Room for advancement.
good,macys was a great place but it was super busy. they always wanted me to work extra but they really never took the time to see how much i did for them. besides that everything was great.
good,"I liked working at Hechts/ Macy's . Great discounts.,training and product knowledge.  We had to wear Black.Macy's had  double discounts four times a year for the associates to purchase their clothing for work."
good,To be quite honest Macy's has good benefits for the employee. Very good flexibility for hours aswell. Not the best paid of salary for the employee. They do have great discount of back of the house.
good,a good place to work and advance. only thing I didn't like at the time I was working there is problem solution with management. kind of one sided and don't listen to what others had to say.
good,"Workplace was nice, some management great to work with and working with new customers is something enjoyable. I learned valuable sales associate skills with Macy's Inc"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A nice place to work for the most part. Training is provided prior to start date, but it's always an ongoing process. I learn new things everyday and I've been there for 3 + years. Managers act mostly as coaches to enhance customer satisfaction, achieve store quotas etc, but usually are very accommodating to your work schedule. Hardest part of the job would be the low pay for the amount of work you are required to do. Customers can be difficult. Sometimes get stuck doing someone else's work. Quotas can be hard to make some days. Most enjoyable part of the job is making connections with people from all over the world, making someone's day, interacting with coworkers and being apart of a diverse team."
good,"Macy's is a great company. Although too much time was spent in meetings instead of getting actual work done, which created stress to sign team members who got in trouble if we weren't ready for the sales."
good,The days went by fast because I was always busy doing something even if it was monotonous. It was easy to work and talk at the same time and it was quiet in the mornings. It is either a good or bad job if you have OCD because you always want everything to look perfect in the store.
good,I worked in the cosmetics department. I loved it. It just didn't fit in my families schedule anymore. Sad I was there for almost (4) years. Not much room for advancement either.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for an easy job to get by.not many advancement opportunities available. Hours were a big issue part-time is 11 he's a week when I was told it would be 20 .
good,Macy's has an outstanding HR and management personnel department. All you have to do is ask and I guarantee that the managers will go above and beyond to address any of your concerns or issues. They have a flexible work schedule and remarkable employee discount. I've worked as a seasonal employee twice for Macy's with my last time being in the Fragrance Department and enjoyed everyday at work. I worked with amazing managers as well as associates. The hardest part for me was trying not to shop too much. The most enjoyable part for me would be the holiday seasons and helping the customers make gift selections. I loved it!!
good,I worked in sales in the sports area and was specialist for Claiborne for mens I enjoyed the managers and very nice people to work for. I learned lot.
good,The hardest part is working 10 hour shifts but they do pay well per hour they also have a self service sight that helps a lot with shift.you can post your shift to see if someone will take so it doesn't go against your points.
good,"A typical day at Macy`s is not hard work at all "
good,"Depending on which department an associate works in, the associate could be doing a lot of work for the wage their being paid. i.e backroom associates"
good,This is a tough store to work in only because it is so fast paced and busy with limited resources and high turnover.  It is challenging but everyone works hard-  very very hard- looong hours.
good,"management no longer wanted to work with school schedules for Saturdays. "
good,"Hours can be tough to get if you aren't FT bbut they are very flexible. Management is great. Some inter-store drama, though. Overall a positive place to work, since it's small it's like a family."
good,Did stock. Folding clothes was one of the most amazing job i had. Seeing celebrities walk in sum times discounts were good. Lunch break was even better
good,"I usually worked alone or with just one other person on the sales floor, allowing me to have a lot of freedom but also a larger workload. My manager didn't hover and I was mostly expected to figure things out for myself."
good,Always something to do and very busy. Time flies by fast! The hardest part was standing on your feet the whole time. I enjoyed helping and interacting with customers.
good,Its a great store to work but if you are in the ladies shoe department it gets competitive because you work by commission. You have to be quick on your feet and you need to know your merchandise and have a great customer service.
good,I worked in the back unpacking the boxes and putting them on racks. I was in charge of bringing the products out the the sales floor.  Also there was great discounts that came along with employment.
good,Fun place to work and I learned how to be comparable with others employees. The best part of working at Macy's is getting to know different way to communicate with others and help customers from overseas.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"130 mile R/T daily commute; worked 8-10 hours daily. On a daily basis reviewed, managed, and updated assigned areas (Menswear, Accessories & Cosmetics). Read E-mail, and responded, as needed. Reported to Management daily, as needed. Responded to calls for new store openings, renovations, seasonal/departmental prototypes and set ups. Interviewed and hired seasonal staff for Holiday set up, September 2000. The hardest part of the job of course was the commute, but I knew at the end of the day that I did the best I was very good at."
good,Easy to get along with supervisors and co-workers. Everyone helping each other. Every one trying to catch up to finish all departments keeping it clean and organize.
good,"start early get job done lots of advancement possibilities i learned a lot about receiving and setting up displays, people very will to tach you new jobs"
good,I enjoyed working in a team atmosphere and I appreciated the fact that they moved me into a supervisory role quickly. I felt like they acknowledged my hard work ethic and strength in working well with people.
good,"I enjoyed my brief employment a Macy's Bay Plaza. Unfortunately i was let go, according to them, because of failure show up for work. When in fact i spoke to 3 managers stating that I was sick and requested a week off. they gave me instructions on what to do, which i did but i got a letter of termination days later anyways."
good,"Macy's was the land of jobs opportunity's and growth.I learn there skills,knowledge and a diversity of associates that I work with. Some management were ok and others aren't,but the experience I bring with me was true profession,hard work and have some fun as well."
good,"I worked part time, but I was fun and the manager was flexible with the team. Work was hard on holidays or special occasion, because we need to put up sale and have store ready for clients."
good,"I worked during the holidays so everything was quite fast, however it was very fun. I enjoyed the team I worked with, who were also seasonal hires. Mostly the people I worked with other seasonal people however it was very enjoyable and if I could go back as a permanent associate I would."
good,"I liked working for this company, we were always reviewing new procedures and kept a fresh and friendly work environment, management had the ""open door"" policy which I think worked really well."
good,I worked here during the holiday season and it was fast paced and crazy as expected during that time of the year. I worked on the sales floor and in the shipping and receiving department. What I enjoyed about this job was it was during the holidays and got to meet and help a lot of people with their purchases and shopping experience. The hardest part of the job was the upkeep of the store and rushing things to the sales floor but again it was the holidays and everything was going fast.
good,"Worked part-time and it was a very stressful time period."
good,Working at the cosmetics counters at Macy's was fun. There were wonderful coworkers that you could freely talk to and ask questions if ever you needed help. Managers were a little hard to get a hold of sometimes in times of need but were very helpful when they arrived. Only major downfall for me was that being a flyer you picked up your own hours and they weren't guaranteed to be any hours sometimes. The Macy's I worked at hired too many flyers and not enough counter workers so flyers had an average of maybe three days a week of work if that.
good,"If you want a safe stable environment with a work load that allows you to mentally juggle school and work, Macy's is your job. There are many opportunists for advancement if you are willing to put in the effort."
good,As a flex receiving associate at Macy's you are working 8am-5pm on truck days and are always on your feet walking around. It is not the most interesting job and gets monotonous but its not bad.
good,"I have been at Macys for two years, and in those years I have learned many useful skills in retail and every day customer interaction. My biggest complaint with this company is its lack of loyalty to its employees when it comes to hours.  My hours as vary anywhere from 6-38 a week. I began as a full time employee and am now a flex associate due to their recent cutbacks on hours."
good,"At my current location:"
good,"I learned more about retail, and how hectic stores are around the seasons. Management was awesome, he was such a down to earth person, the hardest part was the hours, especially on Sundays,most enjoyable part was recovering the floors."
good,"Working at Macys was great! Everyone else that worked there makes you feel so welcomed and part of the team. They have no hesitation to help you and when you need assistance, they even cover each others shifts constantly. The down part of the position was, I didn't get nearly enough hours and it was pretty slow paced there, to the point where I would be walking in circles in my department, trying fix thing that I had already fixed/ cleaned."
good,I enjoyed everything about the job accept when all the orders slow down and not being able to find nothing to pack or label. The hardest part of the job was overtime and standing but no work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was good to work at Macy's just because it is one of the most major department stores. A typical day would include helping customers find the clothing they wanted, ringing them up, and keeping my area clean by stocking clothing. Hardest part of the job was finding where some of the clothing went especially since I was new to the store."
good,"very fast paced "
good,"Could use improvement in many areas, the pay could also be better for the work that is required along with the raises... overall great place to work with great coworkers."
good,"Macy's is a good company to start out with to gain experience and if you want to grow within the company, they have a lot of opportunities to do so. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers solve problems with wardrobe all the way up to credit card bills. I love that your work is greatly appreciated after you've helped solve issues that was hard for the customer to handle on their own."
good,"They will work around your class schedule and it's a great place for a seasonal job. I recommend applying early, around October, to be hired during the Holiday season."
good,If you are between jobs and looking for a part-time job with flexible  the schedule. This job provides the time for you to looking for another better one.
good,They didn't have enough hours to work for and weren't very flexible with hour but putting aside that it was a very amazing job just needs to be more flexible with hours
good,"A typical day would be to count the register, take care of customers and convince them to apply for a Macy's credit card. The most enjoyable was being able to connect with customers. The hardest was dealing with too many managers and you do not know half of them. Everyone was competing on sales since it was commission based pay."
good,"A typical day at Macy's involves working simultaneously as a cashier and restocking, folding clothes, and putting away returns from the fitting room. I learned how to be a good salesman. The manager from my department was wonderful. The workplace, overall, was relaxed on slow days, but very hectic on busy days. The hardest part of the job was working on days that involved multiple sales throughout the store. The most enjoyable part of the job were the discounts and great staff to work with."
good,"This company is good for students. There are flexible work schedules and paid time off, holiday pay and sick time after 6 months of employment. It is also good for a part-time job for company discounts for people with families.Unless you have an interest in retail management, there really is no room for advancement."
good,A good working environment and great customer appreciation. I didn't like that they stayed open so late and opened so early during the holidays. Great sales and always appreciated the customers more than the employees.
good,"Opening store, learning their way, on computers running Juniors dept, management very helpful, being short-handed when people called out, helping customers. The only reason I left is store closed"
good,"It's a good entry level job, but that's about it. It's a lot of work for very little pay. Management is ok but you won't really get time to get a break."
good,I has a great experience working at Macy's. I was a sales associate and got and learned how to deal with customers on a personal basis. I learned how to stock and inventory the items I worked with to include a twice daily counting of the cash that I was given to work with at the beginning and ending of the day.
good,"Macy's was a great place to work and I enjoyed my 4 years there. I was able to go from seasonal to full-time in a very short time and was even pushed to go further. However, they decided to close our store and knew that I would not be with the same team so ended my career at Macy's. The people I worked with on my support team were the best and they are the reason I stayed as long as I did. The work was great and I learned something everyday but it was truely the people that made it worth working,"
good,"While this company in kelso was  open it was a fun place to work. All my co workers were great. Seeing your regular customers ws always fn, learning someone by name and getting to know them better and their shopping style."
good,"Truly Macy's is a great place to work as long as you stay out of the Memphis/Georgia district. The District VP of stores manages  the stores, not the store manager. Store manager are cowards and do  not stand up to District VP. The District VP is the wicked witch of the south. Great benefits and enjoyable if you like meeting people, working hard and committed."
good,"A typical day at work started with opening the register. Throughout the day, I would organize the merchandise and hang up clothes that had been moved from their location. I would wait on customers, and ring up sales. "
good,"Great place to work. There is a lot of room for growth, and the management team is very helpful. The company offers great benefits. Overall a great place to work"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Fun place to work for students who are part time workers."
good,"No job is perfect and there were many ups and downs in my time at Macy's, but the people that I interacted with, the culture, the overall atmosphere and the opportunity to represent one of the leading brands in the retail industry was an exciting one, not to mention the opportunity to be part of its intellectual properties (Thanksgiving Day Parade, Fourth Of July Fireworks, etc...). those moments and the overall experienced I earned, you just can't put a price to it."
good,At Macys its was very busy a lot of customers comeing  thru the door to help make a sell and to give the customer what they are looking for managers worked hard with all teams to make goals.
good,"Everyone is calm, relaxed environment, management is good to their employees. Everyone is on the same level. Treated with respect. Technology is bad, culture for fundraising and community service is good."
good,"Fue interesante, conocer y tratar con muchas razas de todas partes del mundo."
good,"fun and rewarding, the best part was helping customers and seeing leaving happy and asking for me when the customers came back to the store."
good,Its good for a second job to have pocket change.. I have been working there for almost a whole year and its not that bad. Im currently working here until I find a job in my career field.
good,Some areas work longer hours than other but my area works normal hours. 9-6pm The culture is very friendly and there is some areas that have good work life balance. There are a lot of Assistants but not a lot of mid to senior level opportunities.
good,"We had policies given to us from corporate; however, we were given different directions from management. For instance, the return policy dictates a time limit and product's physical state. But management okayed to return everything. Counteracted some days when we were also given the okay to not return something from a suspicious customer. "
good,I was working as a assistant to place different goods in different departments. I was working with other assistant and made sure work should be done on time.
good,I enjoyed working at Macys.  We were the frontline for the company but sales associates just don't get the compensation.  Everything else was great.  I would go back to Macys if given the opportunity
good,"We were open to shift extensions and managers checked in frequently. I learned to always keep my cool, that customers aren't always right, but we should always b professional. I also learned to "
good,I actually enjoyed working at Macy's. Co-workers are friendly and the support team is always willing to help with any problems. The environment can be fast paced at times (especially during the holiday seasons) but it's not a problem. The pay is alright which consists of base pay for most departments at a fixed rate. Overall it's a good place to gain some retail experience but you may find another place to work that pays better.
good,I would come to work and immediately do a pick list. A pick list is when I find the items a customer ordered online. After finding the items I would packed them and scan the packages out for UPS.
good,I love the flexibility and work life balance of Macys. I love the fact that Macys allows you to be you. You can have piercings and different color hair and the dress code is casual work wear (JEANS) is always a plus!! And the associates appreciation days as well as the giving back to the community and the events and volunteer work we did. The only down fall was the health insurance and the uncertainty of job security at this time. Macys went through a big conversion and are making a lot of changes and eliminating a lot of different positions.
good,"I enjoyed this job. It was easy however, I often found myself struggling to find more things to do as the recovery employee. My job was to fold clothing and make sure everything was neatly stocked"
good,"I was hired as holiday seasonal help. I enjoyed working there at that time. I wasn't able to continue working for them due to family obligations, but I would have stayed on as an on-call employee if it was possible."
good,"It's an overall good place to work.However,customer service can be better as a whole. One person can't attend to the whole store. Some of the employees should get more involved."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The first day I worked their I had to learn fast. A lot of the time I asked other cosmetic colleagues for help figuring out certain things regarding customer service and cash handling. Their are more customers who are polite than rude but you still will encounter them. Standing on your feet for the entire shift unless you have a 30 min or 1 hour break depending on how many hours you work that day. Overall I loved this job because I was able to use my skills of cosmetics on customers and the look on their face when they love the look you gave them which even if your not working commission it is possible to build a clientele because of good customer service and cosmetic skills. People also love when they get a free gift with their purchases.
good,"day at work was pretty much not to boring no exciting, I liked working there for reasons like meeting new people and just being able to help any way possible. I learned great customer service and how to handle money or important products from the company. hardest part would have to be when it was super busy but on the bright side days like those days went by fast and the best part of the job was meeting a lot of new friends and having nice dress code I liked it mostly overall."
good,"Typical day at work, You have a vast array of responsibilities, but the most important is to take care of the customers' needs. Yours is usually the first smiling face the customer sees upon entering the store. Your job is to pleasantly greet them, offer to answer any questions, and provide information."
good,"Recent annual layoffs have changed the culture of the organization. Decisions are based on overall business needs, not the performance of the individual."
good,I only worked there a couple of months for a seasonal position but i enjoyed it. it can get very busy so you have to know how to balance the work load.
good,I think that it is a very diverse work place and I'm glad to have been able to experience working there the people are very nice and respectful of one another and that's what i liked about it the most
good,"I had the best coworkers because they were kind, true and held a standard of great integrity. The only issue I had was the little pay I was receiving."
good,"When I was there I did not have a set position most of the time I was lost. Also, they don't really train you, you have to learn it yourself but overall the managers were nice and understanding."
good,"Good Company, I would of stayed there if they didn't relocate, offered slot of incentives for the people who were on time every day, or people who stay late."
good,"Most of the coworker were very nice.Management could be better.Hours were okay , a lot of hours were cut off specially for new employees.It had great benefits for employes purchasing the company's items."
good,great place to work . Room to grow if you work hard . If you have MAGIC then you got it ! I started as an associate and landed as an executive in just three years !
good,"You are able to make your own schedule and you can pick up shifts when you are available to work. It's a plus when you're a full time student, because you work when you're available."
good,Its was pretty okay for a seasonal job position I just hated being on my feet for long. Another thing had good co-workers at that location as well in my opinion.
good,"Great Place to work! "
good,"Customer service doing price tags."
good,"I would recommend working at Macy's Credit and Consumer Services in Mason, Ohio. Their training program lasted 3 weeks and was very well put together and prepared me very well to go out on the floor and start working right away. "
good,"a typical day at work is making friends, you talk and show respect while they look around and ask questions. management is phone call away and will get to you for help in less 3 mins. hardest part is giving your respect and attention to the people who ignore you and talk rudely while instead of asking, they command.Most enjoyable thing is that the employee diversity inmost Macy's is expanded.you get to work and meet many new people and even customers from around the world looking for sells"
good,"it is a good place to work I meet so many people from different parts of the world. Sales are fantastic. nice,  good environment nice management and good associates."
good,"Macy's was fun and different because working there you had to go where you are needed however, past seasonal there is very little chance a part-time worker will last vary long."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys is a good job to get hands on with retail. The working hours are great and the employees are very helpful. Overall Macyss is a good job and I loved my time working here.
good,"Macys was great in the beginning, whoever turned out to be difficult. The company expects you to have 100% sales goals every day amd you have to call customers to get them to come in and purchase prioducts."
good,A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers and organizing displays. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was the customer upsell. It was the holidays and a lot of our customers were on a budget.
good,typical day at work would get stressful at times but very productive..Ive learned at type of promotions customers recieve.Management somewhat helpful. Work place had all types of culture. Hardest part of the job was to get customers to fill out for the credit cards. but the best part was working with my friends
good,typical day at work would get stressful at times but very productive..Ive learned at type of promotions customers recieve.Management somewhat helpful. Work place had all types of culture. Hardest part of the job was to get customers to fill out for the credit cards. but the best part was working with my friends
good,For the most part Macy's is a great company to work for. They have good discounts in the store and for other companies. The work environments very by location. Also they pay more for seasonal jobs than part time employees.
good,The hardest part of working at Macy's is when the job is no longer about the customer and it's all about the money you can't give a customer exactly what they need when someone is pushing you to add more even though you believe the customer doesn't need it.
good,For nearly seven years I have worked asset protection for Macys. It is fast paced and has provided a number of skills that can be easily transferred to other roles.
good,started as a associate and worked up which is totally a part of the culture there. If you are hard working you will get paid more and learn a lot on the job. You will enjoy breaks and decent benefits for the job.
good,"Working At macys was an experience. I got to meet a lot go well driven individuals, with great work ethic and management who would actively keep employees motivated. It was only unfortanute that I Found the culture of conventional in store shopping to be dying so I left and was proven right."
good,"the management at the time was pretty laid back, however the customers are super rude and demanding. co workers were not always the best to work with, its high school all over again, girls form groups and gossip all day long."
good,"great place to work, but human resources department and management were never on the same page with each other.  liked the work i did.  got to learn other departments as well"
good,"Great job to work at if it wasn't seasonal i would still be here. lots of hands on things to do, lots to learn and lots to do. you will always stay busy no matter what."
good,Not much communication between managers and employees. Overall it's not a bad place to work. It is frustrating though with how little information you receive from the managerial staff.
good,"This job requires extreme ability to focus and make fast decisions. Be able to multitask with camera and observation, and be able to memorize items in possession. Achieve training of the program to make safe and logical apprehensions of mays merchandise."
good,"It's work, what can i say. The managers were good, but i wasn't sales so and i know they get the brunt of attention and pressure. Gotta sell them credit cards."
good,"Typical day started at 5:00pm-3:30am.  I was a Seasonal hire, Managers, Team Leaders and Co-workers were supportive. Seasonal hires do not receive any benefits."
good,"When I first got hired at Macy's, I was a shoe expeditor that works in the stock room. My duties were to pull shoes for the sales associate so they can take it out on the floor to have the customers to try on. The job is a little repetitive and tedious, however, the co-workers were great to work with. After a few months of being an expeditor, I switched to the position of a sales associate in the women's shoes department. Being a sales associate could be a little difficult because you have to meet sales goals and credit goals. At the end of the day, it seems like only the numbers on your sales sheet is what matters, rather than your work ethics and communication skills. The management  for both my expeditor position and sales position were excellent. Sometimes there would be a few miscommunication but we all get along at the end of the day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Management was all over the place never really there. Everything was unorganized no one knows what to do half the time, but fun everyone is social and they'll keep you busy"
good,"It can be fun, if you have the right co-workers, but mostly I was by myself in an empty department larger than the small stalls at the mall. "
good,"A typical day at work: They don't really keep an eye on younger seasonal workers. "
good,"I find it hard to understand why people bother to apply for jobs, get hired, and not show up for work.  It is probably the most frustrating thing I face daily, other than the ones that show up and don't want to work."
good,"check schedules/sick calls,feel open positions, conducted morning rally's,open store doors, merchandise and recover fixtures,walk and observe associates customer service and behavior.set sale/change signing read hourly performance report. address any issue in the store and finally close the store and set alarm"
good,"Simple Work, and validation easily achieved when you do your job. Management lets you do your job and doesn't linger but is easily found when you have questions or need assistance."
good,The flexiblity as a part timer to pick own schedule was great. The on going training classes were helpful and fun. The company's willingness to give back to the community was a great feeling to be a part of and work for such a giving place.
good,"Productive work place, always something to do to keep you busy. Great people to work with, on some days. Its more of a self battle to achieve the store goals unfortunately."
good,"I have got opportunity working few departments while i have experienced dealing various types of products with different aged group people that privileges me to boost customer service and team working experience. The proudest part of the job is becoming sales manager within 6 months, that made me feeling paying off my hard work as a first job in a new country and completely new culture. To be honest, i did not find something too hard to manage as i like dealing with people and working under pressure at a fast paced, taking challenges and meeting targets makes me even more joyful. i am seeking job for career development not because i do not enjoy working at Macy's at all."
good,Taco Bell gave me a good amount of hours and the people I worked with were nice and always there to help with anything. Everyone there was willing to take time off there job if someone else needs help.
good,"While my job as a supervisor with most of the focus on customer service became easier to do with everyday that went by, and a good team of associates, I can say that I have had a positive experience with the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Macy's. It's a fun, family oriented place. They overall tend to take care of their employees. Only real downside is the high cost of insurance and lay offs."
good,Each morning we would be greeted with a morning rally giving us the goals and objective for the day. Then we would go to our department get the register and sales floor ready for the day and would greet and help each customer around. Make sales and remain involved. The hardest part would be dealing with difficult customers.
good,I love working for Macys but they are doing a lot of lay offs. If I don't get another job in my field in this company I may have to find something else.
good,"Busy but also fun"
good,Macy's is a great location to start your first job. It teaches you skills in so many different locations. You're not just stuck in one department all the time unless you chose  to do so.
good,"Other then standing around waiting for something to happen, it was a fun job. Our managers where very understanding. I would go back and work for them again."
good,"A good place to work to learn about fashion, makeup, fragrance, cosmetic, and home products in retail. They train you, but often you learn to work independently as managers don't breathe down your neck."
good,"I have worked my share of retail jobs before, but Macy's was different from the others. It is different because it is a big department store with several floors and different areas. It can be pretty crazy during the holiday season with all the one day sales and black friday, but other than that I think that working there is a pleasant experience. "
good,Macys is a good place to work at if you need a job that's flexible. As a sales associate you have a lot of flexibility to switch around your shifts with your coworkers to make it fit your schedule.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,They will give you many hours around the holidays. The customers are very nice and friendly. The job is easy and the co-workers and management are easy to get along with.
good,"took incoming call to help Macys customers with there accts online and over phone. handled a lot of password resets for customers, disputes on there accts, and making phone pyms."
good,This was a very fun company to work for. Very upbeat environment nice co workers management was nice as well. Typical work day you would work in your designated department and you had a sales goal of a certain dollar amount to meet every shift.
good,Sales Fragrances all day .. co-workers are easy to get along with .. The hardest part of being a fragrance ringer is learning about each and every fragrance in the department .. Actually learning and remembering about the colognes .. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work and being with my coworkers and friends.
good,Open and close registers.handled large amounts of cash. Played rolls of leadership worked in other departments. Helped out whenever or wherever I could. Liked being able to see different people and multi tasking in the work place.
good,"I worked at Macy's Starbucks and it was one of my favorite places to work. The hardest part was having to make sure everything we did fell under the guidelines of both Macy's and Starbucks regulations. Everything else was wonderful. You get a discount on Macy's and Starbucks merchandise and a 50% discount on lunch meals from the Macy's food court. Co-workers were delightful and half of Macy's management were regulars at the coffee shop so you got to know them all really well and made friends in all the departments, especially the MAC makeup girls."
good,Macy's was a very fun place to work. You do not have Co-Workers here it is more like a family. A typical day at work ALWAYS starts with a team meeting to talk about our goals and what we already accomplished. This made the team grow stronger as a whole and gave you motivation for the day. The hardest part of the job is asking someone to start a credit card but with time you become better at selling them.
good,I did not work there for long but everyone was very helpful and nice. Great personality and customer service with mostly everyone. It was a very busy location but everyone did what they were hired to do and most of the time did beyond what they were suppose to.
good,"Sales, Retail, Cashiers, Stock and products knowledge."
good,Read plan o grams and set up for sales. Review sales production. Go to meetings and help customers decide on merchandise.
good,My career really progressed at Macy's. I learned a lot from the VPs that I worked for. Excellent diversity and a great group of people to work with.
good,"Typical day at work would be to make the sales goal and provide the best customer service. Sometimes can be challenging but doable."
good,I enjoyed working hear . Good work environment. It's a great place to meet new people . Also the jewelry department which I used to working does a great job in making sure people get what they need
good,I like working here because you can keep a balance if you have another job or go to school. It is easy to give away shifts and swap shifts.
good,"Over all fantastic , experience , fun environment. Amazing, fun meeting people and learning products and nice employees."
good,"fast paced, non stop and enjoyable."
good,"Decent place to work for. Good hours, management very nice and always on the sales for. Very organized, fast paced. "
good,"Fast paced with new opportunities daily, Growth opportunities available for those interested in retail career ."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Provided assistants to customers in a retail sales position (Women Shoes and Men's department)."
good,At first its pretty hard if you dont know how to sell. But as soon as you find your own way to sell its coasting from there on out. The environment is great. Coworkers are good (some of them) and the buyers are mainly old people for the Macys I worked at.
good,Meeting great new people every day and get to learn about them the thrill of not knowing who you're going to meet on a day to day basis
good,"A typical day at Macy's on the merchandising team meant being the first ones inside the store to set up store displays, change out fixtures, face outs and stocking the sales floor with fresh merchandise."
good,Macy's was my first real job. It was a learning experience for me. I had to talk to different people everyday something that I wasn't use to. However my position in women shoes made me get out there and handle business.
good,"It was really fun learning new things, except my department manager who gave me hard times because of inventory everything else was so good."
good,"always a busy day, i learned how to be a team leader, co-workers were hard working, hardest part of the job is keeping the hours steady for all employees, most enjoying part is the crew is really a team, helping each other and we are all called ONE TEAM."
good,very busy fast pace work environment . I enjoyed working on the cash register and meeting new people.it was fun helping people decide on what they wanted to buy and save.by watching and observing people you learn how they acted and you learn better ways of approaching people.
good,"Not a terrible place. The hours are decent and so is the pay.. But the credit solicitation is God awful. They expect you to twist customers' arms into applying for a credit card.. So if you're okay with that, then you'll love it. Eveything else is not that terrible."
good,"Nice place to work as a starter. management is helpful. Co-workers are supportive, pay rate and benefits are not that good"
good,The most enjoyable part about this job was my co-workers and the customers.  If you are people driven then this is the job for you.
good,Great job for those going to school full or part time. You must love the atmosphere of sales all of the time. You will be doing a lot of standing and cleaning. You get a great lead way in managing yourself. Lot's of opportunity to learn new product. No longer a commission based incentive. Those that have been grandfathered into previous contract negotiations benefit the most.
good,"Scheduled applicants for interview"
good,it is a good job if you nhave no life or your in highschool or college. even then they do not give two s.... about you they will fire you in a heart beat do not get paid enough to be doing what they ask
good,"Very fun, a lot of cash handling and customer service experience. The management is really helpful, and you also get 20% off of everything :)"
good,"Responsibilities included providing quality service by assisting Macy customers, keeping a daily inventory on store products, handling telephoned store inquiries and organizing daily work environment.   "
good,"great place to work, wonderful customers, great sales associate teams , products of quality, great prices, variety of designers. good selection of items"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Typical work day was apprehending shoplifter to bring down shortage in the store as well making sure of the safety for cutovers and employees all day.
good,"I learned a great deal about leadership, organization and delegating tasks. I thought my co-workers exemplified outstanding team work."
good,The company has a very good training program in place and the staff that I have dealt with in several stores have been very pleasant. The district executives have been very nice and approachable. The company seems to care a lot about it's associates
good,Macy's is a very professional and friendly place to work. All managers are willing to assist whenever needed. I would love to work for any of the managers in the future.
good,"Working at Macys was fun especially working with your coworkers. "
good,"This was a seasonal job, training was paid and was very hands on with a pretend register and sales examples. Dress code was black/white and red. Sales goals were a little excessive, we don't control the store traffic, how are we supposed to reach a certain amount of credit card sales. Co workers weren't very friendly. Learned a lot. Was told by the supervisor I would get a job offer because I worked well and hard in the shoe department but I never did get an offer."
good,"I like working with Macy's, it was a company filled with hundreds of amazing people. Everyone helped each other out. The hardest park was when my section changed into a clearance room, which wasn't what I applied to do. But over all It was a good job with good people."
good,"Working with Macy's for three years now, I have learned how to work as part of a team, how to communicate effectively and reach goals as a team player. I also learned the skills it takes to become a leader, Leading a team with an average of fifty people, I learned to cater to the needs of a very diverse set of people. I am lucky enough to work with a great and hardworking team of Leads who prioritize daily goals and the development of our workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I get to work with."
good,I work along side my coworkers guiding them down the path to ensure everything gets down so that we can make the customers happy. I learn and teach everyday and help grow macy's.
good,"I enjoy going in to work because I'm always looking forward to another great day with customers, I love to teach new technics we learn from cosmetic school and have them walk out the store with new products and a smile."
good,"Of the three retail jobs I have held in New York, this was the better of them. I was given the opportunity to learn and grow in multiple positions. The most enjoyable parts of working here were being able to control your own schedule (depending on your position) and the feeling that if you want it bad enough, you can move up in the company.  One of the more less enjoyable parts was the lack of communication between management and associates. Overall I enjoyed my experience with this company and would return if the terms were fair."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the people. In a typical day I helped up to 300 people find exactly what they needed.
good,I didn;t get a chance to experience a lot while working at Macy's but the time that I did get to work was a learning experience. It was fast paste and quick thinking which I enjoyed just didn't get enough hours because we were seasonal workers.
good,"I learned that you always want to make a lasting impression on the customer, make sure they leave feeling better then when they came into the store."
good,"-Typical day is fast pace working environment"
good,"-hardest part was learning to know the floor; each section of clothing and helping the customers "
good,Great company with advancement opportunity if your willing to relocate. Customer service is priority for the company however staffing and expense control limit the opportunity to engage with customers. Something different everyday and the associate base works very hard to succeed at all metrics expected.
good,"I had various shifts which was interesting and great because i got to choose them all. I learned about merchandise quickly how to interact with guest to make their shopping experience at Macy's fun and easy. Co-workers depends on which floor were very nice and helpful wouldn't leave you hanging in a bad situation. Hardest part was getting to know and get along with some co-workers and finding a floor/section where you felt comfortable, acknowledged and wanted. There is one person on each that will make you feel comfortable and is genuinely nice because let me say fighting over cash registers, acting like you own the floor, being rude to your co-workers, bossing around the new people like you own them, stealing clients or sales is just straight wrong."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Working for Macy's was fun.  I can't speak about other teams but we worked extremely well together.  I can't say that about every place I've worked in the past.  My supervisor was big on us detectives finding our own ways out of I wouldn't say terrible but sticky situations.  He was big on us thinking for ourselves.
good,People are nice and it is quite busy during the holidays. I enjoyed working during the holidays because of the christmas music. It is a good job if you want to work in retail
good,"Very intense work pace. Friendly co-workers and management. Work schedules are high, especially at Holiday Times. Customer Service and Sales are top priority."
good,"Macy's Herald Square is an exciting place to work, with incredible access to top company executives, a strong team of store leadership executives, and a crash course in learning the business of big box retail in NYC.  Of course, this does not come without a non-stop promotional calendar and the stress of running a floor in the world's largest store!  Coworkers are amazing and supportive - I could not have gotten through it without the camaraderie of them!  "
good,taking the right time working with customers to have them make the right decisions in their purchase to avoid returns. management is not always available which has my co-workers lean on me.
good,"Working with the management team, family comes first and they are very supportive of their employees. Hours have a lot to be desired with opening and closing shifts and holidays hours are even longer. Staffing is not what it should be but that comes from the budget allotment not the store managers."
good,"being a macys associate is fabulous. you get a chance to meet and interact with variety of people either customers or fellow co-workers form all over the world, you get a chance to learn about their culture, customs and traditions. always fun with regards and respect to results, and getting the work done. the workplace is so warn and welcoming that gives you the opportunity to learn a lot to carry on your journey. overall, you working for a multibillion dollar business."
good,"I learned a lot about multitasking, training in how to lead and motivate   a team, auditing, inventory, logistics, merchandising, and how to put the customer first and drive sales."
good,"i worked during the holiday season in the watch department. handled cash sales, did minor repairs on watches and worked with friendly coworkers."
good,great people few hours and low pay but the hours are low and competitive. I worked here seasonal and we get no benefits. The managers have favorites.
good,"Macy's is really making some great improvements right now. The work is hard, but it's innovative and exciting. It's nice to be part of a successful transformation."
good,"Macy's is a company that on a daily basis one can expect to be coached to the companies goal namely moving products and doing so with a smile. Meeting were held daily regardless of performance to ensure that the sales force was doing what they management had instructed them to do. The tone of the company was severely sales driven but customer service was most certainly not lost. Working with Macy's truly influenced my customer service and team work skills in a major way. The managers seemed to take a real hands on approach to the sales staff to ensure optimum efficiency and the co workers seemed very receptive to the encouraging aspect of it as well. "
good,"It is a nice place to work, I do enjoy interacting with the customers as well as my coworkers.  "
good,I liked the people that I worked it and the made the day enjoyable for me. I worked in the toy section so it was really nice to see all of the cute children play with the toys their parents told them not to touch.
good,My day working at this organization was an experience that will last forever; which I enjoyed satisfying customer needs and wants.
good,"Here at Macy's I have learned the Magic of selling:"
good,"I manage and coach associates on proper selling technique along with driving sales and charity events on a daily basis. I help with customer needs, while also teaming up with the department managers to ensure daily tasks a accomplished, along with helping customers with sells. I enjoy the interacting with associates and customers."
good,"Great place to work, lively team. Management was always understanding and flexible with schedules. The hardest part of my job was working late shifts but the smiles always made up for it...."
good,"Macy's is an amazing company to work for, they do honor their associates in all fields, and will promote from within. Macy's just needs better insurance and Pay scale for their associates."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a multi channeled retailer and is always looking at the future of retail and customer service. I work on the store side of business for 13 years in San Francisco and New York as a Creative Director and as a VP of Creative.

good,"A typical day involved handling cash, opening and or closing cash registers, cleaning merchandise fixtures and performing merchandising tasks. The primary task was to provide customers service that lead to sales and customer satisfaction, including offering reward programs that were connected to the proprietary credit card. Often, I worked with vendor representatives, receiving training in the new features of new merchandise and presentation. There were times when I was the principle trainer for those who worked with me and there were times when I was the learner. The job always had new and developing tasks. Very little about the sales associate job was difficult. Sometimes, explaining a procedure to an associate who was new to a department took some time. The parts of my work that I enjoyed most were those times when I could give individual attention to my customers as well as those times when I performed merchandising and merchandise ordering tasks. I had confidence that my customers would be pleased with the results."
good,"This was a constant on the phone.  It was fun dealing with customers, drivers and associates.  There was room for advancement.  Hardest was to deal with difficult customers.  Our job was to make them happy and if we didn't it was a negative to our station.  Learning was exciting."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My typical day at works starts with looking at what on-line orders we have received for the day.  I make sure when the employees get to work they pull and find the orders.  I do the final process to make sure the customers are receiving the right merchandise and everything is processed. I  share the weekly numbers with the employee's so we can celebrate our success.  My job also includes making sure the sales associates, merchandising leads, and sales managers are all trained in the fulfillment process."
good,It was a great place with nice hours and good co-workers. I learned alot but the long days were the hardest part...management was kinda hard but fair
good,"A typical day as a shoe expediter, the sales team orders shoes, you get them for the guest, if they buy them great if not they get sent back, you scan them back in and put them back in their place, If you work mornings you do shoe audits, where you scan out all the display shoes bought and replace them, this can take 20 minutes to 2 hours depending on how fast you can go from place to place."

good,Working at Macy's during the holidays was a challenge due to all the sales and promotions offered at that time. The hardest part about the job was dealing with irate customers. The best part about the job was turning those irate customers into happy and returning customers.
good,Good place to work. good discounts. managers are great and are very helpful. clean working conditions. pay is alright wouldnt try and support a family off it but is helpful when working another job
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee in the Men's Fragrance department and was able to quickly learn about different brands, promotions, etc. It was a fun experience that I would quickly join again given the opportunity."
good,"I would make sure that the area that I was working in was neat and clean for the customers to be able to find what they were looking for. It was during the christmas season, so it was a very busy environment. I was able to handle it with no problem. I met new people. I would get called in early and leave later than expected."
good,A typical day would include security protocol which would be designated by Assets Protection Manager. Detectives would review Closed Circuit Television Cameras for security purposes.
good,"I love working in this company but I could not go on standing on my feet for 12 hours a day.  Packing is an easy job but when when you have to pack big items, this is where the difficulty comes and sometimes there is risk in lifting."
good,A typical day at work with Macy's is based on just providing what the customer needs. Mostly walking around the floor making sure every customer is acknowledged and welcomed. Also working the register making sure customers don't have to spend any extra time in long lines. Finally focusing on keeping the store up to par making it easy for customers to find what they need. While working at Macy's i learned a lot more communication skills. I never had any problems with my co-workers everyone was very easy to get along with. I really cant say they were any hard parts because everything was very manageable. The part i enjoyed the most though was being able to please my customers and accomplish store goals.
good,Help Customers Familiar with the Products or clothing package bought items and handle financial transactions such as receiving payments and making necessary change document the initial money provided for the register and balance. Friendly environment making customers happy and reaching sales goals.
good,"Typical work day would be finding your shortage opportunities. Identify potential theft externally and internally. Creating shortage reduction programs for the store and holding people accountable. Consistently following-up with store partners. Touch base with store management team and district manager. Responding to calls and educating associate on policies and prodecures. Review surveillance of high shortage departments and cash registers. Responding to emails in regards to theft, safety, and operations. The retail hours and travel are a little too much. For example, working to midnght and coming back to work an early shift. Or responding to alarm calls in the middle of night and having to respond. If you have a store that is close by, then you shouldn't have a problem. But if you have a long commute then it can effect work life balance. You must productively apprehend shoplifters but if you're by yourself then it's hard to uphold consistent productivity. Plus stopping a group of people by yourself can hinder your safety."
good,I loved working retail just not enough money. I love shopping and I was always able to pick from everything before the customers bought all the clothes.

good,"Macy's Receiving Dock is a great place to work.  The associates who work on the dock are hard-working and get the job done.  The receiving manager is an awesome leader.  His expectations are high, but are achievable.  Every associate on the dock works as a team.  As a team, we process the incoming merchandise as quickly as possible so it gets to the selling floor in a timely manner."
good,"A typical day at work would be me lifting and stocking the storage. I unload women's shoes. My co-workers are the best part about work. Their older women, the drama is at minimum when I'm there. The hardest part about Macys is lifting the boxes all day. Its hot in the storage room and uncomfortable. It's a free lance job, not to demanding and full of positive employees."
good,"It's a huge company, the workplace feels that way as well. Most of the workers are friendly but some don't stay for long, be sure to stand out or be consistent if you wish to stay."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very competitive environment at times due to the fact that it is a commission department, still able to work well with coworkers but it is somewhat of a competition against them, this is my greatest challenge. I do like that I am able to connect and help actual and or potential clients, this is what I look forward to most as well as sales that make almost all customers even that more excited to make purchases on any given day; being able to help other save some money. I've learned that by giving someone your attention as well as positive and honest feedback that it this will usually provide for a great connection between clients."
good,"A typical day would consist of walking the store before opening to recover visual set ups and manniquins from the night before. Help lead and inspire employees starting with the morning rally and to continue supporting associates through out the day. Touch base with senior management on the days goals and to make sure no changes occurred. Give direct reports direction on projects for the day ensuring company's goals and directions are implemented on a timely basis."
good,"-Work in various stores with the  Team."

good,"Macy's is a great company to work for that focuses on the associate and trying to maintain a pleasant atmosphere to ensure an enjoyable workday.  The company allows for cross training for those who want it, opening up opportunities for advancement and learning new skills.  Macy's has an open door policy allowing associates to speak with whoever they feel most comfortable with about work concerns and share feedback and ideas.  The culture, on the weekend shift, is production oriented with a priority of associates feeling appreciated and cared for.  There is teamwork not only in each department but between all departments as well.  All managers willingly help each other out.  The hardest part of the job is probably staying on your feet all day long while the best part is being part of a team that truly cares."
good,Management wasn't to familiar with their task which made things hard to get done. But was still a fun job other than that.
good,"great flexible schedules and great benefits."
good,"It depends what department you work in and what time you're scheduled to work. But everyone aims to open up macys rewards cards, provide the best customer service, and keep department looking clean and neat to Macys standards. I learned alot about patience and making sure that your guest are always your first priority. Management is very hands on and involved. They have morning rallies to set the mood off right in the store. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with guests who are challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job are the many events we get to enjoy as employees."
good,"Flexible Scheduling - If you were scheduled a shift that you can't do (drops down 3 or 4 weeks of work schedule), you can advertise your shift but you have to do it right away so other associates that wants to pick-up hours can take that shift and you'll be clear of that shift. Great entry level job for people new to the workforce."
good,It is a great company to work for but the hourly wage at this company is too low for someone live on their own and being independent.
good,A great place to work if you can multitask. Managers empower associates to handle situations on their own using their best judgement.

good,"I started working at Macy's my senior year in high school, very fun place to work and I had no problems with my schedule working around school. The only problem I would say is the opportunity to move up as well as pay raises was the only con I would say. Management would also be another con of the company."
good,"Go to work, stock shelves, shipments, markdowns, how to manage my own, great management. co-workers work as a team, there really wasnt anything hard about the job. Most enjoyable working on shipments and adding new items to the sales floor"

good,"great co workers"
good,"High energy day of work. In my particular position, every day was different. I was always busy and the hours flew by. At times I felt the workload was too much for and average 40 hour work week and felt behind. The coworkers were enjoyable and hard working. Management was encouraging and allowed for some individual input."
good,My typical day of wrk would be 6.50 hours an everyday we would do a take 10 which would be all the stafff an managment discuss how our day of work was going to go an that a good learn experience for me .

good,"It is like your usual retail place, always hectic. It is enjoyable when you have good colleagues and the work flow is steady."
good,"I loved working at Macys. I was a counter manager for Origin's cosmetics. I had daily goals and weekly goals to meet. I would meet clients, answer phonecall and do data entry. The only thing negative I could say about working at macys is that I work wth alot of petty women. It  was very competitve and the women would try to take comission from different counters, and I didnt approve of that."
good,"A typical day at work for me at Macys was fast and friendly. "
good,"A day at work is usually fast paced (especially since it was the holiday season,) and very busy. I learned how to operate a cash register for the first time. Management was typically great, but a few managers/supervisors had a tendency to be overstressed at times. Most of the Permanent employees I met were great people and very helpful and cheerful. There are a few who seemed to get stressed really easily and a few were more then happy to talk negatively about others behind their back. The hardest part about the job was the coupon system. It's not fully explained to the customers and many people were upset over having to pay more or refused to buy items because they were excluded from the coupon. I liked coming into work at Macy's."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,I like the company overall. Everyone is very polite and willing to work together. There are good hours as well. It is very easy to approach supervisors and managers as well. There is also a café there so you can get food without leaving.
good,I learned how to focus on sales goals and to audit sales. Promotions on sales and satisfying customers with there needs. I like to take the lead and assist my co-worker as well as my customers. The hardest part of my job is carrying five boxes of shoes and dispursing them to three different customers. And the most enjoyable part is all that hard work wasn't for nothing because I always go over my sales goals.
good,"A typical day at work included providing customer service and making sure that each customer was waited on in a timely fashion, in search for the proper shoe size, style and color.

good,"An all around easy place to work, a lot of customer service, management is usually very well maintained. Fun environment & a nice energy from the staff."
good,"I was glad to get help from co workers and I loved greeting and meeting new people. It was nice to know there was always something to do but it usually wasn't slow enough that I needed to do anything extra. Some days there weren't enough employees so we would get overwhelmed or not have someone there to cover us when we needed our breaks/lunch. The managers were great but obviously very busy. Overall, I loved my retail experience."
good,I had a great time working there. There were perks to working there and I also met a lot of great people. Definitely has its ups and downs.
good,A typical day at Macy's is; unloading trucks that come in the dock full of clothes and accessories and unpack them to prepare them for the sales floor. The management and co-workers were great and made it easy to work there which made the time go by faster. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers actually and getting off at a reasonable time.
good,"As a retail store the typical day would begin with getting the area I worked in ready for guests.  Greeting guersts and assisting them in finding what they were looking for."
good,Very good work/life balance. Work with a lot of great people who you can learn from. Issue is every year they make job cuts and never sure if I will have a job from year to year. Best part of the job is the people you get to work with. Just not sure of advancement as the path to move up always seems cloudy.
good,The people were super friendly and easy to work with. I had good hours while I was in my last year of high school and the pay wasn't bad. I loved being able to help out in the bridal registry and getting to meet new people. I love being able to help customers and having them leave with a positive experience.

I learned how to diffuse heightened feelings and emotions and how to quickly finish up purchases with a smile and a genuine connection within in minutes. The managers are fantastic they are honest, kind and genuine. They do some much work for their store. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers they are awesome diverse and a blast to work with; they make my day better by far. The hardest part was the continuous lines of customers: inevitable but tiresome and wore me down a lot."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Typical day would have to be going in, organizing the department, ringing customers up and answering any questions customers may have. My manager at the location was great even the store manager was great and always backed up the employees when it was obvious the customer was not right. Co workers all very diverse and great to work with. Hardest part of the job is that on Key days even if you have an availability stating you can only work nights or days they will schedule you at any time no matter what. Most enjoyable part being able to meet new people."
good,"A typical day at Macy's will start with employees coming in some minutes earlier than the store opens to prepare and tidy up their working areas. I learnt a lot in Macy's, how to attend to customers, how to be a people person and a lot about sales. My co-workers are friendly and we always work as a team."
good,Great Team but truly hard to balance family life due to never knowing what time you are going to work or coming home. Changing week to week and that does not change as you climb up the ladder.

All my co-workers was friendly and help me if I needed any help. The only hard part about the job was opening up macys cred card cause most people already had one. The most enjoyable part of the job was having my customers smile and leave them happy with the serve I fulfilled them with."
good,"Unfortunately the scheduling options are not always acceptable, and it is difficult to make changes.  Other than that I love this job except for the low pay scale.  I need to increase my income and that is not possible here."

good,"I learned new things about customer service, I learned more about management in retail work place, you have to treat your co-workers as you expect to be treated, the hardest part of the job, was cleaning the dressing rooms when you were working by yourself, working with the public, customer service and learning new things"

good,"Great company, learned a lot of how to deal with company culture and different age groups.  My co-workers were awesome people.  However there is a immense disconnect between management and employees.  The company is structured in a way that the only way to move up is by knowing someone as opposed to your own merits and accomplishments."
good,"I love how Macy's plays a major role in our local community through volunteer & charitable donations. I LOVE our products. I don't see why anyone would shop anywhere else with the excellent prices, products & sales promotions. When you love your product it is then very easy to sell, which is another aspect of my job I enjoy, interacting with customers & delivering an honest product with exceptional customer service."
good,Overall Macy's is an ok company to work for. It's all about sales so you are definitely pushing for people to open accounts and meeting daily goals. It can be stressful at times. I have a great group of coworkers on the floor that I work on and my manager has gotten a lot better so it can be fun and enjoyable. I mainly love the flexibility of it all. That is the best thing for me because of my child so I'm basically working around her schedule.
good,"Fun atmosphere, good customer base during peak shopping seasons. Hours of working not too early or late most of the time. Great management team and co-workers."

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day is greeting and helping customers with any questions or concerns they may have, checking them out at the register, cleaning fitting rooms and straightening up display areas. The hardest part of the job is to remember when to accommodate the customers dealing with mark downs and sales. The enjoyable part is all the people I meet and help them with their self-esteem."
good,"A typical day at work included stocking clothes, cleaning fitting rooms and helping customers with there needs. What I learned from this position was how to deal with difficult customers in a professional way and how to organize my work. My co-workers were very helpful in doing their part and making sure all of your work was put away if you need help. The hardest part of the job was making sure that even when you couldn't help the customer you tried to reassure them that something else could get done to help."

good,"-Provided excellent customer service to customers."
good,A typical day at Macy's was all about producing new credit accounts for the store. There was a morning meeting everyday about the daily goal of the store and the credit card goals. At the Clinique counter I enjoyed teaching new customers about the individual skin care that fit their needs and help teach them about Clinique products. I learned how to order and control inventory for the counter and give excellent customer service. The Clinique management was excellent and always willing to help. The Macy management was difficult to work with and did not follow up with results of counter or information of display schematics. My co-workers were fantastic and always willing to help. The hardest part of my job was balancing job/home with two small children and trying to make two separate goals everyday for each company.
good,"My day at work can be very unpredictable, however, with that said I love what I do. A tremendous amount of planning and executing is required in my position, as I am responsible for merchandise placement, replenishment, and back of house execution. Even though I've been in retail for the past eight years, I learn something new everyday. That's what keeps my job interesting and exciting."
good,Macy's gives you a great  schedule you could work with and a chance to advance within company
good,Very typical work in customer service and cashier service in accessories throughout the holiday season. Training was provided by Macy's prior to being scheduled to work in the store. Testing was provided as well. I was very pleased to have an opportunity to work with Macy's.
good,I was a Sales Associate for Macy's my typical day at Macy's was filled with fun and active co- workers and customers. There was a lot of walking involved and socializing as well. What I learned from working at Macy's was teamwork and how to work with a team which was a lot of fun. My co-workers were funny and made the work environment enjoyable to work in. The hardest part of my job was working graveyards.
good,"it was great. evryone got alone. it was located in the mall.·	Actively promoted business in a variety of settings"
good,A nice place to work very flexible for if you in school. Not much growth for Support team. You have to leave your department to really grow with the company.
good,personally i dont think ppl should work here if they want the pay check but if they want the 25% discount and the 10% discount you get form every store in the mall if you work in the mall then yes this is a great job get hour long breaks only problem is the pay it sucks
good,"was overall good experience, GREAT environment, staff soo friendly however hours and pay not great"
good,"laid back, easy work environment. enjoyed the coworkers, but didn't like the long hours"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Many people. Always in a hurry. A place where sales is everything.
good,"Great learning experience, but didn't enjoy working commission."
good,came in would wait for everyone to show up have a meeting get our game plan if something needed to be done first before our regular day  or if we were to help in another area. always learned new stuff and changes for the stock and how they wanted it set for that month. co-workers were great.  not enough hours year round. i enjoyed working there.
good,"Constantly interacting with customers, handling customer returns, sending out merchandise. Very upbeat and fast paced environment."
good,"Furniture sales can be slow, meticulous work. Each sale can take from 10 minutes to several hours. Often a sale may rely on the customer returning several times before making a decision to buy. Although the furniture department at Macy's an inherently competitive environment, we rely on each other to get things done. "
good,"-Conduct investigations"
good,"Typically, a day as a recovery worker at Macy's, begins at 7:30 to prep the sales floor for the day and potential customers. Job required organization skills and a since of style. Really laid back environment and has a great community of people who genuinely care and have been May's shoppers for years."
good,"Constant training and helping to improve sales and stores, great place to learn , outstanding customer service is taught daily"
good,Worked in Men's Fragrance over the holidays a couple years ago. Staff was awesome and so helpful. Getting to interact with so many different faces from all over the world was awesome. Loved this job!
good,There have been many changes in the industry as well as the company in my time with Macys.  Some changes have been very successful where some have been revisited.
good,"If you are a natural born sales person you will do well here. Macys will give just about anyone an opportunity to be a sales associate. They are very focused on sales goals, the culture promotes some slightly unsavory behavior by associates but retail game has changed. Customers are harder to connect with which in turn causes sales people to have to push harder. Extremely Flexible Schedule and generally laid back environment."
good,"I worked there as a sales associate in the cosmetic dep. But the associates are very aggressive since it is a commission based job, so as a new associate they use you to make more sales by making you ring for them."
good,"Avery busy environment. The holidays is very fast paced and being quick and on your toes is important. I worked in the beauty department specifically fragrance, there are times when it is slow because fragrance prices are expensive. The management is very short with you but nice and welcoming. You can get lost in the crowd if you are not assertive or aggressive with customer service. Being extremely friendly can help you sell a lot fragrances. Unfortunately a seasonal employee do not work for commission so you are selling for the main employees. The most enjoyable part is learning about the different fragrances."
good,"I made a lot of friends who I still am in contact with. I learned to have patience and work in an extremely fast paced environment. Management was great, they really cared about their employees. The most enjoyable part working for Macy's was building great relationships with customers and of course, with the Macy's team itself."
good,"I felt a sense of professionalism in this work environment with most people that I worked with."
good,"Macys inc and mens department was like a family. Very caring, able to solve problems within the company, integrity held highly. At the end of each work day, you know you were productive. Management was very compassionate and able to lead us in the right direction. Training was very helpful in every aspect of the store."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Macy's.  My co-workers were the best.  Management needed some improvement,  but doesn't it always?  Most enjoyable part of job was my co-workers.  The  hardest part of the job was communicating with my supervisor, who had much drama in her life"
good,"-Greet Communication Skills"
good,"For the most part, it was ok. My coworkers were awesome as well as my boss. U get paid every week, which was great. The only bad thing is have to wear a uniform and not regular clothing. I would dress like a customer so people wouldn't know that I work for the store."
good,"-A typical day at work is fun. It's an easy job with flexible hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Excellent place to work alot of pep and praise for goals met and very friendly co workders.
good,"I loved everything about this company when I first started in 2012. I began as a sales associate at Lenox Square. I left later the next year and after a few months reapplied for an administrative support position and was employed and another mall in Atlanta as a seasonal team member. In 2012 I slowly began to dislike what I was doing because it was a very competitive environment in the aspect of meeting daily sales quotas. Co-workers would take your customers and persuade them to buy things outside of your area (that way they could check out at their register and the sale would be theirs.) Besides that, I was close to my supervisor. He would give me extra assignments like sketching layouts of the floor plan, merchandising and dressing mannequins. The hardest part of the job, according to associates with more experience there was advancing. In 2013, as far as working on the administrative side, I liked the idea of my job but just not with the company anymore. I am glad to have taken away with me more skills than I had when I first began."
good,I learned alot of great things with macys call center and met nice people there wasnt really anything hard about the job. Working for Macys was a great experience
good,"good job and great opportunities, login and assist customers to resolve any issues with online orders"
good,Macy's is a pretty nice company to work for. Only irritating part is having to wear all black every day. Kind of feels like im always ready to go to a funeral.
good,"worked in several different departments , assist customers with their purchases"
good,I worked for the Women's perfume department for the holiday season. A typical day was answering general questions and relaying information about products. This was my first job so I learned a lot from this position. I learned how to communicate effectively with unhappy customers. I also learned to communicate with coworkers on certain tasks.
good,Nice coworkers and managment. not enough pay. but great place to work.
good,"Despite how hectic it was working during the holidays, the environment was very good. I was constantly doing something, which is a quality I enjoy in a job. My coworkers new what they were doing, and were always ready to help out customers. My manager understood my needs as a college student and worked around them. I spent the majority of my time arranging the displays and working at the register. At the end of the night, I would close around 3-4 registers and handle the cash back into the safe."
good,"Mostly stocking and customer care but thrived on making everyone feel welcomed and assisted when needed "
good,"Nice place to work , fast paced sometimes. I can't really say much because I only worked at this location for the holiday season but it's pretty big so it's hard to get to know your co-workers but the managers are pretty nice and seem like they try to get to know you and help out the best way they can."
good,It is fulfilling to know that I've helped customers with their purchases and have made them happy.
good,Very slow paced jobs alot of positions you can advance in time and dedication is key for you to adapt to this work place. Very social job need to be able to comfortable help satisfy customers.
good,This job started as a part time position and grew into full time. I enjoyed the staff I worked with but event eventually I needed a job with better benefits and pay.
good,"Typical work day is helping customers, maintaining stock and providing beauty tips/make overs. Working with the customers when new products come out is the most enjoyable."
good,A typical day at work consist of cleaning the sales floor. Maintaining the fitting. Providing customer service. Completing register transactions.
good,Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Very polite and well mannered co-workers and managers. Starting off the work hours and compensation is very reasonable. But I would not recommend long term employment. This would be a great place to work if your in school.
good,"Loved the experience, the beauty of meeting people from different background and countries, love the fact that it was busy and challenging and i learned that when you want something badly you got to work hard for it...."
good,Macy's has a great culture and history as far as the company goes.  Also the associates form a close knit bond.  However the company has made some choices regarding staffing and scheduling that make it hard to consider it a great place to start a career or even hold a full time position.
good,a lot of carrying and walking around with boxes all day! you will learn a lot about the industry
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys is very Busy & exciting. but its very hard to manage. When you come to macys you feel the presence of everybody, the work-place is very exciting, but when you have a job to do, get it done and call it a day."
good,Corporate playground! Great opportunities to really grasp how a national retailer dominates a market. Minor issues with bureaucracy.
good,Helped to put the sales floor back in order after customer handling of the merchandise. Hope to be given more hours.
good,Very friendly staff good place to begin a retail career. Flexible schedule with chance to advance once position opens.
good,"I started this position as a temporary holiday shopper, and it has grown into a position that reviews over night tapes and just this year a year round secret shopper. I will be doing work as needed and keep up on trainings."
good,"I have worked for Macy's since August of 2013. Overall, the other associates are wonderful people to work with. I am a Fine Jewelry Associate. My department is a great one to get into because it really teaches you just about all the basics you would need to know to work in any other department within the store. The hardest part is the mass amounts of paperwork that need to be maintained on a regular basis, which comes much easier after practicing with it for a while. The most enjoyable part is being able to do what I love and making connections with so many customers and really learning about the customers that we serve each day. I have learned entirely too many things to name, and for that I am grateful!"
good,"Would work here again. Very busy productive workday, usually busy and fast paced."
good,"I was there for s short period, but still had fun while getting the job done. Sales goals were met, the team worked together and was very helpful. It was tough the days were the traffic was slow, but we did what we could to drive customers in."
good,"working in merchandising you have to do a lot of work"
good,There were many tasks and customers requests to handle. I learned to prioritize and work with diverse customers and co-workers.  The greatest joy was in making a satisfied customer from a disgruntled customer. It was all enjoyable. I learned to multi-task.  There were some set routines such as opening/closing registers.  Sometimes new accounts required a phone call to complete.
good,I love working at the fragrance department of Macy's.  My customers are very inviting and loving the advice i have to give them.  I attend fragrance classes to inform the customers of the flowers and interesting hormone reacts in each fragrance.
good,"other employees were very team oriented and worked well together, organization was excellent and management was very helpful, as well as flexible with my school/work/parenting schedule. Would definitely recommend jobs here for college students ."
good,"Great place to work to meet new people daily."
good,"Typical day - ensuring executives and associates receive training necessary to perform their job. This includes virtual and classroom training of core competencies as well as follow up on legal compliance."
good,Workplace of many competitive efforts for a strong community. Communication can be a bit short timed.  Thanks to their responsive skills that helped me be an asset to the Macys Customers.
good,A typical day at work for me starts with cleaning up lose clothing off the floor and putting them back on the rack. I also have to make sure that the store is neat and clean so that the it would be presentable and organized for the customers. Another duty of mine is  to handle any questions that customers may have about clothing and sales prices. I help them to find things that they are not sure about such as a certain size for clothing. What I've learned so far from this job is that it give me an opportunity to help people more and be able to speak them. I work well with managment because  a typical day  for us can be very  busy in the store  but the managers try to make sure that each and every person is doing his or her job correctly in a certain manner. The hardest part of my job is when I want to help mulltiple customers but due to the store being busy I may only be able to help one person at a time. Some customers would ask questions that were hard to answer  but  I always take my time to look up  the answer or ask my manager to help to solve the issue. I  often thave to continue to fix up the tables  because the customers would mess  the clothes  and throw them everywhere after I've fixed them neatly but I know this is part of my job in order to serve our customers. Overall  the most enjoyable part of the job is being able  to communicate and help the customers. I  have  enjoyed the experience of working as one of Macy's workers.
good,Working at Macys was fun. Every day you got to meet someone new and hear their stories. The co-workers are friendly and enjoyable to be around. Everyone is extremely helpful and for the most part it was hard to have a bad day at work.
good,"Assist customers with identifying their needs and purchasing merchandise that suited their necessities."
good,Meeting new people everyday spending quality one on one time with each customer ensuring that the quality of their shopping experience is rated high.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Since I'm only seasonal  a typical day at work is pretty hectic and a lot of people are throwing and leaving merchandise around the store learned how to interact with costumers.   like a lot of the managers.  some are strictly business but a lot of the are friendly and supportive.  my co-workers were friendly also for the most part they really helped make it comfortable.  The hardest part is recovering on a very busy day.  The most enjoyable part is making a sale and pleasing the customer.
good,"As far as warehouse jobs go, this was an enjoyable job. Hours were stable, pay was fair, overtime was available if you wanted to work it. My only complaint is that I was supposed to stay on after the seasonal position was ended but there was an occurance within the HR dept that prevented that from happening due to the compaies policy of not hiring on full time from an employment agency"
good,"Daily audit, holds, putting shoes away, cleaning of floor, helping fellow associates."
good,I learned how to handle with different of customers everyday.
good,"Hi,"
good,"My weeks are packed with constant communication, to-do lists, details-details-details, meetings, traveling, executing events… all while staying in budget. I coordinate, manage and execute Macy's in store events for the Mid-Atlantic region. Events include fashion shows, celebrity/athlete appearances, community events, holiday events… and the list goes on. Most people underestimate the time and preparation it takes to create a successful event - there are always moving parts and it's important for all parties to be informed about details more than once. Double and triple checking is essential and very much a part of my day-to-day."
good,A typical day involves alot of recovery of product and trying to find out what your customer wants.
good,typical day at work come in Set everything thing up for the truck to come in start setting everything up to unload the truck.I learned alot about the company as a whole so that was a plus that they really take care of there employers.Management was very good was raelly up front about what he wanted about the job no nonsense but was a very great manager.coworkers where great tought me alot or more so the things i didnt know me doing this line of work before but the things i didnt know so that was great.The hardest part the holidays that was when we where really busy time of the year of course but you get use to it.The most  enjoyable part of the job was the work basically because i like the fast past tempo of the job makes alot time go faster and the coworkers just a great atmosphere.

good,its a great place to work friendly people and great understanding form management
good,"Macys is a great Place to work, Working in the Fragrance department is challenging at times. Sometimes you have to spend a lot of time helping a single customer to convince them of selecting the right scent for them. You have to be a people person."
good,No full time position. But I do help over the summer and holidays
good,Selling items to customers. The staff is pretty knowledgeable  about products and the management is nice. The hardest part is trying to sell the macys card. LP plays favorites though and if they don't like you they might give you a hard time.
good,They are usually very flexible with the balance of work and school life.
good,"Macy's has been a great place to work while in school. I am now looking to advance to a full time career and utilize my English degree. Macy's has taught me excellent customer service skills through training programs and classes, as well as knowledge in setting goals, tracking sales, and coaching sales associates to achieve Home Store and Bridal sales goals. The hardest part of the job is the retail hours, and the most enjoyable part would be working with and building long term connections with customers."
good,"15 minute commute to work "
good,Great company if you work hard and connect with the right people you can go far.
good,"A typical day at work was okay, I came in helped the customers find any items they needed as well as put them back. My co-workers were awsome and we alwasys got along. There wasn't a hard part while I was working at Macy's, I loved the wonderful food they bought us for lunch"

good,One of the perks of working with Macy's was the willingness they had to work around your school schedule. They understood that school came first for me and scheduled me to work on only the days that I was off from school

good,"When I was employed with this company a typical day consisted of me helping others and working in various department's. My main department was the children's department. I obtained skills of integrity,I am assertive,honest,and committed. Management can be described as articulate,professional,and encouraging. My old co-workers were an outstanding crew to work with,trust worthy,honest,understanding,and respectful. The only hard part of the job was when we couldn't provide our customer's with a size,style,or product that they really needed. Especially for when it was a special occasion. The disappointment was the looks on their faces,which made me feel bad,but I know that I had to keep it on a non-personal level,and try to accommodate them with what we had for the inconvenience. The enjoyable part of that job was that I was able to assist customer's,management,and other staff with whatever was needed."

Learn how to use the tool to remove clothing detectors. Management was all over the place everyday I had a new person to report to they were nice but caused confusion to me. Only I had one coworker who was friendly enough to    talk to me daily versus just speak to me because they had to. the hardest thing about the job was learning how to size the designer jewelry the most enjoyable would be speaking with customers day in and day out."
good,"Typical day is organizing specific locations with a coworker or being on the register helping costumers. I learned how to make clothes look more aesthetically pleasing by color coordination, I also learned how to work as a group and how to have fun but remain professional in the work place.

good,"Working at Macy was a fun experience. I would get in every morning and they would be a rally, Macy always had gifts and prices to give out to hard working employees. The down falls of working there was the rumors and drama between managers and employees on different floors. Over all i learned different way to deal with stubborn customers. The hardest part of the job was when they were alot of customers to assist and they were only a few employees to help. The best part of the job was the discount and getting payed"
good,I enjoyed working here overall. Working with customers and being in a nice environment was key to this job. 
good,"Being on call they kind of dont respect your life schedule outside of work and when they want you there, it doesnt matter what it is going on at all.. I understand thats the point of on call but theres no limitations.. Its a fine job tho besides that"

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I do enjoy working at Macy's; the flexibility of your schedule, opportunities to pick up shifts in various areas, and reasonable weekly pay. However, the cons of working at Macy's include the lack of benefits, difficulty in reaching managers when questions need to be asked by employees or customers, and not many benefits. I believe the benefits that Macy's offer come after one has been employed for a very long time. Macy's also doesn't give many hours but is always hiring new people."
good,"I was seasonal, so it was not enough time to familiarize with the company's culture."
good,"I come in and relieve the morning cook, see what I have to prep. Prep what I need and cook what orders come up on the tickets. I've learned to cook meals to order, because most of my cooking was bulk for service lines and dietary lines.The hardest part of the job is balance, schedules are never the same. Some weeks you may have two days on the schedule, others you'll have five and your hours are never the same. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the people I work with and the satisfaction of preparing great dishes of all cultures."
good,"The work is great there when I walk in Macy's I have to deal with the different changes that goes on through out the store."
good,A day at work consisted of racing to get the most customers and trying to make the biggest sales of the shift. Many employees would experience conflict due to lack of communication with customers and with each other. I learned to effectively communicate with people in order to avoid unnecessary confrontation. Management was efficient and worked hard to keep the department organized. Coworkers were driven and motivated individuals that would compete for the most sales. The hardest part of the job were the slow days when sales were tough to come by. The most enjoyable part was the experience I gained in a customer service oriented field. 
good,"good job experience you definitely have tons of opportunities..you can work in the stock team,visual,sales in clothing or cosmetics but that's a little tougher to get. At my location very n ice managers  that simply want you to Sale you are given a daily goal of 1000 bucks or more to sale it can get commutative for there is always other associates on the floor that need to reach their goal, you must open credit @least one a week but to great 3 a week. that can be a little though, if you are full time you must meet all goals..if not by bye, on-calls or PT its a but more casual  for them but of course less money as well, I enjoyed being full time...the pay was over 10 dollars with 37 hours a week i made my goal was nice to everyone and eventually moved up. Good for people who are fun,energetic,social and not concerned with getting asked questions back and forth."
good,The atmosphere of Macy's is always upbeat.  The managers try their best to make working there as fun as possible with goal incentives and just overall encouragement at all times
good,"Each day you are greeted by pleasant co-workers, management and customers. There are always tasks at hand, but with MAGIC training you learn that the customer is always first. We learn  to personalize our communication with customers to create the best experience for them, and success towards our daily goals."
good,Macy's has provided me with a great learning experience. The management and atmosphere with co-workers is productive and quite rewarding. One of Macy's greatest strengths is its continual Magic Training. I have to say what I LOVE most about my time here is the on-going building of my clientele.
good,Typical mall job. Nice because they offered a weekend work option. Only worked Friday-Sunday. Perfect if you're looking for a part time position.
good,You have to reach a sales goal everyday and it can be stressful.
good,"Great company, lack of ability to listen to employees. They cut hours and then hire new employees. Management is great but no one is willing to make changes to ensure their employees stick. Specific departments need specific things and some are left to fend for themselves."
good,"A typical work day was coming in to work, clock in and go to the register to see if any assistance was needed there or if anything needed to be cleaned up."
good,We couldn't interact with other coworkers on a friendly tip.
good,A typical day at work would consist of lots of people busy working and getting task done on time. I learned to deal with various of personalities and how to make a bad day better. My co-workers are fun and upbeat and likes their job. The hardest part of the job is being overwhelmed with customers during busy days. The most enjoyable part is just being able to make everyone smile and enjoy their day at work being upbeat and communitive.
good,Someting different every day. Most enjoyable part is the interaction with the associates.
good,I enjoyed the job during my time at macy's I learned the end's and out's of retail.I loved my co workers very easy to work with.The hardest part of the job was during the holidays when we were slammed with merchandise but we all worked as a team and got the job done.

If merchandise is not in store,search on computer and have it sent to their door. Taking ideas from management on making the best experience of customers shopping needs. Have worked in just about every area of store,have met people from all backgrounds ,from students,encourage them to continue to take with them pride in whatever their dreams are and to continue with their education, the more season coworkers,their time in retail and them looking forward to retirement. The hardest part of the job is trying to talk some into opening up accounts during slow peaks. Just taking the experience and enjoying the moment on this journey"
good,"Great managers, fun place to work at, at a mall. If you enjoy clothing and socializing with the customer, this a place to be."
good,Overall the job is decent management is good and the job security is good.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Wasn't a bad place to work most of the time. Worst part of the job was the benefits. For just myself I was paying $200 a month!!
good,A typical day consisted of: primarily taking care of my customers.
good,Macy's was a great place to learnabout retail. Training was very good. It is an icon and had a good repurtation for training its executives.
good,"Great company to work for, I really like the people, upper management isn't very nice but it's probably stressful. The most enjoyable part of my job as an AST associate is the associates and helping them with any Human Resources related matters."
good,"Macys is a great first job in retail. However I dont see it going much past that. It is not a good place to work if you are having trouble making ends meet. Its more of a side job or a way to get spending money for the holidays. They decided to keep me after seasonal hires were supposed to be let go, and I have only worked 5 days in the past month. Its impossible to pick up shifts now that they have cut shifts so much. My last paycheck was only $64. I love the people that I work with, they are all sweet and genuine people that i really enjoy being around. There isn't anyone you cant ask for help that wont stop what they're doing to assist you. The hardest part of the job is usually very pushy and rude shoppers, but that just comes with the territory. Management was alright. They're nice when they need you to come in, but if you have a schedule conflict they wont really help. They'll just say ""advertise it to other associates"". Well when i needed to go to a very important doctors appointment I dont want to have to hope that another associate will pick up my shift. Not to mention the shift was assigned outside of my available hours. I think they need to pay a bit more attention to employees outside lives."
good,Your average warehouse. Not to hard of work involved. People were friendly. Management were helpful. Sometimes long shifts. The company parties were fun.
good,"a typical day at work, is fairly easy. Management is good, most of the time. Co-Workers are easy to get along with most of the time."
good,Macys.com is a fast-paced environment that has the benefit of carrying the Macys brand yet it functions very much like a start-up. People who get ahead challenge the status quo. It's also rare and great to have direct access to the chairman of the organization.
good,"Macy's was my first real fascinating job, and I can say that I loved it. I was a merchandiser so I got to do many things not just one thing. I loved the hours and the flexibility I had, yes the job was hard labor but it was fun. Working holidays was exciting as well. Didn't like the pay for the labor if I would have gotten paid more I would have stayed but we all need to survive, it was a good job while in school to get me out there. Co-works were nice and I made great friends with them."
good,"A very stress free enviornment. This job taught me how to understand people from all ethnicities and religions. My manager was very laid back and always came when I needed help. The hardest part of my job was recovering the shift before mine, which really wasn't that much of a problem. The best part of my job was having very helpful coworkers to help through out my shifts."
good,"we would come into work at 5 am, to do the morning truck. it would take about 5 hours, depending on how big the truck was. example, 1600 units would be around 5-6 hours. my boss was a great boss, my co workers were good, we worked together to get the truck finished. the hardest part of the job was the job it self. alot of people cant get up at 4 am and be to work at 5 to do a truck, sometimes 2 trucks, which would take till 3 pm. the best part of doing the job was working hard with my co workers and finishing the truck and than get to go home and we already put in 8 hours of work, while people are still in work till about 5 pm lol it was not as bad job at all."
good,"Macys was a great experience filled with great people to work with. I truly enjoyed my experience there. I learned how to use a cash register, communicate with strangers, sell products and membership, open/close store and register."
good,"great working environment, management is great. flexibility to balance work and social life/school.. friendly co workers"
good,Meeting different people from different parts of the world is definetly the best part of the job
good,Delivered Macy’s customer service promise by ensuring quick and efficient register transactions and provided friendly and professional interactions with all guests
good,Very tiring but good breaks and always something to do. Must learn a lot to deal with all the customers questions.
good,"Typical days include following planograms and directives, arranging merchandise by style, type, or certain category."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Easy and productive work day
good,A normal day consisted of providing customers information about the departments products and helping customers with their purchases at the check out. The management was generally fair I got along very well with my supervisor and co-workers. The difficulty of the job came from a policy of the company. I was a part-time worker so in order to keep my job i had to offer the department stores line of credit to customers at the check out. I was tasked with opening a minimum of two to three accounts a week. Problem was majority of my customers already had one or they just did not want one. Funny thing was the customers who already had a line credit were unsatisfied with it and those who didn't want one were against it for the same reason why those who already had one were unhappy. Go figure. Still i enjoyed this job and met a lot of nice and interesting people.
good,"Macy's is a great place to shop and a pretty nice place to work. At the Bollingbrook location, the management team is friendly, responsive and fair, and the workplace culture in general makes it a fun place to be."
good,Good people nice place to work. Good Pay for the job. Good place to improve and advance your skills
good,Good opportunity to dictate one's on compensation based on customer service interactions. Very set corporate structure. Small and timely opportunity for advancement.
good,"Macy's, was Famous Barr Warehouse when i work for them before the company taken over. The managers and the employees work together this was a fast pace job getting the merchandise out to the stores doing each season to come in. I enjoy fast pace, and changes with this i mean where ever in the building has lack of worker you gets the chance to go and help."
good,My typical day consists of training and development for new hires and current employees. I am also responsible for compliance training and on boarding. I also am responsible for job requistion management with dispositiong in HRIS systems.
good,"Days are fast paced and involve alot of time managent, team work, balance and organization."
good,"multitasker, costumer inquiries, coworkers valuable, costumers are suprising."
good,"I would open the register, count it down. I then would put the trash cans away, and go check the floor. I would straighten merchandise, if needed and greet customers. I would check the sale signs and make sure they were correct. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. We all come from different backgrounds, so you get the chance to meet all sorts of people. The hardest part was keeping up during the holidays and being able to make sales during down times. The most enjoyable part was working with customers and helping them out."
good,Macys was a first job for me and I stayed with the company while I completed college. The hours worked well for me at the time.
good,"Great management, good training, good continuing education"
good,"I had a fun time working at Macy's, there were always enough customers and sales to be had; However, the pay and benefits comparatively are very bad."
good,"The men's building is a good, casual place to work. Management is not as strict as others and are easy going. They only ask that we connect with all customers that come into the store and give 100% customer service."
good,working hard to make daily sales goal. well my coworkers are great. its an easy job well customer service rounded
good,I have enjoyed working at Macy's part time. The customers and coworkers are quite enjoyable.
good,"Very fast paced work environment. Multi tasking is a must. Expect to work very long hours around the holidays and inventory. The people that work there are very smart and driven. If you can work in Macy's at the pace they require, you can work any place in the world. It is a very rewarding job if you can handle the high stress. I enjoyed my time there."
good,I injoyed my time there u meet alot of people I was happy with helpin th e custermus ...It was a nice job that I had ....
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and there was never an issue with management.
good,I just stayed with them for a couple of months because of the distance from where I lived and I can't drive on snow. I learned how to organize a department in a retail store.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Although it was nice to have Jeans Friday in the summer and employee appreciation days, it didn't make up for the lack of compensation for the amount of work I was handling. As far as management, my director was hands on the best manager I had ever had and she would fight tooth and nail to get me merit increases."
good,Fun place to work/shop. Can have long hours though during the holiday seasons and big sales.
good,Good
good,"Everyday I would help customers shop, keep a clean area and answered any questions that needed answering. I learned to use the register and how to communicate with customers. The management was average, there was a lack of communication. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for a long period of time in one area. I rather be cinstantly doing a task. The most enjoyable part of the job was the motivation I got from everyone."
good,"A typical day a Macy's is greeting each and every customer with a smile. I make sure that i attend to every customer and pride myself on making their shopping experience enjoyable. I have a number of years in retail but working at Macy's i've learned the magic of selling and reaching goals and working in different departments and working with the managers have been a great experience they are very patient and pleasant to work with, furthermore all my co workers are helpful and and hardworking they understand when a new employee has started they are patient and very helpful with training. I have to say the hardest part of my job is not being able to find a product for the customer and the most enjoyable part of my job is the one on one connection with the customers and making their shopping experience great."
good,"Open the cash register's for morning counting, straighten up items around my area, check and sign off dressing rooms, help customers when help is needed, interact with customers, check out customers on register, close register for store closing."
good,The most enjoyable were your colleagues and the friendships that I made during my tenure. I have learned that one should have an inquiring mind a seek out a mentor for overall development. A typical day was usually engaging with customers or co-workers. Retail is constantly evolving and keeping pace with change may have been the hardest part of the job. Management was very good at providing direction.
good,"I loved working at this store. I was a sales clerk, trainer of new associates, responsible for opening and closing my cash register."
good,"Unpacking, placing, and signing new product;"
good,"Enjoyed time spent here. Worked with sales floor associates little and worked different departments, mainly supplies. Staff were friendly."
good,Made connections with the public. met sales goals. Love helping people.
good,"a typical day would consist of folding clothes to make presentable and neat for customers, as well as organize the entire stock room. Management is nice and friendly and at the same time make sure the job is done well. My co-workers are fun to work with and friendly. The hardest part of the job is working in the stock room. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"A typical day at work includes answering inbound calls and placing orders for customers. I learned how to stay calm in stressful fast paced situations. Management was there for you when you needed them. Co-workers were freindly, young and easy going. The hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer."
good,"Go in, organize racks and sales floor, check fitting rooms, ring up customers, check new merchandise that came in for private brand. give back merchandise to proper deparments. Some management friendly and other not as friendly. Open accounts, Best part was where ever my manager got promoted she would take me with her."
good,I think Macys is a great place to have a work experience.
good,Macy's is a fun experience and is pretty fair with every employee
good,"I started the day at 6 and began unpacking clothes and stocking them on the shelves. I learned organizational skills, teamwork, and the basic operations of the retail industry. The management was friendly and flexible, and the co-workers were punctual and got the job done. The hardest part of the job was waking up early enough to get to work on time. I really enjoyed interacting customers"
good,"Help customers, meet sales goals, clean fitting rooms, put clothes back so customers can find them easier as well as employees helping customers, helping customers pay bills. Sometimes we have events going on like Brazil event or Prom. Sometimes they do special things for the employees especially around the holidays, we play game cards for opening accounts, search and send items, donations, ect."
good,very fun culture enjoyed working here.Was able to meet and workin with all types of people from different backgrounds.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I liked working here except I felt like I was looked down upon by the 2 head managers. Much to my surprise, many of the temporary staff felt the same."
good,a typical work day included helping costumes find different beauty products that helped enhance their natural beauty. I have worked with costumers of all different backgrounds that was the most enjoyable part of my job learning about the different people and being able to interact with them.
good,I was a seasonally worker for both sites at Macy's. It fit perfectly with my class schedule. Before i start my shift i would have to go through security and drop off my bags and jacket. once i got on the sales floor I wouldnt have to check in with any of the mangers because they usually came around to check if everything was fine. the other workers on the sale floor were very friendly and willing to help when a new associate came. What i enjoyed the most working for this company was being able to assist customers.
good,"The jewelry dapartment in particular and the company in general are quite demanding in terms of meeting sales goals, participating in store events, meeting goals for credit applications and so on. Macy's offers a lot of incentives to motivate employees to achieve the various goals."
good,"As the store admin, I was in the pulse of the store. I interacted with all level of associates/management with ease and professionalism, but not in a stiff way.I likes being the go to person and feeling as though I effected change. I enjoyed having structure - as our opening/daily procedures were in place, yet, we/I had to always react to changing priorities which kept the job from being mondane."
good,There needs to be a better form of training for new associates.
good,"On a Daily basis at work I would check my floor coverage for the daymaking sure everyone was present and on time.And had all the tools they needed to achieve the daily goals for credit and sales. Also I would help with stocking merchandise recieved that morning. And throughout the day check sales, and attened many manager meetings."
good,Great place to learn the visual basics! I really learned how to fine tune my visual artistry here!
good,I loved working for the customers to providing them with outstanding service for there insurance needs.
good,I enjoy helping and meeting new customers every day at work.
good,Everyone that worked here just did not seem happy. Not enough hours were ever given out.
good,"This was a seasonal job but i had a great time, i got to express my cheerful side while being at work. the co- workers were friendly as well as the managers. the most enjoyable part of being at santa land is the express on the childrens face , the hardest part i would say was the hetic crowds."
good,Different managers oversee your work although you do have a primary one. They do train you. You are on your feet most of the time.
good,"A typical work day at Macys was fast, i learned how to be patient and put customers needs first. Once consumers are satisfied, business goes well. Co-workers were great we were like a family. The hardest part of this job was dealing with a manager that did not appreciate her associates, non the less i enjoyed what i did which was helping an individual find what he or she needed."
good,Macy's is ok. Though the higher management makes it where they won't be flexible on what's going on in your life at that moment so no changing availability. They are going to go by what you first put on your application so be wise on days you can work.
good,"If you are into retail, there isn't a better place to start than Macy's. Okay benefits, decent employee discount. Advancement is a bit of a challenge if you're working from the ground up but if you have a college degree it's pretty much a lock to advance."
good,"Great associates (although i was alone most of the time). Everyone was very kind and willing to help with any issues that I was having. Great place to start off, if only there were benefits and if only the position was a potential full time position. Overall, it was a good start. I liked the experienced and learned a lot in such a short amount of time."
good,My experience at Macy's was great. I enjoyed the associates that I worked with and also helping the customers.
good,Working as a team throughout the day with a steady paste. Some merchandise may be a little heavy but if you need help with anything you can just ask someone for help.
good,Good company for a high energy; driven executive. Plenty of support from district and regional management
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I loved working at Macys. The environment was nice and I got along with all my employees. I loved helping customers find things to wear and make then happy with their purchase.
good,I enjoy my particular job because I work with a great team and we are there behind the scenes yet playing a key role in the overall operation of the store.
good,"In Macy’s, I worked in different departments. I can say that there was always something new to learn every day. These job experiences have taught me to work as part of a team, and have given me the opportunity to work in direct contact with customers, developing at the same time my people skills. I have also learned how to adapt to different working environments, adjust to priorities, be flexible and willing to learn from the others."
good,"Macy's, Inc. is very focused on having sales associates achieve to their highest abilities. It is difficult to place one standard, however, on a company as a whole when each region is so very different. The opportunities for advancement are available for upper management if an individual is willing to relocate."
good,"I only worked at this company for a short time, but I did enjoy every moment. The environment at the store I worked at was nice and it was great to know that I could talk to anyone in the store management about questions from my direct supervisor to the store's manager. I was paid hourly but I still was required to meet sales goals, but there were plenty of incentives to keep me motivated throughout the Christmas season."
good,"Prior to consolidation of all divisions at Macy's New York, Macy's West ran a stellar division in its own right. Excellent opportunity to grow and mentor others."
good,I have enjoyed working for this company. There are many good people there with high working ethics and dedicated to good cause
good,"Great company to work for, especially if you are starting your career. The particular branch I worked for didn't allow for much advancement or job security, but I'm sure that is different based on location. Overall, management treated with you respect and also commanded respect for the customers, work place, and other employees."
good,This was a good starting point in learning the basics of warehousing. Great management kept everyone on task and focused . I definitely can say i learned a lot working here.
good,"Loved it. Great place to work. I  left only because I was relocating to another  state. "
good,I got to work with some of favorite people I have meet. Sadly the top down decisions from higher ups are harsh and show how little they know about their employees day to day. The pay is also low and they have a hard no overtime rule. Working on under 50k in NYC is a very hard thing to do. With their current lay offs and restructuring of the business I would suggest working for Macy's.
good,This is a great company to work they are very open to diversity they are will to work with your working scheduling associates will to help if you have any questions .
good,"Macy's provided an excellent work culture and they work with employees to advance their leadership, communication skills and career path. Macys provided family atmosphere."
good,"You'll love working at Macys if you're someone who likes to be around the latest fashion, enjoys bing busy doing a variety of floor maintenance upkeep so your department always looks appealing to shoppers who will enjoy the experience.  Enjoyed interacting with the customers.  Being familiar w/merchandise and shoppers (especially regular shoppers this added a more personal and familiar shopping experience  which brought them back repeatedly).  Good feeling of satisfaction helping the men at Christmas time. Loved the discount, opportunities to earn extra Macy money, special extra employee discount day.  Everyone very nice and and willing to help others. The managers are always planning some kind of fun thing to keep moral up. Unfortunately, see a reduction in shoppers and their workforce due to shoppers going to online. Many customers very unhappy with not enough sales people and floor in disaray.  Also, need to improve pay for sales employees; however, their benefits are super!"
good,I enjoyed working for the company I just wanted to expand my horizon and change companies to get a field for a different company and different environments and my goal is to be with a slower pace
good,I loved working for Macy's good benefits good manager positive atmosphere. Appreciates their employees. Family friendly company discount inclusive good ethics
good,"I would say overall i like the area i work in and the people i work with. The associates i work with are encouraging and helpful. While the tasks are the same, each day is different."
good,"A typical day at work is unloading trucks, doing transfers and processing merchandise. "
good,I loved it here. Everyone was warm welcoming and kind. Very helpful and sweet co workers and I had an AWESOME Manager.  Only was there for a few months but I still really enjoyed it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work is early morning for me. Upon arrival I get the equipment for the day and check in with management or lead and begin the tasks given to me. I have learned many skills since being employed from price changes to floor sets, merchandising the sales floor and inventory prep. There's a lot of different people from all sorts of backgrounds that makes working with each of them fun and exciting. the hardest part of the job is not having enough associates to man every department on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility people have to work with you and the feeling of not just a team but a family who truly seem to care about one another."
good,"The company is trying to provide an environment that fosters work life balance. More lenient on work from home and the culture is much more laid back as far as dress code, meeting structure and overall environment."
good,Overall their method of how sales run throughout the store shows how much hard work goes into the process that requires setting sale and inventory display is almost flawless with the help of everyone from all the different departments.
good,Management always looks after your well being. Promotion is based on your ability and work achievement. The management always listens to every employee's views and complaints.
good,"Supporting team members "
good,"It was a good job . The employees were really nice and helpful. It was fairly easy and I had a few responsibilities, like opening cards , working at the register and cleaning fitting rooms"
good,"My day of work consists of me helping customers with order placement, being able to help with price adjustments and anything they need help with that consists of Bloomingdale's inquires"
good,This was a very easy going environment to work in. I thankfully had a great management team within my 14 years of service. I really enjoyed the diversity Macy's continuously displayed.
good,Ha sido una gran experiencia laboral para mi haber tenido la oportunidad de formar parte de este gran equipo de personas que trabaja dia a dia para mejorar el servicio y la atencion a los miles de clentes que visitan esta tienda .
good,Working here at MACYS has been partly enjoyable. There has been times when Ive felt appreciated and there has been times when I haven't. The times when I haven't I have been able to learn from them. I also don't let those times affect my work ethics or behaviors.
good,"Macys is a positive environment, which you can grow and they are supportive of your aspirations. Most enjoyable part of job is the customer, second is the co-workers. The work load was sometimes overwhelming, however you had support from company to do what was necessary."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and great working environment . Management was fair and very professional also, relationship with our customers was great!"
good,Fast-paced work environment. Customer service - most enjoyable part of the job. Must be able to multi-task.  Must be able to promote the application of Macy's Star Rewards Cards.
good,"I enjoyed learning and experiencing customer service in a fast paced, friendly work environment. I enjoyed working with such a fun team and meeting new people everyday."
good,"The job was simple and straightforward. I had shift leads who were happy to assist if I ever had a question. Every day I understood the purpose of my position more and more. The only and biggest downside is that the work was seasonal. If not, I would love to continue working here."
good,"My particular position, Stock Support, was offered to me after my first two weeks in receiving/shipping. Everyone is friendly and helpful, if not helpful then resourceful. Over the course of one year, the joy and fulfillment my job gave me started to blur. Holidays are always busy, weekends and sales time. I was the only one who could fill my shoes and they were large shoes! All and all, it keeps you busy but you don’t have much free time."
good,"Only thing I have to complain about this place is when your a temp worker, it's really hard to get a temp to full time position. Everything else was great, flexible schedule, everybody was fun and nice to be around, and you were fairly compensated for your work"
good,"Always on the move. Never get complaisant while working there. The Job required a lot of walking, so exercise was easily incorporated in day to day activities."
good,"Pros:This is a simple job. Perfect for part timers, easy work. Requires a little hustle. Cons: A lot of kids in their early 20's who have no work ethic, can be irritating work with them."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was fairly happy at Macys, they manage departments differently from hourly to based commission only. I was on commission only so for me it was very clear if I didnt produce I didnt get pay. I most mention management can be poor all depends in what department and the political game is like most big companies however I always felt I was part of it. the inclusiveness felt all around. but I am not sure my experience could be the same for everyone. overall I was content to work there and the benefits were amazing, definitely accompany to work for the long term and perhaps to retired there as well. "
good,I work at two different locations during that time i work at putting new product in the sales floor signing and making the area looks beautiful and  clean . like Macy’s work in sales and commission sales and have a great time .
good,"It’s a very sophisticated work environment, very clean.Schedule is fairly flexible. Salary is not bad I would work for them back but in another location."
good,"I enjoyed my time as a store Detective. I despise thieves, and was able to catch them and recover stolen goods, and have the subject arrested. I provided excellent surveillance video to law enforcement for prosecuting."
good,"My typical shift at Macy's started with emptying the racks of product brought from cargo to my floor. After all products were either placed on the sales shelf floors or brought to the back, I would then replenish my shelves or assist other departments. Occasionally, I would also help with the product displays."
good,Clients are given the best of service to promote the best purchasing experience to allow for continued business relations. Customer Satisfaction is always the prime focus.
good,Maybe my review will change next year but so far so good. I hope things will remain good and I think they will. Let’s just see what the Near future holds.
good,"Macys was a good environment to work in, I learned a lot and loved doing what i did. There was a lot of opportunities there as well. To grow and learn more."
good,Professional and efficient environment. Managers and employees are approachable and easy to work with which made it a pleasant work environment. Considerate about work life balance which made scheduling easy.
good,Nice place to work. Just does not pay enough for the work I put in. My co workers and my managers were very nice and worked with me. I just couldnt make ends meet with this income.
good,"Overall, a good company to work for but low pay for the amount of work you have to do.  Sales associates and management team are great to work with.  Everyone is friendly and kind.  Feels like a family."
good,"Macy's is a very flexible, efficient place to work in. Benefits and work/life balance are great. The culture is friendly and not too corporate. It's a great place to grow your career."
good,I worked in the santaland department. All my co-workers were jolly and friendly for the most part. The supervisor in the santaland were very friendly and helpful. However if you are a sales associate printing out the photos its a different company. They are often rude and unprofessional.
good,"I began as a seasonal employee and picked up as many shifts as my schedule would allow.  My work ethic was noticed by the management and I was offered a position after the holiday season ended.  I later took a seasonal management position and left after the season to continue my bachelor's degree.  The work itself is easy and predictable, but the challenge comes in working with the public; you never know what you're going to get.  I met great people who were both customers and employed by Macy's.  Working a job like this is a great way to gain experience in dealing with people at work and as a way to help you get through school, because of its flexibility.  Compensation is definitely greater when you work a department that earns commission."
good,Its a ok place.Its like a family u are working with.Management is great so far. And it is flexible.I love Macy's so honestly i have no problem at all just loving it
good,"Typical day of work is relatively easy, always something to do when not assisting customers. Co-workers and managers are helpful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is how fast-paced everything is during the holiday season."
good,"a typical at Macy's includes , sales returning and managing "
good,"•	Gained experience in sales management as well as client satisfaction & retention"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys has a growth opportunity, I wish they would take it there are no hours but a lot of open positions. It’s very confusing and I really wish something’s would be clarified."
good,"A good  place to work."
good,Very relaxed environment. Can get busy at some moments. But managers and supervisors are always willing to help if you get swamped. Coworkers are very friendly and always have your back.
good,"Every day I learn new skills:-"
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for, also there is a lot of opportunities for advancement. I can say if you loving working in a great environment Macy's is the place to be."
good,"I like to work with Macy’s good company and a lot experience how to reach your goals, I worked with best team we shared the knowledge to make the jop easy"
good,It all depends on which job you have that will make u happy or make you mad. As for a receiving clerk it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Days go by pretty fast.
good,I worked during the holiday season and it is a great place and you do feel the magic of the holidays. It does get busy towards the end of the holiday and the people who I work with where just great people.
good,"Macy’s offers great pay and benefits but you do the job of 5 people wearing many hats.  The company is trying to save money where they should be spending it.  "
good,"work hard, you'll end up having the right opportunity. Be patient, your time will come. Do not be so easily to trust associates. Be careful and calculated."
good,I enjoyed the energy that came along with working at a company such as Macy's. The staff and management team were friendly and I enjoyed my time working for the company.
good,"Macy's was a good job just not enough work hours, I would recommend this company. I would go back and work for them if given the chance. I will be applying real soon."
good,"A typical day would be helping unload merchandise from the trucks and stock them in individual cages, among other deeds asked by management, The job is tough and demanding but once you get a feel of things time flies by."
good,"Just like a normal retail store, you have your busy days and then you have your slow days. Even on our slow days, we find something to do such as recovering the floor, repining the mens dress shirts, restocking the shoes, etc. After being there for a year, I am still learning new things everyday."
good,"The work environment was great, but the pay could have been better. Management was nice and friendly. They were easy to approach. Training was fun. Like any retail store, there's a lot to clean at the end of the day."
good,"I had a nice experience at macy's! they have flexible hours, and they reward employees. Black Friday and christmas is intense, but the employees are well paid."
good,First job I ever had. I can remember walking into the department store. A new employee ready to begin a new job. 2 years I spent under the hustle and bustle of a retail whirlwind.
good,Positive vibe and culture.  A busy environment.  Management is fairly attentive nad supportive.  Job is nit overly complicated.  There is always a lot to do but staffing levels may make shifts feel overwhelming.
good,"Very busy,. Sometimes not enough workers to cover work. Learned a lot and interacted with customers .   I had fun working with people and helping people 😁"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a Jewelry Sales Associate I had the duties of assisting customers find the perfect piece. Wether it was a necklace, ring, a pair of earrings or just a simple everyday watch."
good,My first job when i graduated. The one thing that i notice the most is the lack of benefits of seasonal associates cause im one of them. Thats all i have to say.
good,"Some of the managers seem to not really care about employees, or if they are doing their jobs. Some of the employees don't really care and are there just to be there."
good,Working for Macy's has been a great experience I got to work with customers experience different departments get to meet and greet people it just experienced a different store
good,"The staff were very friendly and I loved working there. I just wished they paid more. I liked Macy's, I really can't say anything bad about the company."
good,"Very big store, but workers were in their own sections such as womens, mens, shoes, etc. Environment was nice and lively with music playing everywhere all day."
good,"There was room for advancement here, the coworkers were pleasant and helpful. The job was challenging but satisfying. The ability to pick up and swtich shifts was very nice for a flexible shift."
good,If more hours were available I would still be working for Macy's!!  I enjoyed my time there (4 years). I had wonderful management and team player co-workers.
good,"Fast paced company, and the best of the best in traditional retail.  Company follows traditional hierarchy roles, but contains strong leadership and numerous opportunities to move up and around the organization."
good,"the work environment ""s ok .  like you can take 15 min breaks every two hours of worktime & depending on how many hours you working their is 30min or 1 hour lunch break also , have meet such a nice friendly people …..most of employees are very helpful . however, poor management , a lot of employees & few working hour even so you work all weekend !!! specials ,working at jewelry stressful  a lot work you do for a littlie pay !!!"
good,"the interaction with store sales associates was inserting and informative  call from inside and outside of USA. new information learned about brand mane products from sales  people.It was fun to finally meet trainers and associates from other locations during training events. New things were learned each day with your co-workers, I loved hearing what happens on the sales floor  from the sales  persons."
good,fun easy to catch on to what to do sometimes felt a bit repetitive but the hours were good and the over time was great and the people where nice and accepting
good,My coworkers were friendly and taught me everything I needed to know when I first started working at this company. It was a fun experience even though I only worked for a short amount of time.
good,"I worked as a seasonal merchandiser, so I had the early am shifts. It is definitely quick paced but is also a very fun place to work at. Discounts on clothes"
good,"I was at Macy's for 25 years."
good,I enjoyed working for macys for a little over two years. I liked the pace of the environment and my co workers. The management could be a little iffy sometimes but over all were good. The store I worked at unfortunately closed.
good,Great job management is cool some days can be stressful specially during holidays customers aren’t the nicest but all around isn’t a bad job at all I would recommend it
good,The most attractive point about working in Macys is employee discount. The working hours are flexible but always changeable. The money paid is so low that I cannot make a living only on this.
good,When I first started working there I was very excited the management was very welcoming and they thought me the ropes real quick and if I ever had a question or concern they always listened and helped me by showing me what needed to be done.
good,"I enjoyed my job working in the Houston Distribution Center. It had wonderful perks, great pay, and I actually enjoyed going to work every day. The only thing I was not a fan of was the fact so many people had to be laid off. Management doesn't seem to care to try to work with you either when you need your job for your livelihood."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,There are some people great to work with and some aren’t. Normal workplace. Just not enough hours off peak season. Peak season is good just hectic. Overall I will refer this job to people.
good,"I like the work environment, fun management and how the system works. Need to focus on taking care of the employees like how they took care of the customers."
good,"Working at Macy's everything is the same thing every day. The management may try to spice it up but it is the same thing every day it was a year ago and it will be a year from tomorrow. Sell, Sell, Sell than recovery and get as many credit card applications as you can."
good,I had the time of my life working at Macy's!  My co-workers were great and management were friendly as ever.  We had bonus goals to achieve such as new accounts and they were fun to work towards.
good,"The shifts are very flexible, you can use the online website to pick up shifts and do various other things. During the season I had a hard time getting shifts as they were all taken."
good,"Been working there over 9 years; I have done many jobs and still do 4 now. I'm never recognized for the work I do anymore. I clean up after mangers and other staff. I maintain a clean and safe environment, which some others leave equipment around for people to get injured. I replenish the merchandise on the sales floor, since rarely anyone does it. This company needs a lot more people to work there in various positions, to keep the store clean, well supplied, and well managed. I just see so many mistakes happening that never gets fixed."
good,"I had a wonderful work experience, the people were friendly, was not too stress full I would refer to a friend my manager was very stern but also pleasant to work with."
good,It's been a joy working for Macys. In view of the retail climate in our times; Macy's is fighting a good fight. I endeavor to help in the success of Macy's.  I feel loyalty for my employer.
good,Working at Macy's throughout the Holiday Season was exceptionally fast paced but extremely rewarding. I gained experience in one of the world's biggest Stores and obtained something exceptional to place on my resume. The initial training was one of my critiques as it was solely Computer based and there was no involvement of Hands on training on the sales floor.
good,Wonderful work experience and always customer service oriented. Great place to work and the constant connection with customers always makes the job more rewarding.
good,Un ambiente laboral excelente pero salario muy bajo para todas Las exigencies que piden...
good,Very fast-paced work environment. Always something to do in the office. Best part of the job is helping customers find solutions to their problems or questions.
good,Work at Macy's for 14 years at first it was all fun to work and see the changes for the better and the needs of the customers and also the employees. Working at this company is great to earn experiences in sales and management and to earn extra income.
good,"If I was to describe what life at Macy's is like, I would say it is an environment that does provide an opportunity for growth and development where you can create lasting relationships between co-workers and customers."
good,nice place to work holidays were tough over time required late nights also were required customers were mostly friendly. peers were great to get along with.met a lot of people
good,"Flexible scheduling,Good discounts and fun place to work.Management needs some work but other than that this company is a pretty decent place to work for."
good,"It’s a great place to work, but the pay is not good. It make the people not want to work there and when they do work there, they really start not to care."
good,smooth and easy going work days it was busy during holidays but haad  great  co workers n bosses i also learned how to fit women bras n finding out how to do picks on the floors n all departments
good,"It was a seasonal job, so there wasn't any extra time off. The pay was good for an entry level job. The management was helpful and considerate. The hardest part about the job was standing for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and the customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Arguably the best job I had to date, and would recommend this job to anyone. The job is not difficult at all, and my coworkers were all very helpful and friendly. However, no hours are guaranteed as part-time."
good,"Macy's has a very well-paced work environment. There were opportunities to become more acquainted with other departments within the store, which also added to one's skill sets as a sales associate."
good,Pay is not high as some other stores but you get your promised bonus.You have to steal from them to get fired.job security.some managers are respectful.account executives are friendly.I would work for them again if they pay more.
good,Busy day as a sales associate. The majority of clients are pleasant and receptive to your assistance. Educating them and directing them to the right product is rewarding
good,"My typical workday consisted of many behind-the-scenes roles, such as coordinating with department managers to accurately fulfill patrons' online orders, and participating in team-building exercises."
good,"Macy's was a fair employer."
good,"A typical day at work could include assisting customers, putting out stock, setting sales. Many of the customers truly need your help and it is a joy to assist them. They truly appreciate it. The manager in my department is the real deal. She jumps in daily to help out with any of the things she expects you to do. She's putting out stock, she's assisting customers, she's answering any call you put in to her. The hardest part of the job is having to tell people we don't have the exact item they want. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a smile on someone's face, whether it's helping them find what they needed or just listening to a story they need to tell."
good,Advancement is limited. Management only cares about those that work the sales floor. The backbone of the store is the support those that get out the merchandise and make sure all standard are met and those individuals are not acknowledge for the hard work
good,"A typical day at work was opening up registers, cleaning the back counter and after that do fulfillment which was get the items that were order online. I learned to always look at the schedule and see who had showed up and sent them to their spots and review our day to see if we had any promotions that day. Management was great we had more than 3 mangers in the store at all times. The hardest part of work was not having everyone in the same energy than the whole team. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping out costumers and making them smile."
good,I learned to deal with all people and act as a team. It was very fast paced which made the days go by faster but it was also hard. I had to learn on the fly which was tough.
good,Good place to work; Excellent store with lots of options for employees to move within departments.  Management is open to suggestions from employees.  Management seemed to try to accommodate employee requests for changes.
good,It was nice opening up and meeting so many people drom different places around the world was fun. A lot of foreign people came in and really helped my coustomer service by talking and showing them our new inventory to talking about personal life. Macy’s was a really good job I had.
good,Macy's was a nice place to work. Very fast paced. Worked during the Christmas Season. Staff was friendly and helpful to new people. I worked in every non-leased department in that store.
good,"I had a great time working with a team of great people including the Managers. If you're looking for a part time jobs, especially during the holiday season I would say check out Macy's."
good,"This particular Macy's had friendly, helpful employees, was well-stocked, and had strong management.  As a seasonal fulfillment employee, I became aware of the inadequate space that this particular store allocated for this department.  Associates barely had enough workspace to safely perform the required duties for this position."
good,"I started as seasonal receiving receiving, my supervisor saw that I had the aptitude to do more then receiving and I was able to work with the fulfillment program, cosmetic support and signage.  Working in the three different areas gave me a nice overview of the company and allowed me to move into signage once the seasonal hire was over."
good,Enjoy co-workers and clients.  Especially like merchandising for enhanced presentation. Use mainframe computer.  Process new product.  Return product to vendor as requested.  Attention to detail.  Other duties as needed.
good,"My job was a simple, entry level position as a signer for the Men's section. It was a simple job and they kept it simple. I only had an issue with my supervisor who refuted any new ideas on how to  be more effective or efficient. Having  been in supervisor positions myself, I understand that some things are out of even your hands and cannot be changed, but her approach (refusal to even hear anyone out without explanation) was off-putting"
good,"The management at the Macy's I work at is solid and willing to be flexible if you need time off. It is very busy in support especially with fulfillment and online orders. Always work needed to be done. People, especially in support, are ready to help out."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Management was not the best and you were always looking over your shoulder wondering who was going to get fired. The pay was not great and theft was very high.
good,They lunch only an hour and transportation is to much cause its far . the people thats there some are mean and some are nice. The pay isn't that good cause you get paid every week on a Friday.
good,"Was able to be trained in multiple areas of the warehouse. "
good,I had a very busy life and needed this job and Macy's helped me create a schedule that benefited me! Their training was pretty easy and whenever we needed help we were given it.
good,You learn the ins and outs of managing a team. There is a heavy emphasis on building relationships and putting customers first. There is also room for expressing creativity in tackling challenges that produce results.
good,"Macy’s has always had the best executive training program and advancement opportunities. While malls are losing the favor of many consumers, this department store legend remains one of The places to work in retail"
good,"A typical day was opening registers and helping customers. Goals to be met were sales goals, charity, and opening credit cards. The atmosphere was fun."
good,Great workplace for college students looking for a seasonal job. Atmosphere is very friendly and motivating. Most definitely room for growth. Management can be tricky to get a hold of and communicate.
good,Working at Macy's has been an overall great experience. Everyone was very sweet to me and no one would get angry at you if you did something wrong since you're new. AST really sucks though. They don't know how to do their job right but it's not something that will ruin your experience completely. It was usually pretty busy on the sales floor and you always had something to do when working as recovery which is great in my opinion. I liked being in fullfillment the most because everyone there is always in good spirits and most roles are easy and simple to do.
good,This job allowed me to see a busy retailer at peak times such as Black Friday. This was my second ever job and it allowed me to really hone my collaborative efforts with my coworkers.
good,"The job could be stressful at times, especially during the holiday season, but it is a great place to hone and nurture your customer service skills. With the right manager in your department and hard work and dedication you have job advancement opportunities."
good,Macy's work environment is nice and everyone is helpfull. The reason i wanted to move because of its took too long to go there. there is not much good comunication to go there.
good,Good time wouldn’t recommend night shift for students fun environment good food in cafeteria cool supervisors dumb coworkers breaks are paid lunch is not
good,"its easy money honestly. just listen to your trainers and supervisors and your manager, you’ll be okay. 30 minutes lunches and 15 minute breaks depending on the shift you get."
good,Macy's is a seasonal position where I stock and create stands for merchandise. It is a nice environment to work in and I will continue to work there every holiday season if allowed.
good,"I enjoyed working at macy's, the coworkers and manager were polite and I got along with everyone there. I didn't have any problems with any customers either and if there was to have any problems I handled the situation properly."
good,Management was very poor when it came to solving problems or figuring something out. Schedule was messed up. My money was messed up as well as far as me getting paid.
good,"I really enjoy working at Macys. every job is tough but I find enjoyment in it, which makes it easier and enjoyable. flexible shifts are there to be picked."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Loved the job just the traveling and the transport to work...My schedule and driving alone played apart on my not returning every season to work,,case I would if they were closer"
good,"I learned so much about customer service as was implemented at Macy's. My fellow employees were helpful, and the environment allowed for personal innovation within a defined employment goal. My manager was always there as a support system, and provided constructive reviews to help me improve my abilities. This is a skill set that I will be able to carry with me into whatever profession I decide to pursue."""
good,"In December, I will be there for 16 years, I enjoy what I do. I’m just looking for a more work life balanced job , and where I can continue to move up the ladder , not be penalized because my degree is not in retail management."
good,"Good people and environment. Customer service was always first. Very helpful staff throughout the store, willing to make sure that the customers get the best shopping experiences."
good,"At the time I worked there , the scheduling was not one that I felt was focused on meeting the needs of the customer.The Store Manager was awesome ,she had a lot on her plate, and needed a more supportive staff.The most enjoyable part of the day was working with guests and celebrating the wins. The supportive office staff was amazing. Merchandising staff was always short handed and so as a Sales Manager would often find myself doing floor sets."
good,I loved working at Macys.  The people were great and would go back if they offered the interviewer position to me.  I did it 2017 and 2015.  Unfortunately they no longer have that position as they do most of their seasonal hiring via phone.  The only thing they could offer was possibly a floor sales position at $9/hr and as I live 45 minutes away that was not practical.
good,"Customers can be frustrating sometimes, or really stuck up, but I feel like while working in cosmetics its definitely built my patience with individuals. Love my managers and coworkers, they are some really  I look up to."
good,"Macy's was a nice place to work, but the location we were in at Jamestown Mall left us with little business so there wasn't much to do a lot of the time."
good,"During the Christmas holiday shopping season sales operations at the 34th Street flagship store are often frantic and stressful with customer and visitor interactions that demand patience and steadfast resolutions interactions. Please do not think that this made working at the flagship store lacking of  accomplishments and enjoyment, on the contrary it was stimulating,  challenging and fun."
good,"My job was sales associate. I maintained the department, which included, cleaning, picking up and organizing, helped customers with the choices, or checked stock or computer, opened accounts, cashier."
good,Working for Macy’s can be a great opportunity. You can advance quickly if you have the right skill set. You will also enjoy the generous discounts. My only complaint is the medical insurance. It’s expensive and doesn’t cover nearly enough. I recommend getting your insurance privately.
good,"Loved being able to help customers and making sure they left happy. Work days were busy, but the environment was fun. Good coworkers and Macy's  discount was a plus."
good,the management at macy's was lacking any backbone in assisting the associates when having problems with customers.  The policy was for associates to be in the wrong rather than the customers.
good,Overall a great place to start your career but going forward it depends what you want to do.  Knowing the good people there can help you really build a career
good,Macys is a good place to work. It is a nice environment with growth potential. They are very flexible with schedules. Managers are great about helping in different work situations.
good,"I worked in the support department, so my experience can be pretty different compared to some. Most support personnel work morning shifts. Macy's counts on you being able to do your job without a whole lot of micro management. Once you learn your tasks, they leave it up to you to accomplish."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's because of the management. My managers/supervisors were great, and coworkers were helpful as well. The hours were to too long, and it was not too stressful."
good,"the day begin with open all the registers in your departments, in my case 3 registers and make the fulfillment (check if the area has any on line order and pick up the items and bring them to customer service), I learned too how to use the register, one o the duties is be a cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job is te interaction with the customers."
good,"Working at the alarm center gave me the opportunity to work on my computer,typing skills. I enjoyed my time there and a discount was definitely a lovely perk."
good,"My work experience at Macy's was good overall. I would hope the pay rate could be better for the amount of work done on a daily basis."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of unloading trucks and placing the merchandise on to pallets, then locating them. I learned how to work as a team member of a warehouse environment. The workplace culture was a helpful and friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the number sequences on the scanner to work in different sections of the warehouse. The most enjoyable part was knowing i had done my part as part of a team in order to keep the warehouse functioning smoothly."
good,Fun place to work. Enjoyed working with a diverse group of people and I really enjoyed my job until the passing of my mother. I loved the paid time off and I also wish I could work for them again
good,"I understand that not every job will provide the desired income we all need, however, working here as a sales associate, is okay. Eventually, the more you show through your hard work, the more benefits and opportunities are offered to you."
good,"It was a great experience. Hours are flexible. A typical day would consist of cleaning the fitting rooms and returning clothes to the proper places. Also, if it got really busy, I would jump on a register to move lines faster. Depending on which department you worked in each day, it can get pretty hectic. For example, the kid's floor would always be busy whereas the home and textiles floors would rarely get busy. But busy is good, because you're always moving and time goes by faster."
good,"Worked here as a part time job while during school. Worked early morning, relatively laid back atmosphere with good fellow employees. Pay was a bit low, but the work was perfect for me at the time."
good,"Overall, Macys is a good place to work. Unfortunately, there are a lot of reorgs that are currently taking place. As with any reorg organizational changes departments will be merged and employees will have to adjust."
good,I learned many warehouse functions while working at macy's. I have also developed many other soft skills. This is a great place to grow and get better. The hardest part is being on night shift. Every part of life has to be scheduled and planned out when on night shift. In the long run it's difficult and hard to keep up with. Management is great about giving you opportunities when you ask for it.
good,"Checking in, counting register, morning break out."
good,I work macys just in the winters for about 4 winters starting as a bus boy up to a prep cook in the winter of 2016 I enjoy working in the walnut room BoH
good,It was fun but sometimes it was hard working on every holiday. No family time. Work odd hours sometimes. Long hours and staning for long period of times.
good,"Once I was comfortable performing the duties required of my position, I really enjoyed this job and all the various possible duties that I might be doing daily. My co-workers and management were easy to work with and helpful when needed. My only issue was not always getting schedule for the amount of hours that I would have liked to have."
good,"Working at Macy's is a very enriching experience. The location I worked at had an abundance of hardworking, friendly, and understanding individuals who truly enjoyed being at work. The company's emphasis on organization and structure is very apparent, which made it much easier for me and my co-workers to be productive."
good,"My day mostly consisted of helping customers find their desired shoe and cleaning up after their messes. Also, we were incentives to get people to sign up for a Macy's card, or upgrade their existing one."
good,Macy’s has a lot of raffles through out the year always passing buy to participate. It’s an okay job I feel like it’s not a job for younger people. It’s sitting down the whole shift
good,"Macys is a fast paced depending if its busy or not , highly recommend as a entry level job, management is helpful and listens to customers, they compensate you for the all good reviews."
good,"I loved working at Macys, the team was amazing and the job flow was nice. The only reason why I stopped working there was because the store in my area closed down."
good,"Good work environment, busy for the most part (this particular location) therefore always keeps you on your toes. Lots of training and refresher classes for every department. Good length of break time. Associate discount is ok."
good,"Great Holiday job, but Macy's is changing and growing so it may not be the same Macy's experience that I had, but the management cares about you and that is very important when you are in school or have a family."
good,"I love my job and my co-workers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"it is a nice place to work, the employees are helpful and work excellent as a team. the pay needs to be improved.  Employees provide the support needed to learn and move on."
good,The job was fast pace and had versitility. Meeting newe faces everyday and the job provided room to grow in the company. The workplace provided skilled training and paid attention to detail and the customers needs.
good,"The Macy's I worked at was mainly Spanish speakers, so my day at work was usual confusion because I do not understand Spanish. I learned how to use a computer faster."
good,The customers are truely what makes you enjoy ur job when you can find that one person who has the hardest time finding shoes  find some comfortable and  stylish shoes it makes the job completely worth it
good,"Overall enjoyed my experience, I was not allowed to take a vacation because I was a part time worker which provided some complications.  However, I was offered another job when I returned from my vacation"
good,"I worked in the corporate office under the event administrator. Although it is a temporary position, I was exposed to many opportunities and people. Working behind the scenes for big events. We got paid every week! Which was a plus."
good,The compensation was competitive for the industry and benefits were very good. The hours during the holiday season are very demanding especially for salaried management
good,Enjoyed working at Macy’s great co-workers. Only thing I would like change would be the General Manager who had favorites. Other than that it was great working there meeting new people and interacting with them.
good,They did a great job of building a team. My director was fantastic. I only left because it was time for me to move on. The job compensated you for your contributions to the bottom line. Your pay was reflective of how well you did. Honesty goes a long way with this company.
good,	Conduct and investigate internal theft issues
good,I loved it it was my best job yet I’ve worked at Macy’s twice in two different city’s I miss working there to be honest best experience I have ever had
good,"Morning Meeting- it was encouraging, fun environment, low wages, morale was high, it was high paced work place at times, holidays  were entertaining. Managers were nice too."
good,"I had came in to work toward the end of the year! So it was boots galore in the women's shoe department! Very productive, upbeat, fast paced environment to be in!"
good,I was wrongfully terminated from one of the previous managers that were working with at the time. I enjoyed buying some of the clothing. During holidays it gets pretty busy.
good,"This is a great place to work, especially if you hate shopping. All you need is right at your fingertips."
good,"West County location is always relaxed, even during the holidays. I enjoyed working with the employees. Everyone was positive and welcoming. I rarely interacted with management."
good,A great company. Value and importance of customer experience very important. Opportunities for company growth and development. Employee engagement a priority for the company.
good,"I enjoyed my job even though it was a bit demanding.  I learned a great deal about packing, shipping and how a huge warehouse is run. Seasonal work..."
good,It was my first job and they were very understanding. Work tasks-varied and we were expected to learn a variety of skills. There was not a lot of direct management as it was a large department store. Luckily the manager that I worked under made the experience worthwhile.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"a regular day working at macys would be calming and towards the middle of the shift it gets very competitive with the other employees "
good,A typical day is fairly routine. Most days require the same tasks.  Good management team in store locations. Communication issues between corporate office and store locations.  Routinely find out about changes to policies and procedures after they have been in effect.
good,Company is great to work for. Excellent benefits for employees. CEO and upper management were amazing but floor managers promoted according to acquaintances not performance.
good,"Builds strong relationships with others by [task],  seeks creative alternatives such as team building that drove [results] and clever and imaginative when confronted with obstacles. Is continuously experimenting to drive results and initiates and executes creative ideas such as display tables, always seeking new ideas and approaches"
good,"Fast-paced work environment, learned to work solo and as a team to accomplish Quota's. Management was amazing, workplace culture  was fun environment."
good,"This is not a job for those with anxiety or easily stressed, this job has a lot of pros but a lot of cons , also it will seem like the best place to work at first but that will quickly change."
good,"This was my first retail job, previously I worked in high-tech and bio-tech companies for 20 years...major job shift.  I made this change because I wanted to understand and learn about the beauty industry I made a career change as a Skincare therapist/Esthetician."
good,"working at macys was fun. You went to work, the work was easy and simple and no one bothered you. I enjoyed the people I worked with I was a very friendly place to work. the management toward the end was questionable but I would work there again."
good,Great company to work for. Pay isn’t great but the company does care. Managers were very helpful in coaching and setting you up for success. Trainings for product knowledge.
good,"I worked in cosmetics so even when it was slow I had something to do. Management was great actually, worked well with me. Everyone was super welcoming."
good,I enjoyed working with the employees and the customers were great. The management was empathetic towards the the staff when ever things would come up.
good,It had a great work environment but overall the work experience was kinda unpleasant. We did to much work with very little recognition. Management was understaffed and when needed to communicate with management they were no where to be found or to busy. Security was also very hard to contact which made it easy for shoplifters to steal.
good,"making sure all displaces were clean and shoes lined up correctly."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was a great company with plenty of opportunity to grow. The compensation was low and not very competitive. The culture was amazing. They have an open door policy which promotes a healthier work environment.
good,the people i worked with are fun and help pass the time. there's something about working in the women's shoe department that really brings in business.
good,Great work environment great work place Great Food On Lunch Breaks Great Work Hours Fair Management overall great job I would recommend it to my pairs
good,"Its high paced but easy to keep up once you acclimate. Picking is much more demanding than packing but your days fly by as you walk among the shelves. Packing is low effort, even with conforming to company packing standards."
good,"This job is decent, it would be hard to do for a long time. It is a lot of standing on your feet, and at my store we did all of our own visual.  Otherwise, it was a really fun job, and the customers were wonderful and always very appreciative of recommendations."
good,"When working in the furniture department it was a very enjoyable time, from assisting customers to assembling new furniture when it got delivered. I learned a lot about how furniture and mattresses were made as well as how to solve sometimes very difficult customer service issues."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"retail is not an easy job but it can be rewarding.  you are on your feet all day but for breaks and lunch  if you like helping people and pleasing them this may be a job for you.  you interact with customers helping them locate an item, ordering for them if item is not in the store, you operate the cash register and close at night/open in the morning.  you are responsible for clearing the dressing rooms and do a check at least every hour.  you put back clothing and merchandise that are returned, left in dressing rooms or on the counter.  you sort merchandise and return it to the proper department.  making sure that the department is neat and everything is returned to its rightful place is also part of your job.  you are assigned to a department but on occasion you may be asked to fill in somewhere else in the store if needed"
good,"This job does take a lot out of you, you can be extremely tired and lazy. The work itself is not difficult at all, but it can be slow at times. Do not get used to slacking off or being talkative. Certain departments the workers do their work but in some they do not. Management for the most part are very helpful they do have some who are too serious, have favoritism towards some employees. The people there are nice for the most part some times it will feel like high school with the gossip."
good,"I started in the lingerie dept, then was promoted to women's moderate clothing, and then I was promoted to fine jewelry dept where I worked for 4 years. Here I sold fine jewelry for regular salary and commission. It was a lucrative position."
good,The hardest part for me was the hours.  I was trying to go to school and work at the same time and it was too much for me.  The environment is fast paced especially in the peak season.  This is not a job for you if you are lazy.  It is what you make of it and it was great for me because I like to stay busy.  You work till you get a break and then you work so more.  There was no down time.  The managers and staff were incredibly helpful.  I really enjoyed the job.
good,Very fast pace job since it was based off sorter not to much room for improvement but got bills paid great job for someone looking to have a stable partime
good,"I loved working at Macy's, however the management there was all about favoritism and the benefits weren't reasonable for my budget. I would go in and start out with packing/ shipping. I got 11.00 an hr in that department, six months later I got a job opportunity for active 12.00 an hr. It was fun while it lasted however the management was favoring the seasonal workers and treating the older workers like we didn't matter."
good,"very fast paced work environment, always something to do around the store whether be fixing displays or folding/ hanging clothes. "
good,"Hardest part of the job was balancing all the work load at once, especially during Christmas time. Between helping clients, attending the register, making sure the fitting rooms were picked up and organized, and make sure all go merchandise went to its designated department. It was a lot of work to do but the competitive edge versus the other sales associates made me strive."
good,"Macys was my first retail job that thought me what it was like to attend customers, and how fast you have to be to make sure every customer is satisfied. It was fun to sell to customers, giving them options to chose from, and giving them great customer service. The team was also nice even though competitive, we would all help each other which made working fun."
good,"Strive to get customers to get a credit card and buy items they’re not likely to return. Working in fine jewelry is one of the harder departments to work in. Every diamond sapphire and emerald must be tracked whether it be a sale, return, new merchandise or case move. Also left looking over the whole department frequently."
good,"A typical day at work was full of meetings with the different teams to update on new and on going projects. Meeting with my direct reports, reviewing proofs for color and retouching before sending to the printer or releasing for online/digital use. I learned a great deal at Macy's, many lessons for my career and for life. I learned how to manage not just my team, but how to manage up. My position required a great deal of organizing and being a team player and we had an amazing group of people that knew how to have fun while accomplishing our goals and creating engaging campaigns."
good,suprevisor were fair with everyone and it was a relax job everyone would help you a lot of teamwork they would train you good . They would fit your schedule
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my position at the counter. The management team was awesome. Someone was always willing to help in order in satisfying the customer. i would recommend the position to anyone starting out in the cosmetics field.
good,Fast-paced position that was based on compensation in the women's shoe department. We had to work the floor as well as managing inventory and doing regular recovery.
good,"Productive, busy and a friendly environment but long hours standing on your feet all day. Employee working full time are usually scheduled to closing shifts.  Employees are expected to work at least two week ends a month.  Busy during the Christmas holiday."
good,"Keep yourself busy, ask for help and be available to help others. You go through a long training process that shows you there point system throughout the day. You get a chance to shadow other employees throughout there shift and get hands on training also."
good,"I come in the morning and do fulfillment after I opened all my registers.  Then when I finished I cleaned up the counter and I checked the fitting room to make sure that nobody left any clothes from the night before.  I learned how to be a sales associate in retail at Macy's since many years of my background in my career is in accounting and finance.  I think the company needs to learn how to keep their good hard working employee.  They seem to keep the employees that are not hard working.  The hardest part of the job is during the holidays because you have to work so late and sometimes your alone minding the three registers and serving a long line of customers that are needing to check out their merchandise.  The problem is they are short of salesperson because some of the people they hired does not show up so it leaves the other salesperson to work even harder.  The worst thing is when you get the rudest customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I look at those beautiful dresses and the job location is only 10 minutes from my house so I felt safe traveling very late at night.  Also, when we get 50% discount every year on all the perfumes for men and women plus the other discounts for the merchandise inside the store.  This company had given me the flexibility of taking care of my Granddaughter for many years.  I was able to take her to school in the morning and get off on time to pick her up after school every day."
good,If i could i would love to work there again and not hesitate to take the job that build my character it was a wonderful experience especially meeting my co workers
good,"I worked in the Down Summerlin store in Las Vegas. The days there could range from absolutely nothing going on to crazy non stop, it all depended on the day. Most of the managers genuinely cared about their team but some couldn't care less. The good ones were over worked and stressed out most of the time. Some of the commission sale area people would steal sales and make life miserable but most of the employees were truly wonderful."
good,Great place to work for retail but long standing hours and only full time gets benfits. Good team but only specific departments get bonus. Holidays are crazy.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Everyone is super welcoming and helpful, the seniors there are always willing to help the new kid and teach them the ropes. You gain experience in many areas of the store for posible job advancements in the future."
good,"Great place to work, it's just very fast pasted. It was my first job I learned​ alot about retail and what it demands , and I liked the work environment very much. The training was really annoying though sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours really was awful, I was expecting a bit more from Macy's they also don't pay for your uniforms it's funny though because they sale clothes, but what they do instead is give you a coupon so that you can buy clothes at Macy's it really bugged me since it was my first job and I really didn't have money to spend on uniforms."
good,"Professional atmosphere, relaxed working space. Friendly customer service, quick paced and busy during holidays. Organized management, with employee perks."
good,"The hardest part of the job is waking up at 5.30 AM. "
good,The company was solid and offered at the time job security.  I was recruited to another company in the Luxury Division and I jumped at the opportunity.
good,"Weekends were certainly busier than weekdays. It can certainly be a very competitive place to work. I did enjoy selling the product, and the type of clientele it attracted."
good,"I enjoyed working with the company. Unfortunately, we were relocating and there were no opportunities to relocate and continue with the company. There are great associates that are an asset to the company."
good,It was a great temporary job. I had fun with my manager and employees while also making sure the store was safe. I was entitled breaks every shift and I had hands on training with monitors and cameras.
good,The fine and fashion jewelry department is so much fun. My coworkers became my friends and I always had fun helping customers to find the perfect jewelry they needed. My manager was really nice but his assistant was the best supervisor I ever had. They were always willing to help.
good,"delivered merchandise to all departments, worked in loss prevention and janitorial departments, worked in the delivery departments, also worked in hardware, men's clothing departments and unloaded trucks in the receiving department."
good,"It was always something going on at the job, but exciting. The Job ended because the call center shut down.The culture was empowering and encouraging."
good,"On an average day I'd walk in say hello to the managers on duty and then go clock in. After that was done I'd go check my assigned duty and carry on as normal, helping customers, working on floor recovery, etc."
good,"Got hired as Xmas Seasonal to work in Women's Shoes, but ended up working only one day training & one night during inventory. I did not learn much. All of the people I worked with were great. There wasn't anything hard about the work. The most enjoyable part were all the people I worked with."
good,Usually a great place to be. I love most of my coworkers and my manger.  Macy's is a good company to work for. Not to much physical labor besides the hours of being on your feet but you get used to that after a while.
good,"Management are very nice in Macy's. I really loved working for Macy's, I used to be signer specialist and it was one of my most loved jobs. It left really really to be supposed by possible and energetic people. We learn to build relationship with your coworkers, as well as clients."
good,it was a fast paced job you were busy al the time. learned a lot would have stayed but was only temporary.the people were nice to work with and the managers. and customers even if it was during the holidays .
good,"Walked in to meetings before work, learned several other departments job, management was ok but usually spend their time in their office. Environment was nice with people but dirty with the warehouse itself"
good,Macy’s is a good place to grow. They give you great opportunities and they keep on giving. Great place to start out in a warehouse type job. I have definitely learned a lot being here.
good,"The work was in no was hard,they gave time and patience to new employees. But the work was so simple that I would finish my 4 hour days in 2 hours. The management was also very one sided."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I really enjoyed the people i worked with and meeting new customers but there definitely is a lot of down time and the work can get very monotonous. If you are someone who needs change and excitement out of your work this might not be a good choice for you. During busy hours the jewelry department gets packed and there is not much support from associates from other departments. Be prepared to learn fast if you are not already well knowledgeable in fine jewelry and be prepared to talk, a lot. Not a good job choice for the meek or shy, I learned that the hard way."
good,"Macy's is fun at the start depending where you work ,"
good,You learn how things work in one of the biggest retail companies in the united states. The atmosphere is great highly competitive but together you work as a team to make sales.
good,"Started as a seasonable employee, but changed to permanent."
good,"Always reminded about warehouse safety, working as a team and communication is essential. A meal was compensated for. Room for growth. Able to pick up and drop shifts online through an employee website."
good,"Most enjoyable part is my co-workers are very nice to work with. A typical day consists of ringing customers up, beauty and skin care consultation, and sometimes makeovers."
good,I was really able to learn true customer service in a retail environment. Daily interaction with customers and working with a sales team was a lot of fun.
good,"Fantastic management any issues were resolved very quickly. Job was very heavily focused on getting customers to sign up for credit cards with very good rewards for employees. Lots of employees come and go especially with seasonal workers. Button up dress clothes were mandatory for the uniform. Sales goals print out every time you take a break, clock in, and clock out to show you how you have done for the day."
good,Working at the Macys Fullfillment center they definitely want you being as productive as possible but the people you work with are pretty interesting ad fun
good,"I worked third shift as a high bay operator. A regular night at work would be collecting a list of products to be picked from the floor leads, driving the high bay forklift down aisles to get products."
good,the culture at macys was driven for success always way to move up but i was only there for part time because having another job. managemnet could have been better but i cannot complain
good,Was a great place to work for almost 28 years. The AP position was eliminated in the company and will undergo major changes. Great benefits and challenging work environment. I would recommend if position opens to apply and be challenged with a great organization.
good,"Macy's was a very pleasant environment to be in. I mean the people were great and very helpful anybody can work there. You spend alot of time on your feet but it's worth it. The only reason I'm looking for another job is, after peak they lay people off and cut back hours; but luckily they haven't laid me off but they have cut my hours back big time. So I just want to work at a place similar to Macy's but I need more hours."
good,"Productive and friendly inviting work place. Everyone was nice and willing to help you learn, they don't make you feel like your mistakes are unacceptable, they explain that they have done it before and have messed up."
good,"It's a great place to start your career and is better than most places in terms of job satisfaction. It's demanding, but not too demanding."
good,They should clean out the warehouse better. It had mole on the walls and up on the ceilings. I think they need to put gloves and mask for employees all around the warehouse.
good,Your typical big retail brand. The culture and coworkers are awesome but hours are a little short. Great employee discounts and rewarding opportunities.
good,I was the lead recovery had a lots of nice people working with me. I manage 45 associates i'm a very friendly person i love working. Had lots of fun working for macy's.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Its a good start to get experience and you can request to do more than just the position that you applied, they welcome people who seek to learn and sharpen their skills"
good,"Overseen visuals for women's wear, petites, intimate apparel, and better sportswear.  I learned to work in various departments that allow me to gain more experience. Management was supportive.  Workplace culture was creative, open, and supportive.  The hardest part of the job completion of all tasks within each department within a strict time limit.  The most enjoyable part of the job travelling to other stores to assist with executive visits."
good,Great place to work. Going through a lot of restructuring and company reorganization. A lot of lay offs and store closings. I was laid off from  my full time position at the Cottonwood store closing and went to the Coronado store to work part time. Now I am getting laid off again.
good,"While I thought my department was pretty great to work in, Macy's West was a very segmented company with communication problems between departments and very different cultures between them. Some departments were hyper competitive, while others functioned as families. Some departments had zeroed-in focus on KPIs, while others took a holistic view of the company instead of individual goals. Macy's could be a great place to work, or tough to tolerate depending on which side of the office you're on"
good,Macy's is a great company to work for.  I have worked for Macy's Inc. for 17 years.  7 years at Bloomingdales and 10 at Macy's.  17 great years in various positions.
good,"Worked holiday season. Can get very busy and overwhelming depending on the department, but there is good management to support you. Great atmosphere if your'e a hard worker."
good,"i learned great customer service here, aka the costumer is always right. My manager had a lot on her plate when i worked there, since it was a seasonal job she was very busy at the time but she definitely did everything she could've. Hardest part of the job was probably having an unhappy customer who couldn't be satisfied. the most enjoyable part of the job was building some great relationships with some customers and co workers."
good,"When you consider typical considerations for a job in retail it is a good company to work for.  I really enjoyed the customers and many of the people I worked with.  They were a pretty good team environment as well.  Overall I enjoyed my job, it was pretty fun!  Slight concern with the future of the company in smaller towns and job security."
good,"I love working here, it gives you great customer service expirence, and they are also very welcoming to all the new employees, they also give good training."
good,Macys can be an exciting job to have. The environment is quick paced and there is always something to do. The managers are friendly and reliable. As time goes on you feel like Macys is your family and they make you feel equal to everyone....you can be yourself as long as your respectful.
good,Basically clock in find out what you will be doing for the day and do it to the best of your ability and it will all be fine. The managers are very patient with people new to using the equipment used to complete the job. I've learned how to use gladiators and RF guns to move product around the facility. The hardest part of the job can be meeting the desire rate when picking orders however it can be achieved with the right mentality. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the option to work solo and zone out or work as a team
good,Macy's is a great place to work. The diverse culture allows for a comfortable work environment. Management is willing to work with you to help advance your career if you're willing to put in the work.
good,"Typically the job is ringing at the cash register, customer service and keeping areas organized. Can get pretty busy during the holiday rush. People are nice and employees are easygoing."
good,"I loved the fact you got to wear all black (I know, very morbid). You had the freedom to pick up shifts when you logged into the Macy's employee page and not much had changed from when I worked at Macy's in Douglaston (from 2005 - 2006) with the employee discount or lunch breaks. It's pretty cool that they train you at the store location you've applied to compared to traveling to the Macy's in Roosevelt Field Mall to train but you still got paid. The downside of working at Macy's is that you needed to apply for the store card in order to receive your discount and I had applied for the prepaid card but never received a card in the mail, I doubt the card even existed."
good,Macy’s offered opportunity for advancement in a very fast paced environment. They have had a focus on employee engagement that I admire. I enjoyed my time with this company.
good,Macy's team is fun and exciting to work around. Everyone is there to help each other succeed to make daily sales goals. Managers are helpful in finding resources when asked questions.
good,"Working fragrance at Macys was a huge step up for me, I enjoyed it immensely and it boosted my experience levels. It was fast paced and got a little chaotic around the holiday season but everyone was helpful and nice towards me. I learned to work the Point Of Sale cash register system and I learned to sell product beginning to end by myself. The hardest part of your day is when you have several customers and employees pulling you six different ways. I taught myself to take it one task at a time and remind myself I can always ask for help if I need it. I loved working with my coworkers, I learned so much from them and they never gave up on me."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,it was a great experience but it could get tiring being on your feet for hours straight. it can get overwhelming when working on holidays since it is super slow then out of no where it gets super busy
good,I enjoyed the experience acquired at Macy's and won some contest in sales and received many customer accommodations for service about and beyond the call of duty. I had customers who would only buy from me and some I am still in touch with even after leaving Macy's. I will never forget the lessons learn in sales there. Thank You.
good,"Like anything or anywhere, Macys will provide you with basic pay, that will allow you to pay your bills. The upward mobility is based upon whether you perform to your managers liking, and whether they like you or not. It can be stressful depending on the job title you carry, but remember in the end you came here to work not socialize."
good,good place to work nice employees friendly great customers best part is macys employees are team players they care about the customers and there employees
good,"Friendly enviroment"
good,its a great place to work staff is real helpful. Its busy on the daily basis. I had the best experience my manager was great. I learned so much from working at macys.
good,"Overall nice place to work. Company is very culturally diverse. My biggest complaint is a lack of communication extended/shared with everyone, it was very inconsistent."
good,"Working at Macy's is very fast paced.  Macy's provide it's employees with training classes on every aspect of their business.  Employees are treated with respect and are encouraged to take advantage of all the training that they offer to enhance your career.  The company is big on diversity and supports employee with family life and wellness benefits."
good,"I was recruited by this company from a secure position and my job was eliminated 6 months later. Despite the positive aspects of the company, I would not recommend Macy's, Inc due to unstable job environment."
good,"Macy's has been my employer of choice - unfortunately, the retail space has shrunk - so jobs keep shrinking. The organization has been steadily eliminating their best talent for years in favor of automation and more cost effective labor. "
good,"I learned a lot about the retail industry working here. The most enjoyable part of this job are my team members.  They make the job fun.  Although we may fool around a lot, at the end of the day we always get the job done!"
good,It was good. There's a lot of freedom and indepence.  I love that the scheduling system is very flexible with options to advertise shifts in order for another associate to pick up.
good,"It was my first job and to this day was my favorite. It was relaxing, but still kept you busy. The hiring process is extensive to ensure a good work environment and compatible co-workers."
good,"I enjoy working at Macy's. My boss is top notch, my coworkers are awesome, we work as a team."
good,"consist of me assisting customers and making sure i solved all their problems. I learned new things everyday because i wanted to be the best at what i did, and didn't have to bother others to much. (inventory, stocking clothing, tagging, and much more)"
good,Macy's is a fast past company always evolving with the industry and what it takes to retain good talent. The work culture is collaborative and engaging.
good,"I really enjoyed my employment with Macy's. Everyday at Macy's is a chance to make magic.The management cared, the associates cared. I would recommend applying now!"
good,"I overall loved my job at Macy's. The day went by fast keeping busy  being in charge of an area. However it really bothered me that they allowed me to do the job of two without enough pay. My coworker would avoid the registers and would ""get lost"" most of the time. Other than that coworker I got along with everyone."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It's very busy and you will have to be able to catch on quick and multi task because it's a lot of things that one person is assigned to and it can get a little hard but you have to always maintain.
good,"Working in Merchandising is a great job for anyone looking for their first job. Everyone there is friendly and the hours are flexible. I'd like to mention that I've been there for almost two years now and I don't feel like I'm going anywhere, and as a Fashion student, I would like to move on to something bigger with more learning opportunities."
good,"At the Macys in Woodbridge, NJ, I had an amazing time and experience. I worked during the holiday season so it was VERY fast-paced and always on your feet, type of work. The managers were on-point but very understanding. HR was nice as well. I loved the customers and had a lot of room for growth. The hardest part was standing for so long but you are constantly on the move as well. Working as a seasonal worker sometimes you are placed in different areas. One of my worst work days was spent going through returned clothing items. I enjoy interacting with customers. But overall I loved Macys up North."
good,I was hired for the Holidays so it was very busy when I worked their. Management and my fellow coworkers were great to work with and made it pleasurable to work even with the fast paced environment.
good,"There was always something to do at work during the holiday season I worked. The employees were very friendly and were patient and answered any questions I had. It was really fun and you got to know your co-workers. Each department is close with their employees. Management was great. The hardest part was working on Black Friday, even then it wasn’t too bad. Most enjoyable part was stocking perfumes and making gift boxes for fragrance department."
good,"I can say that it was a well in order store, supervisors and manger were nice. Clean and comfortable place to work, not too much to complain about. I actually enjoyed working there"
good,All in all it’s a great place to work if they took the time to train the managers correctly. It’s stupid that you have to text you Manager just to make a tester of a product so you can show the customer or for new product launch. The managers lack communication
good,"A typical day at work is very busy helping the customers first.  If you don't have a customer, you clean, straighten and restock your area.  Macy's has a diverse cultural staff.  Management is very helpful and understanding.  The hardest par of the job is being on your feet for many hours.  I really enjoy the people I work with and the customers I assist."
good,"This is a good job for right out of school. not hard or heavy work, and not real difficult. good boss and kids around a lot, the guys I worked with was quiet but helpful."
good,being seasonal explains why I had such poor hours . it was very calm place to work at. i don't know nor do I remember how my manager was because it was a couple years back . I will say this they're discounts and rewards cards gave me a smile on my face
good,"It was a pleasant experience working here everyone was sweet, very professional. I had no issues working there it was just a health issue that occurred during my employment there."
good,"I'm enjoying to work in Macy's with team members, feel like a big family, easy going co-workers."
good,No tip each person is different each department is different great company to work for I have worked as a sales associate markdown pricing dock fullfillment lead supervisor
good,"I would have stayed with the company if i was able to work in the same department part time while attending school. Therefore, I resigned for better chances."
good,it was a good place to learn how to use the register and how to make customer happy.  The employees are very freindly and helpful.  The Managers are very helpful also.
good,Macy’s is a good place to work especially when you’re just starting out. You get crossed trained on everything and can add lots of experience to your resume. Overall I enjoyed working for Macy’s I just wish they paid more.
good,Loved coming to work to lead my team on the everyday tasks we had for the day. Very fast pace environment. Overall i loved working with the team I had.
good,"Macy's is a great place to gain basic customer service and retail experience. It is typically a fast-paced environment. The managers are friendly as well as the other employees. If you're working part-time you may not have many hours. I'm only guaranteed 3-8 hours per work week, and usually end up with only 3 or 4 hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked part of the AST Team in the macys  store. I did a bunch of office work and worked side by side with managers. I was able to gain a lot of experience with the hiring process and HR understandings. I worked on the phone with customers and tried to make sure to help them with as much as possible. I enjoyed working with the people at macys, we all shared laughs and relatable lives. Shoppers and workers are friendly and made working in the office fun since I would walk down to the floor to make connections and making sure the floor had coverage."
good,"Every morning we have ""rallies"" with clappers to announce our previous day's performance. The managers always push us to get people to open credit accounts with the store, one of them pushes to a slightly unrealistic level and gets a tad annoying, but it's alright."
good,"I liked the clientele and quick pace.  The salary was ok, could have been better, but I was just temp holiday help so maybe it gets better if perm. I liked my managers very much and appreciated the way we were treated, as valued people, not just numbers.  I didn't like the hours required of empolyees during Black Friday and Christmas Eve.  This is the main reason I'm looking else where for employment now."
good,"Overall good place to work, was nice to have a flexible schedule as I am a Full-time college student. Pretty basic as far as retail jobs go, although clientele tends to have the privileged mentality."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Macy's, while there were a few difficult situations, the more experienced coworkers and the management staff were always willing to the lend a hand to help me when I first started working. The hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers, while some were difficult I did my best to fulfill their needs while shopping in the store and make their shopping in the store a positive experience."
good,Loved the excitement and rush during the holiday time. The working staff members was great and we all had a great time during the hoilday. They are reasonable with scheduling.
good,"Really enjoyed working at macys on state street, very nice people and management is great. Always willing to work with you with any issue. And pay and hours are good as well."
good,I've grown so much with Macy's! I was able to learn over 15+ beauty brands and apply that knowledge to each and every chat! Very welcoming and encouraging environment!
good,"Good environment"
good,"A typical day at work was you clocked in then you asked the person before you if there was anything that needed put away such as new items or if dressing rooms needed checked.  I learned that a retail job was not as easy as it seems.  everyone should have to come and work a day to see how many time you can get yelled at people saying i   want a manager,  the workplace culture itself got you thru the rough patches,  the hardest part was sale day who pelple cam in and just brought in a pot and said i just bought this yesterday and i want the sale price and you ask for a box for a receipt and they say they got rid of the box and they paid cash for the item.  What do you do ?  the most enjoyable part of the job was when you really found the special item for the client and they just smiled ear to ear"
good,"Busy, productive, customer focused, fun and friendly atmosphere, fair, rewarded if job well done. Discounts are great. Management fair and knowledgeable, open door policy."
good,it was great working for macy's. the people were like a family. but the pay is substandard compared to other companies in our industry. they really worked with us to achievegood work life balance.
good,A typical day at work dealt with competition between my coworkers and I during our sales but the overall work environment was friendly and manageable.
good,I loved working for the company and helping the customers.  I Loved the atmosphere.  Management was kind and expected a lot from their employees which is nothing abnormal.
good,"Fasted paced retail environment. A little cut throat. Great discounts. Nice layout for the department"
good,Awesome place to work. Balanced can sometimes be fast paced but you'll get the hang of it as you're doing it. You'll always be busy Macyys is a popular store that everyone attend to and on the plus side getting paid weekly is awesome
good,Macy's is a fast-paced working environment that always keeps you going you always have something to do there's never a dull moment and you definitely work for your money.
good,Its a typical teenager job where you go around folding clothes and assisting customers. It can be dull and boring but you just have to make the best of it.
good,I enjoyed working at Macys as it gave me a chance to gain several skills in customer service including how to figure out how to satisfy individual tastes . I especially loved working as part of a team to achieve maximum sales.
good,"Easy work, a lot of customer interaction and engagement on daily basis."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"- will spend most of time recovering the floor"
good,"Macys was an excellent learning experience for me. I was there from 1993-2008 and I had met alot of different people who helped me to become the leader I am today. Due to the schedule change, I had to leave Macys."
good,Started my retail career here and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Worked hard and was rewarded for that effort and results. Strong management team who created a great culture.
good,It was my first project as an android developer and the management and the employees are friendly and helped me to learn new things. The workplace culture was good enough.
good,"I worked at Macy's temporary due to a major surgery I had the month before I started, they did ask me to stay after working their seasonal but they hours and pay did not work for me but it was a great experience"
good,"It can get very slow at times and it can get very hectic at times. There are many customers who will be difficult but working at sales, it is always interesting."
good,"Macys is a good place to work, the main complaint was the management was choosy who to discipline and cliquey. If your department manager is close friends with anyone above you...good luck. I got yelled at and reported on for small things when my manager never followed the dress code or rules but I was the only one that would constantly get told anything."
good,"There is more to do than hours, resources, or people to do it.  Macy's does not give enough hours or budget to make sure that you are able to get your work done without nearly killing yourself trying."
good,Friendly co workers. hardest part of the job working overtime most of the time. Most enjoyable part of the job is assisting people in office and getting the work done before its due.
good,"great work place to do Loaded materials and products into package processing equipment"
good,"cut throat but fun environment "
good,"Macys cherry hill is was a fun experience for me. I enjoyed meeting a plethora of customers who shared stories and were very engaging. It wasn't much pay but where the pay lacked, the amenities soared! Employees got 20% off on top of any sale going on, plus received the benefits of getting ""Macy Money"" through fun competitive events."
good,Macy's is a great company to work for. I have been able to move up through management and also allow for a work life balance. I have enjoyed all of my roles with Macy's and have grown a great deal professionally.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's department store. All though the holiday season was crazy. It was easier to get through with Good management, clean work spaces , lots of room for growth"
good,It was a friendly and fun work environment.  The management and employees made sure the customer was satisfied.  The customer service of the company was above and beyond the expectations.
good,"Busy helping customers to select merchandise according to their needs"
good,"Great technology / good benefits / freedom to perform your job"
good,"I start my day by unloading truck off all merchandise.. then begin stocking to the appropriate areas. I learned zoning, bailing,stocking and customer service skills."
good,"everyone was very friendly and willing to help. the problem with this place is that Macy's is downsizing. so you should start looking for a back up if you work there right now. i only had a temp position so i didn't really get any benefits either. durring my seasonal position, they served food in the break room many times."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I would usually do my job of just gathering the cosmetics flatbed and just place the merchandise in the correct stockroom location. The co-workers were fun to be around with because they made your day more fun, and the manager understood what the employees were going through and tried to uplift their spirits with fun activities."
good,"I had a great time working at Macy's during the holiday season. I did have difficulty getting hours at first because their system wouldn't allow me to, but once that problem was fixed I got all the hours i wanted and needed. The hardest part of this job is the outdated ringing up systems they have and maybe even being yelled at by customers when their coupons don't work."
good,"This was a good company to work for had fun , good discount  very fast place at times. like in most retail jobs the hardest part is get people to sign up for credit."
good,"The workplace was fairly great, the managers for the most part was friendly and helpful. But others wouldn't be so much helpful. The company policies was kinda crazy."
good,"A typical day includes internal and external customer service, data entry for schedules, payroll, onboarding new hires as well monitor training. Count and balance cash vault is a daily opening and closing task.  It is a very busy office where priorities can change at a moments notice. I enjoy the fast pace and I also enjoy the occasional time when all is quiet. I enjoy helping people. Having a happy ending to each day is what motivates me."
good,"It was fun , and you meet a lot of people , customers ,of all kinds, dealing with shop lifters, booking them ,for the amount stolen  from the store, there are times it it is the best time ,and times it has bad , not everyday is always good"
good,Best part of the job is the joy of the customer. The pay is okay. All of my co-workers had great spirits and enjoyed working with me. Employee discount not much but hey anything is better than nothing!
good,"I work on the flex team while in college. It was a good first job. I was able to pick up hours when needed. I usually had as many hours as I needed, but some weeks were short. Fun place especially during Christmas time."
good,"Most days at Macy's was relatively quiet and calm, no problems with employees or management. Everyone is nice and willing to help out. On the weekend and holidays, it get really crazy and insane during rush hour but it's manageable."
good,"As a summer gig, I love Macys due to their employee benefits. The managers are super nice and they have never raised their voice or given me attitude at all. But then again, I have pretty great work ethics if I might say so myself. It's a fun job so don't hesitate!"
good,"Was a decent place to work. they had all the latest  equipment so we could do our job. However, we where sent home early quite often because of lack of work."
good,I loved working at Macys during my first year of college. I started as a seasonal and I decided to stay. As an employer you get a lot of discounts and you can also get Macys money if you meet your sales goal.
good,"company currently closing stores focusing on clearance/sales items ,financial outlook dim ,enjoyed department responsibilities and freedom to do my job, disliked rapid employee turnover"
good,"I was a signer meaning that I had to assess which merchandise was to go on sale later in the week so I would have a large cart to push to the departments I was assigned to and set up the sale signs for the merchandise on that day. "
good,"Had fun while I worked there and most of the employees were great to work with.  Unfortunately, the store I worked at closed. I worked in several departments doing various tasks.  Even though business was slow, there was always something to do."
good,"Collaborated with varied levels of management, inside and outside Business Partners. "
good,"The particular Macy's store I work at is very diverse and adaptable, I think the management is alright but could be more effective in certain areas. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude and unruly customers and also dealing with multiple issues at once while still maintaining your job descriptions and title."
good,"I worked in receiving so all I did was cut open and move boxes around all day. I learned how to quickly keep up with senior staff members so that the load would not become too much of a burden. The management and workplace culture was chill, as long as I did my job I didn't get into any trouble. The hardest part of the job was just the amount of physical labor, but that wasn't an issue at any time. The most enjoyable part of  the job was getting to know my coworkers and how they operated."
good,"typical day at work was productive, fun, and easy going."
good,For the 8 months working at Macy's it was an overall great experience as a work place. I have learned a lot of from working there from customer service skills to sales experience as well.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was a good experience, I learned alot new stuff and accomplished alot. Made good progress understand the costumers more made them satisfied and was on a good base."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you have patience with customers. Moslty all the managers quit their positions and now theres nothing but new managers,it looks like the store is fallling apart financiall."
good,"I would sell clientele all kinds of different makeup and perfumes, explain to them which one would work best for their complexion, eye shape and any other questions that they had. I would do makeup for the clients, work the register, do stock and inventory."
good,"Learn new cultures, talk to all different people, fun Saturdays day work, good place to start new skills, easy to make your own schedule, nice befeficits..."
good,"I loved working at Macy's, my coworkers were lovely, everyone there was really nice. The pay wasn't enough and health care plan was expensive. It was hard seeing how people treat the clothing . There is a complete lack of respect towards the clothes, maybe because of how excessive clothing has become. Helping elderly customers with clothing was the best, they know what they want. The coupons was our biggest complaint ,because of the exclusions. I think the hardest part of the job was slow days, trying to make time pass with no real movement in the store, those days you hope for someone to try on clothes and leave them everywhere ."
good,I had fun working in a department store because i got to get familiar with a lot of brands. I know how to fold different pairs of jeans and opened my eyes to the different types of mens clothing because i mostly worked in the mens department.
good,Fun place to work. Had great interactions with customers. Learned lots of new things like how to size watches. Learned great customers service skills.
good,"It is not very bad at working for Macy but full time jobs are pretty limited so it may not be very good for people who want to work as full time.  Most thing I learn from Macy is we should work as a team.  And it is very important to give an outstanding customer service to our customer.  Beside limited working hours,it is pretty nice to work in Macy. Working environment is nice as we got friendly mangers always."
good,"Lots of creative people with focus on driving business, facilitating new ideas and great energy.  A great company to learn and show off your talent with a nice culture and management team."
good,Worked temporarily during christmas season as a recovery assistant. I was typically the only one in my department. A lot of busy work.  They should pay employees more during holiday season due to the amount of work that they are given
good,"Face pace company, also trying new things, very interested in employee input, I was able to grow very quickly with this company"
good,Macys is a fun environment to work in.  Feels like family.  Liked everything except the nights and weekends.  The company is ever changing to keep profitable.
good,A great place to develop customer service skills.  Each location is very different in your job responsibility based on the traffic pattern.   The hours can be challenging during the Christmas season.  Good place to work but advancement has become very limited.
good,At Macy's everyone usually works well together and supports one another. If you are into fashion this is a good place to acquire some familiarity with styles and trends.
good,Great company with opportunity to advance.  Hours are always sporadic as you are working in retail.  Sometimes it is difficult to keep all floor employees happy with can bring down moral.
good,"Very productive work experience, good Company overall to work for."
good,making sure the floor was organize and the customers where been assisted. Communicating with local macy to provide the customer with the item they are looking for if we do not have it in store. Handle return and order online.
good,"Macy's.com has a good work life balance, but the enterprise is going through a lot of changes right now. Some good, some bad. There is a lot of struggle from a leadership standpoint."
good,"Result matter in driving sales, customer service, vendors relations, promotion and inventory and employee relation "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,During my tenure at Macy's I was able to focus on projects that were meaningful to me.  Impulse Beauty was a new initiative for the Company and I was a part of it from the beginning.
good,"I learned how to communicate with staff and customers. It taught me patience and how to multi-task. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a discount on clothes, and styling people with new trends."
good,Macy's is a challenging but nice place to work.  It is a goal oriented culture.  Management is responsible for coaching and providing positive reinforcement to assist in reaching goals.  The most difficult part of the job is getting customers to agree to open a Macys credit card.  Most customers are very gracious and some have become my friends.  I consider this to be the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,Great discounts for employees. Fun and fast paced work environment. Very little opportunity to advance when starting as a sales associate. Most of the time is spent cleaning if in a clothing department.
good,"All around nice environment, the people there make you feel welcome and when you feel welcome it makes you want to work harder. I learned how to work with people that i never knew ill become good friends."
good,I was a great associate always meeting my goals and going above and beyond for the company. My biggest issue was that I was not being considered for advancement. I was basically doing everything right but was not being appreciated or considered for higher positions. After 2 years I made great improvement to where I had a total 30% raise and a position change. It wasn't where I wanted to be. I was just a glorified sales associate and there were beginning to be way too many tasks that needed to be done.
good,I enjoyed this job. The people were great and so were management. They were always willing to work with you on schedule and trade schedules if needed.
good,"Macy's was pretty cool. It wasn't hard work, and the pay was alright for what the job was. They had a large break room and common amenities. Things got very hectic at the holidays, but it wasn't a bad job. Management was very cool, too."
good,Management is very helpful especially if it's your first job. You have a 30-45mins lunch which is enough time to sit and relax before going back. Mostly busy on weekends and clean up process is hectic because you have to make sure your section and the fitting room is clean before closing.
good,I started Macys almost 5 years ago as a seasonal hire.  I enjoyed my job thoroughly and advanced in a matter of years.  I went from seasonal hire to a sales supervisor.  During my time at Macys I made amazing connections with customers and my work family as well.
good,"It was a good experience working as a sales associate. I gained a new perspective as I handled my responsibilities. I sold watches ranging from a tech style to a traditional style. I also handled money and used cash registers."
good,"the atmosphere here was pretty nice and welcoming, and the coworkers were fun to work with."
good,Stocking up perfume good company as well not so well tho I help out with the customer service with the company help out with the sale ment team coworker
good,"Team was more isolated, competitive"
good,"During the time I was working here, my managers were really great! You can feel that they build you up and make sure you're trained well. I kinda miss working here. It's a regular sales job, where you need to have target goals and membership goals, but I think that the rewards you get are great. I love having so much discounts on quality items and it's just addicting to shop at Macy's!!"
good,Working for Clinique at Macys is a really great job. Working with the my Clientele to provide advice and assist them with purchases is really rewarding.
good,"great work environment. friendly co-workers, helped trained me when I needed assistance. "
good,"I was able to develop many skills:"
good,"Working here was good for me as it was a temporary position. I worked there over the holidays, which was extremely busy a lot of the time, but the management and fellow employees made it enjoyable. It also had the perk of getting complete control over your shift schedule. You were able to choose which shift and where you would be working, though it was on a first-come first-serve basis. You also would use this system to trade or take shifts when you wanted to make a bit more. It was difficult to stand for the 8 hour-shifts sometimes, but they give you a 30-minute break, so it isn't impossible. Just make sure to have some good work shoes."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is a great place to work, but working on commission can be tough. Th pay in a commission department is hourly versus commission. Tricky, because the commission you earn today will be taken from you tomorrow once the customer returns the merchandise. Promotion is not based on performance, but friendship."
good,you really had a chance to talk to each person and find their specifics about jewelry. i like the personal touch on a job when it comes t helping each person out with the item they wanted. I had the chance to give my own recommendations and it was laid back but straight forward. overall had a good time working but the branch shut down.
good,Selling the products in whatever department I was in and doing my best to satisfy customers. I learned basic computer skills and interaction with people.
good,"Macy's is a very good work place if your looking for something to maybe get on your feet. Definitely wouldn't recommend staying at Macy's for more than a year. If you don't have the tolerance and patients for degrading managers and a big load of work, you will not survive more than a month working there. There are a lot of cultures in Macy's, a very good variety of diversity. The most enjoyable part about this job is getting paid every Friday. Depending on which department you're in, your managers can be you greatest downfall. Watch out for Cathy, Lynn & Jessica, they might seem nice and understanding in the beginning. But just wait 2 weeks, you'll see it.   ( QBM, Lawrenceville, NJ)"
good,Macys is by far a very nice and friendly envoirnment to work  in. People are sweet and kind. Everybody helps each other. some days very relaxed and mild and other are busier its a mix of both and that is what makes this job so much for everybody i assume. managers are nice and kind and very helpful.
good,"Depending on the department, a person in a technical role has the opportunity to expand their skill set and work on interesting projects.  The project priorities can constantly change so the stress level can be quickly change.  But the work schedule flexibility can help relieve some of the time management and pressure."
good,"Its a great experience for those who want to work in retail and customer services ."
good,"Liked the job well enough, kept me busy. Nice atmosphere. Fun to see the constant turn over of all the new trends. Great discount that allowed us to ""stack"" deals."
good,"The mangers in my location can micromanage, which can be infuriating due to the fact that we know how to do our job in an efficient and effective manner."
good,"One manager is outstanding, other not so much. Excellent to develop great customer service skills.  Not enough money for a full time employee.  High demands on experienced employees with out proper compensation"
good,Great summer job and everyone was super friendly and helpful as this ws my first retail job so I had a lot to leave. Everyone was willing to lend a hand.
good,"What I truly love is how Macys supports alot of organizations like make a wish,bag hunger and united way. We try and make it about feeling apart of the community and making customers feel like family"
good,It just depends on the store you work for. I worked for two different stores. One was much better than the other. The management was much better and the area where it was located was much safer and more high end
good,"Easy job, customer service. Just checkout customers, returns, exchanges and purchases to be shipped to home. Good work place. Benefits of 20% off purchase being an employee."
good,"macys is a great place to work Its a fun atmosphere, the corporate family are approachable people. you will always receive proper training with further education"
good,It was a great environment to work in. I enjoyed the staff as well as meeting new people on a daily basis. The customers made the job enjoyable to go to every day.
good,"Nice company to work, problems lately ,two massive lay offs in the last year. Friendly atmosphere, nice benefits ( especially vacation). Unfortunately, company does not have money for classes. It was the hardest part for me."
good,"Management was all over the place, there were some nights where they had no one to close and no one to come in and help. Not sure if it was just my store, but all the coworkers formed cliques and were so rude to one another and it was difficult to work in that environment."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I'm a student so being on-call and having flexibility to work around my schedule was great. However, being on call meant I missed some important information that was passed from manager to each cosmetic counter specialist, but was not passed down to me as I worked at various counters."
good,"Fast pace, and very scripted. Most  clients calls are because they are disappointed, upset, or disgruntled; must keep a good head space . Think outside the box. This IS the job. Learned the art of de escalation. I find if I treat each client  as I would like to be treated we can come to some sort of compromise if possible and I leave with happy or at lest satisfied return client.   Lots of bullet points to meet on each call. Calls monitored, timed and rated by a chart which was often left to perception and interpretation.Staff very friendly. Very much involved in community service."
good,If you love fashion and have a competitive edge then this will suite you very well. You are able to pick up shifts and work in different areas. Every night management will check to see how many Macy's accounts you have opened. They want you to open two a week.
good,"I love working for Macys, the support from your colleagues is what makes the job. No person is for themselves here if one person needs help, you can count on someone to be there to assist you if you need any help. everyone works together, friendly environment."
good,you have to sit at a computer for the whole day as training. there is no physical being there for you to ask any questions to. If you don't understand something in training there was no one to help you. there was no team effort and everyone was isolated to their own part of the store.
good,"a typical day at Macy's is fast paced, i got to learn the many different smells of fragrances. The employees were very friendly but protective of their sells.getting to speak to different people and learning different approaches to people."
good,"I worked at Macys only for the month of December 2016, the holiday season. I didnt expect to like it but I was desperate so I took the job. I ended up loving it. The managers are so patient and helpful. It was nice to be able to call a manager anytime and have them come right away to assist. The holiday season was extremely busy of course but that is something I enjoy because it makes the day go faster and I really dislike having nothing to do at work. There are always rude, ridiculous customers but they are few and far between. The pay could have been better, it was $9.50/hr. The way they do scheduling is pretty cool, you essentially pick your own schedule and what section of the store you want to work in so that offers a lot of flexibility which is really nice. You most certainly do not get bored. All in all, I loved working at Macys and highly recommend them. I wish I could have stayed after the holidays."
good,"I was employed by Macy's for 19.8 years although my position was similar I worked 6 different locations in 3 states."
good,"Macy’s is great employer. They provide a wide library of online books and training classes including IT certifications and skills, programming, and business skills. Inclusion and integrity is a paramount of the corporate culture. Macy’s encourages its employees learn and grow because its people are the chief architect of the company’s success. While teamwork is celebrated and rewarded, so to is individual accomplishes and recognized."
good,"Enjoyed working there, but it was seasonal. Wish I could have stayed on longer. Good management and definitely a fun store."
good,The support teams have great work schedules. They are flexible and they will work with you as long as you work with them - notify them within a decent timeframe. My managers were very good at what they do and great to work for. Support teams start early in the morning and very early during the holidays but so much fun.
good,This is a warehouse job. I have actually worked in multiple departments there. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the long days. the schedule i was working you had to work 4 ten hour days. so that gave you every weekend off which was nice.  They have multiple shifts. One big perk about this job is that you become cross trained in multiple areas in the factory. the more you know the better
good,It was a great company to work for I had a all around good experience there. I wouldn't mind going back but I was only working seasonal over the Holidays.
good,"I worked there during the christmas/holiday season in the most tourist visted Macy's in the area. I worked almost everyday from 3 pm to midnight. My managers were relaly helpful, and enjoyed a lot of my time talking to them and learning. Dealing with customers now is a second nature to me, which helped me become a quicker problem solver in any given situation. Although standing for 8 hours straight in uncomfortable shoes was not ideal, but it was a very fun experience."
good,"Very fast paced, on the tip of your toes job. "
good,"They overwork you, a lot for a seasonal worker. Fellow employers are easy to get along with, makes the job a lot more fun. Gets really hectic around Christmas time."
good,"a typical day at work would be helping customers find what they needed and more. always make your sales goal, and never stand behind the register if there are no customers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was an easy fun job, however on-calls don't get the same benefits as a part time employee, but yet are expected to put in the same amount of work. On-calls should receive the same incentives as part-timers."
good,"Work is usually fascinating. Customers from all backgrounds visit the store. Throughout the process of helping customers with their needs, I usually get to learn simple pieces of information about them and their cultures. I enjoy the communication between associates and customers the most."
good,"I enjoyed my work experience. I picked up and made sure the store was neat and clean.. I helped the customers, I sought the elderly, and confused customers. I enjoyed the chance to help them. It was am experience that I will never forget."
good,"If you are looking for a living wage, it's pretty tough to make ends meet at Macy's but the work culture is fun and the computerized attendance system makes it a flexible and easy to navigate around a busy life.  Managers are friendly and helpful.  The hiring process is stress free and things happen quickly.  Benefits are good and start right away, but they don't cover a lot of the expenses.  Overall a good place to work, but the low wages and the tenuous nature of the retail giant possibly closing stores and laying off employees looms large."
good,"You help customer find items they are looking for, help the ring, try to open of macy's cards, and make sure the floors and fitting rooms are clean. main thing is to make sure you make a connection with the customer and that their experiences is memorable"
good,"Unloading trailer, processing merchandise,  packing and shipping fulfillment orders, customer carry-outs. Working individually as well as with others. Being on the dock customer interaction was minimal."
good,"Good place to begin your retail career or pick up a few extra hours. Casual, easy going shopping experience, with a great staff and good teamwork. "
good,"I have a love hate relationship with Macy's. Mostly, I loved my coworkers and the casual environment at work - unfortunately, management doesn't care about you. You will get the feeling that you don't have a name, you're just employee 10929807. If you're a good worker and they see that, you will be used until you're all dried up and then they'll start cutting your hours."
good,"great break times, good team effort work, great interactions with customers, different work stations good hours, good overtime"
good,"This job was by far very productive, and walking into work was always joyful and fun , the hardest part was making sure everything was we're it was supposed to be but it was fun"
good,"Macy's can be very accommodating of your time when you remember to pay attention to the employee website; however, students should be warned that they sometimes schedule you when you have specifically asked not to be. Management is always willing to listen, and tries hard to take what you say into account. Customers, or more specifically appeasing them, will always be the hardest part of the job. Coupons are a pain, but coworkers are always ready to help you in a time of need."
good,I had a very productive time there just wish I had more hrs of work. I would of stayed for Eva if it wasn't for that small problem. I loved the staff location an bosses just not the hrs
good,stock seasonal product and merchandising for customer. Give customer full attention. Work in a safe environment for customer and employee and be a team playeer
good,It's a great opportunity to have my first job in macys as seasonal sales associate in women's shoes. If there's a sale or if it's a holiday season many customers are buying shoes. The concerns that I encountered were meeting the demands of the customers especially when their size is out of stock and return purchased items. The managers and other employees were easy to work with by sharing some goals to achieve.
good,"I absolutely love my position at Macy's. The management is amazing and very friendly. They come around often throughout the day and ask how everything is going. The business is very customer oriented and go above and beyond to make ""MAGIC"" daily. A typical day consists of helping customers find everything they are looking for and answering questions that ensure they are comfortable with their purchases. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people decide which item or items that best suit them. Watching customers walk out of the store confident with their purchase is a good feeling. Seems like a small feat but with some of my bad experiences in retail stores, it feels good to know that I've helped make them happy."
good,"open and close store."
good,"Great customer service to accommodate customers with their needs in returns, purchases, or anything in retail. Making customers feel comfortable and making the floor visuable with go-backs."
good,Everyone was kind & helpful while I worked there. The managers were friendly & understanding. Everyday at work I learned something new about the store & customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I was employed almost at the beginning for the busy season so not much coaching was given to me. I had to learn as I went along. There is a sense of family at the store I am employed. The salary is not great but the experience is priceless.
good,loved working for macys. the was room to move up and great mangament there. hours were kind of short. but all in all it was a good job. I would go back to with them anytime
good,"Very fast paced, but generally friendly atmosphere. Management works with school schedules and has positive demeanor towards workers. The pay scale for seasonal work was not bad. Breaks were consistent and Macy's rewards those who do what they should be on a job anyway. Co-workers were over-all friendly and core employees generally were too. Some did have attitudes, often stood around or told you not to do what they did. But, they were readily willing to show you pointers and assist. Not bad place to work."
good,"Hardest part of the job is being on your feet for long hours. Its a fun place to work with a lot of incentives to do better.  benefits are great. Most enjoyable part of the job are the ""Gratis"" from vendors."
good,"Steady Pace alarm center. Previously Tyco or ADT accounts now being handled by Macy Department Store own call center. MAC oversee approximately 840 store nationwide. Both Fire and Burglary systems monitored 24 hours. MAC also submit service tickets for faulty alarm system for repairs. Report writing for break ins and fire alarms. Close employee relations, holiday, birthday parties, and employee appreciation events."
good,"At the Corporate office, there is a constant stream of work but there is an expectation that vacation is taken in full and the Company releases executives at 1 PM on Fridays during the summer months."
good,Great job. wonderful atmosphere. A typical day in the office is very fast pace. Associates really need their questions answered and as a worker you do just that.
good,I honestly really like working for the company. Everyone is pleasant. It is also not a back breaking job at all. I like my boss. The store overall is nice. There are always sales going on and plenty of ways to get extra discounts.
good,I try to stay as busy as possible to make the day go by faster. And i always try to listen to my managers and do as im told. I am a sales associate with macys currently.
good,Always looking to improve and make its employees happy. Review process could be better and employees could be paid more though. Dealing with the public is a difficult job.
good,"I was impressed with how quickly and seamlessly I was incorporated into the Macy's team culture. For the most part I enjoyed my time on the sales floor and had positive interactions with the customers. A little more attention could be paid to staff restrooms and break areas; they weren't as clean and modern as they might be. The hardest part of the job was trying to cash out registers while having to help customers at the same time. Everyone I worked with was helpful and pleasant. The managers were helpful and pleasant as well. The most enjoyable part, and I won't lie, was the employee discount."
good,"I work at Macy's every year for a seasonal position, it was a fun work environment and my coworkers are very nice. The management can be very rude, but it all depends on your attitude and ability to ignore people that try to bring you down!"
good,Macys is a fun place to work at with great flexibility. My manager is very understanding. He is very willing to work with you. Very patient  the co workers are friendly its overall a wonderful place to be. There is room for advancement if interested.
good,"Macy's in goodyear is a great place to work at but not if you are looking for a permanent job. The management and coworkers are friendly and helpful. The work is great, a little on the physical side,. trainers for equipment are awesome and offer great advice on how to make your work life a little easier while boosting your productivity. The down side to working for Macy's is their hiring process. It is complicated and no one completely understands the process and the requirements for advancement are difficult even to move from seasonal to a call on"
good,"Fun and free environment, but managers do not manage as well as they can. You are not payed for how hard you work, basically underpaid."
good,"A typical day at my job would consist of approaching customers and helping them with what they want/need. What i enjoyed the most was restocking merchandise, finding where things need to be and organizing everything."
good,"Macy's is nice retail store to work at. i enjoyed working there for some time i started off as retail rep, moved my way up to loss prevention very fun productive job."
good,"This was a good job to have, especially during the holidays. As a cashier, you are able to work in multiple departments and gain knowledge in multiple areas."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I enjoy working around people. I respect Management and enjoy exploring new ideas about the work place in conversation.  I have learned that the Retail World is so different from Telecommunication World. My co-workers were a great support team, we helped each other finish tasks as needed.  The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and being able to see and make purchases of the sales items before the customers."
good,Gotta take what one can. The organization supports it's employees and there is always room for advancement. Great place for teenagers to work and learn a skill.
good,Great buisness and a typical day at work. Pay is great but a seasonal job and not guaranteed. Some things is not the best but its a job and it gets things done
good,"Nice company with a lot of great perks. Really enjoyed my time here, it's just too bad it didn't last long because it was a seasonal job. Other then that the job is pretty laid back."
good,"♣	One of the main responsibilities that I had at my job was to provide excellent customer service. Customer service was a huge deal. Providing good customer service brings clients back to shop at your store. It is all about engaging with customers, making a connection, and bringing sales. "
good,Learned to put the customers needs first. Timing and scheduling aren't the best it can be for workers. Friendly/cooperative staff even under holiday sales or sale dates.
good,"once you stay after the holidays, they push you to get charge accounts, to the point that customers get angry.  other than that it was fun working there."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. However, hire ratio to hours available was often a problem. Also, Macy's is great with compliance such as fair treatment in the workplace."
good,Decent pay but certain things will undoubtedly pop up and interfere with your personal life. Unexpected schedule changes and late closings suck. Not to mention sometimes overnights or early shifts.
good,Customers and employees friendly but selling Macy's cards are not easy to do but management pushes to open 3 cards a week
good,"Again learned to deal with all types of customer and building relations to help further benefit myself, the department one works for, and the store overall."
good,"Very clear what the work task is daily, coworkers usually on the same page as one another, I learned how to work diligently in a group operated environment and the hardest part was getting hours because the store literally has so many associates ans vendors."
good,I enjoyed working here most of the time. There were some problems here and there with the scheduling and the management but I never really had a bad experience working here.
good,"Encourages and supports diversity in all levels of observed job titles.  Excellent pay in the Information Technology department, provided good vacation pay and sick pay for exempt employees."
good,"I like working here. You got to create your own schedule and didn't have to consult with your supervisor, which was great, but it was very busy and often short staffed. I was seasonal, and they cut most of the seasonal employees."
good,"I sold women's shoes, which was fun, because I love shoes and so do most women. The pay was pretty good; it was hourly plus commission so it's up to you how much you want to make."
good,"Greeted customers and assisted them in finding merchandise. Made sure the store was neat and organized. Pricing and label products. Often handled main cashier duties, answering phones and assisting customers with purchases and returns, and ensured customer satisfaction. Described products to customers and accurately explained details and care of merchandise."
good,i had days at work where i loved being there cause of the way management and some of my coworkers was..i had learned how to sell items one by one and getting commission it was not easy but i got there..i had so coworkers that was easy to get along with
good,"I was seasonal, they promised me five months which lasted three. When they let me go it was when I went to go check my schedule and was then escorted out. They did have some lively people there! Not in which all were bad but some were defiantly sketchy. I had at least three stalkers while I was working there. Not everyone was weird though, I met a lot of awesome people there!  It can get so hectic that you have to share carts, to move boxes. You may have to take out trash or sweep if there is no work. Overall it's not a bad job, just boring. They expect you to stay busy when there's nothing to do which is can be hard to do."
good,"well basically my job was to help the customers with sales and made sure I gave them the best experiences they had while at that moment. A normal day at work will look like helping customers with there shopping, or I can be helping a co-workers cleaning up the floors or the dressing room."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Its the retail industry so the work/life balance aspect is tough as you will work nights, weekends, and holidays like Thanksgiving, etc. You are given everything that you need in order to succeed."
good,I would come in and make the counter look nice and the area smell great. I would make my goals for the day. I would help clients in their skincare needs and beauty needs.
good,"Working at Macys is amazing but there has been a huge turnover in managers especially in the home and mattress department and I have been told different stories from each one and the scheduling kept being messed up, not because of the managers, but because of the system they use to schedule people. The only reason I am leaving is because I would like a change and something closer to where I live. I do love the atmosphere and my coworkers but it is time for a change."
good,"Love the hours got to be home by 11am sometimes."
good,"Some Macys are better then others, "
good,This was my first job in a department store.  I enjoyed the work and being able to stand for long periods of time.  The management was good.  Benefits for employees are underrated but still are acceptable.
good,"It was a bit of a competitive work environment. You are given a goal in sales to meet for your scheduled time. However, the managers and co-workers were a pleasure to work with. I liked the flexibility of the work schedules."
good,"A typical day at Macy's consists of selling women's shoes to customers, while maintaining a positive attitude and openness to questions or concerns, while ringing up customers and making sure that there is a clean and orderly sales floor for people to shop. With this job I have learned to deal with the personalities of others and to be more open to changes and also to aim high in all that I do.  My co workers and I usually work as a team and cover each others shifts when needed. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done on time, due to the many steps and the doable responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to earn small token s of appreciation, like extra money and discounts. And of course Management; which is great. Management at Macy's understands that there is more to life than just the store. Allowing the needs of its employees to be met as best."
good,"Overall if you are looking for an up and down schedule and you don't mind working holidays and weekends, this is the job for you. Each management team is different so it depends on which location to know if you like them or not. It's a competitive company within itself so prepare for outrageous goals."
good,i liked working at macy's because i was around all the clothes that i wore on a daily basis. the people that i worked wit were all wonderful people too like i was apart of a family there
good,"was able to meet a lot of new people everyday, managers were accommodating to personal lives, very slow business at times, co workers easy to get along with"
good,"Since I was in Macys for long time, I can tell you that it's good place for woman with family to work. "
good,I didn't work their long but for a few short months it was a pleasant environment to work. All the managers and coworkers where all polite. I learned a lot about customer support working their I had a lot of opportunity to meet different people. I gained a little more confidence in regards to talking with strangers. The hardest part of the job was the crowds during the weekend sometimes made things confusing but the mangers where very helpful in making those situation less overwhelming.
good,"Co-workers and management made coming to work very fun. Working in cosmetics was always fun and easy. Here and there i would have a very complicated customer. Over all, the job was very easy, fun and enjoyable."
good,"Good system and Management, poor salary/benefits"
good,At the time i was working here it was cool the coworkers were fun management was nice. The only gripe I have with this place is when management tells you to do something when there is nothing to do. You only find things to do during sales and holidays typical retail. 90% of the time its slow and when its slow its really boring. The hardest part of the Job is dealing with obnoxious customers and half the time just call the managers and they deal with it swerve. The most enjoyable part of the job is socializing with coworkers and enjoying the mall on breaks. What i learned  is how to deal and interact with customers and sell.
good,"Overall it is good place to work and build your communication skills. I am a part of excellent work team. Managers are amazing. If you like to be socially active, it is a perfect place to work."
good,I have worked for Macy's for three years and have found them to be an effective company within its industry and offers competitive pay and benefits. Executive opportunities are harder to come by but overall job stability is a plus.
good,At the beginning and end of every shift we would compare sales expectations and actual daily sales with each other for a competitive edge in the work place. The management also would come up with prizes and competitions to inspire motivation.
good,A typical day at work is working as a TEAM with all of the staff. The hardest part of the job is re-arranging the sportswear after customers tried the garments on and my favorite part of the job is knowing that I made the the customers happy and put a smile on their face.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"•	Customer service consultations"
good,"You definitely learn to be patient with this job. Ringing up customers can be fun and rewarding a lot of the time. The most tedious part of the job is maintaining the floor, the cash-wrap, the fitting room, and your sales/new accounts. Management here is like any other job; picking and choosing employees, rely on hardworking employees for employees that dont pick up their own slack. The environment of the store was good. Co-workers were who really made work worth coming to (besides new and frequent customers). I gained a lot of experience professionally and personally here. Made me more passionate about helping others and seeing them beyond satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning the stock room, making space for new shipments, and selling shoes. Management was not very help at times and they were very nasty when they wanted to be. My coworkers spent more time in the stockroom playing than actually spending time on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find shoes or outfits that fit their personality."
good,"Business was very competitive, but when working with the right employees it was easy to meet your goals for the day. There was a lot of gossip that moved through the work place. I enjoyed the discounts and merchandise available."
good,"Loved meeting new people, working, helping and interacting with customers. Everyday was exciting. Managers never put pressure on the workers. Loved it"
good,well fold and put away alot of clothes ask every one if they wanted a macys credit card. and was a cashier. also i did inventory at night i was good at that really enjoyed it.
good,A typical day at Macy's would be interacting and building a relationship with the customer. Making sure the customer's needs are always met. Also making sure their products are placed out for the customers.
good,"You had to stay busy or else you'll get in trouble and you must meet a sales goal for the day. Lines would always be long because they wouldn't open enough registers. Customers demanded a lot like using coupons, when they were not eligible."
good,It's very flexible with your schedule. It's like a family there. They value customer service extremely which makes this place enjoyable. They are always ready to put the customer first to insist that they enjoy their shop at Macy's.
good,My time at Macy's was the perfect job to introduce me to sales and business while maintaining flexibility with my schedule as a student. My co-workers work hard and my managers were always accessible and great leaders.
good,"Early in the morning you could assist as many as 300 people from all over the word, is the kind of place were everyone visits at least once."
good,"Hardest part of my job was balancing so many customers at once especially during Christmas sales. If I could, I would try again."
good,"Have to be on your toes with everything you do. Never just wait around find something to do. Fold, Sell clothes, fix up help customers"
good,"A typical day of work as a Lead would be for me to make sure daily plans are due a week prior the upcoming week. As a Lead i had to supervise a team of 25 associates and make sure associates are effective in their work productivity, The hardest part of the job will be to find coverage when an associate calls out in big event and during the holidays."
good,This position is responsible for the execution of merchandise-oriented promotions/events to drive sales within Macy's stores for a geographic region. The position networks and partners with a combination of internal and external resources including personnel in stores as well as the Merchant organization and external community partners and vendors.
good,While working at Macy's i learned how to work with many different customers. I also learned how to properly take inventory and other things i should know about retail.
good,There are never any hours to give to the employees on the support team but hours appear so that the sales associate can do the support jobs.
good,Hours for work were not always available the schedule registration is first come first serve therefore you are not guaranteed hours
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"all encompassing "
good,This was my first retail job and it was easy to pick my hours cause it was a system in which allows you to work. But i loved working there but terrible management.
good,I loved to work at Macy's Galleria. I loved my team in the Ralph Lauren department. Days went by so quick because of the interaction we had as coworkers and with our loyal customers that would come back to see us and shop again and again.
good,A team oriented work environment with strong support. The work is engaging and equally spread around. Pay is underwhelming.
good,"This is a good place to work.  There is a good work/life balance with some of the work hours provided.  The drawback is when work starts to become scarce, hours to work are very limited making it hard to maintain a proper lifestyle for someone with a family."
good,"I work at Macys as a part time employee and is only here 2 -4 days a week. The people there are friendly and helpful. However, managers can be pushy when it comes to opening Macys credit cards."
good,What I learned during my time at this store is how to provide great customer service in and out of the store. The management team are understanding of what the customer and employee need help on. The co-workers within the store are great people to work with and they enjoy working there since its a great environment to be in. The hardest part of my job is we are given a lot of tasks to complete to work on in one day and when it is not complete it has to be finished the next day. We have a lot of tasks to handle with a short amount of employees to handle them.
good,A typical day consisted of either or unloading merchandise off of trucks and placing the items on shelf. I benefited from working as a team through much communication and understanding with co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work tends to be merchandising the floor and having an associate on the shop to upkeep the neat appeal giving me the chance to fill floor better and give it a fitting look. I've gotten to witness an improved management angle on retail jobs here. The management is spot on- accommodating scheduling with my daily schedule, appointing supervisors who know how the job can be executed with less difficulty, maintaining a fair amount of staff on the floor consistently, and sympathetic yet authoritative to keep the flow of productivity at a high percentage constantly. The co-workers are great; there's a lot of team effort and genuine modesty with the right guidance. Hardest part of the job would have to be when we'd have to perform stock work and micro-manage every item for damages, tags, or re-ticketing seeing as how the stock room is about the size of a mini-gym. However, the best part of the job is the morale and productivity. There's always something to do so time will fly by without ever having to be bored."
good,Macy's it the place of magic and selling meet together to satisfy customer. i like my schedule and my work over there. you meet different people everyday and you learn something new everyday.
good,"I collected different products, such as cloths and tie necktie everyday. It was interesting to communicate with customers and deal with variety problems."
good,I enjoyed working with Macys especially the customer service aspect of my work. I always met or exceeded my sales goals and was enthusiastic about doing so.
good,"Everyone knows how to have fun and be productive at the same time, it's easy to make friends because everyone is friendly and they become your second family."
good,"Management at Macys are wonderful, they are nice with employee but so much pushing to open CC. All together is ok."
good,Your day to day always changes. Management is great and willing to work with your schedule.  The hardest part of the job is that sometimes you can't rely on new hires and have to take on the extra work.
good,"I work in the home dept."
good,"I typical day there is a lot of duties not limited to sales and customer  service. Including merchandizing, stocking , client calls, personal attention to a clients needs as well as greeting new clients, when needed we are pulled to other departments that need help. During the holidays I was an SSA which stands for seasonal sales assistant, those duties included scheduling and coaching of the new associates. In addition I would help drive sales and help open credit accounts fro the store."
good,sale all day my workers are fun to work with we all help eachother the hardest part of day is when u get mean customers and the management is good they treat really well its a good team
good,"Overall was a great job. Had great coworkers and trainers that made sure I was comfortable with my job. A day at work started with a meeting and then stretching to get ready for the day ahead.  The days were usually fast paced and busy, which was nice.  On days that we weren't busy, they placed us in other departments to learn, or we restocked our work areas."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Everyone is acknowledged. They have programs to move you forward in the company if you're interested. I had 2 managers in my time there and I liked them both.
good,"i learned that not everyone would agree with what you like as fashion. You have to treat each customer different, let them talk about themselves so you can pick up on what they may or may not like."
good,Low Pay great management. co-workers are fantastic... the hardest part of macy's would be the work schedule never consistent. I work with a lot of great people
good,"great co workers, nice way of being able to pick up your own shifts and or swapping your shifts. nice that working in the womans shoe department offered a commission base also."
good,Days are filled with great associates and great customers.  Teams focus on customer service.  Merchandising Teams work to make the store easy to shop.
good,"I learned good people skills and how to operate a cash register, co-workers are friendly and willing to teach. management doesn't breathe micromanage and they trust you and your work."
good,"I had the opportunity to work and grow at Macy's Systems and Technology. It's a great place to work. There are many opportunities to learn, lead, and implement many new technologies and project management techniques."
good,A typical day at work I opened the store  and .Waited on numerous customers.  Handled numerous phone calls I learned how to handle the busy times.  My co-workers were the greatest.  Everyone would pitch in.  The most enjoyable part of work was waiting on the customers.
good,Great place to work. Great co-workers and management is nice and want to make sure you advance to where you want to be in the company.
good,Learned how to use a pallet jack. Being around great customers whom appreciated your performance. Clean environment and the employees were nice.
good,"A nice, organized place to work for, especially during the holidays. Everyone is so lively during the holidays with the radiant red and green colors. The people are nice and the co-workers are great."
good,"I loved working for Macys, it was something that I had never did before. The workers and coworkers were very friendly and always energetic. If I could work there again I definitely would."
good,"Enjoyed the flexible hours, coworkers, and even helping customers. However, the have too many expectations of their associates for how little they pay them."
good,"This place is filled with different departments and management, but all is the same. No room for growing. Will not go back."
good,The managers were all nice and the work was not very difficult. The training could have been better but it doesn't take too long to get used to the flow of things.
good,"Emphasis on working together as a team to best help the customer. "
good,"Working at Macys and; Bloomingdales was one of the greatest jobs I have had.  Everyone aspired to be better than me, which kept me on my toes.  The greatest reward was to be able to help people to help ;themselves and be stress free and comfortable in doing it.  It is a great thing to wakeup, but the day was greater when I could help someone else to feel better about themselves and knowing someone like me really cared as a collector. It made it even better when management encouraged you to do your best without breaking the bank."
good,"A ver Productive and Professional environment to work in. very fast paced and goal oriented. i enjoyed working in a commission based work play, it was very competitive and motivating"
good,"I would greet and assist customers based on what they were looking for. I was in teens, men, and the handbag department. I answered customers questions, directed them to the appropriate departments based on what they were looking for, helped locate specific merchandise, checkout and bag merchandise for customers and advise customers on promotions, sales and events going on in the store. I would work with coworkers to make sure the store was in organized condition, clean out fitting rooms, organize clothing racks and to assist customers in the most efficient ways possible. I learned how to schedule out all my responsibilities throughout the shift while making sure all the customers were happy and the store was always in organized order so it could run efficiently as possible for everyone in the store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys is a good place to work but the pay is not so good but i appreciate it. Its work for a younger age person can do . Lots of standing for long hours. Consistent walking with lots if clothes.
good,easy calm environment.. educate you in addition to otherthings.  they seem that promotios are given  base in who you know..not merit or earning it.
good,"Co-workers are very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job, to me, was having to deal with angry customers. Some customers are understanding of Macy's policies and procedures while others simply are just not having it."
good,"Managers are amazing to work for, and are very flexible in working with my kids schedule and school. However the pay is horrible for a company that makes so much money, and advancement good take many years unless you relocate."
good,We were like a family not just a team. We enjoyed meeting new people and helping to make better shopping experience for customers.  Very rewarding knowing you were a part of that experience.
good,"A wonderful and fullfilling company to work for, very generous and active in the local community as well as world- wide.  This position will allow you to use your phone techniques to assist the customer.  Customer are mostly satisfied with their products.  Very futile are there any complaints.  This position was a joy"
good,"Teamwork was valued greatly at this job as well as making sure the environment stayed lively for customers. We worked several departments at once sometimes, always ensured the customers were taken care of and made time to make friends about the place."
good,I worked their during the holidays and things were really nice. It was a seasonal job so I didn't stay long but would love to work their again one day.
good,"Macy's offers ample amounts of opportunities to grow and expand as a professional. Employees can change positions and locations within the company with much ease. The company invests in its employees, especially in the managerial/executive levels."
good,"A typical day would vary, depending on whether it was a sale day. On busy days we would be fully staffed to handle the business for the day. Slower days were taking care of task and focusing on guest and their needs. Assisting guests, monitoring associates and making sure they were doing their job and completing any computer task and duties. In my position, I feel treating people with respect and compassion goes a long way for them to want to do a great job for you. Everyone needs to be encouraged and thanked when doing a great job. At times, dealing with an upset guest could be challenging but being a good listener and finding out exactly what they want goes a long way, After all, you want the guest to leave a happy one so they will return in the near future. I truly enjoyed my job because of the people I worked with and the pleasure of working with our guests."
good,Great hours and flexibility. I enjoyed the management and they were nice. They give you time to train and get on your feet.
good,"I rely like to work for Macy's."
good,"A typical day at work involved having a brief meeting with the signage staff to ensure everyone is aware of what needs to be done in terms of advertisement and signage displays. Pretty much everyone has their own sections they are responsible for and all signings need to be up before the stores opening. Unfortunately I did not have the chance to really come into the title as signage lead as the co-manager was the one assumed all responsibility and looked upon me as just a lead.  The hardest part of the job for me was having all of the members work together and do the task on time, it was a struggle to have everyone focused on completing their task. Overall it is not a bad company but be prepared to stand alone most of the time during company decisions as they don't consider the signage lead to be a major component. Often times I had to stay way past my time in order to complete the task given."
good,"Totally enjoyed the work place, assisting clients in choosing clothes that fit them properly. .Having customer return monthly to work with me personally"
good,Great company to foster and develop many skills. They have great tools within their Learning and Development process to support their employees. They are starting to really look at technology updates to support the product development process as well. They strive to recognize the individuals and group efforts.
good,"If you're into high-end cosmetics and know your stuff,this is for you. Also great if you enjoy doing makeovers. I loved the diversity. It can get stressful on a really busy day,but overall rewarding if you love what you do."
good,Each day is unique which is both fulfilling and challenging.  There is a constant wealth of information and opportunities to learn something new.
good,Great place to learn in the moment. Co-workers are supportive and knowledgeable. Work life balance can sometimes be difficult but that is the nature of the business. You can gain some valuable experience and insights into the retail world.
good,"My typical days was as a sale associate in various departments, mangers were helpful, lack of associates in some areas."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The people were great to work with but the pay wasnt so good.Managers helped with the schedule so you can have family time.
good,"Always wanted to work at Macy's.  Although it was seasonal, I enjoyed the work.  I worked five kiosks in the perfume department."
good,This is a good job but there simply is not enough hours for the amount of employees. Demanding more work while cutting hours.
good,"A typical day is helping customers finding merchandise, and ensuring customers leave satisfied with their purchase.  Making magic happen everyday!"
good,answer inbound phone calls basic data entry transfer calls to proper department call center was very big and comfortable the calls where fast paced overall good company
good,"Long hours, competitive pay, extremely nice co-workers, understanding customers. So far the job has been moderately paced and I cant say I have anything to complain about. I think I should have had a few more training days and gotten payee for the 40 hours of online and in store training that I completed."
good,"-  Receive/greet customers."
good,I think the best thing about working as a sales associate at Macy's (besides the discounts) was being able to take care of & please the customers to the best of my ability.
good,"Macy's was a good company to work for.  I worked at the Gurnee Macy's.  This Macy's is a one floor store compare to other Macy's, therefore, it was comfortable store to work for."
good,"Every department has a start up meeting, which includes safety and general statistics for the work day, then we do stretches. In the 3 years I have been with eh company I have learned different jobs and even different positions for every department. The co-workers generally work very well as a team, but the hours are long and are probably the hardest part of the job. As far as what I enjoy at Macy's, it is the ability to be flexible enough to learn from many different team members in management, as well as the trainers who took the time to teach me new jobs, so that I can work in any department and still be successful."
good,"Macys is a great place to work in my opinion. The 20 minute breaks are paid (30 minute breaks and 1 hour breaks are not). I work in the shoe department, which is commission based so sometimes my coworkers get hostile and territorial but when I was working in the non-commission part of the store I got along very well with my coworkers and I felt like we all had a great time while still getting work done. "
good,"Interacted with customers and management to give shoppers a great experience."
good,Macys has best scheduling system from any place I've worked in. Management was always clear and precise in what you had to do. Job gets tedious during the holidays but enjoyable work experience.
good,Working in Macys has helped me gain more working experience in a professional working environment. This is a stepping stone for my advanced career.
good,"During my career at Macys, I was able to advance quickly.  My job was challenging at times, yet I was usually given the support needed to complete each task."
good,I have really enjoyed working for Macy's. I like the environment and my coworkers. I am in need of a full time job or another part time job. I would like to continue working for Macy's but it is only part time.
good,When i started working at Macy's it was pretty simple. I love that most times it was always busy so it always made things go smoother. I learned how to work with different people and also great customer service. The only part that i didn't like about the job was the unexpected quick changes we would have to make in the stock room.

To push credit card application is the 1st priority!  Not always easy.  They do have a great schedule system called MSP, which you can choose your hours.  It could be a lot of fun, at times.  However management tends to be very clique-y sometimes and the 'point system' can be flawed and inaccurate!"

My manager was always there as a support system, and provided constructive reviews to help me improve my abilities. This is a skill set that I will be able to carry with me into whatever profession I decide to pursue."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I never saw myself working at a retail store, but overall i really like it. I started of working at Macy's as recovery; in which is helping every department put all the clothes back and to maintain the floor and displays in place. It's probably one of the hardest thing ever, since it never stays clean. Although, now i got promoted as a sales associate. Now my duty is to recover the floor, manage the rack, offer a good customer service and assist them with all their needs."
good,I worked 11-6 I would come in clock in and head ride to an open workers station if there were any available if not then I would be a sorter for that day until an open space was available. I learned how to be very fast at things with this company. management was the best they made you feel wanted. My coworkers were very helpful any thing I needed I just went straight to them. the hardest part of this job was to pack the bigger things like microwave ovens because you needed bigger boxes for those kinds of things and if we didn't really have them then we would have to make a big box. The most enjoyable part of my job was matching the invoices to the merchandise was fun it was like playing I spy.
good,"Wonderful team. Many opportunities to learn and advance"
good,"Enjoyable place to work, organized and structured. Well managed and a good idea of what your job description is."
good,"A typical day at Macy's involves starting everyday with a smile, and ensuring every customer receives the best customer service. I learned how to be an exceptional sales associate and how to work well as a team. The management and co-workers were extremely supportive, and helped to create a great working atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of working as a sales associate at Macy's was getting the opportunity to meet different individuals and working with them on a personal level to assure they were satisfied with the service and product we provide."
good,its a good place to work if you can last it hasn't given me a raise in a whole year and a haolf so im kinda looking to get out of there cause fed ex gives you more benefits
good,"You can have your day in order but there are always changes. I've learned that the bottom line is the key. My co-workers are truely the best. We work as a Team always. We have ech othes best interest and make sure that the job gets done. What I  finf themost challangeing is trying to maintain Life Work Balance. "
good,you clock in depending on the time you come in your either taking customers right away or setting up your area making sure everything is presentable and taking back anything that customers returned. The hardest part had to deal with the strong accents some of the tourist had. Ive learned a lot from working at macy's from closing a register to how well organized I am. It was a great experience and I enjoyed working at a fast paced environment. The pay was just pretty low
good,"Assist customers"
good,Nice work environment and good people.  I did not mind working there at all.
good,Customers are great. Associate are fantastic. All managers are great there.The most enjoyable is meeting different people every day. The hardest part of the job is working for less money...

good,"I have over 25 years of Customer Service experience. A typical work  day at Macy's is the continuous fast paced customer service focus and day to day sales with a daily and weekly goal that I strive to meet. What I've learned from management experience  is that   training is a very important and critical tool  and in order for your company to be successful you need to know and have knowledge of all products that you sell to consumers.  I was also chosen to be one of the Assistant Managers during the Christmas  holidays for the past 5 years. The hardest part of my job is that I am extremely helpful. Once completing my goal I also help my co-workers achieve their goals and by the time my shift ends I'm a little warn out, but I don't think that is a bad thing because at the end of the day we all win, meet our daily goal and keep our jobs. I enjoy working with my co-workers or I work well individually. The most enjoyable part of my job is suggestive selling new products in detail in hopes of selling it to the customer. I am a peoples person and  love interacting with customers and having excellent communication skills. I've learned to also listen to the customers concerns to find out their wants, needs and issues if any. My main focus is once a customer leaves my store  I want to make sure they are happy and therefore I know that they will come back and be one of my clientele customers moving forward."
good,"Typical day is starting at 6 am.  Had a work planner made out for the week and task that had to be done.  I learned how to do work orders for repairs.  Management was all right.  Co-workers you liked working with and then there was co-workers you didn't liked working with.  They didn't care, did what they wanted to do.  Hardest of the job being short handed.  Most enjoyable is see a job well done by all."
good,"Productive and competetive work environemnt, getting paid based on performance which is very excitigng, coworkers have great attitude with helping each other, the hardets part fo job is closing and make sure every thing is where it supposed to be and is organized for tomorrows audit. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have agood sale day and make your goal."
good,"My particular position is one of a very few.  I am on-call and have total control over my schedule.  I am retired and am not seeking anything where there are concerns regarding promotions and/or a career path.  I am the quintessential team player within the Cosmetics Department.  I now have the unique ability within the company to fill in on any counter for sales.  I am not highly knowledgeable in any one counter, as I do not spend enough time at any one counter but bounce around from counter to counter as shifts become available.  I find it suits me, I have the opportunity to learn a little about a great deal of product, and I can work the hours that fit into my schedule.  What is difficult with this position is being on my feet for an entire shift, be it four or seven hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"worked part-time evenings and weekends while working a full time job."
good,"Working at a fast past restaurant their is never a dule moment. Directing other young adults was good for me, it help me to become a leader, but the hardest part was the rude one that did not want to work.  It kept me on my toes and the day went by fast."
good,"Unload trucks, process goods. Clean up and supply registers. Assist in inventory. Any other oddball jobs that need done."
good,"I am very working hard and help the customer."
good,Manager was friendly but didn't train as I thought it should have been.
good,"Provide a good customer service everyday at work. I learned how to work as a team / team leader, help find mix/ match clothes for customers, maintain the department. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customer services."
good,"A typical day at work began with checking-in with other store managers on what needed to be accomplished for the day, working with associates and training new associates, providing outstanding customer service to each of our customers, making sure that policy, procedure and Brand expectations were being met. I learned a lot about merchandising, scheduling, developing and coaching associates. I also learned about many different departments in the store and not just the ones I had direct responsibility over. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and learning from them. The hardest part of the job was leaving due to a change in my families dynamic. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers and helping customers find exactly what they were looking for in our store."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some really great managers and associates.
good,A typical day at Macy's included me meeting and greeting a variety of guest. I would get to know their names and find out what brought them to the store by using open ended questions. I would then suggest quality merchandises  and explain why that particular merchandise would be suitable for them. My co-workers were great and they always would help me to best serve the guest. Management always encouraged us to provide outstanding service and they worked well with my schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was to compete with my other team members to sell the most Macy's card. We would get rewarded with employee of the month and sometimes won prizes.
good,"This was a full time position, but since it was retail, the hours varied each day.  Some days I went in before the store opened and other days I didn't go in until noon and stayed until the store closed.  All employees were taught to up-sell and had to meet a revenue goal for their shift.  Sometimes this was really disappointing because the goal wasn't met and could create a lot of stress.  Management was very helpful in dealing with issues that employees couldn't resolve. The hardest part of the job was keeping enough sales people scheduled to cover each department.  For the most part, I enjoyed the job until it ended with the holidays."
good,Never a dull day at work. Always something new and interesting  going on.
good,"Macy's provided a work environment for me to grow and interact with more people, from customers to top managers.  Management at Macy's is top notch, making sure we are satisfied with out jobs and work environment.  Our concerns were also addressed in company meetings.  My co-workers are the friendliest people I've ever met, and very comfortable in our conversations.  Enjoyable part of the job is just going into work that day."
good,"My passions are beauty and cosmetics. I was a beauty advisor for Macy's, therefore I loved what I did. I loved the client interaction and the multiple responsibilities, including appointment scheduling, bookkeeping, filing, and stocking, Make-up trends are always evolving which is what I also enjoyed. the constant changes made my job more interesting. My coworkers were very welcoming and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job was team work. Even though i had a counter manager, i took on a lot of responsibility, which often went unnoticed by the department managers. Eventually, it was noticed that my counter manager never came to work and was let go. I never received any notification of this, leaving the overall responsibility of the counter that worked for in my hands, Because i love working at a fast pace and i multitask very well, i was able to handle it. I didn't appreciate the lack of appreciation or communication from my department managers about this change however. The most enjoyable part of my job was what i was involved in, cosmetics. Again, beauty and cosmetics are my passion, so i manage to put aside the issues and just enjoyed what i was hired to do."
good,Working at Macy's was exciting and rewarding.  Hard work is the norm but I didn't mind since it made the days go by faster.  Management was strict and demanding but I learned to deal with it and meet sales goals.   Working there was enjoyable!

The smile on their faces give me joy, when I have help them with their cosmetic needs. whereas,  it's a question,  makeup choices, recommendations or skin care.  A satisfied customer is a happy return customer. It is also important to follow up with your clients it makes a difference and they feel special.

The managers from every department are very pleasant and always are willing to help even if their not that knowledgeable about a specific problem."
good,It was the holiday season and very fast paced. I learned a lot.
good,"If you are an hourly employee in Corporate, there really isn't much room for advancement unless you have a background in design/planning or merchandising.  Also, there are no sick, personal, floating days to take off.  Just regular PTO and to start off it's just 8 days for the year!  So don't get sick if you plan on taking a vacation!  "
good,"Over all a fun place to work , with every day comes its challenges however we make to most out of every opportunity."
good,"my work schedule varied greatly. some days I helped open the store other days I helped close. I organized my work space, helped cleanup dressing room, seek out customers to assist with their purchases. attempt to get customers to open charge accounts. my manager was always very helpful.  I did have one co worker that always presented a not so friendly attitude towards customers. I would sometimes have to intervene to assist the customer with their purchases.  hardest part of the job was no steady hours that allowed me to pursue my college goals"
good,"My co-workers were friendly, my managers were competent and professional. It was great to interact with customers and help serve their needs, although some of them could be difficult. I learned to put the customer first and how to upsell. Long days spent on my feet could take a toll, however."
good,"Provided customer service in self-service store."
good,"Working at Macys provided me an opportunity to interact and learn from people all over the world. I worked in the main department store located on 34th street, which lead me to meet different people. I learned about their cultures, values and sense of style. Being a sales associate taught me how to work independently, as well as with others. I believe the hardest part of my job was to make sure I was meeting the demands of my customers when things would get very hectic. However, the hardest part of my job was also the most valuable in what it taught me, I learned how to manage my time and multitask. I also learned how much I a capable of doing, and how to do it well. The best part of my job was working with my co-workers and getting to know them, learning about how we can work off each other  to make the day a little stressful and a little more fun. Working with a company like Macys taught me a lot about the ladder  to success and how to excel through handwork and determination."

good,Love all of the opportunities to volunteer!  They definitely put their employees first!
good,"During a typical day I was responsible for maintaining the look of clothes on the shelf and assisting customers in finding merchandise, or with making a decision in regards to the purchasing of a particular product."
good,"I would arrive to work on time, clock in, check with my manger what are the sales for the day (if it was a long term sale, I would find out when it ends), and attend too the customers. I would tell them all the information about the coats, for example what material is it made out of. I would also ring the customer, when they were ready for purchase. I would go on my break, when done return and make sure I reached my daily goals before clocking back out. I've learned about coats and which are better for the winter. I could use that to my advantage when every winter comes along. My coworkers were very nice and helpful if I ever had a question at hand. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customer leave happy, and the most hardest part  (also able too be done) was keeping up with every coat that arrived in our store."
good,"worked as a merchandiser they'd tell me I didn't have enough experience. Finally I got a merchandising job doing temp work and it was extremely easy. The only thing I had to learn was how to read a plan-o-gram, which only took me about 5 minutes to figure out. Once I'd done the job I didn't understand why the companies asked for so much experience because the job was very simple.It is a good Work Environment, although it gets boring without customers and the music at times may make you fall asleep unless your in cosmetics. Employees have good benefits if you take advantage of them. The managers are extremely nice. Every year you get a review, and then a raise. They are very flexible on time and life balances. The most amazing comment about working at macys is the employee discount."
good,Working here was fun and exciting as there are different departments to work in.  Learned alot about watches.
good,A typical work day revolved around assisting customers and assuring clothes were on racks where they belonged. I learned how to put together items that complimented each other and how to make more efficient sales. I had some good coworkers and some lazy ones.

good,"A typical day at work was rather slow and at times a little boring. However, I enjoyed working there because the workers there were so pleasant and they really made it feel like a family. The hardest part really was being able to manage things alone because I had to handle the juniors section alone most times but the challenge was worth it. It pushed me and I excelled. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be when we had theme days or when we would bring food in and just enjoy each others company on our lunch breaks."
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking emails for promotional events, deadlines, and important information in regards to previous day sales and credit goals as well as productivity hours. Then I had to review the utilize reports in order to implement action plans specifically focusing on deficit areas. The manger in charge calls a meeting at 8:30am where things such as announcements, customer surveys, sales, credit and other metrics are reviewed. (The manager in charge rotates every week) An action plan is taken for the day where all the working managers come to an agreement on lunch schedules, information to go over with associates, store wide incentives, and ways to provide optimal customer service. It was the executive in charge job to gather all associates for our store meeting where we would go over sales, credits, and customer surveys responses as well as other important information. At this time we would also celebrate and recognize our top performing associates. My co-workers at Macy's were absolutely amazing. We were a family. We helped each other out and gave each other constructive criticism when needed. There was never a dull moment with my co-workers, I learned a great deal from everyone of them. The hardest part of the job is accomplishing your day plan because in retail there are so many things that can occur. Everyday is different and you can only be as prepare as you can be and everything else requires you to think on your toes.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my associates grow. When you can make a difference in someone's life is a very rewarding"
good,"Inventory time was exciting."
good,"Enjoyed the sales atmosphere, working with clients, makeovers, learning about new products and sharing with clients, very busy."
good,"I love retail, so when I go to work I get to be around people and fun merchandise all day. I help customers feel better when they leave the store then when they came in."
good,"A great first job. The paid sucks, but the benefits make it worth it."
good,Work was always okay. The only problem was that somone can see you were helping another person and that sales associate would take your sale away. Ive learned so much because i met some great people that taught me great things and stuff I could use if I ever got a different job as well. I learned differnt techniques when approaching a customer and how to keep their attention.The only part I found hard was the fact i could barely make deficit.
good,Working at Macy's taught me a lot as far as building relationships with all levels of management.  My team that I was responsible varied with different skill levels which was something that I loved.  I worked hard to ensure that each person felt comfortable and that they gained knowledge from each visit that I had with them. The moments that I cherished the most was when I was able to take someone who wasn't secure in her position and with proper guidance and mentoring I was able to watch them grow more confident in the roles and even get promoted.

The employees are very nice and help and I get to meet new friends."
good,"I have been at Macys.com for over eighteen months now and have grown to love the interactive world of ecommerce. I have had the privlidge of working on many high profile campaigns and omni-channel projects including the current production of Fashion Star. The existing technology today gives the opportunity to evolve and try something new with every campaign. The exploration of how to use all the new functionality available to incorporate into our sitelets is both challenging and rewarding. Learning something completely new every day is truley a remarkable experience."
good,"A typical day working at macys is alot of ups and downs. You may get a customer that knows eactly what they want and just needs your help to find it, or you may get a customer thats just browsing through. Macys is verry good with traing you and helping you meet your sales goal. I would have to say the hardest part of he job would be dealing with unsatisfied customers."

good,I have the opportunity to meet people frorm all over the world on a typical day. My co-workers and I work as a team when we are busy and management does recognize our hard work at those times. The hardest part of the job is standing all day but we keep busy.
good,"Opportunities for success"
good,"I really enjoyed receiving new products and placing them where they could be seen & purchased by customers.  My work shift was full of activity which I enjoyed because there was no down time. My co-workers worked as a team and helped each other.  Sometimes finding a space to place products was challenging because of limited space, but it always worked out."
good,Working will diverse people day to day; couching associates to meet sale goals and mission needs.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with so many different people and learning about them and myself in the process.

good,A typical day at work is getting ready to work. What I've learned is that working can be tough sometimes but it's good to work and make money to pay your taxes and feed your children. The co-workers are just really friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is driving from Alexandria to Springfield just to work and working on the weekends can be difficult. The most enjoyable job is socializing with your co-workers during break or having lunch with them.
good,A typical work day consists of servicing customers recovering department and interacting with management.
good,"The experience of working with people from different walks of life is the best part of this job. Since the inception of my employ, I have had 4 managers and 3 supervisors.

A typical day includes interacting with customers, cleaning and restocking racks with apparel, Putting outfits together for our customers, using our search and send database locating garments for our clients to purchase from another store, or our warehouse, opening credit cards for our customers to help save money. From working at Macy's I learned how to conduct myself in a professional manner, I learned excellent problem solving skills, and executing tasks in a speedy manner. Management at Macy's for the most part is a positive one. Most of the managers are willing to help, and maintain a high level of professionalism for the most part. The women I work with are absolutely outstanding, we all have mixed personalities that can create friction at times but because we are all on the same team we all can manage to put our differences aside. The hardest part of my job is being on my feet eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers that I interact with."

good,Provide customer services on their credit card accounts. Setting meetings to inform co-workers of new rules and changes with the assign registers. Helping the customers with any questions.
good,Fast pace and different everyday. workload changes dependant upon what is happening in the store. It is nice to meetand converse with customers and collegues.
good,I worked at the location right after it was built this was one of my favorite jobs.
good,"i enjoy doing Customer service, helping customers with their needs."
good,"I met a lot of wonderful people at Macy's however one of my bosses was extremely strict. She would always treat me like a 5 year old, and it nearly drove me nuts. But the managers were nice, and most of the associates. Since it was a temporary job, I was happy I didn't have to quit because eventually I would have. The hardest part of it was to answer questions I didn't know the answer to. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting other employees. They were always so friendly and willing to engage into conversations."
good,Management was very motivating and rewarded successful employees. My pay in downtown Los Angeles was $8.40/hour and it just wasn't enough to live on so I had to look for another job.
good,"i was a customer sales associate, i everybody there was nice , polite and respetful. excellent atmosphere."
good,I was a sales associate and on the recovery team. It was a good job. I was only seasonal but it was worth it for extra cash. I did not like the fact that they did not tell me my section was over they just let me think I was still employed with them.
good,Began as a department manager and learned management skills.
good,Macy's was a great place to work. I felt respected and valued for my work as well as needed.
good,"go to work find out where to go and what to do for the day, learned to merchandise, do markdowns, do the truck, coworkers are great, hardest part is when times get slow you find anything you can to do to stay busy. enjoyable part is learning new things"
good,Thanks to God most of my day at work is enjoyable.
good,"I was a seasonal support associate. I loved working here. The atmosphere was great, everyone was nice-- management, co-workers, customers. This was my first job, so I learned a lot. How to do recovery, pricing, inventory, and just helping the customers. It was hard to remember where every department was. On-call shifts were literally on-call shifts. They call you and you have to come in in like half an hour or an hour. You can usually take your break whenever. There's no one hovering over your shoulder. Training prepared you for everything."
good,"I've learned a lot throughout the years at Macy's. The people that have entered my life through the store has been amazing. The management that I've had the opportunity to interact with couldn't be better. While you're on the floor selling products, you are taught to make a pitch in 10 seconds or less. You must make sure the customer feels at ease and making the right decision. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with all the associates when there's free time."
good,A typical day at work would start with a lot of nice gestures from coworkers. This job was retail so i maintained most of my day talking to customers. It was enjoyable because i had a flexible shedule and great people to work with.
good,"Macy's INC., was a great experience. From the first day I felt like I was apart of the team. Would love to work for them again in the future."
good,I Loved working At Macys..They Workers was Friendly & Also The Managers
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,doing loss prevention is fun and i like it except if u dont get certain amount of cases in a month then the LPM changes and starts to take it out on the workers cutting hours and stuff
good,great company and compensation package
good,I have had a great experince here. But travel downtown is to much.
good,macys is good for a seasonal job but when it comes to after the season they dont give to many hours and pay gets cut
good,Maintain and control crowds in the department store.Helping the guess to locate what they are looking for.
good,"A typical day at work starts off slow. The workers there are professional, and helpful. I have learned to mange my time with different projects while focusing on efficiency. My co-workers always make my job easy, and are great to work with. The hardest thing about my job I would have to say is the standing, and that depends on the person. The best part of my job is seeing all of the nice watches, earrings, and other cool jewelry."
good,What I enjoy most at Macy's is seeing the customers happy even if they didn't purchase anything. Being a part of the team in one of the biggest and most historical department store is a great feeling. I have had many coworkers in the past 7 years that I have been there and they have all been great. The hardest part of my job is when a lot of my merchandise all comes down together it becomes difficult to find room in my stock area especially during big holidays.
good,Good place to work for the short term. But really strict unnessary rules. but other than that its ok.
good,"Typical day was spent analyzing business for the eight stores I was responsible for. Would see sales trends and make recommendations based on those trends. Store management was usually receptive to suggested changes. Worked with district team members, including district merchant, district operation manager, district visual manager to help drive sales."
good,"Although it seems that in order to move up, you have to have practically no life outside, you do have growing potential. Regardless of race, religion, etc. (at least at my current location), the management seems to take care of those that work the hardest. I am the fulfillment lead in the fulfillment department, and the hardest part for me is not being to have the last say on every little thing. The work has be delegated to others. I cannot make sure that each item is wrapped to perfection (what if I have 600 orders???). I do worry about how my department is presented, and I feel that no matter how hard I work sometimes, the positive may not always be presented. Also, the department goes by percentage not be effort, so you may have worked extremely hard to find the items for shipping, but you may not make your goal. That becomes very stressful."
good,The typical day at work was helping customers find what they are looking for and making magic. I learned more about customer service and how it makes the customer feel. The management needs more improvements but they were really helpful when we had issues. My co-workers were really helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part was trying to make sales and getting the credit cards. I really enjoyed the people I meet.
good,"A typical day here you would be nothing short than an adventure. We were always finding the latest ways people were stealing clothes, how rude some customers were as well as having extremely nice customers. You can learn more about clothes than you probably ever want to know working here."
good,The place where a non creative person could discover that they are creative in some form. Here you a person could find any and everything they ever thought of trying from cooking to drawing to creative an original talent yet discovered by anyone. I know for me it always had me wanting to try something new and different.
good,I worked at Macy as a sales assciate in the home department. I did alot of sales and stock. I have 5+ years in inventory. I loved working for the company.
good,"There's always work to be done and people to do it. A typical day at Macy's includes exercising each morning to prepare for the day ahead and then giving each employee his/her assigned duty for the day. For me that involves working in Inbound in exceptions and also receiving, prepping and putting away product. My supervisors are very easy to work for and I get along well with my co-workers. Overall I think it's an easy job. The hardest part for me is accepting that I have to work every holiday and won't get to spend Christmas with my family."
good,"in my field, stats was the key, after a while didcated to it, I found a better opportunity but it was awesome to work and learn there."
good,"Very good training. Pleasant supervisors. I was able to really put my best personality attributes out there while selling high quality products. I loved the customer interaction. Sometimes, because of the holiday customer volume, things could become a bit hectic,but most employees were helpful and considerate of each other and put customer service at a very high level also."
good,"The manager that I had was outstanding, the hours are flexible if looking for a part time job and the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming."
good,Great co-workers. They help make the job fun and make the time go by fast.
good,-Typical day would be just attending to customers needs and bringing them whatever shoe that they would want to try on.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me doing shipping and receiving first thing in the morning,then i would be responsible for extraditing orders from the que pad for the remainder of the day. I learned how to receive and organize massive amounts of inventory that were to be placed in the warehouse. My co-workers and management were respectful and professional. I rarely met with management due to the fact that I was constantly working.The hardest part of the job was working determining which items needed to be shipped out and which items needed to be logged in our inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a staff that was all on the same page. Which made the day much more productive!"
good,"Good store to work at, but the compensation and lack of staffing in my department is horrible"
good,"a typical day work at macy's. hepling a customer find something to wear to a special event is very exciting, its like playing dress up or hepling dressing someone. i really enjoyed the feeling because knowing that i help a person find the perfect outfit or gift is very rewarding to me."
good,"A pretty upbeat yet very sales driven environment. The store is really focused and really awesome to work for, though the managers could give employees a pat on the back a little more often."
good,Every morning was a pleasure to show up for work for me with Macy's. I loved to be among the first to see what new in store products were going on the floor. An average work day for me include unloading shipments to stripping and organizing materials the preparing merchandise onto the floor. Also replenshing registers with bags and supplies were also expected. Through this particular job I learned how to secure most clothing with security tags and how most department stores like Macy's run the dock.
good,"I think Macy's was a big improvement over Kohl's. I liked the fact that the customers didn't have to go to the front if they wanted to check out, I didn't have to leave my post if I wanted to look up something for the customer, etc."
good,Get up early. Learned it takes awhile to have an open mind on how to merchandise.Co-workers worked as a team and alot of discussions to come to a conclusion on how it should be done. Hardest part of the job is getting promoted if you worked there for to long. Making a wow factor when customers come in by the work that the team did and knowing it people are buying what the team put together.
good,Working for macy's was a great learning experience and a great deal of fun. Management was friendly and the company makes a fun and supportive work enviroment. The hardest part of my job was customers but I rarely dealt with the public in my postion. This was a fast paced and fun job with lots of great people.
good,"a great environment , organized, & a good place to work overall."
good,"Responsible for the pricing and signage of store merchandise through the use of equipment such as RF, Management Work Station, Laser Printer, Sign Printing Facility (SPF) and various types of paperwork and reports. Hardest part of job, when prices did not show up correctly in the system, and having to preset the sale with those prices one day and come back the next day and its completely different and having to do it all over before the store opens for the morning."
good,"this job was one of my first stores jobs, while it was great the hours were too crazy."
good,Fun job. Felt good to be doing something that you're comfortable with along side co-workers of your age group
good,We were like family and enjoyed spending time together outside of work

good,Helped Bride and Grooms register gifts for their bridal shower and wedding.
good,Usually on a typical day I'd walk around and fix the watches around my area and other things and when a customer needed help I would help them.
good,"It's a good job to have. Pretty busy, have plenty of customers to help and work to do."
good,A good environment that can be really competitive when it comes to selling deals and promotions to customers. An overall good environment with a good management team who is really helpful.
good,All the employees were quite nice and comfortable around each other. They make new employees welcomed. Management wasn't bad either. They were more business than friendly.
good,It was an awesome work experience. It taught me a lot and prepared me to really know how to interact with customers. The managers really stayed on the associates to make sure we could perform to best abilities on the floor. And I think the co-workers were great aw well. They taught me tricks to help sell and open accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I constantly worked to make a connection with the customers and it paid off and I opened accounts. There weren't really any hard parts. I strive to accomplish my goals and I do just that.
good,"Working at Macy's was a great experience for me. I got to always be around things I love, such as clothes, people, and outfitting people with advice. Our supervisors were great. Always disciplined us to learn and grow and was always done for the good of the company. My co-workers and I learned how to approach customers and how to get them to buy something we believed would be suitable for them. The only down-fall about working at Macy's was having to subject to a lot of verbal abuse from customers. Besides that, Macy's was great. Great environment. I recommend the job to anyone."
good,"Macys is a big company and it was a pleasure for me to work for them. i had a position there as a sales rep which is by commission, the only thing that was hard and unpleasant about the job was the fact that there was never a commision collected on my behalf because their poicies make it almost impossible to do so."
good,"Macy's has it's own unique and diverse environment and culture. There are so many people that have worked at Macy's for numerous years, there are generations of families that are employed and happy. The biggest benefit is the discount you receive and higher management noticing your accomplishments."
good,the most enjoyed part of the job was I was able to express my passion for working with the public and utilizing my skills as a customer service representative.
good,"I usually arrive on the job at 9:15am and attend our morning meeting at 9:45am. I set up my cash register and make sure my workplace is clean and ready for my customers. As soon as I see a Macy's customer I immediately stop whatever I'm doing and greet them with a smile and a good morning. I offer my help in everyway possible, and when their ready, I'll process their transaction. This goes on for the majority of my day."
good,Management is great. Friendly empolyees. The early hours and of hours are the hardest part.
good,"If retail management is what your looking for then Macys is a great company to work for. Macys as a company is aggressively taking an initiative to staying profitable. It has a very bright future as a company. I'am a recruit from a very respectable institution, and I am a part of their Executive Development Program. If your looking to advance in the retail industry Macys will give you the opportunity to flaunt your talents."
good,"We start the morning with a pep rally meeting, managers tell us about sales and discounts available for that week, and employee recognition from the day before. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you interact with your customers and they leave extremely satisfied with their purchases and our customer service! Also, employees that did well get a chance for a drawing to win macy's money or other prizes! The hardest part of the job I would say is to open new accounts, since most of our shoppers have macy's cards already."
good,"My co-workers were wonderful, Sometimes i wish the managers were more helpful."
good,"A typical day at Macy's is always interesting. The different people you'll meet and the different attitude you inquire. I ahve learned how to meet and drive new people to meet sales quotes, and how to deal with customers complaints. Management I did a little manage work also: Supervise 5-10, answer phone calls on different customer issues, and when supervised made sure assoicated met the sales quotes. My co-worker were great and always had great and postive attitude to help with the customers.I don't really remember a hardest part of the job nomore than trying to have selled different Macy's card and meet the sell quotes. My most enjoyable part of the job is to know that I can and always put a smile on a employer or cutomer face."
good,"They did not joke around there, since the store was always busy, always helping customers and giving them opinions in the fashion department."
good,Productive and fun workplace. My coworkers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job not being able to balance my time. My supervisor is very supportive.
good,"If it is a career choice then this is a good place to work, but it is not a good idea if you want temporary of you have another job or in school."

good,"You go in to work, and you are greeted by the others in a warm manner. After being assigned the area i would work in, my coworker and I split into teams and clean the sales floors. Management is nice, and understanding willing to help you out. I learned how to minimize time straightening up, and maximize the results of my hard work. The hardest part of the job is catering to the client, and doing your work at the same time without being disrespectful. The most enjoyable is the person to person interaction, and the happy customers."
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with various kinds of customers while maintaining a clean, safe working and shopping environment. By working at Macy's, I have learned about sales and patience. The management is excellent to work with and they are very understanding."

My coworkers were amazing, they were very easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was trying to balance my life with work. Since sometimes I had to work on weekends it was hard to make some events. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers and recieve employee discount."
good,flexible work hrs but no public transportation after certain hrs.
good,"Customer service, wrapping gifts for holiday season this was a part-time job. Manager was very nice, typical day at work up until Christmas very busy. Wonderful tips. My co-workers worked together customer service was excellent in department (Gift-wrap). Hardest part of the job it does get very busy, have to maintain patiences and control. Most enjoyable part of the job, making the sure the customer is very satisfiled with the service we provide."
good,"The role that Im in now has not been filled for sometime. So, it has puts my supervisor in a tough position. Since we are so behind its hard for him to spend time with me for my training. Which is fine since I have many years of management experience. And I have experienced some of the struggles we are going through. Knowing that logistics is the heart beat of most companies. I enjoy the challenges it brings each day."
good,"opperating a cash regester, hanging clothes, orginizing racks, bagging clothes."

good,"I had an awesome experience here with some amazing co-workers. They were super easy to get along with. There wasn't free food, but they did provide free coffee."
good,It was busy during Christmas time but otherwise it's kind of slow the hours I was happy with and it's mostly a seasonal position. The manager or the person who deals with the hours was great and she helped me out
good,It was good working here there were it’s perks and issues just like every job but there was nothing about this job that would make me quit it was very average day to day and a nice place overall

good,I was put in a easy area to work after a while it just mind numbingly boring since i worked nights they require you to work hard and for good reasons anyway i would suggest working there just be wary it gets boring at night
good,Working with a lot of very nice and professional people. But it's retail with a lot of expectations but poor pay and odd hours. Schedule can be a challenge but overall good.
good,"Kind people and love working with them and greeting customers, easy training and easy work. You can switch , change or callout online if any emergency occurs. This job is very nice and I love working here, I would recommend this job to any and everybody"
good,"A typical day at work is normally helping out with putting away new merchandise on the sales floor, or helping find customer online orders. I learned that people are only helpful when it benefits them, especially in a retail environment because they feel like they don't need to do anything. The management at Macys needs to be more concerned about what we need as a store because we all feel that this year has been especially bad because there is no proper management or organization with daily tasks. The workplace culture is very diverse and constantly busy, especially around holiday time. The hardest part of the job is completing the workload within a certain time frame, although our team is small, we are tiny but mighty and get things done in a reasonable amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting work see and talk to my co workers, they work as hard as i do, out of all my other jobs its been hard to find reliable and trustworthy co-workers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,employees gain the opportunity to learn from many others individuals from within multiple areas. The company has a strong teaching program to learn skills efficiently.

good,"wish that I was given more hours"
good,Helping customers with finding the right fragrance. Learned to stand for multiple hours and also assisting people with what they might like if they are unsure about what they want. The hardest part was standing up during slow times. Most enjoyable part was engaging with the customers.
good,Macy’s has a lot right but they have a culture that doesn’t really move you up from within.. In my opinion they are wasting all the work employees put in to be better because you will get a boss from somewhere else all the time... I believe this allows for a lot of starting over in departments instead of continuity...
good,I love working at Macy's. The time is flexible i can go to school and go to my other job. It's easy to transfer from one store to another when u relocate. The benefits are fair and good and there is always room for improvement if you are willing
good,"When I started working at Macy's I applied to work at the Clinique counter. I was super excited to start working with Clinique. The interview process wasn't too difficult-and I was hired a few days later. Since I was applying to Clinique I also had a Facetime interview with one of Clinique's associates. I was also working full time at my other job but they were flexible with giving me hours to work. Their weekend shifts were HORRIBLE, as we were working all day with only two 15 min breaks and one 45 min break. Another thing I disliked about MACY'S was that they would give me a Friday evening shift from 5-close (11pm) and then give me an opening shift the next day at 8am-4pm. I was exhausted. A plus side to this job was that I had access to make up and skin care (gratis, cool manager who gave me free sample products, and discounted prices), I had a new manager who had just moved to MN and was slammed with so much to do that there wasn't much training and I just had to learn as I went. Luckily, it wasn't rocket science. Another plus side was that the women I worked with were super cool once we got to know each other. Another plus was that we were able to earn commission (which really was the main point to working there because our base hourly pay was only $14). So commission was important! Most of the time the women I worked with would take turns with customers and there was only really one person who hogged customers and took most of the commission. As Clinique Beauty Associates we were also given free workshops to attend through Clinique and after the three day workshop we ""graduated"""
good,Working at Macy's was great even though it was just seasonal. I gained a lot of experience working in the different departments. I also learnt a lot about products.
good,Macy's is a place where usually adults work so it can be hard to be a teenager and to work there but everyone is nice. It is difficult to get a handle on everything you need to do.
good,Typical work shift are 10 hours long and some are 12+. You're always on your feet and get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. Consistently walking distance of around 6-15 miles a shift.
good,"It was pleasure to work at Macy's. But it was a company that I could not progress for my future and benefit. The holidays hours are not reasonable. The scheduling was not reasonable, they woul leave one co-worker by them self for 4-hours responsible for cashier, fitting room, helping customers."
good,"Picked up a summer job at Macy's Women's Shoes and learned about shoe brands and types of women's shoes    As for schedules,they were online in a portal and we could trade shifts as needed.  Overall it was a nice place to work and I left due to school and wanting just part time hours, but they were unable to to provide that for me."
good,"Over the span of 3 Years was offered 4 different job positions within the company, with pay increase. Great with customer service and always eager to tackle new challenges within each department."
good,"I only started in October, but seasonal work at Macy's/Bloomingdales is fast-paced without being super stressful. Management is nice and care about the workers there. The availability for overtime is especially nice with the wages they offer. I would definitely recommend."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Macys. I was given opportunities to move up. They really helped me build a professional aspect on jobs and they were really patient with me.
good,"Working at the Springfield Macy's was a dream come true for me. The job was different every day, wonderful people to work with and for. We shared duties and helped each other, enjoyed the company of coworkers and customers. The hardest part of the job was closing the store, seeing it taken apart, bit by bit, and saying goodbye to friends who were more like family."
good,Great company to work in kind people that are always willing to help and understand you. Flexible schedule to accommodate your needs as well overall they make the team feel like friends and family grew working with them
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Their Seasonal employment money is good, but it's only 4 months and rather than base WHO GETS overtime Extra Hours on WHO works well and productive, the ""CLICK"" In CROWD sucks up all the open positions by using company time not doing their job, but on their cell phone signing into InSite Scheduling Board BIDDING for added hours."
good,Great company to work for lots of opportunities benefits and employee discount. Freedom to manage your schedule online is very convenient venue to as well.I had fun working there . I life helping customers and making their day better.
good,"Good People, great team, good training, excellent culture, care about safety of the employee. Good health benefits.Real concern for employee well being."
good,Je hebt altijd met klanten te maken. In de winkel en online bestellingen. Ik heb geleerd om met een divers klanten publiek om te gaan en georganiseerd te zijn( deze dingen deed ik al in mijn prive leven ). Ik heb geleerd mijn collegae te motiveren en de voordelen in te zien. Er is altijd iets positief. De bedrijfscultuur is over het algemeen goed en het maakt het nog beter als je positief bent. Moeilijkheden heb ik niet ondervonden. Ik ging altijd met veel plezier naar het werk.
good,"I was only a seasonal worker, so the work was harder than it normally is. Part of the seasonal GAP shift, worked four tens weekly overnight. From 6pm to 6am, the night was spent organizing and picking items to ship off. We were shuffled between apartments regularly so it was never consistent, which was the fun of the job."
good,"Supervisors are great.  Work during shift is fast paced and consistent. There's no down time.  Days I worked, I didn't need to go to the gym.  I ended up quitting because I wasn't in good enough physical shape to keep up with everybody else.  Great job for early risers, shift starts at 5am."
good,"Great place to work for those looking for a new start! The scheduling is flexible and if you enjoy a fast pace business this is the place for you. Let's not forget, there is a wealth of iconic history associated with this company."
good,You have to be strong minded and a strong leader to survive at Macy's. They paid well but you work for your check. There is a work life balance which is great. A newly hired manager gets three weeks of vacation from the very start. Most companies you have to work at least a year before you accrue PTO.
good,Great place to work. Great Benefits for full time employees. Employees get employee discount on all the products. Best place to work also flexible hours. Great environment to work
good,"Only one Supervisior I didn't get along with at the Macy's I worked at and she wasn't in my department."
good,"handling the cashier opening /closing "
good,I was only seasonal almost became part time but the company lacked the payroll for it. I was let go almost a half of year of being with the company I felt that was wrong.
good,"Normally your manager or supervisor would give you a list of products you'd need to pick, pack, and ship. I learned how to work as a team since you're not working with customers all day. Management was efficient, always making sure you felt comfortable and prepared to do your assignment. The hardest part of the job was picking because macy's is a big store and what sometimes isn't on the floor are in the storage rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork and getting stuff done on time."
good,"I supervised a team of customer service / collections associates. I learned how to coach and develop customer service skills. Management were fantastic. First class organization. The culture was fun. We had regularly scheduled rally's to pump up morale. The hardest part was being yelled at by irate customers. The most enjoyable was watching others develop, grow and succeed."
good,"The work in the warehouse is constantly bustling and the managers and staff work as a team to prioritize the needs on a daily schedule. There is flexibility if someone needs to swap a shift with another employee."
good,"Productive,Progressive and supportive working environment."
good,"My experience with Macy's was as a Seasonal Sales Associate. I really enjoyed getting to know the staff and making personal connections with the guest. Actually, I am still close friends with one of the Sales Associates I worked closely with. However, the most memorable aspect about this job was the guest connections. I remember one day during the Christmas shopping season (best time of year at Macy's), an older gentleman approached me with stress on his face as he did not know what to by his wife for Christmas. We put our heads together to find the perfect gift with only a few days until Christmas and even managed to get it wrapped for him. I was so elated that day because I was able to bring a smile to his face and helped make that shopping experience a great one for him. It was always the small things that made working for Macy's worth it."
good,I enjoyed the time I spent with them. Management was very friendly with a focus on teamwork. Major distribution center with repair center for the entire Macy's corporation.
good,Working at Macy's has sharpened my skills as a visual merchandiser. Great environment to work as a visual merchandiser. Fast-paced setting. The workload can be strenuous.
good,"I mean it has its bad days like all jobs.but this is by far one of the easiest jobs I’ve ever worked"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I loved working for Macy's. Unfortunately, with the competition with online shopping, it has severely limited the field management opportunities. Overall, I learned so much when working for Macy's. Great culture and support from others."
good,For a first job I can't think of a better place...A typical day at Macy usually involved going up to customer and helping them to the best of your abilities. I've learning everything I know about customer from my time working there. The work place environment is very competitive which can make everyone work harder it also breed hostility for the employees. However i met a lot of nice people and had a lot of fond memories.
good,I learned a great deal working for Macy's. I learned how to assist customers from the back of the house. And how to set up for the best possible outcome.
good,I would work from 3-11 pm I started before Thanksgiving I started off by folding clothes and being a cashier.  I eventually would help give breaks in different departments
good,"relaxed easy going environment "
good,"Everyone works well together. If I had a question I was never given the impression that I was bothering them.I liked the job. The atmosphere there was relaxed but professional."
good,"i love the experience, the culture is amazing, you have a lot of fun doing what you love if you like retail..........................................."
good,"Good place to work a sales job, not recommended to advance in a career. Good for a part time or you need the extra cash, good for uni students and good with the flexibility."
good,Every year I was a temp for extra money around Christmas time and every year they asked me to stay.  I thought about it long and hard every time before I had to turn it down.  I just lived too far away to work that hard for the rest of my life.
good,It was manageable with my school schedule. I loved the employees that worked there. Management wasn't the best and didn't always treat employees that well. But overall it was a good experience.
good,"It was fun working in Macy's. Good management."
good,"Nice work environment and good management, but average pay and not much chance to move upward in job status. But very safety focused and flexible with your personal life"
good,My location was located within an outdoor mall which meant heavy foot traffic almost daily. This was a perfect first job as it allowed the space to learn and grow. The management was helpful but could have been more present with the employees. Overall a great place to grow skill wise.
good,"Very nice and fast paced job; full employment, seasonal job ."
good,"Macy's has a variety of positions and plenty tasks to go with those positions. I got the chance to experience marketing skills, direct customer service, working with a team, efficiently. I was an associate. The pay would be great for someone who doesn't have a family. Or someone who is on salary. I would recommend Macy's as a starter job."
good,"When working for Macys, you begin to realize how they had built their company from the ground up and this meant by them becoming very creative in their methods to attract customers. However, this can be very stressful on the employees as it is mandatory to open credit cards for customers and provide excellent service. You will often find yourself in conflict with customer's demands, but the end result will more than likely be ""The customer is always right!"""
good,Macy's is all about building relationships and getting to know their clientele. Great atmosphere especially around the holidays. Room for growth throughout the store and within the company.
good,"Typical day of work is easy. We receive incoming truck brake it down, separate merchandise and label merchandise. Organize carts and clean stockroom. The following day we take the merchandise out to its proper home ,"
good,They need to get better seasonal managers I do not have much to say about them what's so ever they could do better I've never had this problem working
good,"A get place to work for entry level. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked for Macys four days and wound up getting into a car accident that had me go on medical leave. they held my job for me for which I went back a couple of months later but then wound up leaving shortly after. for my expereince, they do not train you on the position you are going to be working in. I felt like its a fend for yourself. I had no idea what I was doing on most days."
good,"A typical day working a Macy was fast-paced,  and focused on customer service. Workplace culture was smoth, and pleasant. Part of my job was to sale and open credit card accounts."
good,"working here was a good temporary job for the time that i was in college, their hours were very flexible and it is possible to pick up extra shifts all over the store."
good,"I feel very blessed to work at this store with the colleagues I have.  We have a phenomenal team & partnership among each other & our counters.  The management team is very supportive as well. Sometimes it can be demanding, but for the most part it's very rewarding. Interacting with the customers is probably the best part of the entire day there!! I learn something every single day that I spend there."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,you got to work as many hours as you wanted and pay was good. you got plenty of breaks and are treated fair. you can always go to your boss if need be.
good,It allowed me to meet different people and help them with the selection of merchandise. It helped me with my patience with rude customers. It was fun and a wonderful experience
good,"The staff and management was nice, however beginning work after training could be rather confusing, especially if you are a seasonal hire.  There were not a lot of available hours and when there were hours, it was not always guaranteed to be in a department you were familiar with, sometimes leaving you feeling unsure of what to do."
good,The fulfillment center at Macy's is a busy place to work. There are constant online orders to be packed and shipped. Especially during the holiday season
good,"Working at Macy's was both humbling and educational experience made many new connections also new friends that will stay with me a lifetime. "
good,"I believe this position is perfect for those who are starting a new job or for those who are currently enrolled for school. The management provides flexible hours and employees are around the same age. Although the weekends were the most hardest part of the job ( due to a large amount of customers during the hours of operating), working at Macy's has become an experience. Training was fairly easy and it was uncomplicated."
good,Macys culture is very welcoming and teaches you a lot about customer service along with a great management team that want to see their employees progress
good,"Macy's was a great place to work. Their pay was okay but you missed out on bonuses unless your whole team worked as hard as you did to meet target. So individually you missed out."
good,"Great benefits and fun workplace, there is favortism, gossip and rude customers like any other retail position, pay is decent. opportunities to grow or transfer within company"
good,"The cosmetics department was very fast paced and the department manager was not. If a customer had questions I wasn't qualified to answer, the manager would take her time making it over to the counter which would hold up my line, take my products to other counters (which is frowned upon since your sales made you commission) and then somehow blame it on us for not making sales goals. Even if sales goals were made, all she cared about was signing people up for a macy's credit card and would threaten to take shifts away if we didn't get a certain amount of people to sign up daily. It was unnecessary pressure that made me stress about losing my job, even though I met all the rest of my requirements. The other managers would mostly step in for her, and they would try their hardest to do what they could with their knowledge of the department. HR was very nice and always responded with a quickness. Also the free coffee in the office was nice too"
good,"great place to work, very fast paced. loved working in impulse beauty, got to learn and train with some amazing people. you can pick up extra shifts very easily. hardest thing about this job it having an outside life. sales goals are easy to maintain"
good,"I Love the work life balance at Macys. Macy's provides flexible work schedules, work from home options and Summer half-day Fridays from Memorial day to Labor day."
good,I Was Only Seasonal Wen I Work There It Was Okay I Work With Some Good People They Where Nice N Welcome I Learned A Lot With Them I Had Fun At Work...
good,"I enjoyed helping different people from different background and culture with their clothing selections. I learned the importance of greeting, selling, listening and understanding your customers.I enjoy shopping and getting good bargains. The hardest part about the job is not spending you whole paycheck."
good,Overall macys is a great company tc work for with good customer service and friendly employees. They offer employees a reloadable credit card and emloyeee discounts which is a nice perk
good,"Great as t place to start a new job, and allows you  to learn new skills that can be applied in every life. Flexible scheduling with some opportunities for advancement"
good,"The flexibility to work when you want or need to is AWESOME as an on-call. You learn ALL of the make-up lines so, you develope a feel for which product and cosmetic line you want to represent-This applies to fragrances as well. The pay is not that good but there are incentives to kinda make up for it. Such as: The commission (very low) and management incentive competitions and prizes. Thankfully, it's a Weekly paying job and you can earn overtime too-when its available. Having a Store Manager that is engaging, super friendly, personable, motivating and ALWAYS positive, made the job easy to love and not focus on the low wage and how to better interact with unpleasant customers. John O. was by far the very Best Store Manager at Macy's."
good,I had such a great experience with Macy's. I was employed as a seasonal worker while I was working elsewhere part-time. My supervisors were extremely helpful and understanding.
good,"I didn’t really have a problem with the last Macy’s I worked at , everyone was nice to me and I’m good with selling products and I would love to work with Macy’s again"
good,The work environment in Macy's was very good fit my personality very well. It was fast paced but the work was not too hard for me to keep up. I loved that i could work alone because management had so much faith in the workers that we were doing our jobs right.
good,"I was only there after one day of trainning and ran a department by myself. A lot of managers did pay much mind to me, coworkers are kind of snippy and others are really sweet."
good,"Great experience, great people, lopsided management but overall a great opportunity and experience interms of retail and sales. its a small step to bigger things."
good,Everyone I worked with was willing to help guide me in understanding how to do my job properly. The amount of people willing to teach and help each other was surprisingly pleasant.
good,"I was there only a couple months , okay paying job at the time . Didn’t really get allot of hours. Other then that it was ok. Learning experience , although it was limited it was my first job and I appreciated the working opportunity."
good,"I was super nervous to start my first job here. Everyone however was very welcoming and treated me with respect! It was hard to lean how to do everything. I still messed things up and had to ask for help sometimes though, but everyone makes mistakes. We would get fairly busy there was usually 2 cashiers per department, 3-4 for the bigger departments. i worked in the Men's Department. I would ring people out, organize shelves fold clothes after they have been sorted through. It wasnt my favorite thing to do but it was okay for my first job! The hardest part of working here was learning everything, we had to pay attenton to every single detail. Everything had to be perfect. I was okay with doing it i think because I know how i like having my own home perfectly clean and organized. Everything has a place and it should be there!"
good,"a typical day at work, folding clothes, doing a few morning ice breakers, greeting customers and clocking out. In the time of me working, I learned a few things vital to my everyday life of living, managing my wardrobe, organizing my areas at home....etc. it was a diverse work place, which I was most comfortable at. No one presumed themselves better than other, we all got along really well. the hardest part of the job, to me, would be the fixing of the gadgets, I am not all the way professional, so I am still working on that. the most enjoyable part of the job, is greeting and helping the customers. It makes my day; even I'm having a bad one to see a customer walk in with a smile, makes me wanna smile."
good,Honestly you will be happy with employment for Macy's. They do not hide what your duties are and they make you feel comfortable immediately. Could not really ask for a better place.
good,Assisting and Hiring new colleagues. Explaining and getting them through all information needed before first day at work. Also preparing them with all necessary equipment and knowledge for their job.
good,I worked at Macy's for 9 years and I have good and bad times there. I mostly enjoyed my co-workers and customers. The management team was distant and the pay wasn't enough but overall it's a good part time job.
good,Sad it’s only seasonal. But good place to work. They train you well before they set you free. They cross train so you can try new things if you want. They only give you two 30 minute breaks one is paid the other is not.
good,"I received great mentoring opportunities, teamwork and great collaboration while working for Macy's and had very supportive, seasoned management team!"
good,To many things to remember. Job standards had to be met on a monthly basis. Very hard to meet at times. Customers were not always very nice. Company did let you know when customers gave you a accommodation.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,this job was perfect for someone who was going to school part-time and needed a job to just help them get by while in college. I enjoyed the people i worked with just did not like the pay or being a part of union who took more than i made in a week.
good,"Very good place to work if you do the things you are supposed to while working. They are laid back and willing to work with you, but depending on where you’re from driving distance may be a issue."
good,Macy is fun place to work you can sing have fun while working. you get discounts and lots of fashion shows and candies . I love to go there on weekends for extra hours and to shop. The management is very understanding and they get along with your schedule pretty much fairly.
good,Great Place To Work If You Like To Work at a Very Fast Pace. It’s Fun Meeting and Interacting With New People Everyday. Very Good Customer Service And It’s A Very Busy Environment
good,I loved my job here and the people I worked with. It was fun and there was always opportunity for advancement. Customer service her was more focused on the customer and you actually got to interact one on one when helping guests. Sometimes you even made friends and customer would come back and shop from you because they loved the service you gave them
good,"worked as a fragrance model for different companies for about 17 years and at other department stores throughout New York City like Sacs fifth Ave, and Blooming Dales"
good,It would better place to work if they had better communitcation between the managers that is the only down fall they have besides not being loyal to the employees that's been there for years they find ways to break them down to force them to quite.
good,Nothing hard about the job. Great co workers. And good management. Flexible working schedule. It is a Clean workplace. I learned a lot about the customer there.
good,"This company is always adapting and trying new changes to make the customer happy. You can great retail experience here but be prepared for a very fast paced environment and be ready to adapt to change. Every year you will be expected to do more with less and customers can be though like any service job. Great peers, everyone works very hard."
good,"I can't say much about working at Macy's, since I only worked a handful of hours per week. What I can say, though, is that I really enjoyed the coworkers I spent my shifts with."
good,Productive workplace and professional staff. Good with working out schedules that suit employees life outside of work. Very well put together presentation.
good,Macys is a fast pace working environment. Great place to work starting young and advancing into a career. Can be quite stressful though. Can have a few conflicts but with proper management anything can be resolved
good,"A sales environment that focuses on customer satisfaction, offering employees good benefits after probationary period. The brick and mortar stores rely on the employees' ability to contact with customer desires"
good,"Macy's was a nice place to work. It wasn't overtly difficult for the tasks being performed. Depending on the day, it can be a quick-paced environment or it can be relaxed. In either circumstance, you are of course expected to be professional and provide not only your best customer service, but of course hit your credit card sales quota. Perfect job for someone who has a busy out of work life or a young person needing a good job to keep them steady. Pays very well compared to most reality companies."
good,Thumbs up.good place to work. Good people. Nice discounts. Good sales teams.  Great managers and staff. Safety. Works with you and your work/ home life.
good,"It was good at first, I had a partner to recover but was soon split off and had to do everything myself. We without a manager for months and then were given a couple clueless ones. Then I was told to train people with a higher starting pay/ overall pay with little to no job experience on how to do the same position. Things were really fun and perfect the first half of the job though. Being solo just became unmanageable."
good,I was a High School Student and the job was really flexible when it came to my hours. Loved all the people I worked with supported me when life hit me and overall the Macy's Employment Life is really family oriented in the mission but also on the floor.
good,"Great place to work at!  I had a part time job there but doing the deposits for them was my favorite thing to do."
good,"Face paced, but, very pleasurable job.  Love helping customers and leading teams through the busy season.  Would have love to stay if the store didn't close."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I loved everything about working for Macy's. I only left the job because we relocated to an area where the nearest Macy's was over two hours away. It is very easy to be promoted with Macy's if you prove yourself to be a great leader with staff and in sales.
good,"A typical day at work is going around and making sure the floor is clean, check fitting rooms, assist customers, etc. Working the register is not hard. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers. The best part of the job is meeting new people."
good,I enjoyed my job with the company.  It started as Heichts. I was with them for 13 years in full-time status. When Macy's bought them out they cut our hours and benefits.  Which forced most of us to find other jobs
good,"A typical day at work, it was slow paced or fast paced. It depends on the time of the day. I learned how to work the cashier and what tabs to do. Management is fine. The workplace culture is full of nice and productive people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers, when they show attitude and sass. You really want to yell at the customers, but what they, ""The customers is always right"". The most enjoyable part of the job is organizing clothing."
good,I love the people i work with. It is a fun place to work. The only thing that i did not like is the point system. If you're out of point then you're out of job
good,I worked at Macy's during my college years as one of my first official jobs. I appreciated the diversity and inclusive environment and management was good however the pay was definitely underwhelming especially for the amount of work one did as a sales associate.
good,"It was difficult at first because it was my second job. To people who are used to working customer service I think this job would be a breeze. I worked as recovery associate. The only thing I had to do was fold clothes, stock the sales floor, and pick up items from the storage for customers. I would advise anyone who is looking into going for a recovery position known how to fold clothes properly. It seems easy but there is a trick to it. There are a lot of clothes. The kid's department was the most chaotic. The only problem I had was that I was never taught how to work the register because I never got my tour around the store or cashier lesson before my start date."
good,Fast paced work.  I was excited to go to work everyday.  Lots of people to meet and greet I never got bored.  Breaks time is sufficient. Got to meet celebrities during holiday season always something new to do or learn.   The hardest part of the job is catching thieves. Especially when it could be your co-worker.
good,"A typical day of working at Macy's consisted of greeting every customer, tending to cashier duties, and keeping the work environment clean and safe. It was always a joy to come into work and see friendly coworkers in the work environment. Assisting customers was always an adventure because a variety of people come in with different needs and each success with a customer was always rewarding. On holidays there are events in the break room to participate in festive activities. Working at Macy's is definitely an experience I will carry with me and I'll never forget how the entire team felt like a second family."
good,Received incoming customer calls and made outgoing calls to customers regarding their Macys bills.Hardest part of job was being pleasant to belligerent customers who were cussing you out and calling you names. Best part of job was helping customers who wanted to pay accounts. Work environment was mostly pleasant but could also be stressful at times.
good,"As an associate you help customers with whatever they’re looking for, you give them your complete attention. If they need to be sized for something, you do that. And when they’re ready to purchase you check them out."
good,Great atmosphere to work with levels of opportunities to excel within your career. Met many colleagues that are long time friends. Loved my experienceat Macy's.
good,It was a company that provided job security. I was given many opportunities for advancement. It was a place that taught me many new skills. It provided the finances I needed to get through college.
good,"I enjoy working at macys, it really gave me the knowledge needed for my future job and the environment was very fun. I would refer anyone there because it was an amazing experience overall."
good,A good place to work if you do not mind extended hours. Most everyone there is very kind. Positive attitudes pervade about withut a doubt. Their management is very efficient and kind as well.
good,I did not work FOR Macy's.. Macy's was a client that I serviced for many years. Great company and great people to work with. Very organized. Very fair company.
good,Macy's is a great work environment that has a good work/ life balance. My main issue diminished opportunities for advancement. There seems to be less development of staff and more recruitment from outside of the company.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was a seasonal worker for martinsburg wv. I enjoyed ny time there, it was fast paced, breaks were spaced well and they had multiple postions and work times. They also were proactive about information there employees may need."
good,"they're a good company to work for. there's just a few bad apples in the company so you can't judge an entire corporation based on a few bad apples. i'd go back with them actually. their benefits are good, they treat their employees fairly, and they know their employees worth and know hard work."
good,I loved working at macy's because of the customers and some of my co workers and managers it is a very fun and at times stressful place to work at but I mostly enjoyed my time working at macy's
good,I really enjoyed working at macy's the people that work there make the job more interesting and is almost family like.  the hours are great but long during the holidays.
good,It was a very fun place to work. Learning about the makeup industry is solely built off of their brand. They were really motivating and inspirational.
good,the managers would always come and check on her sales associates and tells us to meet our goals. Sometimes there was so much pressure due to the holidays and many customers would come in to shop and we had to assist them in finding them all those things they came in to purchase or looking it up online for better deals. if we have items unavailable in the store make sure to always give them the choice to purchase it in the store and get it delivered as soon as possible to the store or their home.
good,"I learned to use a PDA scanner, warehouse/inventory work, etc.  I obtained orders from salespeople and staged them for the sales force to pick up, scanned bins, scanned returned inventory back into stock, filled clearance, and assisted with markdowns"
good,Great atmosphere at holidays and different events.  Community and kid involvement activities a plus.  Management does not allow space for educational advancement due to department needs. To go to school would be a mistake because the skills you learn might not be used in your current role.
good,"I really did love to work at Macys , I love people that I work with and the managers , the hours are flexible and I rey like the schedule. It was one of my favorite jobs."
good,"Macy's is a fun place to work, the pay is decent, and so are the hours. When you work sales you can pick up shifts online throughout the whole store for hours, that was awesome. I think benefits are full time employees only :("
good,"Although I worked in a seasonal position it was nice to work there, I learned a lot in a short time. They should respect lunch time of minutes. They do care for customers"
good,Working as a order picker production was the main goal making an attention to detail a must. Being able to work in different areas of the operation was a great way to advancement.
good,"I was seasonal for this job. My hours were neat, the people were nice. Employees were friendly as well. Work environment around that time was very fast paced."
good,"This was my first job in high school and I liked it, it was a very fast place work place so you have to make sure to wear some comfortable shoes."
good,"Overall Macy's is a great company, I just can't live off of my salary. I would rather work one full-time job instead of 2 jobs."
good,During peak season it can be hard and strenuous work but there is a great team to back you up. With the help if a good team the day can go by very fast.
good,"Not enough employees, manager were rude to me. I didn’t get a saying in how I should be treated. I worked like everyday. I like the fact that the pay was weekly."
good,The enviroment is a great place to work. THe customers make each day challenging and fun. The flexible work schedule is great for a work  life balance.
good,"Macy's Logistics is a wonderful company to work under. The associates are hard-working, team oriented individuals that come together as a whole, highly productive establishment. Management is quick to accommodate, quick to react, and benefits are astounding. It is a very large building to work in, however, and it can be a bit overwhelming to new faces. There isn't an associate in the building that won't take the time to help new faces, however! I would recommend pursuing a career at Macy's Logistics!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The Management was very nice to work for Helped new asscoiate  with the new adjustments , great with guiding you to Greet the customers any where in your area."
good,"In my time at Macy's, I had a generally positive experience. The pay was pretty good for retail, and they offer a sales management development program. Management was competent. Disorderly displays were an issue due to an insufficient recovery efforts, but no major complaints otherwise."
good,"Macy's was a great experience. Co-workers were always nice, my manager was always comforting to talk to when I needed reassurance. Would recommend this employer to anyone."
good,It’s a great place to work and has friendly co workers and has a strong and energetic management team/system. I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys weekly pay and is energitic.
good,"Everyday is fast paced, especially if you work in a store.  The schedule can be erratic including nights and weekends.  Management coaches employees at every level to improve performance.  There are opportunities for self development and to grow within the company."
good,"having fun working with a big family, helping customers as personal shopper sometimes, offer them deals (credit and coupons) excited to see them happy"
good,"its a work environment so friends are not you main focus, team effort is key, and patients is a must. managers are willing to work with you and help build you up as long as you show effort and interest."
good,"Macy's was the best retail job I ever had, it was a little difficult because of the language barrier, but I thoroughly enjoyed working here. I was able to learn the different tasks very quickly and was given a lot of responsibility. It was overwhelming at first but a great motivator to accomplish the tasks I was given to do."
good,The management is not the best and you cant really move up in the company. Other then that it is a great place and you meet great people. Hardest part would be the hours for some people.
good,"My experience working at Macy’s was pleasant but transporting to and from work was always an issue because of distance however, all staff were helpful and friendly and I was able to learn quickly and be trained quickly and assist customers with their needs."
good,"Overall, macys is a very lively place to work. The scheduling is very flexible and allows employees to plan ahead. There are some minor things that need improvement."
good,"Fun easy work. Family orientated. A lot of hours. Great pay. Pay is weekly, management is pretty cool. People you work with are pretty cool. Sales are great"
good,Macy's is an excellent place to work at for anyone interested in the department store retail market. You also get to work on strengthening and developing better communication skills with upper management and customers.
good,"The manager's at my location cared about you as a person. The work environment was at times stressful, though it was manageable. The co-workers all treated each other as a family and were consistently nice/welcoming to new employe's."
good,The position was really great to interact with new individuals and clients.  Learning the products and the everyday flow of the environment enabled me to appreciate the solid foundation of retail and customer service.
good,"The company has moved in the direction of really valuing its people, driving engagement and loyalty. The focus on driving positive culture changes is prevalent and genuine."
good,"Consistently creates a welcoming environment for the client, focusing on the fun factor, the girlfriend experience with equal focus in driving top line sales."
good,"daily sales meeting to talk about goals for the store and individuals and departments, write department schedules for breaks and lunches,team building."
good,"In my opinion every job has pros and cons. Macy’s isn’t a fairy workplace to have rising opportunity of growing personally for some people who are interested in improving different job profiles or careers. As a full-time associate during 7-8 years working in Miami, I can let you know that there are at least 3 important trainings in a year for all the personal working in the store. I’ve learned a lot interacting with customers whoare the focus point in the store. Environment  is great, coworkers are awesome and managers are our best companions, guides and friends. The weekend checks are not so bad down here where I live and work, there might be more positive effect if they rise annually our salaries, but comparing the hours we work and flexibility vs other jobs there are remarkable differences, we have 45 mins of lunch break and 15 mins of break without paying, I do enjoy it as a relaxing time. In our store team managers are celebrating and encouraging employees all the time so that mostly we’re surpassing our goals, not only on sales, magic and performing good customer service. We’re Bestland ever!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job meeting some great and loyal customers.  Busy environment made the day go quickly.  Was able to move up in the company and spent 6 years in management.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Very fast past area that required a lot of patience. Also making sure I gave out good customer service. Productive  environment  To work in. Always made sure any customer I encountered could have a good experience.
good,"Fine Jewelry sales responsibilities from generating leads to closing sales; "
good,"The managers will always work with your schedule, especially if you have school or a home life. Many open positions and each job is different. Sometimes it is understaffed."
good,It was my first retail experience at department store and I quickly became professional and got reward and I could exceed  my annual established sales goal  and recognized for the best sales associate for the year and became the star of Macy's due outstanding performance.
good,"There are lots of managers and many of them have different ways of managing their department, so you may get one with attitude, one that's very nice, one that's emotionless, and one that's right in the middle. It's very easy to work with others if you have great people skills and that's what Macy's require. I've witnessed co-workers who aren't good communicators complain about a customer who needs answers about a brand or article of clothing when it is the employee's job to tell the customer about the product or find an employee in the store who know's about it if you don't. A typical day is simply recovering your department, helping customers with choices, looking products up for ordering or to see if the product is in another store and/or available in general, having amazing customer service to reach the sales goal of the day and signing customers up for Macy's Credit."
good,Ask any manager for questions or tasks each day. Always take care of your areas and clean them. Merchandise or customers that come in should be processed and be helped with.
good,"Selling shoes can be a fairly physical job, so some days are rough."
good,I enjoyed working with my team. They were friendly and we all co-existed without any hard feelings or anything. we all worked efficiently and for that we all got the job done farther than expected.
good,"fun, fast paced place to work.  Good opportunity to make livable income.  Benefits good.  Would still work there had store not closed.  Good work environment."
good,"Excellent company and people--other than the low wage. It is impossible to survive based upon the hourly rate offered at Macy's. Other than that, the people and company are excellent!"
good,"Retail sales you open/close registers, handle cash, checks and credit cards.  Open new accounts."
good,"It was a great company to work for but the pay was not. I really enjoyed working with people. I love Customer service and Educating my Customers on certain fabric , on the fit and the care for their garments. I was a INC. which stands International Concept. Which is one of Macy's top private Lables."
good,Macys was the first job I got as an adult.I worked there seasonlly for 3years.I was at the Edina Minnesota southdale location.It was fast paced and always something to do.
good,"•	Created product presentations and communication plans for new product assortments"
good,"For anyone 18-30, this job is the perfect one. Everyone has a pep in their step, with many opportunities to strive to do better. I work in cosmetics and i love my job, despite the normal stresses"
good,"Every morning I conducted a meeting with my employees on setting up sales, review and answer emails, create signs and posters for special events. I learned Photoshop and Illustrator. Originally I was very happy with management. We had very good co workers. Even though I welcome changes, if those changes include to feel like you are being demoted rather than promoted, then it becomes hard to stay happy at your workplace. Not being included anymore in the executive meetings and not being clear about my standing at the time in the organization was discouraging. With changes of region came a change in work culture and not in a positive way. I loved my co-workers, the customers and the creativity part of the job. But I didn't feel it was challenging anymore and I was going backward rather than forward."
good,Loved the job hated to leave but I had moved family out of the area and they didn’t have a position where I moved to. I would recommend macys to friends.
good,"Great group of people to work with over the years. Daily and weekly routine which included travel and car time was difficult."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working full-time at Macy's, my average day consisted of a 6-8 hour work day. As a sales associate I worked on draw commission which can either work for you or against you, depending on the amount of sales you make in a day."
good,working in Macy's was a very interesting job. I enjoyed it very much it was a fast paste environment and very friendly. I enjoyed being a team player and help customers if they needed.
good,like any other retail job their will be friendly and not so friendly costumes but working at macys taught me how to help these different type of customers  and how to handle a crazy situation as well
good,"Management and co-workers fun and friendly,  Lot of competition among employees.  "
good,"I recommend Macys to anyone; and although it may take you some time to advance, it is either a dead-end job, or a prosperous job. It depends on your role and what you want out of life for Macys. If you consider yourself abnormal or not average, Macys is either for you or not for you. "
good,We answering the phone seeing what the problem with with there order and trying our best to fix the problem the best we can and sometimes help people find items or placing orders.
good,"I loved being part of the “Macy Magic” this holiday season. I learned a lot, really enjoyed the interaction w/ customers. I loved how the supervisors (even manager) would not ask you to do anything they weren’t will to themselves. This was my 1st retail job. What a wonderful experience. I am sad they didn’t keep me after the season was over. But there’s always next year. The hardest part of the job was learning the retail language. "
good,I would recommend Macy’s to my friends and family if they wish to work a part-time position in a customer-oriented and incentivized business model. They totally Rock!
good,Third party collections as well as customer service representative dealing get with customers request credit card increases while adding and updating current accurate information
good,"it was a really fun place to work, I was able to grow with the company but due to restructuring i am no longer employed with them. but while i was there it was a great and energetic place to work"
good,"Wonderful place to work at. Great opportunity to assist a lot of tourist and customers. Very busy place of employment. However, it makes the time go by quickly."
good,"Highly recommended for someone who appreciates working for a large enterprise.  Unfortunately,  there is much downsizing going on at this time putting many great people out of work."
good,This job was definant;ly  hard work because I was on my feet the entire shift but the work was plentiful so there was never a 'slow' day. I also enjoyed the many different people I came in contact with each shift.
good,"Worked at Macy's 26 years in the payroll department and benefits department. I enjoy my job but feel our wages for the work we do in payroll is not compatible with other companies . With processing checks off cycle checks for all Macys employees, year end processes."
good,this job is good for those who just graduated High school and need a place of employment until they figure out what they want to do in life. Also a good part time job if you are looking to go to school and still work.
good,I enjoyed working at Macys. I was recently laid off due to staff reduction. Working with the customers and satisfying their needs is what I miss most at macys.
good,"I love working there, We serve a lot of diverse customers from Canada, and Buffalo, NY. We are actively on our feet as employees and helping customers in all departments"
good,I liked my managers and my associates. It was very fast paced because it was holiday season but it was easy to get used to the system and the way things worked. I definitely needed more training though.
good,"excellent collaborative approach to work."
good,"Not stressful at all, good place to come get work done and go home to have a life. People were alright to work with, it was mainly a place to put your head down and get done the tasks at hand."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was a good job the only problem was the lack of communication between the managers other then that i would highly recommend this job to anyone looking for simple hard labor
good,"Typical day: Doing functional schedules, Managing team with opening credit, making sales goals, adding clients, making magic(conducting great customer service) product knowledge. Doing operations such as rtvs, process, damages etc. Daily jewelry counny with expensive jewelry. Following policies and procedures. Conference calls"
good,"Great job if you are looking to make some good money during holidays. Great training, great managers and coworkers helpful and friendly. The jobs are all super easy. Its a temp job, so dont call out or complain when youre only working for 6-8 weeks and you will be fine. You can work as much overtime as you want during peak season, so the opportunity to earn some serious cash is there if you want it. You can do things as simple as loading pallets and boxes, restocking shelves or get into picking and packing orders, prepping goods or learning forklifts. Dont expect to be hired on full time if you want to stay. All have to start out part time to get your foot in the door. If you are an excellent employee during peak season, expect to get a part time job offer when it's over."
good,"very promotional environment"
good,I liked my position as fulfillment at Macys because I worked on my own and it allowed me to work at my own pace and not have to be overseen by a manager all the time.
good,Its a work place we can have fun at some point when it comes down to it we are all family we work just has hard as another place if not more when it comes to trying to get an order out to a customer. The hardest part of the job is going to work in the morning and lifting the heavy boxes when your not awake the job is fairly easy once you get the hang of it and getting into it.
good,the Job was ok. A typical day at macy's is usually busy in the afternoons/evening on weekends mostly. The hardest part of the job was working the computer. I never had that experience before but it was good.
good,"If you're opening ,a typical day is slight recovering from the previous day i.e. cleaning ,folding. Possibly setting or taking down previous days sale signage."
good,Need more older seasoned people and people who are dedicated in their work. Communication needs to be improved between management and employees...;.;.
good,"Love Macy’s and working there. Pay was okay, basic retail pay. But no opportunity to grow or advance with company. Enjoyed the merchandise and discount"
good,"I work for Macy's for 9 years and enjoyed. It's sad that I've been laid off. Employees are treated fairly overall. Liked the benefit provided to employee like employee discount, Macy's money. etc."
good,Would work there again if i had a chance. Better benefits if you're a full time employee. Overall I would recommend anyone looking for a temporary job to apply here.
good,"Pretty quick paced, co workers were nice. "
good,It is overall in the cosmetic department a positive and happy environment to work with those in the department. Great communication with management and other departments as to what might be going on in the store or online to communicate this information to the customers.
good,"Worked with amazing people to fulfill task such as; merchandising, fulfillment, and recovery of the floor. Fast paced environment taught me to work well with others and multitask with bigger task as well."
good,I felt that this was a great company.  I never had any trouble with my schedule and the managers were willing to help in any way they could.  I felt the managers generally cared about their employees.
good,Easy going and family oriented environment with respectful and with a very understanding management team going to work is so motivating. The team is willing to do whatever to make the show go on.
good,Macy's is a nice place to work as a seasonal or 2nd job.  Pay is not enough to be the main source of income.  The atmosphere and employees are very nice they do whatever it takes to help you succeed.
good,"Clock in a work and attend to customers. Keeping the work place nice and clean. Looking at new product to sell, along with discounts, and suggestions on how to influence customers and at the end of the day, collect money for the bank. Hardest part of the job would be holidays and trying to help the customer understand expired coupons and new deals with their membership cards."
good,"fun to consult with clients on make up."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"the management at my store was wonderful, for the most part. there were times where there was a lack of communication between associates and management, but other associates are able to fill you in on things you may have missed. "
good,"My experience with Macy's was a good one. I only worked there for the holiday hours. However, those two months did make me consider asking to extend my position. The store was run into parts so it wasn't one overwhelmed manager. Instead, it was multiples heads of departments broken down and each having a little team."
good,"In such a huge and fast paced department store I felt like I was left behind, the management never learned my name. When I asked to switch shifts it was always very difficult. I had a lot of fun and its easy to learn everything but I probably wouldnt work there again"
good,"very relaxed and calm"
good,"some of  the workers are rude, nice managers easy to learn register  good pay.good dicounts are great working at macys was fun and loved going to work"
good,The hours were great and the training was amazing. The managers really worked with you and the system made it easy to do everything. The customers were not so hard to deal with and it was all around great.
good,"Macy;s also requires an upgrade on employees working conditions."
good,"Macy's has been good too me all the years that I've been there, I have learned many skills. And I've created great relationships with and employees as well as clients."
good,"SALES!!! best thing about Macy's to me? The interactions between customer and associate. I love establishing interpersonal relationships, and being able to assist others."
good,"This has got to be one of the most relaxed places I've worked. Dress code is very casual; you can basically wear what you want, appropriately of course. You are always working with your team, so you may start to get close and feel like family"
good,"Customers were definitely the most stressful part of this job, as with any customer service or retail position. My coworkers made the day fun and had good team skills. I would work here again now that I know what to expect."
good,I learned a lot about sales working at Macys. I liked working with the other girls. It was competitive and fast paced The management seemed overworked but willing to work with people.
good,management is kind and helps as much as needed. The job can be energetic at times but for the most part its a nice place work. You come across all different types of people.
good,1. Good place to work
good,"My job duties included unloading trucks as they came in, unpacking boxes, and stocking merchandise. It was fast-paced but a good work environment. I enjoyed working with all my coworkers."
good,"Overnights, weekends, late shifts, early morning shifts, holidays, split shifts..."
good,"A typical work day at Macy's was usually fasted paced and very busy. I learned how to use the cash registers, how to interact with customers, I learned a lot of the jewelry sold there, and how to size watches. Management was great, always helped in tough situations. The workplace culture was very friendly and nice everyone helped each other out. The hardest part was having the same lunch break as my other coworkers and having to wait 1-2 hours later than scheduled to eat. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with great people."
good,Good management cool work enviroment friendly co workers employee orientend flexible but not enough hours. Busy around the holidays but they have plenty potlucks
good,Working at macys is easy if you have patience. Customers can get edgy but if you know how to handle and control situations then this is the job for you.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A great company to work for.  Working with customers daily and employees. Being able to interact with customers and seeking help with them. Learning new things everyday
good,Macy's was a great Security Job to have for the most part. I started off in uniform as a Visual Security Officer and was later promoted to Security Detective. I was assigned to the Home Store and Security Safety Auditor for the store.
good,Had a lot of fun helping people find what they needed and restocking and searching was Enjoyable. Had a lot of fun under pressure of the Black Friday events.
good,The work was fine enough. But there are quotas to meet which can be difficult especially when a lot a people are working the same day. you have to fight for the register to make a sale. including sales we had to make sure the sales floor was organized and clean which a job in itself. (I had the mens underwear and apparently no one knows what men's underwear looks like so they HAD to take them out of the package and just leave them around constantly. It would take me two hours to get it cleaned and organized only for another customer to come in behind me and mess it up just a little so my manager had something to yell at me about and an accuse me of not doing my job. so yeah. not fun.)
good,"Macy's was a great place to work at. I only work seasonal. I wished the paid was more reasonable. I was offered to stay after the holidays were over, but I wanted to put all my focus into school."
good,"Was able to excel in customer service and sales techniques in order to meet company goals and standards. Very friendly coworkers, who are more interested in supporting each other rather than competing with each other."
good,Macy's is a place where the more you sale the more you gain. With the help of  other employees you can get work done on time and efficiently. During holidays is when things get more stressful but having your team behind you can make things go smoother.
good,Had no problem with shoes loved working there everyone was great to work with its hard work but pretty laid back holidays in shoes gets really crazy but their is a good team that makes it happen.
good,"Great place to work for temporary work, when seeking a position in which you are deciding on future needs or goals.  The setting is comfortable and can always find someone to assist as needed."
good,This position was challenging. The location was very small but not thought out carefully of its location. I saw more potential in this store if it was located in a different area in the Macy's store.
good,"Macy’s is a great place to work ,I highly recommend.I only work in the backstage section of the store so I can’t speak for the rest of the store .The managers in backstage are great ,can’t say the same for the rest of the management team."
good,"Macy's is a great company to work for, great benefits. You can make your own schedule, but...... Not as a security guard. The company website said all associates. Not only do security guards keep you safe, we prevent thefts. When the company loses money, every worker loses money. This is completely unfair, we should be treated the same. There is no work/life balance for security guards. The job is also dangerous and we deal with morons, we should actually get more benefits than other associates, instead we can't get a simple work/life balance? This is beyond ridiculous. I hope Macy's decides to change this. We have families and lives, and your false advertising is extremely uncalled for. We stand for long periods of times too, treat us like humans with this stuff. We need the benefit of making our own schedules. We have lives, families, and other things to attend to."
good,"standard retail environment. friendly people, environment ranges from fast paced to slow paced depending on department and time of day. I get bored when it is slow as I prefer to be actively doing something."
good,"Easy place to move up if you make your voice heard, pay can be better especially if you have experience, fun job and coworkers make it even better which added to the whole Macy's experience"
good,"I enjoyed being a jewelry associate.  I did  not have to cover for another department  very often.  I loved helping the customer look for a gift for someone.  It allowed me to use my artistic mind to see what kind of jewelry would be best for them.  That was really my talent.  The hardest part of the job was closing out the cash register for the night because so many associates had used it during the day. Sometimes I stayed until 11 pm to get it right.  When I came to work,"
good,Macys is a good company. I worked for shipping and Handling and it was new at the time that I started. It was really busy we had a time limit and I worked at on the holidays so it was a lot to do.
good,It was retail so customers would be rude but I always remained professional and tried to assist them as best I could and to the best of my abilities. It was quick paced especially on sale days but it was worth it. Everyone was very polite and welcoming but also willing to teach new employees the basics. The managers were very informative and kind always teaching.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working at Macy's was great for the most part.  The only issue I had was my manager after I got a promotion, I was warned she was awful but I wanted that promotion.  Other than her I loved the people I worked with, I was given a lot of responsibility, and the work was surprisingly enjoyable.  Checking my schedule and changing it when necessary was relatively easy.  I worked at a slower location so it was fairly relaxed.  Aside from my promotion there isn't much room to advance, and raises slow down almost to a halt.  That was the main reason I left."
good,I have worked for Macy's Productive Team as a Seasonal Support Associate for the past three years and it is a good job and is instructional and rewarding.
good,It was a fun job especially meeting and working with new people.I love it when we had sales because it was very busy but other times when not in season it was very slow.
good,The only reason I want to leave is because there is no job security. you could lose your job over night and they do job cuts quite often which scares me. I need job security. Otherwise I love who I work for right now I'm an Admin Assistant and I got very lucky with 3 great Vps. The salary could be a little better considering how many people I actually work with.
good,"I loved working at Macy's. I enjoyed the rapport with my coworkers and supervisors, and the work was easy. I learned how to spot minor, key differences between brand name items and non-name brand items. The most fun thing was getting merchandise ready to go out on the sales floor. This was a very satisfying job for me and I would do seasonal work for them again anytime."
good,"- Part timers normally get 4 - 12 hours per week. Full timers generally receive 12 - 40 hours, but no one generally gets more than 32."
good,"I am a people person, with that being said, I enjoyed meeting and greeting the customers.  Eventually, some of the customers would ask for me specifically which made my day, but of course when working with the public you will sometimes get the customer that couldn't be please and would actually look at it as a challenge and did my best to change the customers attitude before they the store. I wasn't paid very much but making a customer happy compensated for the pay."
good,"Macy's was that type of job to really enhance my communication/sales skills, It was the first job to give me a management opportunity at the age of 19 years old"
good,"great team spirit and inclusive of all"
good,"As a member of the signing team, I got in very early and as such was able to get out of work by noon, which allow me most of the day to do other things or work another job."
good,"I worked in Customer Service for 2 yrs Trainers were great it was a lot over all to learn and once you hit the floor you were placed in a academy on the floor with helpers all around you for about 4 mths then you were placed on a team with a supervisor it was the best training class I ever experienced. "
good,it was okay working there i loved working with the customers and i also enjoyed working with the other associates overall i liked my job  i wanted a better pay
good,"Macy's is a very good company to work for. If you are strong in retail/sale. My section went over budget and seasonal positions did not get hired. I think Macy's is highly competitive but management does not manage the competitive between commission and non-commission sections that I worked in. Management does do what they can to help with administrative issues. The registers were easy to use. And Macy's have some demanding customers. All in all if you want to learn how to sale, and get off the ground with experience Macy's NYC is the place to be."
good,"At first, I wasn't that good at my job and & my co-workers were getting frustrated, but after I understood what I was doing, I was great, and did a very good job. I had to be fast packing so that it can be there by the date. Tough, but still good."
good,"The upper management and my manager were probably the best of many jobs I've seen. There was paid training. Everyone knew their job roles and each one had their own location. Unfortunately, I felt I was not able to shine with the large staff and it was near impossible to cancel or reschedule a shift."
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits and incentives. Ability to advance and change departments. Pretty well organized and managed. Takes good care of the employees if you show that you are also loyal to the company.
good,"Very nice work place, was not able to get home due to transportation issues. Would work for this company again if given the opportunity. Manager and peers was great."
good,Fun environment working with other associates to get the job done. The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with customers' problems when you're unsure of how to solve it. There are also situations where there is more than one way to deal with it and there might be a specific way the company wants it done. Overall its a great work experience.
good,"Macy's was a holiday position, and it was great for a holiday job. During the holiday it was very fast paced and sometimes it was difficult to take breaks on time, but it was fun nonetheless."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The job requires being there hours before the store open to make sure current sales, price changes and new merchandise is set for customers coming in. They wanted to make sure customers were shopping in a neat and clean environment. There were few times throughout the year where working weekends were required. The management was very good at working around unexpected scheduling issues. The only problem I saw was that sometimes there weren't enough hours available to work a twenty hour week."
good,I love working at Macy Mall of America. The only thing I did not like was the hours. You have to worked late sometime. Otherwise it was wonderful place to work.
good,It is a nice place to grow experience and human interactions and also you get to expand your knowledge and personality you get to learn a lot and get to know different kind of people
good,Very hectic around the holidays. You work mostly alone and you learn the aspects of merchandising. Hardest part is trying to find something and it's not where it's supposed to be.
good,Great place to work and to strengthen your selling skills. One must be great at possessing strong customer service skills so as to uphold the Macys Magic brand.
good,Macy's was a great place to work with great people. I was able to get my first security guard job experience there and learned a lot about being a guard for a high shortage area.
good,"I worked in the kids department which rarely brings customers unless it's Christmas . Everyday I had to reach a sales goal as well as a credit goal. The sales goal was easy. The credit goal, not so much"
good,I liked working here but just quit because I wasn't receiving hours. I need a job that was going to give me a steady work week and this wasn't it. But I did enjoy the company though.
good,"Macys was definitely one of my favorite places to work! Everyone was very nice, the system set up was easy to learn and it seems like advancement was not to difficult."
good,"The typical workday as a warehouse worker on the floor when seasonal is a lot of work in a ten hour day, occasionally there might be hiccups that can cause a stall for unknown lengths of time, usually brief."
good,Im not one for words but my expieriance with Macys was short my good. The hours were decent and the oppertunities to move up were always present. Id work there again
good,Its always something to do. There's always room to grow and show off your skills and abilities. During the time I was working there the pay wasn't good. But it seems it may have improved.
good,Macys was a a good place to work and learn about Planning and Distribution at the same time.  Good opportunity to work with third party and create and build strong business relationships.
good,"Answer inbound calls, 50-100  depending on call volume. assist customers with credit card accounts. Up date billing information, take payments, reverse fees if warranted. Explain their statement and fees, review purchases and report credit card lost or stolen,  Transfer customer to other department such as credit granting, collections, gift card dept or Macy's or Bloomingdale's.com.."
good,"Overall macys-queens center is a good place to work. Many of the employees are young people who attend college and everyone gets along with each other. Management is friendly and helpful and more than happy to field any questions or complaints from employees or customers."
good,The Management and HR at this location is excellent! I enjoyed working at this company. Friendly and fun environment. Really great perks with Macy's Money and discounted items.
good,Macy's was fun energetic place to work. nice vibe. I met different people everyday. I had great customers that called on me to shop for them personally.
good,Macys has its days when it was slow and steady. I've only worked there for seasonal but my time there was fun and easy. Managers were cool and showed appreciation.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"They work you through all holidays but they do look out for their employees. On Thanksgiving, they provide a good meal and try to ease the fact that you're away from your family on the holiday. That's always a good thing."
good,"like most retail/sales positions, it was pretty cut throat.  you would have to watch your customers and make sure that other employees were not trying to take them on for their own numbers and commission sales."
good,"Great environment, clean area, convenient locations. There's room to expand and grow within the company you just need to take advantage of them! Be friendly with coworkers and it'll be a breeze!"
good,"for me was a good experience in work in Macys, they give me the opportunity in grow up my knowledge. Always received from the managers and co worker a nice word and compliment about your job. It was a good place for practice English for me was useful. The schedule in the evening didn't work for me when you have little child."
good,"be knowledgeable about all of the brand products and trust no one, do your job and mind your own business. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of us receiving new inventory, unloading and setting up the merchandise, picking and packing merchandise for orders, performing moves and set ups of displays and end caps to display new merchandise, and helping the customers with all of their shopping needs. I learned a lot about the retail world and what it takes to survive and excel in that market. The management was stretched thin from time to time especially during the high volume months and holidays, so it was up to the leads to pick up the slack an help the store reach our store goals The workplace culture was very diverse and worked like a well oiled machine when everyone was doing their best to complete tasks. The hardest part of the job would have to be if we could not satisfy the customer for example if we ran out of stock on certain items and completely sold out in our region, it was not fun telling the customer that there was nothing we could do to help with that particular item. On the other hand the most satisfying  part of the job was helping the customer get exactly what they needed and exceeding their expectations for our store."
good,Hardest part of the job was first day when you are trying to find the houses you are trying to deliver too. After a couple of days you know which paper goes where and soon you are seeing how fast you can do it on your bike before school.
good,"At this job I folded clothes, organized floor tables and did my up most best to maintain a clean department. We were in charge of making sure all products looked neat and appealing. Although it was an easy job, I did not enjoy dealing with some special tasks. Things like opening up credit cards, or helping with a special purpose. There was not enough training for these situations."
good,Macy's was a great place to work. The people were fun and sometimes you would come across an unhappy customer but then it gives you the opportunity to turn their experience around. I would still be there if they paid enough.
good,"I got in to my dept. early and checked over work and started my day which most of the time was going all over the store shopping for people who ordered via computer/phon. I knew everyone from Sr. mang.buyer's, floor managers and store manangers. anyone who could make my work easier."
good,Great place to get a retail feel. You will get a chance to experience meeting different people with different personalities. The coworkers are great. The work sometimes is a hustle but at the end of the day you will feel good knowing that you did your part in making the customer happy.
good,"Fun, energetic work environment. New experiences everyday with great staff and customers. Management helpful, and encourages team playing with training."
good,"Sometimes when you need extra help there is never enough staffing."
good,"Great place to work, not to fast paced and not to slow either. People are friendly and help you out when you first start. Be prepared for long days though."
good,The company was very good at teaching the mechanics of unloading trucks and moving retail items to the store floor. management was very helpful in teaching the duties of unloader.
good,"Good benefits, good amount of time off. Store closings make things a bit tight but you can avoid it usually if you are not a temp employee. They will relocate you."
good,Good Place to work for a solid job and income. Fast pace marketing environment. Producing advertisements viewed across the country. A lot of in house learning courses if your schedule permits time.
good,Great retail job opportunity for college students.Some associates may be territorial when it comes to sales. You meet amazing customers with whom you can have a long-lasting friendship.
good,Macy's is a great place to work. You meet new people and receive great discounts. The shoe department is always busy and messy. You also have an opportunity to participate in the parades the often have.
good,Macy's is a nice place to work. It has great benefits and discounts and a lot of beautiful merchandise you sometimes cannot keep up with. It is really busy though during holidays because of the sales and during other store sales.
good,It's a good challening environment and really makes you work. Decent pay and great beenfits. But very diificult to balacne life if you are full - time.
good,Usually is a slow day. People get what they want and leave.  Management cares.  The only stressful thing about the job is the dressing rooms. They are always destroyed.
good,"A typical work day was, you show up to work on your shift and answer and questions any customers may have abut renting out a suit or a tuxedo, help the customer coordinate colors and materials for their event."
good,"I love working in the management team, the team really compliments each other with the strengths and weaknesses we provide.  It's a great team to be a part of"
good,Worked here right out of college and it was really awesome. My manager was great and she made sure we all had good hours and fair share of our hours and responsibilities. Great discounts and overall an awesome environment if you like retail.
good,"I'm a very hard worker and sometimes it's hard to deal with people who don't have the same work ethic as me. What I dislike about the. Company is that they always put the customers first no many how disrespectful, and wrongful they are. I love meeting the new co workers from all ages and backgrounds I love the older co workers I learn so much from them"
good,"I enjoyed working here , great for high school and part time college students. I worked at the Macy's in kings plaza. The location was quick paced and diverse"
good,Well in my department it was always stressful. They put alot of pressure on just one person. Somedays would be really fun and we always had cool activites with our macys family.
good,Overall experience was great. I had wonderful coworkers that had no problem with answering any questions and helping with anything that I may have needed. Customers made things difficult at times but the overall experience was a great one.
good,"Fun place to work, with flexible scheduling. Also a lot of opportunity for advancement. Management very fair and understanding, will work with you on availability."
good,A typical work day started fun with a morning meeting to get you pumped for the day.  You get revved up to greet customers/guests and you get recharged to use what you learned in your customer service class.  The opportunity to learn and grow is available to you when you apply yourself and strive to be the best at your job.
good,greatttttttttttttt place to work if you are in high school and love to work with people and the environment is friendly and the schedule is very flexible
good,"Working at Macy's was fun being able to talk to your customers giving them your opinions on clothing or shoes. I could be myself in working with this company and it would be amazing. I didn't have a hard time learning how to do everything there, from fitting customers to there suits to there shoes. I made friends with customers and made strong bonds and they would always look for me so I can help them out."
good,"I am a person who strives for the best that life has to offer. I am a team player, always open to learning and gainign8the neccessary experience to be creative as possible when doing what's expected of me."
good,"Here I enjoyed my coworkers, we all pulled together to finish our days. Team work was important to keep things running smoothly in the department. We had a great department manager"
good,"The management/employee relationships need immense improvements. Following the rules and getting your job done will get you through the day. Up and down as far as productivity, balanced as far as compensation."
good,Productive and welcoming place to work.I like the stable hours I received part-time. The commute was not that bad from where I live.People there are great to work with and easy to talk to about anything.
good,"Constant contact with customers"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Fast pace and competitive, but will learn a lot and be given substantial responsibility. Culture very much depends on which team you are in and what function. Upper management is pushing to show employees more value with flexible work and better benefits, while VPs are actively trying to foster team culture."
good,I am looking for a job part-time and closer to my home. I could work from 32 to 50 hours a week and from 4 hours to 12 hours. I believe in team work.  Our Home Store had a very special team.  Thus was apparent because we were the top performing team at Macy's.
good,I enjoy working for Macys. Like any business there are thing we wish could be improved. What I like most about Macys is that the company thrives on getting it right.
good,"Macy's was a great place for me to gain experience in retail. They were the first to hire me and give me chance. A typical day at work started off slow, since I worked early mornings most of my time working there, but then the day picked up and more customers came in. So I would say, its a busy day until the end of my shift. I learned to have patience and have a better understanding and new respect for retail/sales employees. Management was good, in terms of communication and assisting me when I needed help. I had no problem with asking for help when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was the first day when it came to working with the register system; however, I'm a quick learner, so it didn't take me long to catch up. The most enjoyable part of working at Macy's was to see all satisfied customers and shoppers and knowing that I did a good job."
good,"On a sale day, it was crowded and demanding. i enjoyed making shoe recommendations for a special event or just for everyday wear. I learned which shoe material was best for different uses. I was pleased to know if I had a question, my coworkers or upper management were happy to assist me. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the hours of standing."
good,Macy's was a great experience. I loved the environment especially at the time of the year I was working there (during the holiday season) so festive and full with spirit. I enjoyed the moments that had when I got to help customers with their needs.
good,"I only worked here for 2 weeks as seasonal associate, it was fine. Good pay and flexible hours, with a nice work environment. I would recommend working here."
good,"Great place to work,  Great, challenging but laid back environment. Typical day of work is to walk and count boxes of inventory, switching back and forth between priority inventory and secondary inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was the helpful and friendly people I work with. The hardest part of job was the high stress last two weeks of christmas season, where accurate, fast and efficient results were imperative."
good,I worked part time.  You get  half hour morning break and half hour lunch. Management was easy to work with on your schedule. A good place to work. I got along with everyone.
good,"open selling area.. great staff .. super fun work environment, build great relationship with clients . very easy and stress free management is great. i would recommend this job."
good,"Working at Macys had great benefits, and flexible hours which made it easy to work there."
good,"Just like any other job Macy's is extremely fast paced and stressful during the holiday season. You have to be sure to be quick, and to be able to handle multi tasking."
good,Great place to work with where the customer satisfaction is the number one priority. Employees engagement is the most enjoyable part of the job I performed while working there.
good,"It was pretty tasking. Basically, you are pretty much put to work until your shift is up. It sometimes made no sense to clean when customers would mess everything up again. But that was your job."
good,"It got slow sometimes and the women can be snobby. A very competitive environment. The customers are usually the friendliest people at the job. But overall, a good place to work"
good,"nice staff, good employees to work with love would go back there anytime. They would work around your schedule. Good place to work. Everyone is friendly and nice."
good,Overall not a bad place to work in. Managers add too much pressure. They always pressure you to open new accounts everyday. They start at minimum. They really want their associates to be friendly and helpful and just be available to the customers. Sometimes associates won't be appreciated for their hard work.
good,"It was a pretty cool experience. Co workers were pretty cool for the most part. Manager was really cool. Job not bad at all, only negative is pay and benefits not that great"
good,can be a very stressful but rewarding career working in the fraud department assisting frustrated customers dealing with fraudulent purchases on their accounts
good,"Working a small store was fun, friendly and an easy going environment; compared to working at the larger Macy's.  Working at Macy's has given me a lot of flexibility at the smaller location. However, due to their recent downfall I had to go to a bigger location. Of course, the environment is certainly fast paced and not the same. However, you have to work hard and make sure you are heard for the hours you want to work."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I learned how to use the point of sale system. My co-workers were nice, not all of them, but most of them. The managers were okay, some we're really nice and others not so much."
good,"A typical day at work is fulfillment in the morning which is finding items for people who purchased online, then its helping customers, ringing them up, doing returns, helping them make payments, apart from that its cleaning keeping your area clean, go backs, and trying to open up credit cards which the managers are always pushing you to do. Its pretty fast paced especially during weekends and holidays it gets very busy."
good,My main daily job was to greet and assist customers and promptly and cheerfully  deal with sales and returns at whichever areas I am assigned to as well as recovering clothing and keep all areas clean. The hardest part for me was selling the corporate credit cards because they insisted on a quota be filled by each associate.
good,"There are problems but its definitely a place to a long career. like most places, it depends all on coworkers. I was lucky to have great coworkers. but even if you don't have them, you can transfer or relocate easily"
good,"Perhaps it was because it was the holiday season but the stress was extremely high to push the Macy charge accounts. In a recession, few were receptive to a credit card."
good,"Only during holiday times that it is good choice to work at Macys."
good,I really loved working at Macy's and the people I met there made the job even more enjoyable. I just wished I wasn't given the false hopes of becoming a permanent employee.
good,The management was amazing and the training was very helpful especially for me working in retail for the first time. I learned how to communicate with customers in a professional manner. Not only did I experience retail for the first time but I also experienced how and what inventory was all about.
good,"As an associate at Macy's warehouse, it definitely had it's pros and cons. The supervisors were very helpful with new associates, they very much wanted the associates to succeed at their tasks and gave great advice's to the employees. Also a majority of the other associates were very easy to work with and also very helpful. On the other hand, the job also had it's own cons. That being a few of their employees were unhelpful, lazy, don't listen to instructions, and flat out don't even do their jobs, unless a supervisor comes around. Furthermore, probably what I disliked the most about the job was its schedule. I only applied for Macy's because they had openings for part-time employees, and because I was a full-time student. During the duration of my time with Macy's my hours at work increased to the point that I was working 39 hours a week; and because of this my grades in school started to go down. If only my hours didn't increase I would have enjoyed working at Macy's. I think it's a good place to start if you've never worked before, and team work is a must if you work in a warehouse."
good,"Macys call center was a busy place to work at, it helped me learn more about working with customers over the phone & how to become more helpful. working their you had to learn a lot just to be able to help the customer with any problem they could have. it was a fun environment, management knew how to try to keep a team together"
good,"Always learning and always someone to help you!!! Great upper management. Very positive group it was inspiring being around them. Customers are very focused on helping the customer, something that surprised me."
good,Great place to work for in the beginning.  Learned and got experience about working in retail.  Worked in customer service where I get to meet and assist customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's because they were very flexible with my school schedule. Their online scheduling service makes it easy to swap and pick up shifts. Management was very friendly and always greeted every employee by name. "
good,"Loved working there, it was relaxed and no pressure at all. Breaks were good and a good co workers. You are on your own. People were fun to be with. It was a job that made you think."
good,Great place to work and very passionate leaders and employees.  Must find your own work life balance.  Growth opportunities happen frequently and many leaders in the organization are home grown.  Positive work environment and retail is a fun and exciting place.
good,"I liked to work at Macy's! "
good,"Hours long at times, made it hard to balance my time but the people were great to work with and they gave me a chance to learn new departments and skills"
good,A typical day would consist of patrolling the store and making numerous call outs if lucky we would catch an apprehension. At the end of the night we  close up the store and arm the store.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Being able to see all different kinds of people with various needs helped me to be better prepared for any situation."
good,This company is a leader in the retail industry and really keeps the well being of it's employees top of mind. Excellent benefits and great work life balance.
good,"A typical day at work, if opening, begins with preparing the registers, turning on product security, fulfilling online orders, and reviewing daily goes with other co-workers. In my department I secure, clean, organize, and prep the area/products. I make myself available to cover lunches and breaks for fellow employees as needed. When working with customers and sales I up-sale the products in my department, notify customers of upcoming sales and events, build and maintain clientele, attend to potential customers, resolve any conflicts or concerns that may arise, and opening Macy's credit card accounts. On occasion I proceed to close as well. "
good,Sometimes people were unfriendly and the training was boring and on a computer. I think that I had to come in for multiple days for multiple hours at a time just to do these training videos over how to work the cash register. I was very confused and felt unprepared on the sales floor and hope they are working on a better training system. I appreciated the employee discount because I love to shop and their clothes are very cute. Make sure to ask a lot of questions during training and to have someone helpful working during your shifts when you start out so you are able to efficiently help the customers.
good,A typical day working at Macy's was very productive. You learn new things about every product. And I've also learned a little bit about doing makeup. The music that played throughout the store was upbeat and popular. The hardest part about the job was finding certain items for customers. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers make their purchases.
good,Make sure all new items we got were put out and put there secerty tags on and help fold and put were all clothes go.  And help to do the delivery when we gpt it to unload and sort were all items go to.
good,"My first time ever working for Macy's my first ever trying to sale cologne , it was an great experience just another thing I can add on to resume but I wouldn't do it again"
good,"I was at a seasonal position & I was a ""floater,"" so I was always switching different departments. Some days good, some days bad.. depending on the department of course & your preference. Clothes were always messy, but that's just how retail goes. It's nice that you don't have a strict uniform, break room is nice."
good,I loved this job and the management was absolutely amazing. Everyone was so sweet and kind. I made good money while in college and they were so flexible with my schedule allowing me to work a few hours during the week and full shifts on the weekends. Staff showed that each employee is valued!
good,"I worked in the women's shoes department in commission sales. Overall, the experience was very pleasant and paid well enough for what it was that I don't really have any complaints. However, most of the staff and customers you'll find there are over 35, which doesn't create a very fun environment for younger staff. It's not unbearable, but it can get rather boring and even a bit isolating."
good,Overall it is a good retail store. They're all about their customers and employees. Can be stressful during the holidays but that's retail. The scheduling is the best for retail.
good,Macy's has a good sense of costumer service and provides great training for its employees. The sales specialist job provided me with plenty of teamwork as well as independent duties which was a good balance. Management was present on the floor for any guidance and I felt an overall sense of belonging.
good,"a typical day of work involved merchandising product, managing multiple teams and merchandise execution. Strong emphasis on cross training team members to get all of workload completed. Fulfillment orders monitored and processed daily to add to stores financial bottom line. Responsible for store operations and required testing."
good,Macy's was a nice place to work for good hours and friendly peoples.if you take the time you can really learn about marketing and retail alone with fashion. It works that some of the mangers take the time to teach you about the store.
good,"the benefits at this job are great especially if you work at any cosmetic counter. It can be slow at times however since it's not really a high traffic location like other cosmetic stores. I would recommend it, if you prefer to stick to one brand"
good,"I enjoyed working here and loved the people I worked with in women's shoes, but also wanted a job that fit with my degree. Working here was enjoyable when successful in helping a customer find the right pair of shoes."
good,"I was introduced to the sea of knowledge on SQL and MSBI."
good,"Development program provides access to nearly all parts of the business and exposure to management. I was frustrated with inability to be flexible with wanting to leave early/come early type of items from time to time."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I'm truly happy to be working for Macy's, Always guided me in the right direction, made me feel good about myself working for a company I buy merchandise from."
good,"Acknowledge the expiriense of your employees and allow them to grow in. Better insensitive programs with equal opportunity. "
good,"At Macys, I was afforded great opportunities to develop and improve job skill build advancement opportunities.  During the course of my career I had opportunities to be challenged in new areas and develop others with opportunities to also grow in the organization."
good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's it taught me a lot about sales customer service and how to see from the customers point of view and help me a lot with knowing how to help the customer also build credit in the one thing that a lot of people like to  do shop."
good,"Initiate service consultations to determine the customer’s preferences and buying/service needs; explain and demonstrate use of cosmetics through actual application"
good,"I packed in a warehouse it was below freezing 24/7. You had to wear two pairs of pants, scarf, gloves, two jackets just to stay warm. Managers come around all day and harass you about your pack rate(packages per hour). Even when there's no work to do. The managers did play favorites. Pretty sucky job the thing that keeps you going is the weekly pay, fast money."
good,Great company with great benefits. This company allows growth within the organization and recognizes employees that go above and beyond
good,"I really enjoyed every moment of working at Macy's.I worked in the home and textile industry as a support sales associate. I was able to support the team and I had a chance to interact with a lot of people. It was fun working with my team members, they were very energetic and interesting people. The workload at Macy's was crazy at times but I and my team members had a good rapport and with total cooperation we always got work done."
good,"loved working at Macy's great place to work"
good,"24 years of retail sales/Management with the company.  Ever changing environment to keep up with the evolving retail world.  As a manager plenty of opportunities for skill development through there ""portal""."
good,The work environment there is very professional and comfortable. They made you enjoy doing your job whatever it was. only bad thing about it was they didn't have the hours I needed.
good,No review as I did not work there very long but I can say I enjoyed my time there and was disappointed I had to leave because of a sick child.  I worked in the bra department and certified to size customers. I liked the training that was on going. Problem solving and dealing with difficult customers was a fun challenge. Always loved working with young people. Sounds corny....but I loved the challenge of smiling and remaining positive when others complained. I regret having to leave. They were sad that I had to leave as well.
good,"excellent manager and co workers, the was very flexible with my day and time, i learn a lot."
good,"helping customers find what they need and open credit accounts"
good,It is what you make of it. To me it was about my work family. Learning how to be more confident. Feeling good about my goals when met.Working well with others. Team player. The hardest part of my job was the cleaning up and shop lifters. Not being able to stop people from shoplifting. That was hard for me to see.
good,They helped me understand the company and grow as a person. The most enjoyable part was when I got to teach others what I learned and watch them grow.
good,Though the time I spent at Macy's was short I thoroughly enjoyed the work and environment.  I was given the task to daily check in stock and keep the shoe department store room stocked.
good,"Overall, I liked working for Macy's and I think this is a good job for someone with a lot of energy. A typical day at work was cleaning out the dressing room, making sure all the displays were tidy and helping customers find what they needed. Management was always a phone call away fro any question, so I felt very much at ease, they were a safety net which encouraged me to push myself to doing my best at my job. The hardest part of the job is when the store is not as busy which few shoppers; It's the hardest for me, because when I am stationed in one spot and I have done everything that can be done in my area, it's easy to feel tired due to inactivity."
good,"I loved the flexibility of the job but not the scheduling...most of the time we didnt have enough help for the day. I was hired as a fitting room attendant but pretty much got sent to any department that needed help that day. It is easy to move to other departments as long as you have good attendance and show that your a hard worker but sometimes they take advantage of hard-workers which is good,but can also be bad cause you might get tired of picking up other people's slack. But overall it's a good part-time job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Happy to work there for the work schedule flexibility. It also provides discount benefits for the employees. For employee's of the year the bonus discount increases.
good,It was an overall good experience working there. Management was good and you get on site job trainings. Scheduling is good because you can make your own. You have incentive opportunities when you open Macy's cards.
good,Most days would consist of putting out new merchandise and signing them with proper signs. I learned about product placement and how to manage time wisely to get the needed jobs done before store opening.The management was not the best. There were many communication problems.
good,Helped me to learn to deal with all type of customers. Retail is like work boot camp. The job can be challenging at times but also very rewarding.
good,"great co-workers, flexible scheduling, awesome work environment. this is a great job for someone who is in business and marketing to potential to grow within job."
good,"They are very flexible with college students or those who need specific hours. There are plenty of benefits to working for the company such as health, a credit card, and resume builder."
good,"I learned a lot from working for huge retail company. Being it was my first job I learned something new all the time, I did enjoy working at macys. it was a great experience."
good,Wonderful staff and great people. I would recommend this as a first job or a job to get you experience in retail. Good job to get into the retail field.
good,"It was easy to make friends there, my co workers were friendly, it was always a busy day so it was never boring there was alwasys something to do and keep your day going. the managers there are sweet and good at hadleing there job."
good,"I would assist customers with what clothing items they needed. I would also clean the fitting rooms, and do ""go-backs"". If the department was busy, I would assist with cashier work. I felt that it was difficult to get the certain amount of new Macy's card accounts. My co-workers were all very friendly and enjoyable to be around."
good,"Good environment to work, and good experienced, company recognize who work hard. many opportunities in different areas."
good,"I just love how everybody is so friendly with each other. there are a lot of benefits."
good,"Assist associated with benefits, pay, and transfers. Onboarding and training. Implemented new company policies and procedures. Balanced daily cash office and safe. Prepared bank deposits."
good,Good environment and gives you extra hours if ever needed. Typical day at work would start out picking your station and prep your bags for the items to put it in. The more you pack your items the more your numbers come up the more you get notice for your hard work in the warehouse.
good,"This is a very good job for college students. The staff is very helpful when it comes to helping balance work and school."
good,Great job and flexible with scheduling. Practice great customer service. Fast pace. Have the opportunity to move departments.
good,"ReMax is a great company, however the pay for administrative assistants was not very competitive. There was also very little chance to move up unless you got a real estate license."
good,"I started out with this company as just a sales associate."
good,"A good company, just not to many available hours for on call employees. Loved working there the time I was there. Management was very friendly and co workers were respectful as well. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for a Macy's card. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing customers makeup."
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers. Whether it be finding merchandise, making credit card payments, or just answering questions. I've learned a lot at Macy's. Patience is definitely #1. The hardest part of the job can most definitely be the customers, but they are also the most enjoyable part of the job. Every now and then you get that customer who you can help and really make their day. That satisfaction is almost second to none"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,managers are super nice and go-lucky.  however its boring and not much to do on a normal day. they are really strict and dress code is nice. break room is nice. break system is also nice. not many benefits thou.
good,"Good company and adequate management depending on the location. Pay is not great as bonuses never pay out for management level; year-end losses are always to blame. Work atmosphere is great, fast paced and allows you autonomy with departmental management as long as you stay within policy."
good,"A typical day work for me consists of getting ready for work about 45 mins before I need to be there. Upon arriving I will clock in and go to my department that I will be working in. Once I am done my day truly begins. I great the customers with a friendly hello; even if they are just passing through. If they stop I proceed to ask them if there is anything I can help them with on this day. If they so ""no"" or ""I am just looking"" I say alright and move on to the next customer. After a few minutes I will return to the previous customer and ask them if they are finding everything okay and if they need any help again. I have learned better customer service skills, how to help suit a customers needs. The management is very well. They are very helpful and understanding. I really enjoy my other co-workers, they are friendly, helpful, considerate, and kind. The hardest part about my job is trying to help customers who are very demanding, rude, or overall judgmental about myself or the products. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to be surrounded by inspiring people with striving attitudes, and charismatic spirits."
good,Hardest part is walking on concrete for 12hrs of the day. The supervisors can be hard to handle but overall the work environment is easy and there is alot of drama with grown adults. Just stick to your self and do not tell anyone anything because word around work can get around quick.
good,busy atmosphere very stressful environment with always something to do its a big store so you will never find a dull moment management is very knowlegable
good,the best thing about this place is that you have flexible hours to work between your school and family. they give you chance to pick shifts of your own flexibility which is great
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and management gave me many opportunities to grow and learn as much as I could! I loved how they trusted me it made me work even harder.
good,"I enjoyed my seasonal position, meet new people learned new things opened doors for me far as work experience, If I could I wouldn't mind another opportunity to work with Macy's"
good,I loved my co workers and my customers.  During sales and the holidays it is very fast paced but fun.  Store manager didn't like for the sales managers to help customers.
good,This company is great to work for everyone form the top to the bottom is welling to help you succeed. We put the customer first all the time and go out our way for them.
good,"This was a pleasant environment and positive employment opportunity. Clean environment, helpful co-workers and opportunity to become full or part-time employee after seasonal position."
good,"Working in Macys they gives you the option to have a flexible schedule , it may be minimun pay but atmosphere of store its pretty great. I liked working in Macys."
good,"i learned how to process shoes through shipment, i also learned how to deal with customers more efficiently, i gained more knowledge of p.o.s systems."
good,"Working at Macys is a good experience if you are trying to begin a career in retail sales.  Advancement within the company is possible, but you would need to create relationships with the management team."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in, being told what duties to complete and getting it done. I learn different things everyday and that is what makes it enjoyable, because I never get bored. The management is direct and stern and they know what to expect from the employees. My co-workers are good we are a team we each have our tasks but we also help each others when is needed.

Always fun protecting what's yours and that's my view with every company I will ever work for.
good,"A typical day at work for me is processing merchandise. I come in grab a rod full of different brands and tag the clothes with whatever tag they require. My managers make it clear of the task for the night. My co-workers are always friendly and help is always provided by them if needed.

Overall, working for Macy's Inc was a pleasure and helped me build the necessary fundamentals required to be a Sales Associate."
good,"you come in and pull-up fulfillment for customers that have ordered online. Then you have a store meeting to let us know what we need to work on for that day. Well, I feel that the hardest part of the job would be to always make customers happy when they have a bad day!"
good,The most enjoyable part of being a manager is working with my associates and customers alike. I enjoy finding the right pair of jeans for a customer and helping the associate help their customers.
good,"Overall, my experience at Macy's was great. The managers showed me how to do everything, as well as my co-workers. There was really nothing hard about the job, but the most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,"Everyone employee and manager here are very nice, friendly, sweet, and caring. We all are like a family. There are times where things can be tough but working with the sweet coworkers who can lessen that burden or pressure is the best. I work at the mens department so it can get hectic sometimes but helping each and every customer is our job. When there's no one in line, we would fix up the front line or do go backs. But the most enjoyable part of this job is that every coworker and manager there are very serious but at times they can loosen up to have fun with everyone."
good,It was a fun and safe work environment. I was able to advance my customer service skills in another field. Would love to work there again.The on-boarding process was seamless.

We always had fun, there was games within a team spirit, we contributed to the functions of the games and everyone had their opportunity to lead the team and make decisions on how the activity would play-out. The work took all of your focus skills and experience. I also liked the challenges in those situations, I was given the chance to utilize my problem-solving skills. I think its important that communication is a intrinsic ability that must be utilized to understand each other and appreciate our differences, that was very prevalent with this company."
good,"I learned a lot while working at Macy's from how to fold clothes the proper way to helping customers with payments. My co-workers helped m e out a lot as well whenever they noticed that I needed the help. They wouldn't ask, they'd just come around and vice-versa. We'd take turns in completing tasks so we'd be able to finish our work faster. The faster we finished with cleaning and ect., the more time we'd have to interact with our customers."
good,"A typical day at work was full of movement in the area with a lot of clients to help. "
good,"Productive, good environment to work."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,"Macy's gets slammed a lot, but I have to be honest.. at least on the support associate end, I've always been fairly happy working there. My direct supervisors were kind to me, looked out for me, asked me my opinion, worked with me on days off and usually gave me anything I needed whenever they could. We had a lot of good staff members.. my team in the morning was outstanding and they knew what they were doing and were helpful to everyone they ran into in the store. It was chaotic at times and yes, there are the random employees that seem to goof off and not take pride in their work or their work environment and it reflects poorly on the rest of us. Over all, I've always come back to Macy's and I feel comfortable there. I'm not employed with the company at the moment due to a move, but I'm always willing to go back."
good,"Macy's El Cajon store is a fun and supportive workplace. I get along well with all my co-workers and the management team is very supportive. "
good,"I had the opportunity to work throughout the store in many different areas and learn about each one.  I also got to learn different skills that I could use in future retail positions.  Maintaining the sales floor, the displays, keeping the fitting rooms clean, sorting clothing and returning them to their place on the sales floor were all a part of my job.  Interaction with customers and ringing up purchases were also vital to my job.  Management was wonderful, always clear and concise with their instruction, available and easy to communicate with, always willing to listen to new ideas and make time for their employees.  My co-workers were very easy to get along with, hard-working, great with customers and each other.  The hardest part of the job was balancing finishing the task at hand while still being one hundred percent available to customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was really just being able to work with and interact with such amazing people.  I also really enjoyed keeping busy and productive."
good,"One of the most best company I've worked for. Macy's is a fun place to work at and because I was a FLEX, I had the opportunity to work in different departments in the store. If you're really into fashion and like helping out people find their sense of style, then this is the place for you!"
good,i loved working for them as a seasonal. the employees and managers were very nice but interesting. i had lots of fun sensoring clothes for my first time.
good,"At Macys I would stock and deal with costumers on the floor. It was a great learning experience in costumer service. My coworkers were amazing, they would bring in food lol and greet you everyday with a smile. Management I learned discipline, but the hardest part of the job was not being able to move up in positon. What I enjoyed the most was the great staff."

good,"My time with Macy's giving me the opportunity to provide ""magic' in everything I do, whether it is assisting the customer's shopping needs, checking out or simple a warm welcome. My last few years with company I was apart of the merchandise team. I learned the small details of customer convenience, how the placement of product or a fixture can affect the customer experience. I learned how to work as a team player. "
good,At the beginning of  the work day... we go over the things we have done for the week.. we stretch and get ready for work... i must say the managers in certain area's are very good.. but the way things are set up it may become quite a hastle.. the co-workers are very good people they will help you if needed very friendly people.. the hardest part would be the constant walking.. at break time you only get 20min breaks and lunch break you only get 30min breaks mind you you are working 12hours and are constantly moving around it's not even enough time to enjoy a lunch break.. but the most enjoyable part about the job is.. like i said at the beginning is the bosses they are very unstanding and are willing to help you with everything you could possibly need.
good,"Working in Cosmetics is one of the most competitive, stressful, and craziest  job's ever . Especially when your working at the biggest Macy's in the world. For the number one counter. It can be a lot of pressure. But I enjoy going to work everyday. It's like having a family away from your family."

good,a typical work day would be fun. i learned alot about shoes. my co workers were very friendly. the hardest part was closing. the most enjoyable part was getting off.
good,My duties are keeping Company assets from leaving the building. What I have learned from it is picking up on suspicious behavior and working with a team. The management is good on communicating with us about what is going on in the store and concerns. My co-workers are great keeping it lively and yet professional. The hardest part about the job are slow days. The most enjoyable part of the job is keeping the Company assets from leaving the building.
good,Macy's is a fantastic company to work for especially for first time applicants or maybe anyone looking for part time work. I've been at Macy's for 2 years and you get great benefits. The only thing that put me off was that it's fairly tough to move up. To me there's a bit to much favoritism involved in the process as well. You would have to have a lot of patience to move up because it doesn't always happen quickly.
good,"Love working with the management team and working above the associates in the store. Everyone is really easy to get along with, and everyone works as a team, willing to pick up after one another when needed."

Before work began there would be a daily meeting with everyone one in the store, where we share accomplishments, promotions, and corporate news. I did enjoy working with the store manger because she encourage me to excel."
good,Fast paced selling environment. No day is ever the same in NYC. Lots of traffic from people all around the globe who come to shop and see the city.
good,I work with customers on a regular basis. I also answer phone calls and complete online orders. I ring on the register to sell items to customers.
good,"A typical day would be like, getting your section in  order, greeting customers and making sales. When customers arrived you politely greet them and ask ""can i help you with something Mrs/ms or Mr. Wait for their response if yes you ask are they for something particular or whats the occasion. sometimes the customer would ask our opinion. I learned how to be more patient and understanding, working in retail and customer service it could get a little hectic and the customers could come off very rude. Management was great, they always made sure everything went well and the workers had everything they needed."
good,"-Come in and talk to customers to see what shoes they want."
good,"I work on commission and my position is flex (flexible).  The best days to work are sale days when  there are lots of deals and customers are shopping a lot.  I enjoy helping customers pick their clothing or gifts and I especially enjoy helping them manage their coupons on their Macys account."

We will have our team meeting before the start of the day and will focus on the key areas and opportunity we have to focus. Through out the day we communicate with each other about the progress and how far we have accomplished the assigned tasks.
good,"If you relish change, you can flourish at Macy's.  An industry leader in innovation, Macy's also demonstrates its commitment to diversity, giving back and, most importantly, putting the customer at the center of all decisions."
good,"I worked there part-time and then I had to request a change of statues to seasonal.  During my time there, I had a wonderful Assistant Manager. He cared about the associates and would help at the drop of a dime.  I left due to a family emergency and time conflicts."
good,"For me a typical day at work requires me to find the product that the guest is looking for, and be able to suggest other products to go with or replace the current one. My managers and co-workers are easy to get along with and are very helpful. In my opinion the hardest part of the job is when I have to deal with angry guest, but that only happens on rare occasions and when it happens I do my best to keep a calm demeanor and try to keep them as calm as possible while i help them with their problem.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to see the look on someone's face after you have helped them extensively and they have this look of gratitude and appreciation."

I was learning something new everyday and making new friends, the guests/costumers  there are amazing I really haven't worked in a environment that had so many diversity of people from all walks of life witch mad each day more exciting, you'll never know who you're going to run into. Everyone there  was super nice, the guest/costumers kept me on my toes always presenting me with new challenges as well as management.

good,"It was not always Macy's. It started out as Hecht's department store. I was offered the Manager-in-Training job, while I was working at Lane Bryant. I grabbed the chance. It was a tough job. I learned the ins and outs of running a Fine Jewelry Department and all the responsibilities, including prospecting for clients, talking to people about the things they were buying. I had to educate myself about fine metals and stones, including mythology and lore. I LOVED this job. Eventually a management job opened up at another mall and although I felt I wasn't ready for it yet, it was given to me. It was tough. I was taking over a department that was showing loss in inventory. It was soon after 9/11 and people were not interested in fine jewelry and the main goal was to raise their sales. My numbers were fine but my co-workers were not enthused, and since they had been there for a long time, they fought constantly over who should get what hours, etc. Even though our inventory showed there was no thought, but a lot of paper errors, I was still fired because of the other employees' lack of sales. I was heartbroken. They said it was because I was a new manager and didn't raise the sales within a certain amount of months. Of course, I tried to fight for my job, but they were adamant. I will think twice about taking a commission job again. Hecht's was bought out by Macy's.I found that when I was an MIT, my co-workers were friendly and loving, but as a manager, I just couldn't seem to please them because I am a 'by-the-book' person, especially with scheduling. They expected me to work all"
good,My duties at Macy's were to keep a clean and neat work station. Meet and assist customers with great product knowledge in order to make sales. My co-workers were the best I've ever had.Management was great. But the thing I enjoyed the most was the people. I got to meet and create bonds with my customers. While there I learned a few things. I learned how to upsale and create long lasting bonds with my customers that still exist today.
good,"This was a good, fast-paced job, which taught great communication skills. Everything was also very well organized. It gets tiring but people are surprisingly friendly!"
good,"Great company to work with, and a fast paced environment to enter. Be prepared to help in all departments should you become part of the team. Great for students because there is flexible scheduling."
good,"Work day started with stock recovery and opening registers. Also helping guests find what they need, and helping guests with advice on clothing items."
good,"I definitely learned how to work well in a team setting as well as grow as a worker individually. There were many slow days, but also many busy days, it got to a point where I was asked to multiple things at a time which was a good and bad thing. You tended to lose a bit of focus because of that, which was a downside as a sales associate. I had great coworkers, and there was a good management team. Some of their strategies could have been a bit more organized. Overall, a good place to work if you are looking for part-time or summer employment."
good,"Very dynamic workplace. Very motivated people. Startup environment with the steadiness of a large company"
good,It was an interesting experience. Working in such a fast pace environment gave me some experience on providing great customer service no matter the situation. It was really helpful
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Being seasonal I worked in what ever position I could find shifts in that week. This made for late shifts and early shifts back to back in order to get in hours.
good,"The Macy's branch I worked for cared very much about customer service and appealing to the average consumer. The bar in terms of professionalism is set very high compared to many other Macy's I've been to/ A typical day of work consisted on helping customers with whatever their shoes needs were (worked in Women's Shoes department). From grabbing different shoe sizes to dealing with returns/exchanges, it was all about what we, sales associates, could do to make your day MAGICal. Learned how to deal with customers of all ages and all personality types, from the sweet and friendly to the ones that make you question why you get into retail in the first place. Co workers were very warm and inviting and created a comfortable work environment for me The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple customers who all require several needs, ex. 4 customers who ask for several pairs of shoes in several sizes; I am only one person and I only have two arms. Most enjoyable part of the job was definitely helping customers who understand that retail life isn't easy and make an effort to make my job easier by being polite or just thank me for helping them."
good,"I worked Tuesday - Saturday 7AM - to 3:15PM, work was fast paced call flow ranging from your everyday order questions down to orders lost and fixing orders outstanding."
good,Working for Macy's was very exhausting but fun at the same time. Everybody were super nice and welcoming of me and the potential customers everyday.
good,"macys is a great place to work, everyone was so friendly and its so diverse. i learned to be fast paced and multi-task on different task throughout the day."
good,"I've worked in Macy's for two years and it has been quite an experience. Because of it's flexible hours, Macy's allowed me to successfully balance both work and school. Nothing was ever too hard or too demanding and whenever help was needed, there was never anyone too far behind. "
good,"Coming in to work you clock in, go to warehouse and grab your scanner.  After that you get to sales floor, approach customers and start selling.  I have learned how to use the scanner and register with very little training.  Management is easy going, but many tenured employees take advantage of that.  In other words, they act as if they owned the floor, dissuading new employees from selling rather than helping them succeed and they get along with it.  The hardest part of the job is finding the items customers want in the stock room when there are people that are paid specifically to do that job.  Also said people are bossy with sales personnel and management does absolutely nothing about it.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making a real connection with customer and always selling at least 1 item of the 3 to 4 items a single customer requests of you.  That is just simply gratifying as the position is commission based."
good,"I was able to keep up with the latest fashion trends, while helping to bring up the appearance of a essentially not so beautiful store. I was warmly welcomed by the staff and they appreciated the diligent effort I was giving to reform the store appearance."
good,"- Flexible work schedule & Comfortable work environment."
good,I really enjoyed working at Macy's. I had an awesome manager and I gained knowledge on all the designers. Each day I recovered about 70 clothing departments with the help of my team. We were able to converse and listen to music. It was a great experience.
good,"I loved working at macys because it never got old. Other jobs you have to go in and do the same thing everyday all day. At macys I got the opportunity to work and learn in different departments. The other associates where fun to work with. We would sit there and think of little contest we could have to better our daily and hourly numbers. My manager would do anything he could to help us with any problems or concerns we had. he new I was having money problems and that I have three little boys so he worked me in any extra hrs he could get for me. And I greatly appreciated it,."
good,I love working at Macy's it has a great environment. I love that Macy's has a flexible work schedule system. My co workers are the best we all get along and work hard to make it a fun work environment.
good,"I worked in a commission department, it was a challenge that could be fun or difficult to meet the sales goals.  My co-workers were fun to be around."
good,"Typical Work Day:"
good,"I am really enjoying fine jewelry, you develop relationships with your customers. management loves their credits. The customers are in general very nice and the staff there makes you feel like family."
good,"Being able to teach new hires on their sales skills, and good mony to be make, on credit card enrollment, and commission."
good,"Retail is not an easy job. You deal with many different tasks in a short amount of time. As daunting as it may seem, retail truly provides an insight to the working world. I have gone from the sales floor to my own desk to demonstrate the more people-side of Macy's, the Bridal Registry department. Here I must make my phone calls, update my spreadsheets and regularly converse with my clientele to keep them in informed of our products."
good,Great place to learn and a good possibility for growth. Supportive co worker and encouraging managers. Hardest part of the job is cleaning up after a sale
good,I was hired as temporary/seasonal help so every day was different. I learned many different jobs at Macy's which I enjoyed very much.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I didnt get a chance to work here long because the mall closed down but for the most part i enjoyed this job and would recommend this job for anybody. The hours where good and so were the benefits. My co workers were very friendly and management looked out for you and made sure you were ok. I wish i had gotten to stay longer because i really enjoyed macys
good,"This is a highly reputable company that gave me the opportunity to get my foot-in-the-door, to see what working there was like. This was a very pleasant environment to work in."
good,Retail was not for me. The management was unorganized and I had scheduling issues.
good,Co worker was okay to work With it Depends On What Department You Work In  You get to Meet Alot Of Different People And Fast Paste Sometimes the Time Flys Right By
good,"I like when we're busy so that my day goes by quickly but when I have downtime it's good because I can recover my area and revamp any displays that might need it. My coworkers are great as are the managers, it's typically an enjoyable place to work. The best and worst part of the job are the customers but I do enjoy meeting people from all walks of life"
good,"you get paid weekly, you can do overtime, and its a good atmosphere around the employees."
good,"Macys merchandising group is a productive  workplace."
good,"Making your sales goal, putting clothes back, helping multiple customers."

good,"Responsibilities included going though reports of sales, stock levels, markdowns and open to buy. Analyzing data to make right choices of product mix for 10 locations."
good,I learned the ins and outs of the delivery and recover stages of the business and how essential it is to know the merchandise in the store. I had friendly co workers that were helpful and understanding. their was no hard part with the job once your there everything was easy in my opinion. I enjoyed getting the work down being around friendly people and not having so much pressure to finish the job everything was really relaxed.
good,"It is a fun place to be, You never have a dull moment. The people in this company are very friendly. Management could use a little work but overall very nice company."
good,"I have been working with Macy's Logistics on and off since 2003.  It is a great company to work for.  I started out as a simple warehouse associate and worked up to being the security investigator over time.  There is a lot of room for advancement.  They have an ""open door policy"" so any of your concerns will be heard and there will be no judgement passed against you."
good,"typical day is arriving at work and clocking in before you lose a half point for being late and setting in on recovery and customer assistance. I have learned how to handle irate customers and help those how need in depth product assistance. Management is good, but some treat you like you are replaceable and you are beneath them. co-workers are great, but some bring drama into to the work place and cause bad customer feedback. Hardest part of the job is trying to prevent customers from ripping off the company or stealing when the company always wants you to say yes. Most enjoyable part is the sincerely thankful customers that you help find what they need and get them out the door with a great deal."
good,Even though the job position I was assigned to was a sales associate in the mans department I worked in every department at least 5 times.I worked at the cash register while zoning the floors. I learned to manage myself since there was not a manager working beside me telling me what to do. My co-workers was always nice and helpful. I made friends along the way! Since meeting new people was the most enjoyable part of my day the hardest was the pain i felt in my cheeks from smiling.
good,"very great retail store to work at, the management is very attentive in all situations and very organized, great job because you can pick up hours during the week as you go."
good,"Great location, great people great managers great store team.  Loved it there and always enjoyed going to work, store was always really busy so it made it more fun and challenging.  Not much more to say other than really enjoyed it"

good,"I enjoyed working for this employer, and enjoyed having the work to do that I did. A typical day working for them would be an easy and quick paced job. I was constantly moving and doing many different duties. I learned to keep on my toes and keep up with the work that needed to be done, and that was easy to do with my great Manager. She made sure to clearly explain my tasks, and made sure to answer any questions that I had. I didn't get to know any of my co-workers, but the people all seemed very helpful. The hardest part of this job for me, was that I was pregnant working. Although it was only for a short time, I had a few difficulties. But the most enjoyable part was being able to work with the customers, answering questions and helping with whatever I could."
good,"A typical day consisted of checking people out after they found their items, and assisting customer with finding certain sections. It was very quiet, calm environment. I enjoyed my managers and co-workers we blended very well. The hardest part would have to be when the season was up and it was time for me to find something else where."
good,"I learned alot about retail, customer service and product demonstration.  I had good management who encouraged me to learn more.  Co-workers were a little competitive.  It was hard to make commission sales.  I enjoyed working in the cosmetic department."
good,This company is Great however the hours can be demanding. Staff is very nice and helpful.
good,I loved and enjoyed helping others and making my customers smile.  I worked as a team and solo from time to time.
good,Helped customers purchase fine Jewelry. Management was good just hated that I had to stay until 2am especially on the nights when we got those terrible snow storms and Macy's would stay open even when the mall was closing down early.

good,"I had enjoyed helping co workers with folding men's and ladies' clothes on sales floor every night at Macy.  I also attached with missing tags, and picking up all of them from the floor and hanging them up.  I organized them neatly.  I happily assisted customers with their questions.  I also helped them organizing shoes zones at stock room and helped to clean up on the floor for them.  I hardly reached shoes boxes up on the shelves and had to bring down.  I then put them into the right shoes locations."
good,I learned how to conduct interviews and how to schedule on call employees for a  busy retail dept store.
good,"Fun place to work, have a chance to learn a lot, in different areas. manager are not to hard. Employees are helping each other especially to a new hire."
good,A good company to work for with good benefits as well. A  typical day at work in the  security department is mostly boring and extremely routined unless a shoplifter is being detained.

good,make sure that the young men section was organized a and straight. Learned how much work retail store put inn to folding items. really didn't know management like that was good though for a basic review. co workers were very helpful wen I had to many people in my section  they would come over to help  the hardest part of the job was making sure that u made your sell number for the day the most enjoyable part of the job was competition with co workers

good,Enjoyed customer atmosphere. Team work is very important. The most enjoyable part of my job when  customer satisfied with my performance.
good,I really do love this company.  They have great morals and community involvement and give back which a lot of big companies don't put an emphasis on. Our store is great about calling out things associates did and recognizing them and really making them feel special. There are great co workers and we have a solid management at our store that is always willing to go to bat for associates and help them out. My only complaint is the wages. Since it is a retail business wages are very low abs not really enough to live off of. Other than that splendid company!

Supervisors would have your back if you were right and let you know if you were not. cant really ask for more than that. Pay was very competitive. Most of the management was very professional. Good training opportunities. If I would have been able to relocated to a larger market the opportunities for advancement would have been great."

good,"Good job. I was there for 10 years and I enjoy it, but  "

good,"	Assist in floor moves, merchandising, display maintenance, and housekeeping"
good,"Days were not too long for me. It was a great compliment to school and many of my coworkers were cordial and nice people.

Also my priority was to drive sales for Martha Stewart sales and keep a client contact book and update customers on new products and incoming items. Management was very pleasant and eager to promote if they see you are a hard worker and desire to grow. The management for Macy's Manhasset was very helpful and cared greatly about any concerns and problems in your department. Especially the manager of the store she personally walked around to each department to gather a detailed overview of department changes and concerns."

I worked in Coats/Dresses dept. I never knew how this job would impact my life. Most people think of shopping as a fun time and that it is. It's a little more than that when you help  someone find the perfect dress for a funeral when their grieving, for their engagement party when their anxious, for their prom when their excited.

good,I really loved this job though it was a 12 hour overnight shift.  I worked with amazing people and got to understand the nitty gritty of managing D2C orders for a Fortune 500 company.
good,good friendly environment to work in but not competitive salary benefits.
good,A typical day a Macy's is normally a good day. Always a better day when customers are satisfied and everything is running smoothly. I learned a lot when becoming an associate at Macy's. I learned how to channel my attitude even though I really want to scream when working with certain people and that the customer will always be right in maintaining a business. My co-workers are pretty friendly and we get along pretty well. The hardest part is trying to get new customers to open up star rewards accounts with us even after we tell them all the positive benefits about having the card. The most enjoyable part about working there is knowing you can make a customer so happy with the purchase of their transaction.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed working for macys, I learned how to open and close register, deposit money in the safe, become a key holder, a growing part of management and short leads. My coworkers were always so helpful and hands on with help."

good,"Working for Macy's was a great experience however this was just a seasonal job for me, I came out of college and I was looking for work and I utilized this job as a stepping stone until I found a better job opportunity. If the pay was better I probably would have stayed."
good,Work is straightforward and since it is commission based the more you put into it the more you get out of it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A Typical day at Macy's is you clock in, then you go to the section that your assigned to, clean the area and fold the clothes on the panles nice and neat. Assit customers, make sales goal, and get star rewards(Macys Credit Cards). Folding clothes correctly i didn't really know how to do until I got hired at Macy's. I know different silva-wear,blenders, covers, and just how to function in a different competitve atmosphere. Management was very helpful, very respcetful, they went through everything step by step.  The hardest part was just learning how to handle the customers when their flustered. Meeting new people, learning how to make sales, learning how to communicate with the customers and the co-workers."

good,"Customer Service, Cash Handling"
good,"A typical work day would include greeting customers, meeting daily goals, folding and restocking, answering all questions and concerns customer's have, finalizing purchases. Management was helpful most of the time then again the store I worked at the management depended on who was on that day. My co-workers were really friendly can talk to anyone and have a fun day. The hardest part of the job was meeting the daily goals and the loyalty sign up because for the daily goals they would be so high for a short amount of time and sometimes if you're in the negatives due to a return it makes it so much harder to meet. I know for me the one time I had a $800.00 goal for only 3 hours because my regular goal was $700.00 but because I was in the negatives made it about $800.00 Another thing about Macy's and the reason why I was let go was because I was in the hospital twice on a weekend which made me lose 2 points for each day which was 4 points all together and when I brought in doctor documents of where I was as well as the time I missed for a family reason they weren't accepted so due to me being absent without the documents being accepted I was out of a job."
good,"A typical day at work was spent cleaning and organizing department between assisting customers. Learned to be observant of customers to build rapport. Build own client with regular customers along with a professional business relationship. Coworkers became close to family. The hardest part of job was maintaining a clean area during holidays.

good,The work environment was great and a great way to progress if needed.
good,Nice team and workplace. Plenty of new technology and advancements to learn.
good,"I was always impressed with the training and development at Macy's.  Technology was pretty advanced and helped you do your job effectively.  They had high performance standards but supported their associates to get the job done.  I only left because I moved out-of-state, but would go back if a suitable position every became available to me."
good,An interesting place to work for those who enjoy the fashion industry and want to gain experience workng with the public.  Management allows employees to work all areas of the store to gain greater product knowledge.
good,It like any other job I punch in and head for work on the floor. I realize engaging with my co-worker and customer is a must. And management demand that the effort must be done. It is not the end of the world situation. Due to working along side of my co-workers to manage the floor.The hardest part of the job is when I work without a break due to someone did not show up for their shift. And the most enjoyable part of my job is when we shift from one area to the next on the floor.

good,"I love working for Macy's the culture and the environment is a joy to function in. You have some control in your scheduling and you have clear goals and standards to achieve. However, I feel the compensation is low for the type of company that Macy's is. Other thatn that it's a good place to work."

good,"busy everyday at the shoes department, management and co-workers were fun, the hardest part was that inventory people had to pick up every single shoes was on the floor all day long until your shift ended but since was so busy the day was going fast. This was an everyday thing, but it was enjoyable when i was the first one to see the newest stuff every morning."
good,my review would be a 8 out 10... there was a lot of things i liked about macy's including your own personal sales area... you were responsible for cleaning and organizing that area.
good,"I was only a Seasonal employee so, as expected, the job was a bit hectic. However, if all you want is a part-time position through the holidays, this is not a bad job at all. I got along with my co-workers really well and had fun working with them. Management worked with us to get the job done and praised us for our good efforts. You have to be ready to be thrown into any department at any time, but if you like change this won't be a problem."

My co-workers were nice but compeitive due to meeting  or exceeding quotas, the hardest part of the job were closing a customer without a purchase, the most enjoyable part of the job were arranging the displayes and my department being recongnized for high volume sales."
good,There is nothing quite like working at the world's largest store. It's a great place to work with lots of great benefits and an awesome culture of recognition.
good,"During the sales seasons or holiday seasons, there tend to be a lot of customers on a daily basis and a lot of these customers come from all sorts of backgrounds.  During the holidays there would be customers coming in from different countries and that always brings diversity to the workplace. Sometimes there would be unexpected challenges for example, misplaced inventory or getting short-staffed. But I like the challenges and the diversity, it keeps me motivated and the challenges help me improve not just as an employee but as a person as well. Management is definitely visible, and managers are helpful and understanding which I feel is important for a workplace. The teamwork here is very collaborative, most of the staff here are friendly and helpful to each other which ultimately is beneficial in attaining the main goals."
good,"I would arrive early in the morning to begin tidying up the men's clothing area from the previous evening's shopper's perusal.  At that time, I would either be given new merchandise to distribute out onto the floor, or simply straighten what was already on the floor."

good,I was in all departments. I also choose my own hours. So it worked around my schedule.
good,I enjoyed helping and providing outstanding customer service to the ladies who I sold shoes to.
good,"It is a pleasure to work at Macy's. Most of the customers are pleasant and thankful for your assistance and the management is extremely supportive and understanding of your needs as an employee. I have learned to better handle confrontation with people when they are not happy with the product or your service and have learned to better meet the needs of customers. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is unhappy that a product they want is not available and explaining that to them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a product is seemingly not available, but your co-workers help you out and find it to give the customer. The customer is usually very excited when this happens."
good,This was my first job and I learned a lot pertaining to having a job and dealing with people. Learned a lot about sales and customer service. My colleagues were very helpful and nice as well.
good,"Macy's is great at setting up a schedule for a person going to school. You can easy work part time and go to school full time. Plus, with the new scheduling system it is relatively easy to get shifts covered and swap shifts with fellow associates. In a normal day, as a sales associate, you assist customers, put away merchandise, recover the floor and work alongside fellow associates. However, coverage on the floor often is very poor, with only a single person expected to man an entire department alone. the credit and sales goals can be absurd and the scorecard system is not effective in encouraging sales and credit. an associate can't control the influx of customers or their needs. often, the control of go backs and recovery is less important to managers than credit and sales despite the fact that without those tasks being completed customers would be unable to shop. some coworkers don't pull their weight and if a coworker is unfamiliar with the department, not much they can do except ring. Overall, its a great place to work but there are some drawbacks."
good,"Macy's was a great working experience. They treat their employees extremely well and lets them know how much they are appreciated."
good,"I liked working at Macy's,the people were fun to be around and to work with and the managers were always helpful."
good,"A typical day at work consists of mainly merchandising, and making the store look beautiful and presentable before store opening. Management was always Professional and helpful. Most co-workers were helpful and there was always great team-work when it came to merchandising the store. The most difficult part of the job was making sure all RTV's and transfers were processed by the deadline, especially when it was the end of season and there were several of them to be processed by the same date. Also, it was a challenge to make sure merchandising standards were up to standard and set by directive each morning, but it was always an exciting challenge. It was fun to see new merchandise and be a part of setting new trends."
good,Typical day covered anything from technician reports to setting up returns and deliveries of furniture and bedding to customers of Macy's and Bloomingdales. Learned to be able to multi-task and switch gears....your customer's may be those of the store or internal like the technicians. Company was involved in giving back to the community. Encourage employees to volunteer by giving time off to do so.
good,"A typical day is assisting customers with their purchases.  Straightening merchandise. You must look professional and always be friendly and helpful. I really appreciate most of my coworkers and the managers are friendly and helpful. The most difficult aspect of the job is long hours standing on your feet on a hard floor.  Also, we are given sales goals each day and if the store isn't busy, you will probably not meet your sales goal."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "

good,great people to work for best retail people I've worked for.

good,"Each shift  starts with a run of numbers from the day before, the month, the fiscal year and calender year.  Breaking my buisiness down to the hour each day is the key to making my numbers. Estee Lauder has taught me to run my own buisiness and to produce buisiness even when buisiness is slow!   My coworkers are as passionate about the business as I am.  They turned to me for coaching and guidance each day.  This resulted in good teamwork and profitable gain.  My interaction and product guidence with each customer was truely enjoyable whether it made a loyal customer or set the day for a one timer.  "
good,"I do like to work for Macy's. It's a great company heading in the right direction to take care of their employees. The Admin Support Team (AST) is one of the most stressful jobs Macy's has. We are not only responsible for any customer that walks into our office, but we also manage any employee  that comes in. This includes any manager as well as Sr Managers like the VPSM and ASM. We do everything from supply ordering, payroll, problem solving, schedule changes, cash office, faxing, copying, pulling reports, scheduling interviews, pulling interviews and sometimes conducting interviews. Just to mention a few things. Hardest part of my job is making sure my store manager knows that I am not just her admin assistant, but there is more to my job than just pulling her reports. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to fix problems for customers and working with my team. They defiantly keep me going."
good,"I learned how to audit the inventory, also to build relationships with customer and how to better serve customers needs."
good,For the most part the job was good. A typical work day was just coming in sitting at your desk and taking phone calls all day. It got stressfull at times but thats only people of customers screaming at you. Overall it was a good work environment and i would say 95% of the people that worked there were nice.
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customers with their online orders. I learned how to put myself in the customers shoes. I got along with all the managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when a customer wouldn't get their merchandise they ordered. The most enjoyable part was talking to people from all over the world.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"There are no typical days at Macys. Everyday is special because there is always something on the calendar. It could be a gift with purchase (GWP) in the Cosmetics department at the makeup counters or the Red Dress Campaign to raise awareness for women's heart health issues. Whatever the case may be, it will always be an exciting ride."
good,"I love going to work because I get to meet all sorts of different people. I really like talking to customers and I really appreciate it when they share a story from their own lives.

There when you need them but not hovering over you at all times. All of the co workers are energetic and friendly. Employees work together as a team. The harderst part of the job is trying to make sure that you can satisfy all customers at all times even when they are very upset and disconcerted.

good,Macy's was my first retail job ever. I was originally hired for just holiday help but I managed to make a lasting impression on the management and obtained a job after the holidays. I learned how efficently ask open ended questions to assist customers. My co-workers were very patient when it came to me learning the register software and I quickly felt included into the workplace. The management was always fast to respond and deal with trouble-causing customers when the time arised. I would say the hardest part of the job was the daily sales goals that we were reqired to meet. Towards the end of the month anxiety would rise due to lack of sales in certian departments. The part of working at Macy's that I enjoyed the most was that I made some new life-long friends only working there two years.
good,"a typical days at macys is some what busy. when i first started working i learned how the POS system works. how they organized clothes by size/color and brand. i got close with alot of my co workers. the manager of the juniors was not my assigned manager but she helped me out the most and gave me as much hours as i could get. the hardest part about working at macys is some of the customers , but working there you learn to deal with impatient rude customers without taking it personal. the most enjoyable part was getting to know alot people mostly my co workers and the daily/weekly/monthly customers."

The promotion came along with a transfer to another Macy's store that seen more shop lifting activity and was in need of some help. The management was great. Loss prevention supervisors kindly allowed for me to have a hand in building my security team. Together,we cut down the numbers (Shortage) by monitoring shoplifters,making apprehensions and working closely with the local police department. Some called my job dangerous. I think it was my competitive nature that kept me motivated to best detective that Macy's has ever seen. I was sad to go depart from such a wonderful staff/team that I helped build and lead."

I was in charge of completeing all markdowns, RTVs, floor moves, processing new stock and making sure it gets to the floor in a timely manner. Also creating a visually appealing floor to increase sales. The most difficult part of the job is that there isnt enough time in the day to complete all tasks.

I have learned that customers want help, but they also want a genuine person that will listen and that is knowledgable about the products that we sell. Ultimately, our attitude can make it a pleasureable experience as well as make our customers feel welcomed. We have great managers that constantly update us on storewide events and provide training for areas of performance that need improvement. When everyone work together as a team we are able to reach our daily goals and help new employees with locating our products and assisting with all transactions. I enjoy helping as well as interacting with people."
good,love this job and would refer it to a friend. I also loved working around christmas.
good,"Macys Inc. Was a very relaxed, professional environment to work in, up-beat and motivating. It taught me the fundimentals of team-work on the job, and the foundation of my sales and customer service skills."
good,"I had the best co-workers we worked together as a team and got work done on time and very neatly. I learned a lot doing recovery at Macys, cleaning fitting rooms and making sure the clothes are put back on the right floor, and keeping the racks straightened and display table neat for the customers was a challenged but we did what had to do for the company and for us to get a pay check."
good,nice job good pay just alot of customer come in on the sales day but its a fun job.
good,"Overall Macy's was a great place to work, but the fact that if your scorecard number is too low your job is in jeopardy. Some management likes to base that off of your work ethic which i believe is unfair."
good,I ran the camers and performed internal investigations on employees. I enjoyed this job.
good,I really enjoyed working at Macy's in the Mattress department. Every day so different and exciting.
good,"Gets very busy, learn to deal with every kind of customer concern/problem with in a week! Management is understanding, though attendance policy is set in stone and rarely lenient. You just have to remember the bad experiences end up balancing out with the good!"
good,"Enjoyed the atmosphere and most of the staff. Great training process, easy to adapt to."
good,Macy's is a cool place to work for. Everyone is friendly and down to earth. The manager I worked under was good to work for but she had communication issues.
good,"Enjoyed my time here. The managers and supervisors were very understanding yet still acted as authority figures. I learned a lot of communication skills working here. Ages of my customers ranged from preteens to the elderly so I also improved my patience. The weekends could be intense, especially if there was a big sale, but I find that I work better under pressure."
good,Retail is another good entry job.
good,A typical day at work I dealt with with with customers and managing the cash register. The job it self was pretty interesting and fun. I worked in different departments and gained the learning experience becoming a sales agent.

good,"It is a nice side job, the only down side is, the pay is minimum wage."
good,"I only worked there for a month but I wished I would of worked there longer. Excellent working environment, every employee was nice and friendly. However at times it would be difficult to get in touch with management when needed. Other than that, this company was great!"

good,"This company is not just gliss and glamour, It have became an everyday store to shop!"

good,"I wish not to review about position at Macy's, But Need more pay for what we have to do as associates"
good,"Macy's was my first actual job in retail, I was a bit nervous but previous employee's helped me to make my time working there enjoyable. I learned a lot and I believe that the skills I have learned such as proper and efficient sales tactics, and effective customer service will help me in future endeavors."
good,"I worked as customer Service/Cashier. I had to help customers around the store, met a lot of people. That's one of the reasons i love about Retail is that getting to meet new people. I cleaned out dressing rooms, Reorganized the pant shelves."
good,Macy's Credit has a great atmosphere for employees. Employees have opportunities for advancement within the company within the first year of employment. They also have a great attitude of giving back to the community. Also a great diverse atmosphere.
good,Working for Macys Inc. has been a wonderful experience in my career. I was able to expand my customer service skills and acquire professional growth in Human Resources and Staffing departments.
good,Macys was a great place to work. My team was fun and we had a blast. on the other hand some of the managers could have been more supportive to their teams. A compliment goes a long way. The main director was a very nice lady a real team leader. I learned a lot about customer handling and to be patient with customers.
good,Was hired for Holiday temp work. The employees and management were fun to work with.
good,"Easy enough just walk around and pick me up clothes and stuff I lol."
good,It’s not for someone that has bills to pay they don’t even give you $10 besides that high turn over rate which is sad no clear path to success in management like working your way up they don’t care if it’s stagnant and unfair pay. As a big company like it it could do lote to take care of their employees those on the front lines it made me sad to leave my I have children to feed and clothe.
good,"Enjoy customer service and helping guests find what they are looking for. Managers always helpful and nice. I learned a lot about the different departments as I worked in Home, accessories and womens and clothing."

good,For the most part you will enjoy the experience.The employees are friendly and supportive . The only thing i am not a fan of is the scheduling . But other then that it is a good organization to be apart of
good,Workplace has diversity and culture is great. There is provided opportunity for everyone. Work life balance is decent however compensation is on lower end.
good,Good company that's fast paced and high volume of work. Good for someone who can consistently keep moving and get the job done right the first time. Must be able to lift at least 30+ pounds
good,The company is overall a great company to work for they do offer job placement for those seeking to move up in the company. They also pride themselves in giving great customer service to all customers. They value all their employees have
good,The company has gone through some extreme transformation and will continue to do so until it finds a balance that works in the best interest of its stakeholders. Working at Macy's has been very rewarding from the start til the end. The management has been fantastic and I have enjoyed the culture which is very inclusive. The hardest part of the job is obviously balancing work life. A leader in retail Macy's is a competitive work environment and working on holidays comes as part of the job. The most rewarding has been all the learning opportunities I've had during my long career. I was able to not only get experience in many different fields but also be supported to reach my education goals. Macy's is a great place to work
good,There was a mass variety of customers and I enjoyed getting to meet all the different types of personalities. Also my coworkers and I built strong work relationships which made coming into work enjoyable.

good,"Macy's is a wonderful place to work, I am enjoying the experience and living the magic of this company, a great place to work, I highly recommend this company"
good,"My review of this company - "
good,I loved my job. I was a Merchandiser in jewelry and cosmetics and worked early morning before the store even opened and was usually done by 2or 3 pm. I worked at my own pace as long as my assigned work was completed in the time allotted.
good,Nice to work there employees are friendly seem to try and help each other out and that is nice management is kind and try to help you when they can most customers are also friendly so over all ok place to work
good,I was happy to work in a diversified setting and come into contact with a wide variety of customers with different ethnic backgrounds. I learned a lot about the priorities of keeping the customer satisfied with assisting them in their purchases.
good,A normal day at macys wasn't bad I mostly did my work and went straight home I barely talk to people at work  but I managed to get my work done but I had to keep my legs moving I couldn't just stand in one spot
good,"worked there for about five years. most of my day was spent doing cashier experience. had to return clothes."
good,Workplace to interact with other people. Work that requires details and a lot of attention on the part of the workers towards the clients. Corporate structure.
good,I have not been with the company for 5 yrs. While there it was very diverse and I met a lot of different types of employees that are great people. It is good place to work.
good,"Macy’s is a nice place to work. Personally, the location was very inconvenient. My role was okay, sometimes I was left alone and I never really knew how some things worked. Other than that, it was pretty cool. I’m very appreciative of the opportunity to work there."
good,The interview experience was quite awesome. The only issue I have is with the management and the colleagues I work with. The management at Macy’s is very detached from their associates instead of being involved and caring.
good,Your paid above minimum wage but it could still be a little more. Everyone is really nice. It’s easy to pick up or get rid of shifts. The managers are really good at working with your schedule.
good,When I arrived at work it was a sense of fulfillment. I could accomplish alot as a team player. I liked recovery it was easy just making sure the garments was neat.
good,Great work place environment. Staff is well trained and the environment is very comfortable. They are also very flexible with your work schedule so this is a great part time job!
good,"The work place culture is very good here. Management will work around your schedule if you give them advance warning. The added stress is coming from the reconstruction that happens every year. Departments change, associate numbers change from full time and part time people allowed in the area. There are more and more tasks being added to the sales associates. This causes unwanted stress and frustration especially to the associates who take pride in their work."
good,"They help you  with issues , and understood you as an individual...I was able to manage my time ..and help out my sister...MS (sick and cant do the things she love doing needs full attention. )."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My typical day is opening the register in the Morning, then we have our Morning Short meeting with the Manager and Team to discuss if we have any special events, Big Sales etc. Management are fairly good.  My co-workers are Nice and easy to get along with.  We always try to work as a team.  The Hardest part of my job is some customer can be picky and rude. I enjoy helping customers."
good,"I've worked with Macy's, going on 8 years. I have had my personal qualms, here and there, but overall it's a good place to work. My boss supports me, I get work done and I don't have to take it home with me."
good,"No matter what department you are put it, you are going to have to work fast in order to get numbers high. Pay attention to the packages you pack, prep, return, and scan. A lot of the people there are helpful and welcoming. Don't be afraid to ask questions!"
good,"The staff is very friendly and professional. Each week, workers unloaded and sorted merchandise from a delivery truck. On other days display signs needed to be changed, and price tags needed to be checked."
good,Teaches you new things learn how to do things u never thought u could do meet new people. Grow bonds with custmores. Mangers are very polite and understanding. Great training. Organized  and fresh friendly learning environment

good,Great place to start of your carrier. Work environment is safe. Everyone's very friendly and make working with each other more interesting. Paid is reasonable.
good,"I love Macy’s and the customers are great! The only problem is getting the full training you need & getting help, from other employees. I’ve had lines of 12 people, am alone, working my department, & no matter who you call to help, they are put out. Thats what we are there for, & it’s a great company! The customers are actually the great part! When they hear you trying to get extra help for them and it just doesn’t come, they are so kind , complimentary and really don’t get angry with you. I like my job just wish I had more support."
good,"Daily sales is cause for us to change the signage daily, discount, sale price changes New product signage and pricing. Numerous sales (BOGO, new charge customer discounts, etc.)"
good,Macy's allows you to have a large degree of control over your schedule. The focus on customer happiness was what I liked about working there. The hardest part of the job was keeping the floor recovered during the holiday season.
good,The environment at the Almeda Macy's Houston Texas was exceptionally fantastic. I regret my decision for leaving for another company. that atmosphere and fellow employees were so fantastic and supportive that I still continue to have contact with them to this day.
good,In the being managers are nice and friendly but now they are extremely rude and always in a bad  attitude. Also other associates that work there are extremely rude and not helpful
good,I got comfortable with the staff and the employees and everything was fun everything ran smooth even the shippers was a handful we joked and laughed so hard I actually kind of miss it
good,I would recommend anyone needing a job to apply at Macy's. I drove a cherry picker and it was a lot of fun. I was a put away driver. I had the most units put away on as nightly basis. I enjoyed working at macys.
good,The thing I liked most about working at Macy’s was the fact that the give back to the community. The real make a point to be inclusive as well. I was very happy.
good,"Macy's sales associates primarily assist customers. Key responsibilities include greeting patrons, providing product knowledge, directing customers to fitting rooms, and completing transactions on the cash register."
good,"I love the job being able to independent is a good thing. You meet new people and you learn more and more each day. And the supervisor, and trainer are nice people. I love the way the try to keep you busy."
good,Great experience meet new people relaxing respectful good people great work different opportunities overall great working experience great greeters filled with happiness and respect
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's. I wanted to start off in the shoe department and eventually head to the perfume makeup counter but the job was temporary. I would like a permanent position.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,we got our job done even though the team i was with loved to gang up on the manager i didnt want to come back after all that drama.i was first doing support which was good we dealt with merchandise
good,"My job required working on the register and putting product on the floor, also assisting customers on the  floor .The atmosphere was pleasant but, at times stressful. We   had a reasonable lunch room and had consistent breaks and lunch breaks.  Most of the time I was happy there. I   did feel pressure to obtain new credit  card customers. Maybe this is a common  business practice. I believe they try to treat their employees fairly."
good,It was a fast paced and well organized company they were very helpful and driven to get the orders done and do the job safe as possible and don't steal anything.
good,"I worked in the Asset-Protection department which was very fun minus two things; there was an individual there with serious anger issue that management was aware of and refused to do anything about. While everyone was willing to team up for projects, individual assignments and training were very isolated and counterproductive."
good,"There was a lot of traffic during the holidays, very fast paced. During slow times, a lot of attention to detail. I was able to work in multiple departments and gain experience."
good,"It is a company with an excellent environment, the work areas are always safe, its benefits are very good and the salary is very competitive, and its schedules are flexible"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy’s, unfortunately it didn’t work out because I’m still in school and it got to be too much, especially being a first year college student trying to balance everything still. However, I would definitely go back."
good,A typical day would be clock in change and have a meeting in the morning.  After the meeting we would start our day and go to our stations that we would be placed at by the manager. The work place all depends on the store and the workers . When I first started working it was like a division between new and old people . The hardest part of the job and dealing with a angry customer. The most enjoyable thing about my job working as a cashier .
good,"When I started working at Macy’s, it turned out pretty good for the first time, but later on it turned out to be very stressful to me. I’m already in college and my job is more fast-paced than that. I did made new friends who are managers, co-workers, and even the customers. That was the only thing I like about my job, but other than that I think it’s a good place to start with job experience."
good,"Enjoyed the jewelry team"
good,"I would arrive at work, login in on the computer. I would assist the customers with their choices and check them out at the register. he management team would stop by n the middle of my shift to sometimes give new direction. I would finish my day with restocking products and log out of the computer."
good,A typical day at work is ringing up customers. My only complaint is the store gets trashed and the recovery is very taxing. The staff are very supportive of each other.  Flexible schedules with employee self advertising.
good,Enjoyed my years with Macys. Sad the Business is No Longer in my City. Learned alot working ther for close to 15 years. And hope to carry my experience on to New Companies
good,"- Friendly, helpful people"
good,"I enjoyed working for Macys. I left because I didn’t have enough time to study full time and take care of my children, but I would recommend Macys as a good company."
good,"They are great team work and very respectful ! I had so much fun with co-workers and seemly professional , very intelligence and remarkable.  I don't know how to describe what they had done so far but EXCELLENT !"
good,I worked at macy's during the holiday season. It was an easy job and it was fun to do as well. I was able to make my own schedule so that itself was a perk.
good,I really enjoyed working there. Great managers. Just to bad so many stores shut down. Is a great place to start off if you have not worked in a while.
good,I can't say much since it was a flex job but it is a very good first time job. Pays good and work with the schedule you provide them with time wise and you get discounts.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is a great place to work. Managers are supportive in the work of the associates. There is enough workload to keep one busy and most of the time customers are great with. Being a full time employee, there is full time hours, so it is worth coming to work. And benefits are nice with Associate discounts, Paid time off (PTO), 401k, health benefits (.optional). Not a bad package overall."
good,I had a great time working with a fun bunch! There is always something going on and I made a lot of friends there that I miss.................................................
good,Only worked there for a holiday position but in that time I met two great managers who were both my first and left a very positive impression on me for being my first job. They no longer work there and have been moved to different stores but I only hope that any new management in there is just as pleasant.
good,A typical day at work in Macy's was to punch in thru cashier screen and help customer's that wanted to check out. Also putting away a lot of clothes that customer's would leave in dressing rooms.

good,Busy days but manageable. Learned to  Helped customers achieve satisfaction with questions and solve the problem. I enjoyed all the experience and benefits from working different departments.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much but do to personnel issues, I chose to resign and start my own company. My day begins at 6:00 a.m in the morning. I was responsible for a team of 40 -50 employees. On a daily basis my team set sales, loaded and unloaded shipment, or processed merchandise. Also in charge of markdowns, RTV's shipment. My role was producing daily paperwork setting schedules."
good,"the environment at macy's is great. its a great place to work at for flex, part time and they help achieve your goals at macy's to get to full time job."
good,Good for seasonal job. Pay is okay. Manager where I was at wasnt very good. Very rude unless you kissed her behind along with her sidekick. Otherwise a pretty laod back environment as long as you do your job.
good,"I will come in go to my are of work, fix anything that needed to be fix, I also did stock and the register. I also helped customers locate items and sizes ."
good,"I am someone who works on the flexible work team, I am able to freely pick up shifts at any time on any day. Attendance is strictly set, showing up too early or working over time can get you in trouble. As an employee you receive some great discounts, some paid medical(optional), and transportation. You must be able to gain credits for the store. Fun place to work, many employees are fun outgoing people who are easy to work with"
good,"Work life balance, Room for growth, strong brand/product/business."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I would have Saying the most enjoyable part of the job was the staff and how they acknowledged you and appreciated you and change fun things for the staff
good,"Constantly busy at the children's department not only as a cashier, but organizing inventory stocks. I learned how a clothing has to be organized. A lot variety of people to know their background culture. Hardest part was to compete against coworkers on opening credit cards. I didn't enjoy much being in Macys except for pay."
good,"I mostly walked around putting clothes where they need to go and help with any customer service needed, I worked the cashier for any customer who needed my service."
good,"They taught me a lot about working in a professional environment. It took a little while to get used to the schedule and the scenery, but overall I really did enjoy working there."
good,Eenjoyed working there would return and recommend to anyone looking for employment. I enjoyed being a Flex worked when I wanted to and if there wasn't hours management would give me my hours.
good,Went back into retail and stayed with macys for 5 years until having to relocate for my husbands heart surgery..truely enjoyed my postion and all fellow associates ..
good,"The environment is upbeat with positive team mates and realistic expectations. Everyone was helpful and encouraging as far as training goes. There was always an employee party, discount, or something to look forward to at some point."
good,"I learned to keep busy at all times. If there wasn't much work, it would come in as a heavy load soon. My hands had to work very fast in order to meet my personal quota."
good,A typical work day at Macy's started with arranging clothes and making sure everything is neat before store opening. A quick meeting with department manager. It is important to be attentive to customer's needs. Approach them and see if they need help or have questions. Ring them up on the register. Throughout the day make sure the department is neat and clean.
good,management can be better. Super high sales goal. Customers were great.                                        Hours were flexible. Did not really work with school.
good,I love working for the company. I have experience in 3 different departments. Macy's encourages growth. Started as Dock then went up to security/asset protection aka loss prevention. Ended wit painter carpenter position and if i were to return
good,I enjoyed my time working for Macy’s. I loved the environment and my co workers. I worked there during the holidays and I loved how they would decorate the store and the new features items that would come in
good,Did not train properly and breaks are too short for the amount of hours you work. The people you work with don't talk to you to let you know what's right from wrong until you do something wrong
good,"It’s a really good environment place to work at I really enjoyed my time working here, my only issue was the working hours, but other than that everybody is wonderful"
good,"They do not believe in giving people a second chance.  Good enough to work while waiting for the back ground, but fired as soon as it comes back..."
good,I love working there upset that I had a personal problem and was let go but I completely understand I just wish I had another chance but it’s a great job to work for
good,Productive and fun work place .friendly staff and good service. Good management and good work place. Good perks and discounts. Flexible working hours.
good,"HR's Corporate Location is a pretty good place to work, the training was very lazy, however the learning experience you get from taking calls helps you get accustomed to the systems very fast. The location is very convenient and the office is fully up to date and modern. The wages suck. I made less than 15.00 an hour and the work should of started at 17.00 to compensate for how nasty the associates spoke to the HR call center representatives. Also, they frowned upon going above and beyond in the call center, every department in the build worked as an individual unit. There was no uniformity at all. Communication was horrible among all departments and the timeline to process employee request was horrible. They did not like for associates to reach out to other departments to assist the employees with their questions. I tried reaching out via our internal Skype messenger because and associate was trying for two weeks to reach her workers comp Representative and when I emailed the lady who was available, she emailed my manager to say she does not want to reach out to her and she will get back with the associate on her own time. It was very unprofessional and the associate really needed help. Unfortunately, I was told not reach out to other departments if the associates cannot get in contact with there representatives, however, I thought we were hired to help and we clearly were not. That associate went another two weeks before they heard anything. I felt so bad that we could not speak to other departments and the whole process to contact other departments was so stone age and impractical,"
good,"Some sellers are completely arrogant, they don’t ask the buyer if someone already helps them, they don’t help the clients themselves, but when they see that someone already comes with the things in their hands they pick up the customers and run to the checkout. The store is not in a healthy atmosphere, sellers constantly quarrel with each other. Managers cannot stop or settle this."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Quick paced environment, Make sure you have good hearing skills because they can be strict. Do the best you can, and if your teammates ask if you need anything don't be afraid to say ""yes""."
good,"Macy's is great to work for to gain experience in retail. I worked mostly part-time, some of the workers are great, but management could have been better. Dress code is great and Atmosphere is great. I'm glad that schedules are flexible and how scheduling worked. I enjoyed experiencing other departments besides working in my base department."
good,Macys is an excellent place to work the coworkers are Really nice and able to help you all the time. The customer are very friendly and the manager are mice’s and make you feel like family.
good,Fixing missing unit product code items. Keeping up with the amount of put away coming Get all the orders out the door on time to be able to get to where it needs to go. I have fun putting away returns.
good,Macy's was a fun and new experienced career opportunity for me to learn about. It was a short term position but around the time I was there everyone was very friendly and the work was stable always.
good,"Really enjoyed being here it was a good hard working environment, I enjoyed that their was a lot of help people to help with directions on where to go."
good,"Macys was a wonderful place to work, and I worked there for a year. Co workers were friendly, and the environment was welcoming. The hours were flexible, and I was able to balance school and work. They were very accommodating, and I would work for them again."
good,"over all a good experience for retail. I enjoyed the hours, the people I worked with and especially the discounts I used to have.

The best part of the job was being able to help people and see them leave the store with smiling faces and to assist my fellow peers to feel confident when dealing with customer matters.

good,"If you stay past the holiday season they'll keep you as a part-time. The train you in different fields which I liked and honestly it was a great first job. The only issues I had were the pay, the management could have used some organization, and the company did not appreciate their merchandisers as much as their sales people. The merchandisers do a lot of the work and the work days go by pretty fast. Most of my time was in the early mornings and ended before 2. 20% discounts were a plus, and you get first dibs on clearance stuff! Definitely a good job for a college kid looking for some extra cash but dont expect it to be a career."
good,"Team huddle to discuss priorities for the day and any challenges that prevent completion of tasks prior to store opening. Unloading the truck of new merchandise, prepare for placement on the sales floor.Set current sales event and review business from the day prior. Strategize on slow trending businesses."

What I did enjoy working at Macy's was being able to help people, make all the customers feel welcomed and being able to see them leave with a smile on their face."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work, nice workplace culture and the hours are pretty decent. There is a lot of teamwork going on, and everything is extremely business centric, to the point where all the creativity is lost. Also, could get really stressful. But you learn a lot about business, marketing and project management."

Management was run near perfect and I enjoyed the company of many of my co-workers."
good,The audit department is full of good and qualified professionals.  This is where I enjoyed the most.  There's a lot of travel but it was fun.  My bosses in the audit department were very supportive and encouraging.

good,"As I was a seasonal associate during all 2 months that I worked there I was too busy. Most of the time I was with the customers helping them or organizing the store, so I couldn’t have enough time to get know about that workplace culture, but it was very fun for me to work there, especially when I did fulfillment."
good,"Macy’s is definitely a great start for beginners who look to grow from within. Very caring company with great leaders. Pay depends on how well you perform overall within the year which isn’t so great. Other than that very fun, lots of events."
good,"I enjoyed working for Macy's for the holiday's.  It was a fun job except when we didn't have enough help during the really busy days. I do enjoy a fast pace though.  It makes the time go quickly.  I found a few things they could do differently that would make a seasonal workers job easier.  And that would be the key situation.  They were unmarked and they only had one set of keys for watches and one set for fashion jewelry.  On those busy days, it was a nightmare with those keys.  There is a a better way, first they need to number the keys to save time, and second, make a couple extra sets of keys.  Other than that, I enjoyed the customer interaction immensely and would love to do it again."

good,"A typical work day consists of bringing out christmas decorations from storage and setting it up around the store. "
good,Working at Macy's taught me a lot about coming together as a team and getting the job done together rather than doing it alone and not getting the best result in the end.

good,"it was very good work place, everyone was hardworking, a lot of communication, very organized, great management, always appreciating the associates in many ways."

good,"Great place to work if you are not worried about a lot of money.  The pay was not great for that type of work, but maybe it's different now.  I would recommend this to anyone who already has a full time job, and is looking to make additional income and someone who loves to shop and would enjoy getting discounts of their favorite items..."

My counter manager is well informed and even though I have years of experience, I learn something new daily and she pushes me out of my comfort zone and that has given me real growth. Growth in business and personally.  My Department Manager is very understanding and is very fair.  The culture is nice and I like engaging with customers and teaching proper etiquette on skin care and color cosmetics."

good,Great place to work as the culture is awesome and management understands people. The pay is low but the culture is great. The associates really enjoy their schedules and the overtime that is available to them.
good,One manager in particular was a bully. Abused her authority over employees. Other then that overall great store to work and shop at. Other store managers were a blessing to work for. I wouldn't mind going back but in a different department.

good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys was good to work for, but I didn't find that it pushed me. They ask a lot of their employees to just pay them the minimum wage in that state, and I think implementing some sort of commission reward system would be beneficial"
good,"I loved working at the position i was in, doing stock and the quite time i had. I would recommend someone to work there and gain the experience and know more about the store."
good,"Took calls and educated customers on different products from indoor/outdoor furniture to mattresses. I learned a great deal about furniture, jewelry and mattresses. The work environment was great. The managers were always helpful and willing to go the extra mile to make sure you felt comfortable moving forward. The hardest part of the position I think was being able to keep track of all the new items being sold, retaining the knowledge of so many items and educating customers on those products. The people of Macy's made the job enjoyable and their willingness to help when you had a questions."
good,Good job but a lot of work and not enough money .need to be more people on the floor help cleaning you can help the customer more just more people on the floor period
good,"Each department has its contribution to the process. I have learned that you need all parts of the process to give the best customer experience possible. The hardest part of my job would be standing or walking for 12 continuous hours without any sitting, minus breaks, and a short lunch.

good,"A typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. The days that I spent in other departments were usually right after large shipments, where my manager would need help getting as much merchandise to the sales floor as possible. The projects at the front were typically displays that I would be organizing or new promotional items that I would be putting up in place of old ones."

Working with the customers and vendors was fun and I learned so much about customer service, sales, and the cosmetics industry."

good,"amwork as the center of the operation. A typical day is like a relay race. We start off with the upmost sense of urgency so when the next team comes in, they can take off with a head start. I am continuing to learn that accountability is a big part of molding great employees. The hardest part of the job is staying ahead in the face of unforeseen circumstances, yet the most enjoyable part is conquering on those days."
good,Been w/Macys about 6 years & I like it very much. I look fwd to coming into work every day & I am happy in the dept I am assigned to. The hrs pass quickly since I stay pretty busy at a high volume location in the metroplex.

good,The work I did I enjoyed because I got to see all new products and clothing before anyone else. I helped dress the mannequins and restock the tables and rods with new clothes.
good,"A typical day at work was like it was busy and you would help out customer's no matter what. The store stayed busy, we had a lot of customer's shopping on the holidays. It was like a rat race at work. You're feet hurt because you will be on you're feet all day. You can get off you're feet during your breaks either an hour or 30 minutes. I have learned that you have to be quick with things and pick up things fast. You have to learn where everything is in the store in order to put it back in the right place. You have to learn all the functions of the cash register and the price checker. Everything is kind of hard to manage there because their is so many clothes to handle, and the managers are really helpful if you have a question. There is no tolerance for discrimmination and our work places accepts all different cultures. The hardest part of the job is when you are on you're feet and they heart. Also checking out when people are frustrated because you are trying to do a task and forget how to. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you interact with customer's and help them find what they are looking for. Also when the customer's are happy and are thankful for you."

good,I worked as a support associate coming together with other team members Unpackaging and organizing merchandise throughout department store it was a like working with a family always helping one another .
good,"Don't get me wrong Macy's is a great place to work at, but its not something I would recommend staying at. Every job has their issues but from my 3yrs of working there I have learned that Macy's has a lot. Most associates hate their job and the incompetent managers make it even more difficult. The good thing about Macy's though is that everyone is like family and everyone knows everyone. If you want to move up they will do anything in their power to help you, as long as you show that you are determined and persistent. So even though it has some serious issues it is the best first job or an amazing stepping stool to something greater."

good,"Usually my work day involves helping customers, fulfilling their demands, and creating a positive working environment for fellow coworkers, as well as a positive shopping environment for the customers. Since you interact with a lot of people throughout the day it's very easy to build social intelligence. The hardest part of the job is probably the most enjoyable part of the job; trying to meet your sales goals, as well as surpassing them."
good,"Great culture at Macy's, met some of my best friends while working here. Executive Development Program is highly respected and provides an amazing training experience to understand buying/planning. Room for growth and supporting managers."
good,"The other employees were terrific but there weren't enough of us. I would be the only one in three different departments, trying to take care of customers who would bring their merchandise from all over the store because there weren't enough employees to take care of them.  They were always complaining that they couldn't find anyone to help them.  It was a madhouse."
good,typical day at macys consist of talking to customers and straightening the floor and making sure to meet your sales goal other than that its really a smooth job and you can pick up shifts as they become available

Their goals daily are often met because of the employees and supervisors, It's fun and exciting.."

good,I worked for Macy’s for 20+ years holding many positions from sales associate to Merchandise Team Manager. The ability to grow with the company is endless.

good,it was a good place the people was nice and helpful no one was better than any one we all worked together to get things done if it was still open i would still be working there
good,"If you are fresh out college looking to get into retail. Macys is the perfect job. They’re flexible, pays decent, eligible for PTO and vacation after 6 months, and relaxed environment. Very diverse, Feels like one big melting pot that’s a family."
good,"The time I worked at Macy's, I learned how to multi-task, provide customer support and keep a tidy workplace environment. I also learned how to work in a team environment."
good,the job was very professional and i enjoyed the  one on one experience with the customers. I also enjoyed the teamwork required to get through all the days struggles.
good,A typical day would be cleaning your station within the perfume department or fixing online orders. Also helping customers that would come in and assist them with whatever that was needed. Mangement was reasonable and understandable.
good,This is a good starter job but the pay isn’t much compare to how much work you have to put in. The raises aren’t much either. But the workplace was fun and very easy going.

good,Knowledge of the diamonds/metals/precious youre selling is a must. Getting to know the customers needs is also a must if you want to provide them with quality customer service.
good,"Collaborated with employees from all teams within the store on a daily basis. As an MTM, I learned all of the operational processes that are involved in a retail store."
good,"A job as a sales associate can be productive and rewarding on good days, but boring and quiet on bad days. Most of my co-workers were really nice and supportive. A good work ethic goes a long way in this company, and if you work hard you'll certainly be praised for it. The hardest part would be keeping up with sales on a slow day, and resisting the urge to be lazy and gossip when there aren't any customers. Everyone there can work very hard though when the store is crowded."
good,the experience I had at Macys warehouse was great I really enjoyed the people they surrounded me with it was a fun environment with hard working and loving people I'm really glad I had this working experience
good,I’m hard working and provide good customer service for each customer that walks into the store make sure they are satisfied with what they came to look for or something similar if the store don’t have what they looking for I make sure every customer keeps a smile on their face while working with me

good,Macy's was a great place to work. It has a fun corporate atmosphere and the people are all awesome. It is a shame that retail isn't doing so great right now.
good,"A great place to start to learn about customers, clothing, and retail in general. Learned how to operate a register, and selling skills. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers who ask for extra things that are not available."
good,a typical day at work would be checking in at 6 am to get the store ready for opening set which deals or going on today and assist clients and point the to cashier.
good,"Enjoyed working with my co-workers, and management was respectful and encouraging.  Anyone could get their required breaks, but if short staffed, some workers didn't bother requesting a break, and this went unnoticed by management."
good,If you are flexible and willing to learn the business you can go far. There are opportunities available you just have look for them and apply yourself.
good,"The work environment is a great place to work. it was my first job, but i learn how to find a person wants and needs. I would highly recommend some to work here."
good,Macy's is the number one job for someone who is looking to work in a TEAM environment. The people there are very mature and professional. They are also unselfish and will assist whenever you need it.
good,The best way to describe the workers is that everyone's one big family. Everyone is willing to help in anyway they can for the customers and workers. Workers strive to provide quality customer service and to maintain a balance and efficient environment.
good,"Macys has wonderful people and management, and the scheduling is very flexible and conveinant. The only real downside is the hourly pay rate, which is low for the amount of work that you do- there are some nice benefits if you work there for over 6 months- then you get holiday pay and pto."
good,Macy’s is a good place but the manager is not so nice. The employees are nice and the customers is do nice also. But the people do not tell you that they change your schedule unti the day you work. Plus you really don’t make nlthat much there even with commissions.
good,Being a makeup artist there was fun. I loved working with the other makeup artist. They were very nice. People there were very nice. I would have enjoyed working there longer.

good,working for macy's such a great experience to be part of such a well established organization that also has so much history. Macy's was also a fun experience
good,"Pretty slow pace when not the holidays, management likes for employees to be doing things at all times even if there really aren't any customers. Relaxed attire can bee worn and they make it fun by having us wear certain things on certain special days."
good,"I gave 100% every day with a pleasant and positive attitude.  I learned to operate the cash register, do online ordering and inventory.  My managers where nice and I enjoyed working with them.  The hardest part of the job was listening to associates talking about other associates and managers in a negative manner.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and finding items they were looking for."

good,"The Macy's Credit and Customer Service Center in Mason, Ohio is a very relaxed, ""work at your own pace"" type of workplace, with multiple workday programs to improve the average day of their workforce. From multiple break areas to a fully-equipped cafeteria, it's plain to see that Macy's values their support staff."

good,"management work around your school schedule and very easy to talk to, co-workers was very friendly, it a great way to gain more patience and more knowledge on the customer service world."
good,"fixing clothes on the tables, cleaning the fitting rooms, wrapped gifts, the hardest part was keeping up around the holidays when you get sent to gift wrap..."
good,"I had an early shift there so i had to be there before 6am. I would clock in then head to the stock area and see what it is we hadn't finished the day before, it was a nice environment i liked it personally i would be off around midday. I learned a lot on those registers they would use its very easy with codes to get to a certain website. I would say the hardest is maybe reaching sales goals.

good,"Working at Ross and then starting a new job at Macy's is a huge eye opener because the companies are completely different from each other. A typical day for me at Macy's is clocking in and then immediately doing go-backs, doing inventory, or just fixing your area in your department. Walking around and trying to help customers is what most people did. No one really stayed at their registers. I learned a lot about working independently and having to figure stuff out on my own. The hardest part is when its a slow day and you don't really have much to do at work. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and working in different departments if you're ever needed to."
