rating,review
bad,They don't respect their employees and work them to the bone.  They sometimes don't even give you a day off and make the work weeks combine into one another so you end up working 8 days in a row.
bad,All rules should  Apply for all employee. They should  fire their employees that constantly showing up late for work. constantly not showing up for their scheduled shifts should have been fired a long time ago but some get special treatment .
bad,Smart & Final was a fast work place.  I enjoyed talking to customers a lot and wiring with all my coworkers. Closing at night were my favorite shifts.
bad,"terrible work environment management was horrible didn't really care about load crew and was only about 3 of us working load crew every night for about 2-3 months too many in store problems"
bad,I got my hours and management was good to me! The store was so bad at communication. Had a very negative vibe. You work so hard while getting paid very little. Its just wasn't good😭
bad,"Management at the Yuba City Store was shameful, which is why the store did not last more than 2 years. The hardest part of the job is having to survive on only 12 hours per week of work."
bad,"Management was terrible, hours were bad, they expect you to memorize the entire store in 2 shifts without giving you the time to do so, seemed annoyed when asked questions."
bad,Management huge problem cut hours but yet  they get there 40 plus they give you false promises they give you management role in department without the role established or fulltime
bad,"I appreciated the manager that hired me. He lead by example. After he quit,  The work ethics changed. If you dont have anything good to say dont say nothing!!!!!!!"
bad,does not care about anything but money. horrible service. no room for promotion. favoritism. worked there for years and was so glad to leave. do not recommend.
bad,"The only making a living here are the managers ,they don't give you enough hours always keeping you at less then 30 hours.sometimes 20 managers have a lot of favoratism.they dont care when your sick .Always breathing down your neck they dont know how to speack to you or adk ypu to do something in a polite manner overall worst job in my entire life."
bad,Smart and final started out as an okay job but the management is terrible. I don't feel welcomed or like I matter there I am always told I can be easily replaced and I don't believe any job whatever that may be should be condoning that behavior.
bad,Honestly i liked working with the people at the store but the people above the store manger kept changing their minds about everything which lead to alot of unnecessary stress to the job that was already fast paced and stressful.
bad,"Horrible job, no raises after a year, not enough bodies on the job, overtime is not allowed. Management loves to blame everyone else for their mistakes."
bad,the managers were rude and disrespectful. one of the managers constantly got mad for no reason and started lying on people and getting people fired...
bad,my bad experience working for smart n final wasn't good at all because they would send me home when the store slows down for business. management had lack of communications with employees.
bad,"Do not recommend as a place for work. It is non union, a lot of favoritism, and Human resources fires people for specific reasons and lets others stay."
bad,"Awesome place for the short run. Management could be tough, you had to be committed to the store or else your hours would  reflect that. retail is a very tough industry to be inn"
bad,Smart And Final is not a part-time job even I have been there for two years and when I started there I was getting 32 hours minimum I’m a hard worker and willing to do anything and eager to learn I have never been put through any sort of training I’ve worked in the meat department they used me when they needed me and there is no loyalty to the employee the wages are horrible the hours are horrible and it’s very demoralizing to work there there is no future there !  My father has worked in the grocery business for over 33 years and has been able to support his entire family the grocery business now my experience being with Smart And Final it’s just a very sad sad work environment conditions are horrible for the employees there is no breakroom there is no refrigerator there is no organization whatsoever it is a horrible horrible experience as my first experience in retail I do not recommend working for Smart And Final to anybody that I speak to it is not a fun place it could be it should be
bad,horrible vibe and no career advancement. they say you'll get a review every six months and a possible increase in pay and it never happened. they only promote people if they have some sort of in  with the company. horrible place to work don't waste your time. they say on the ad it has a family environment but they definitely have the opposite.
bad,I dreaded going to work everyday. I was one of the youngest people working and quickly moved up into management which was nice to have my ethics rewarded but the internal control policies in the pricing department are ineffective and inefficient so that goals seem futile. Poor and dated system technology is another detriment to the work environment. Inappropriate and uninspiring management. Had to clock 14 hour shifts every tuesday night and clock out early because policy saud no overtime hours punched in had to pencil them in to be added later and sometines never recieved them.  Understaffing and budgeting calls for stressful and unrewarding shifts.
bad,Low education level of management with terrible communication skills and they don't care about employees. Regular associates get paid more than some supervisors so there is no motivation to move up in the company.
bad,hours are not guaranteed. Other employees are very rude and gossip about one another. Lack of leadership and always a mess in the back room with expired food on the floors.
bad,Expected to work 50 hours/week but in reality its closer to 60-70. Forced to take vacations. Workplace culture not so great for anybody that might like to feel sincerely appreciated for any accomplishments big or small or simply for the daily grind.
bad,"Getting the u boat as fast as you can while organizing must finish the pallet less then an hour. I learned that uniform, equipment, communication, and patience are important because there is none. The hardest part of the job is trying to work at that store"
bad,"when working for smart and final extra in palm springs california i was working night crew, it was a job working all night non stop doing extra work for minimum pay or none at all."
bad,"Managers do not work around people's schedules or even attempt too. They expect too much from their associates and give them nothing in return, also managers schedule only 2 employees in the entire store from 2pm until closing."
bad,"While working at Smart and Final I became aware that there was favoritism within the company."
bad,This Employer was unaccommodating and unprofessional. There was a disconnect between workers and managers. Leaving employees on the receiving end of very poor review from the managerial staff. Worst job experience i have ever had.
bad,"For the short time I worked here, my coworkers were frigid and down-right rude. The managers were short, and would act as if any questions about policy were an inconvenience. I got out as soon as I could."
bad,I felt that they made my workplace a hostile environment and they discriminated towards me because I wasn't able to take care of personal business the  management was poor and all they did was make me feel bad.
bad,I used to like working their but then they started cutting my hours then my days. I was treated unfairly everyone was talking about me. I learned not to trust no one on the job.
bad,this place promises you raises and movement around and up the company then cuts your hours and takes responsibility. i would never work here again and don't recommend it to anyone.
bad,"Typical job"
bad,one of the mangers are really rude! takes a long time to even get to speak to the boss about a situation an we were short staffed.
bad,it can be ok at times. stressful too.i enjoy working on the floor. it makes time go by quicker. other than that it is a stressful environment
bad,"i have never hated going to work in my life as i feel when i come to work at smart & final , the management is horrible there is alot of favoritism that goes on and i honestly feel that this company doesn't care about its employees, they only care about making money thats why they  are open for long hours and be sure not to get sick because they write you up for not being able to show up to work because your feeling under the weather. they will literally expect you to work while you are sick even if you are coughing all over the open food they dont care or if your injured they wont care, i recently hurt my hand and had to get taken off work for a couple weeks. i moved and tried transfering to a smart & final near by i was told by that manager that the manager from the  store i was at had told him that i had bad attendance so i told him i had dr's excuse for those times i wasnt able to show up for work his response was "" it doesnt matter that's no excuse for not showing up""."
bad,Night crew work here is one of the hardest I have ever experienced
bad,No opportunities for advancement and when you do get promoted to a lead you don’t receive  a raise only when you become a key holder and it’s usually not a good raise. Managers talk to you however they want even if you call HR they do nothing. They expect you to work hard and not pay you. It’s all about favoritism in this company.
bad,"They really don't mind overworking anyone and everyone due to being understaffed, there's absolutely no opportunities for pay raises (don't even ask), little to no training provided for any department unless you're going to be a cashier, management 100% picks favorites and doesn't listen to or care about anyone's concerns. They cut hours all the time without warning so don't ever expect a consistent schedule or paycheck."
bad,"They do not treat employees fairly, they let some employees get away with standing around and talking and doing nothing but fire others that would actually do some work. One asst manager that had been there for years took a large check with a bad ID even though the cashier and other asst told her not to take it and no actions were ever taken against her"
bad,"Poor company support to store level"
bad,"Never enough help or coverage. Women working alone at night . Push comes to shove no honest management ,  allowed to yell and scream at you in front of others,  Corp will not help you let alone hear your side of the story. After 15 years company went down hill every since the sold it to share holders. No longer a great company to work for."
bad,"Working at Smart & Final was very stressful  and very hard. You don't get any reconition for anything. The manager there has his favorites on who he promotes and who he doesn't, you have to be competitive."
bad,"This is a good job for students, not if you have a family to support. The pay is not enough for the work you do. To much corporate drama,  not enough equality"
bad,"Smartfinal it’s a horrible company to work for.first of all you get hours if you kiss butt,they wil never promote you unless you been working for the company for years.10 minute break whe. Other company offer you 15 no benefits for part timers.they make you take lunch when u only work 41/2 hours.always has liner not enough people to work.labor they never have"
bad,I was very disappointed with the lack of hours.  all overnight stockers only work 3 days per week. store is based on the volume they sale . the more volume the more money available for there employees.
bad,"learned how to use a cash register, deal patiently with customers, face"
bad,I would bring palets of product/merchandise with an electric dolly or forklift out to the store floor after buisness hours or when the store would close for the night!
bad,"This company is productive and a fun workplace.Smart7Final is a fun place to work it has a big receiving area and a great break room, lot of parking"
bad,"It is so bad to work @ Smart & Final. Workers don’t last. Managers act as if they are the owners of Smart & Final. When in fact they were just given a supervisory level, managers took it  differently. I’m referring to the Sta. Rosa Avenue branch."
bad,"Too many managers, not enough workers. Most work is left up to 3 workers at a time and the rest of them just walk around or sit in the office. Be prepared to work a department, handle all customer service requests, run a cash register, as well as do cart runs every 30 mins. Horrible communication throughout the store and everyone just blames each other for work not getting done. Runs like a convinence store nothing like a grocery store."
bad,Overtime is a must and no comp time.  Management squabbles with each other and harasses employees to work harder.  Servers and networking equipment are way below standard.
bad,overnight with low paying benefits us not up to par with my expatiation so that was another reason why leaving smart and final on mt Vernon in Bakersfield
bad,"i was not allowed to go on the breaks that were suppose to be given to me, i learned how everything works around working in a store, i did not get the proper training that i needed."
bad,This job is super easy. The reason i am looking for a new job is that this job is not fulfilling and the lack of hours. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the condescending boss. Most enjoyable part is to see a customers face light up when you go above and beyond to help them with something.
bad,No room for advancement learned nothing management played favorites culture not fun the hardest part is not moving up. The people I worked with for must part were great
bad,"I've worked for this company for 5 years. Never late, always covered a shift when need. Never had customer complaints filed against me. I help train a fellow co-worked for a management position, and was never considered for a higher position. I've worked with three other African American co-workers with the same work integrity, were never considered for a managerial position."
bad,"I was let go after only 2 days of work, i had experience in grocery before but they didnt even give me a chance to learn the store layout, i had the feeling i was expected to know everything right off the bat."
bad,"If your working at the one I did, I suggest you relocate to a different one cause people can get misconstrued on your perception of being able to speak openly in the working environment. And oh if you don’t like doing janitorial stuff you will be doing it but make sure they provide you with gloves 🧤 cause it was supposed to be required when working with feces, lord know I payed for my gloves every time I knew I was going to work and wasn’t getting a penny back for it."
bad,In the 2 years I have been employed by this company I have been threatened with physical violence as well as not giving the accurate information. Sad.
bad,"zero work & family balance "
bad,"Very stressful, everyone not working together, always calling off, hard labor little pay, always promise things but never deliver, they always want more but unable to take care of there employees"
bad,"Bosses are very rude, they complain about the littlest things that they can do themselves instead of sitting in the office all day doing nothing. Hours are cut almost all the time. Management takes up all the money, but does absolutely nothing, they get paid to have employees under them do their job."
bad,nice friendly envoirment very friendly i stayed with the company 7 months im currently in school for pharmacy technician smart and final was not giving enough hours
bad,I was surrounded by drama throughout my entire employment. The manager never did anything except display blatant favoritism. Do yourself a favor and never work here.
bad,"smart & final  gave me great work experience within the store itself "
bad,highly motivated fun place to work at. Goals are set clear and objectives. Managers are encourage to seek out new solutions to problems and upper management provide the freedom to seek it.
bad,"it was nice while I was there. Lots of drama though, it got so ridiculous. Hardest part of work was coming to work and hearing all about yesterdays drama."
bad,Cant really give any stars in these ares. It has some good points but things are changing cor the worse everyday. Management has no communacation skills. Management also plays favortism with employees.
bad,"Fast-paced"
bad,"-I got almost 2 years of money handling experience here."
bad,Its a OK place didn't work there long enough to say any good/bad things about this place.
bad,I recommend this job for anybody looking for their first job ever.
bad,Fast work everyday and especially in the night shift when the truck load would come. It was very stressful due to the cargo must be packed in its right full place before doors open for business.
bad,terrible work environment management was horrible didn't really care about load crew and was only about 3 of us working load crew every night for about 2-3 months too many in store problems
bad,This was my first job as part time ever we never got full time schedule 14 hours a week unaible to make a living with so little hours. Schedule change every week
bad,"smart and final was a great place to work until management went down hill, hours were cut drastically, I was always doing everything and running around, A lot of customers would tell me i shouldn't be here because i should be a manger and they haven't noticed my work. Before I placed my 2 week notice I had 2 assistance managers beg me to not leave the company, due to me being a hard worker but I knew i wouldn't get any where with the manager that worked there previously."
bad,very slow paced. no room for advancement. lack of hours. pay not fair. i don't wish nobody seeking employment to work for this company. lack of hours. lack of pay. i just had a bad experience there.
bad,"I worked for the company for six months and enjoyed maybe the first two months, Managers would send pictures/ texts in group messages talking about employees. Rumors started by management/ associates reminded me of high school, I was called a ""child"" and had personal items thrown on the floor due to me leaving a jacket in a department instead of a locker. VERY disappointing work environment."
bad,very dirty were I was at it was a tweaker spot they come in and try steal or offer for cheap clothes like less than $5 dollar sandals can be a okay spot staff is cool at first tweakers are funny after a while you'd get gross out
bad,"every store is different,but this one is by far the worst iv ever worked for only there for two months and people are trying to get each other in trouble or even fired .no body was moving up even after being there for a hand full of time showing me there was no hope to succeed for this company ."
bad,"Extremely stressful and the management that I had at the end did not back up the other managers if female. Some of the other managers were extremely over bearing and talked down to me all the time. Never enough people on the floor to call if needed. Pay was not enough for the stress that a person had to go through. Upper management was very male oriented. When there was a problem, management was nice to your face but did nothing about any of the problems. I was supposed to be management but had to be a full time cashier as well as a full time Service Manager. Therefore, was working two jobs for the pay of just one job.That was not in the job description. Never was scheduled the times that I was promised I would be scheduled."
bad,It wouldn't be my first choice it was a side job did I did to make extra money overall if you're looking for a quick job for fast Cash it is okay management wasn't that great but still relaxed
bad,"- Store recovery, always moving."
bad,"It's a good part time employer. However, it is not a good environment to work in because you work for a long hours and you don't get recognized for your positivity. Manager is more focused on your negative or mistakes that you did."
bad,I liked it at first but as time progressed my time here has not been enjoyable. The management here isnt the best and lack leadership. they forget to give you your breaks and lunches and seem to wrtie you up for anything. My co workers are cool but everyone doesnt seem to like working here and most of us want out. Just that looking for a job is the problem. The most enjoyable part of my job is clocking out to go home.
bad,I felt uncomfortable on the job due to the way the managers communicate with the staff. You basically will just be thrown on the register and you will have to learn from your own mistakes.
bad,"management was not open to all and did not care about if you had another job.and when i tried to get an understand, it went all wrong.And i had to quite."
bad,"I honestly learned a lot from working at smart and final , the environment is extremely hostel. everyone expects above and beyond work with only a small amount of time."
bad,"As a new cashier for Smart & Final, I was teamed up with a older female that was in a high position than me. It was a very horrible experience. She yelled at me in front of the customers. She is very unprofessional and came into work with a bad attitude everyday."
bad,"When I first began working at smart & FInal everything was fine, but over time they began to mix my work schedule with my school schedule and I often Brought it to the managers attention but nothing changed."
bad,good place to work at though management needs improvement +communication training.worked there for a month was dissapointed by the way i was treated there by both coworkers+management..
bad,Must be ok with working alone and help customers when asked. Must keep lines moving quickly. You gain great customer service skills. Major holidays are a must .
bad,"I started working for Smart and Final when I was sixteen and in high school. I haven't read any recent changes in labor laws, but I know that back then I was only allowed 24 hours, at most, a week and I wasn't allowed to work after 10pm. For the first two months, I worked between 40-60 hours a week, frequently closing the store. I was given a box cutter on my first day and was using the bailer (cardboard box compressor) without training, certification, or even supervision."
bad,"Hard work is not rewarded. Management will refuse raises due to an hours-based automated raise system. Automated raises are only $0.05/hr. After being a member of Night Crew for 3 years, I was only making $0.20/hr more than our fresh hires their first day on the job."
bad,"overly short staffed, to many black shirts prompted above abilities and unwilling to learn.  Lack of common sense, failure to inform new employees this is a labor intensive job.  Put customer well being below sales.  Ex putting dozen meat out unrefrigerated for 8 hours to thaw and then put out on shelf to be sold. Selling product that is expired or spoiled."
bad,"Don't work there, find a different grocery chain if you must be in that field. Management is horrible, no one users the same rule sets. Random write ups or none, switches store location or job at random."
bad,Management was a joke there they would slack off then blame employees for problems in the store. If you asked for help they wouldnt help you. District managers are snobby and make you feel like you are way beneath them. Alot of work and stress gets put on to an individual meanwhile good employees are underpaid.  Males get treated better and get higer pay males often get to advance over a female.
bad,"Grocery was at one time a male dominated field. Some of those men are still managing stores.  No real innovation or evolution into the new customer driven environment. "
bad,sShortstaffed and employees feel very rude and not caring to other employees. the mamagers blame other crew members for stuff they never done. Not a good place to work at.
bad,YOU are on a seniority order.  When new you will be on a rotating shift. They will send you wherever they choose.  You  might start out at a distribution center close to home then they will transfer you to one that you have to commute 100 miles per day or more.
bad,"It was more of a sad environment all night being timed and rushed  with low pay . Night shift wasn't for me . Recommend to someone who stays up , and doesn't mind giving away their  health and sleep ."
bad,en la empresa  el gerente es muy mamon no  puedes pararte un rato a descanza xqe te regaña no puedes platicar un momento por que se molesta quieren verte todo el dia en friega sin descanzar tienes 30min. de comida el pago es una miseria tienes k hacer esfuerso fisico de mas  esta muy mal pagado y no recomendaria  nadie trabajar ai ya que los  horarios son muy malos y no tienes tiempo para tus actividades personales
bad,"Hours were little to none, no advancement, not enough work hours part time only 12 hours a week not 30 hours as promoised"
bad,night crew was hard work but you didn't have to deal with crazy customers
bad,"Basic retail environment, room for growth, good long term job. They hire no one at full time, you have to work for it. Sometimes it takes years to get basic health benefits and a decent wage."
bad,The 1st 7 months were ok. every worker has to be register trained and you will be taken from your work area to work the register. %75 percent of the workers hated the register. then in jan 2019 a new #2 manager came in and treated employees like garbage and the store is now very toxic because of maria. dont call corporate because they will do nothing.
bad,I have been living with Lymphadima; chronic swelling of a limb. For me it is my left leg. due to this I am unable to work more than four hours at a time. Also until May 6th; which is when I graduated University I was only able to work two or three days due to my class schedule. They would go between scheduling me once or twice during the week. Because of this I am in a very bad financial situation. This is a very bad company and my store in North Hollywood is a very bad store to work for. Stay away.
bad,El ambiente es bueno para aprender el manejo de una tienda
bad,Manager was a bit racist and cocky but overall the job taught you responsibility organization and time management. A bit rough and fast pace but taught me to move faster.
bad,never enough staff to cover breaks and lunch. Managers are not considerate. looking to meet their goals only. They don't seem to care about the employee
bad,Working here is not for people that can't handle stress. Consistently understaffed due to people with a sense of entitlement not being able to handle the pressures of the work environment here
bad,Stressful due to bad location [lots of homeless people and drug addicts in the area [constantly had to deal with theft]. Also often understaffed due to corporate wanting to cut hours and pay.
bad,customer service cashier was to provide excellent service to all the customers that enter the store ring up all final items on the belt i learned to be outgoing and a team player to all associates and managements in providing excellent service the most stressful part of this job was pulling all the shopping carts in when their was a minimum of them the most pleasant part was the customers and that i provided great service.
bad,feels like high school. only way to get any type of promotion and recognition is by being a brown nose. manager is nice but gets stepped over by those underneath him meaning his mangement team.
bad,This job is good for students because they are able to accommodate to your schedule. Moving up the ladder is very hard and the people you work with seem like they hate their life.
bad,"The highest level of hypocrisy exists in the District Manager and above positions. The expectations on store management is unreasonable with the abundance of plus out products and automatic distribution, it is impossible to match the expectations. Stress level is super high if you try to meet the expectations and the pay and benefits are not worth it."
bad,They are very selfish and do not care about their employees. once they are no use to them they begin to treat them differently and cut their hours. Very poor company.
bad,Been working there for about 6 months give or take a month or two manager gives me small hours plays favorites with the workers never trained me properly and makes me do a lot of extra stuff I don't know how to do they just throw you in a department and say good luck then expect you to do that job and the job they had you doing in a short amount of time with no training
bad,"If your good at your job, they start to take advantage of you. The favorite ones get all the good shifts and weekends off while you do all the closing shifts."
bad,"The job itself I don't feel like was difficult, I feel like it was more towards management. It didn't feel like you were working towards anything unless you knew someone who was already higher up than you to recommend you instead of how you actually worked."
bad,if you only want to work one or two days a week this is the place for you. if you are not looking for advancement and only want part time this is the place for you. do not work here if you need a job to support your family. this place provides enough hours for pocket change.
bad,"A temporary job as a service clerk,very stressful and boring.The management doesnt care if the ones who are below them make any advancements,they always give lame excuses if you ask for a promotion,they view you very poorly and demand way too much."
bad,Not enough hours plus you have to pay into the union. Otherwise you will be fired. The employees there constantly fighting for hours and trying to report any infraction to management.
bad,"I mostly enjoyed my time working for this company. It is quick paced if you are a cashier and they will just hammer you with customers with no help but if you are able to handle that then go for it. Also if you are promoted within the company from service clerk to cashier, they will try to screw you over by not giving you the cashier pay (12-14/hr) and they won't tell you about it either. There was one very poor manager at the location that I was at that made work miserable."
bad,"Management was a joke, they played favorites and would always say ok to giving more hours but never got them. The pay was horrible, but its a basic job so don't expect much."
bad,the typical day working there was having the produce area cleaned and organized. doing inventories every week and unloading the loads we would retrieve.
bad,Low pay low hours travel all city and state to get 40 hrs. Mom & Pop operation trying to take on all the Big Chain Stores! Run away train with no one at the controls wants to be big time on a small budget!
bad,have they started to give other people opportunities but the people in charge from the old style are power hungry and dont appreciate the employee's talent
bad,"Company is advertising huge personal growth potential, however this is not actually the case. Company has moved more towards hiring experienced people from outside of the company instead of developing the current employee."
bad,"I've been working there for almost two years, and its been very difficult in terms of pay rates, scheduling hours around school, and getting along with coworkers. A typical day working there is stressful because the managers want to keep you and NOT give you any Overtime pay. The hardest part about the job was timing because most of the time we wouldn't go by the schedule."
bad,I was a Cashier i did alot that i didnt know that cashiers had to do since it was my very first job.
bad,"reasonable wages, good work environment, flexible hours, customer service"
bad,"After spending 5 1/2 years for this company, I’ve not seen many improvements. Management is usually weak, poorly trained and generally clueless on how to properly manage people. In my experience hard workers get more piled on while those who shirk their duties get a free pass. Favoritism is rampant, and turnover is high. Lost a lot of good hardworking employees from the management this company has."
bad,There is no communication from the main manager. Under staffed and expectations of what you are to do in the short time you are scheduled is ridiculous. No room for advancement unless you know someone or are related to someone higher up. Pay is horrible for what they want you to do. Moved to a new department and took over never got a raise. Corporate doesn't care about real stuff that goes on in the store just about money.
bad,Due to the drastic drop in sales they had to cut overall hours and could no longer provide anyone with full-time causing a lot of the employees to leave. Leaving the store understaffed a majority of the time.
bad,If you are a slacker then this place is right for you. If you know someone in management you can move up quickly cause they only promote friends. If you are a hard worker and a good soldier then do not apply. They will take advantage of you for years till nothing is left.
bad,I would not go back to Smart & Final if they begged me and gave me a raise. They do have 401k benefits but other than that dont expect to make a career out of this place
bad,"mainly cashier,work the register,help customer with questions, keep our area clean, help when needed to stock shelves, receive loads when needed, i have learned a lot  about how to work in retail. Managment  is poor no interaction with employes. The most enjoyable part of work is working with the customers"
bad,"what i learned is the faster you help and assist a customer the better it will go, the happier and more reliable you become with a customer. Also just reassuring the customer by checking in the back for whatever they need."
bad,I don't have much to say about Smart & Final other than that it was a basic teenager job that works you to your limit for little pay. Pushing carts was the highlight of the day.
bad,"I will not recommend this place as it is low on hours wit 70 plus employees and you constantly have to keep begging for hours. Getting 2 days, luckily 3 a month is getting it by. Will recommend as a temp job while looking for something else."
bad,"Not many advancement opportunities, pay is not great at all, to many management problems, expect you to do other jobs that are not in your department and eont even give you a raise, expect you to help others and not give you any help when needed"
bad,Very quick pace and didnt have a lot of time to get things done in a well mannered way. Always rushed. People would always miss work or not show up on time
bad,"needs better management and communication, and team building and better access to information, to give others more opportunities and better opportunies for advancement"
bad,"Dramatic change over the last couple of years.. Worklife balance is horrible and the opportunities to advance in company are pretty much nonexistent to incredibly slim.Everyone except management is part-time.Too much pressure on workers, incredibly demanding to continue improving time and completion of duties. They violate labor laws and have been getting away with it for past few years."
bad,This was by far the worse place i had ever worked. My co-workers were always nice but when it came to management they were very rude and cruel.
bad,Hasn't been a week and the manager was already making me choose between school and work. I gave my school schedule in advanced but the manager ignored all my times and scheduled me to work on all days and times that I have school.
bad,"The human resource department should be overlooked and possibly retrained.The lack of empathy, care and actual proper investigation. I tried for a month to get a hold of HR to express what was going on at my store before I quit. After sending video, proof of code of ethics broken, harassment and retaliation at my store. That management team is still working together."
bad,It was a good job working grave yard but I was supervisor and getting paid the same as a regular worker. Alot of favoritism no communication and everything that was wrong blame night crew
bad,"Most managers do not work well with employees and I have been treated harshly by most of them. If you have trouble doing what they want, you get no hours. They expect you to do everything in an unreasonably small amount of time and you are only allowed to take breaks/lunch when they say. If you stop working for ten seconds and are seen, you can be reprimanded, even if you just spent twenty minutes organizing 100-pound boxes of chicken and tri-tip. Unless you have no other options, look elsewhere. Good management at these stores seems impossible based on what I'vee experienced with three different locations."
bad,"●depending on your position, mine was cashier/clerk, you will be doing mostly anything your manager tells you to throughout the store"
bad,Pay is totally not worth what you have to deal with there or any other customer service job. But it is a good place to get experience in dealing with difficult people. Managers were pretty nice but store manager was super strict about small things. Not a bad company to work for though.
bad,I was told that everyone started off as a service clerk and new people  would show up and start as a cashier which is pretty upsetting because a service clerk job is hard and easy at times and it a job no one wants to do there and to be told that i had to start at the bottom and that not be the case is misleading. I was moved to cashier but my manager always had workers quitting on him so he'd only use me to do the job i used to do and that was upsetting. Other than that it was an okay job but the manager there needs a total attitude adjustment
bad,"At Smart and Final, I have had my ""ups and downs. I enjoyed work but with my hard work ethic and punctuality there were no advancement nor sign of me progressing. Even with the lack of respect from my managers and 'most' of my superiors I still looked forward to helping customers; even they say ""thank you""."
bad,"A typical work session for me lasts from 9 pm to 5:30 am. It is a very physically demanding job. The amount of hours you recieve varies greatly. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful and I feel the managers have the workers best interests in mind. There is also a sense of teamwork and co-workers support each other. I feel the managers have the workers best interests in mind. However, it is a demanding job with sporadic hours and meager income."
bad,"Very deceitful, needy and unorganized upper management. Store loses approximately two or three employees every thirty days. Labor and training is Incomplete. Manager interrupts and takes you away from your job to do other jobs in different departments that someone should be hired to do. Loyal customers whisper what’s going on with the large turnover of workers."
bad,This job is more suitable for some one looking for a first job or something really easy. At times you have to be fast and at times it's slow. Dealing with people isn't always easy.
bad,"A location as large as Smart & Final has many parts that keep the gears rolling, multiple work areas, and stations for which a employee is stationed. But for the size of the location it lacked the proper amount of employees running it."
bad,At this smart and final it is drama filled and you basically are going to be thrown under the bus if you do something wrong. Reciever does nothing for hours. Manager sits in office all day.
bad,"never got the deserved payment, or recognized for the work I did. team work was never really a thing. store was poorly managed, and not enough workers or hours."
bad,muy buena la empresa el personal bueno también los horarios están bien
bad,"When I worked there, the company didn't seem to place much of an emphasis on the people who worked there.  It seemed all they cared about were profit margins, and not about taking care of their employees.  Slashed benefits, low pay, and dismal career advancement are reasons I left."
bad,"Was a great job, need something closer to where I live now. Pays a little more and gives me more hours and can give better benefits for me and my family"
bad,Managers don't push the employees to work your best work resulting in one person doing all the work at the end of the day. The managers don't appreciate the hard workers and don't value them as much as they should be valued. You’re requests for things that will better the work place most likely will not happen. They are very flexible with hours which is nice but when requesting time off you can expect your next weeks hours to be cut.
bad,"Hard working hours and environment. Pay is great, but, takes a toll on your back after years. You have to be willing to work graveyard in order to start working at Smart & Final."
bad,"-Learned to multitask in a fast pace environment."
bad,"I understand that companies need to maintain a certain type of integrity, but to treat there work force like expendable assets is another thing. On a normal day, you normally run on your to-do list and complete the same tasks again throughout. My manager isn't the type to condescend on every lower ranking, however, having to work twice as hard in the presence of the assistant manager because of the fear of being scolded at, well makes this part the hardest part of the job. It is very difficult to receive requested hours."
bad,"Smart and Finals was very unprofessional and a very unsafe place to work, there isn't any training you have to figure out how to do everything on your own. The manager has a lack of communication and is focused on all the wrong things."
bad,"I had my hours bumped down to 8 hours a week. Anytime I would ask my manager, at the time, to be put in cashier training I'd be told each time that he will put me in it but he never did. Things could have changed from then till now but I still don't recommend anyone apply here"
bad,"typical grocery store job"
bad,"Management was condescending and hard to work with."
bad,"Smart and Final is a great company to work for, the problem can be the store managers. My experience was one of many people, you go in with a positive attitude and by the end of the week come out with a down spirit. There was three different manager's and all did things very differently. It was very unorganized, and you felt insecure."
bad,You may wake up before the sun and go home before your teenager rolls out of bed on a non-school day. You'll work 20/week so they won't have to give you benefits. I learned it's really cold in the ice cream freezer and if you're in there for more than 10 minute it'll take another 10 minutes to thaw when you get out. Management and leadership are great and supportive people.
bad,I'm sorry to say but smart and finals van nuys dose not have good management. the accountability there is terrible they rely on some one to do there work for them when they can simply do it them selves then tell there workers what they can do to improve. my daily life in this store has me miserable and that's not a good environment to be in.
bad,Sanatation and help customers. Helpful co workers and requires alot of hard work.
good,This company needs to review their policies and every person on the management team at each store in Southern California. Drug testing and background checks should occur for every employee.
good,"Fast paced environment, discounts are okay (not enough in my opinion), poor management, not enough staff coverage especially for cashiers who have to deal with long lines and frustrated customers."
good,the management is inconsistent with protocols and doesn't follow through with promotions. the scheduling is unfair. if you work over night shifts they do not consider it a full shift but two shifts where it splits ur time. and doesn't allow for eligibility of overtime.
good,The employee discount  is good but they just closed a few stores so the hours are no longer good. Training takes a week and you will get good hours for training. Sunday shift differential  is nice as well.
good,Brake down pallets wheel them to proper location and re stock shelfs. Clean store for next business day by wiping down shelfs product sweeping and mopping floor. I learned customer service.
good,"When I first started my work at this company, I was receiving a decent amount of hours per week. I was on top of all of my work and even found myself frequently doing the work of other employees."
good,Working for Smart & Final was not all bad. the company itself was a good environment. The management was very poor. I was often punished for doing my job and protecting the integrity of my section.
good,manager role is tough. Not enough hours given to maintain standards that company likes. Loads are delivered during the day and have to be worked while you are also on the register and assisting customers on sales floor; and hope load is not late other wise it will sit in backroom and not completed until the following day and if your boss walks in they do not want to hear your reasons as to why it is not done or why their are many holes on the shelf.
good,"I enjoy working here, meeting different people, I love packing groceries for customers and seeing their slime on there face. You see different people and always seeing things weird things but are fun to watch."
good,"I do not work in a decent area around decent people, the customers are rude and for first time cashiers there is a catch to it.... I do not recommend store 436, although the Store Manager deserves a thumbs up, because he does, for the most part, take care of his employees. It is very stressful when other people are not team players that do not do their part and do not demonstrate equal respect towards one another. There really is not enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Typical day at work is assisting with various customers with there specific needs.  I learned how to operate a baler, making price tags. The management does need some improvements. My coworkers are like my family.  The hardest part was getting pass over for a promotion.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy."
good,"Pursuing Opportunity which will allow me to grow professionally, while effectively utilizing my versatile skill set to help promote your workplace now"
good,"very fast paste you can never get anything donr=e in our department, id say if your going to work here try to only be a cashier. you have too learn every depaertment which is fine bu u are under paid the turn over rate is crazy,"
good,Most of the managers I worked with don't care about you as a person. If you disagree with their work ethic they will cut your hours. When you move up in the company they don't really approve of you staying in school.
good,Working here I do significantly more than what is asked of me. My manager pays little to no mind to his employees' efforts and skills. Is known for not promoting people when they rightfully should be.
good,"Overnight Logistics and stock, I learned how to keep an extremely fast pace at work, management was good, co-workers were wonderful, hardest part was during holiday and being understaffed and kicking into high gear to compensate for lack of help, most enjoyable part was being done."
good,I was a temporary service clerk at smart and final extra through a job placement program. I did my job and I did a very well but they never hired me. I tried to keep in contacted with them for employment but ignored me and didn't take me seriously I was disappointed because I was excited to work there. The management was very disorganized workers always complains about their job.
good,"When I was hired, the company was fantastic. I actually loved going to work."
good,It’s alright depending on the people you work with. The pay is bad and some workers aren’t serious . It’s a good job if your in school or High school.
good,"Management was aweful. Some employees were favored and given extensive hours while others were given minimal hours, not enough to survive on. The pay was minimum wage-ridiculous. Coworkers here are great and work well together"
good,"Every chance this company gets it will show you how low you are and that they dont care about you. there is constant favoritism and its clear from the beginning. The discount is nice but not enough to make up for the stress put on you even tho you could be at a very low level in the company. Everyone talks and spreads rumors worse than a middle school group of girls, and the management is incompetent and whenever something goes wrong everyone always blames the little guys in the store."
good,This is a good place for kids in high school or young adults who might want to gain some experience in the workforce. Pervs everywhere and no career advancement opportunities
good,"Stacking pallets outside in the sun with no tarp and sometimes no water provided by employer. I learned how to stack pallets by color... Management didn't know how to manage. Workplace culture, lets just say i was the only one who spoke English... Hardest part is that i was the only one who spoke English so i couldn't talk with anyone. Not enjoyable."
good,"-they weren't very understanding of home life"
good,i always liked working there but it was the matter of when i will be working. not to many hours my way
good,"manag was not good to work with did,nt work with empe,s did,nt care about workers other jobs or life."
good,Typical day at work check emails from stores to make sure they are not missing anything. Jugging and multi-task the rest of the day as close to the traffic schedule as possible
good,"Alot of changes have accord within the company and my day gos on ordering the store, helping customer walking threm to the product.  also ordering specoial orders like big orders for specioal events."
good,Negative . My manager was rude the assistant manager snapped her fingers on me to hurry up. Manager embarrassed me in front of customers. Manager would post negative things about all employees in the break room. Which is against the law.
good,If it had better management I would have stayed on!  Some managers were nice others were very rude. Some of them treated those with learning disabilities like they were lesser than others.
good,"This job as a cashier is from beginning to end scanning groceries and taking payments from customers. There are not really chance for promotion for minority, and stop lifts every month and pressure of losing job."
good,I learned a lot working here just was never really appreciated for all the hard work considering all the suites one had to perform on a daily baisis. Management was pretty lazy and expectations way to high for what they were paying
good,"Lucky to see 15 hours a week. You work four or five hour shifts only barely pays for the gas to get to and from, I don't see how anyone stays employed here."
good,"Management is really bad and rules are not being followed. Total disaster!"
good,"no balance from work and personal life at all. They demand a lot from employees that are given very little incentive to do so. its ok, if you already know what youre doing. But they waste too much time and money trying to come up with shady reasons to discipline theyre workers."
good,"Smart and Final is a clean and big warehouse company, They are located in beautiful Laguna Niguel. I've learned how to stock and keep the produce fresh. The management shows favoritism to certain employees and because of the favoritism there is little to no room for advancement. Management is extremely disorganized changing schedules over the holidays and weekends sometimes up to 6 or 7 changes to the schedule in a 24 hour period. The hardest part is the management. The most enjoyable part is working with the nice community of Laguna Niguel."
good,"This was my first job and I hated the community because it was mainly older rude customers. I helped people to their car with no tip, pushed carts and helped customers retreive items from shelfs."
good,"Its a great place to start off but not for advancements. Management is not consistent, with some of the managers communication is not effective and is not executed smoothly."
good,"Regardless of the weather, the company policy wants you out there pushing carts if your a service clerk or not. Cashier, supervisor, or even manager I've seen employees doing other departments' task. Disorganized and not the best work enviroment. Discouragement at its best, when you ask for a transger they just tell you what you want to hear and ignore you."
good,"On your feet all shift and always on the go. There is so much to do from assisting customers, restocking, and retrieving baskets. Customers are very kind and considerate."
good,"I still loved my job having the ability to meet new people on a daily basis kept my job interesting. Meeting and talking with different people from day to day to me will always keep your job exciting. Management could have been a little better though, sometimes the company was disorganized, overall i enjoyed my work with them."
good,"I worked when there when I was in high school I started just as a runner helping people find products, rounding up carts, packing groceries then I did cashier and eventually worked on a department on my own. However, management changed constantly which made it hard to advance because each new manager knew nothing about you or your skills. It was nice to meet new people but once you got used to them everything changed it was like starting all over."
good,"In my time the co workers were really the highlights of working here "
good,I learned how to get things done within a specific amount of time. I had to get things done within the four hours that I had before my shift has ended
good,"The work place was very good as long as you're actually working which is very easy to do with the company. The pay is alright nothing to brag about. If you wish to advance it's not about what you know more about who you know. Worked overnight for 3 years with them saying it was going to be for2 months and they refused to take me off nights because I was ""to good at it"". Got tired of breaking my back for the company when all I asked for was better hours"
good,"I'm not sure if the same guy is the manager for night shift but you will not make it further than entry level if you don't at least pretend to be interested. I left the day i was over looked by someone who had only been with the company for a month and I had been there over a year; changed the whole platform on how to do things and someone else received the promotion. If he's no longer there, the place is cool. Long hours AT YOUR DISCRETION."
good,"Working foe Smart and Final was okay, It was my first job and was unknowledgeable on what benefits were offered other than 401k. But It would be a great job for a first time job."
good,"It was a fast paced enviroment, some days went slow and some a little fast paced. Easy job to learn, alot of interaction with customers and multi tasking"
good,Start of the day was usually ok but the lack or proper schedule at the store location i worked lacked. Also wasnt any proper team work most people did their own thing also usually ended up working deli department jobs by myself with no help as well as dealing with stocking and recieveing orders with no assistance cause people didnt want to help. Lastly due to the lack of a proper manager and scheduling was also forced to not only cashier but also try to deal with stocking and recieving and putting load away by myself .
good,"a typical day at work would've been like clock in to work, co to my register and get my tray, count my money and sign in to my register, Working there I learned that customer service is always a must, and its one of the greatest things that a customer can be provided with.As far as management, it was okay. My former manager was well represented and carried himself very professionally and always made sure the store was clean and organized. The workplace culture was very strictly but also accommodating to certain extents. we had our fun but we made to act professionally in store. I think the most enjoyable thing about have had the opportunity to work at Smart and Final was getting to know customer service and the ropes of how a register works, and learning the different tasks as an employee for the company."
good,"Worked out for me while i was going to school. Flexible hours, usually 5-10, about 3-4 days a week. Management was alright, i usually didnt work with them as they worked the day shift. Cool employees, not much room for job progression though."
good,"Working for Smart and Final is ok, if you just need a second income. It will not be enough to be the primary income, cuz the hours fluctuate every week."
good,common office job. data entry and computer skills. interpersonal and communication skills required to speak with customer service representatives and customers.
good,I joined thinking it would be an energetic environment but the manager was just too much. I was the youngest so my co workers didnt take me serious. I never see myself there again
good,"Typical day consits of carts and cashier. Hardest part is being told by mangers to do different things & being called from dept. to open a register. Co workers are fun to be around however, we all have our days. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to meet new people and consider the work atmosphere as a smart&final family."
good,"My beginning thoughts of Smart and Final were that of hope and hard work. The hard work came without a doubt and so did advancements and opportunities. Unfortunately for my store the associates gave a vibe of disorganization, distrust, and general chaos. The management is what made the store and its associate so bad. Its scheduling does not follow the associates given availability and the old manager of the store did as he pleased. The Senior assistant manager and the General Manager had such disagreement and chaos that the grand remodeling of the store made the work place such an unpleasant place to be. The hardest part of the job is ignoring the drama that went around the work place, as well as the poor scheduling of workers and associates. I've learned plenty within the store, working fast to satisfy customers and helping my team yet a typical day at work is exhausting as the responsibilities are far from what is expected and than beyond that."
good,Smart and Finale has lots of benefits and perks for full time employees and not much part time. Becoming a full time employee is not a guarantee you can work for Smart and Finale 35-40 hours a weak for ten years and still not be consider a full time employee. To become a full time employee you must be a manager supervisor or store P.I.C. to really get to experience the benefits and perks they claim to offer.
good,"i worked as a senior cashier ,doing everything from inventory of products to check cashing and restocking shelves.my Co-workers were great and we all helped each other .hardest part of the job is standing all day."
good,the minute I clocked in we were instructed to begin order picking which was fun on the electric pallet jack but headsets were a problem which decreased my productivity rate. management were hard to find at times especially being new still but employees were friendly.
good,"Long Hours, lack of work place flexibility, Work days are 7 to 5pm no exceptions, Emails..emails.. emails average day is at least 200+ emails and another 50 automatic report emails"
good,cashier and maintain the front area. Would make cash drops and close out register.
good,"it was okay working here, not the best job but for a first job it’s great. At some locations, the managers does not care about your hours, you work what you’re given, unless switched with another co worker."
good,"As a student, this was a helpful place to work for my first job to expose me to the working world. Unfortunately, in my time working with the company I was very stressed and frustrated with the scheduling conflicts with school and some of the customer encounters. My reason for leaving this job was for my own personal reasons but overall is a good exposure job to keep people humble and to start somewhere."
good,"Had a great working environment, learned a lot of new things but the management was little to no help on moving up in the company. The pay was not worth the time and effort you put in."
good,"Its an okay place to work at, you get a minimum amount of hours a week as part time. You start off as a part-time job and the hours are 4 hrs a day and depends on how many days you work.."
good,A lot of manual labor. High labor expectations and low pay. Employees are usually friendly. Hardest part is interacting with customers all day. Best part is lunchtime
good,"There's no such thing as being assigned to one job there. Everybody can do different things example, every one is responsible for trash, go backs, cleaning registers, cleaning bathrooms, cart runs and ect."
good,It’s a great job to work as a part time employee. I don’t find it to be my career. I am getting a promotion here but I don’t think I fully am engaged.
good,"The typical day at work is fun with the employees, some customers are good, some are a bit tolerable, occasionally some homeless with walk in and try to steal from the store, I've learned at the many names and different types of the produce of fruits and vegetable in our store, management is a bit iffy, and inconsistent with follow up and notices, the hardest part of this job is the workflow, with the lack of employees at this smart and final, it'll be stressful for a cashier or service clerk to do their own position, other clerks such as produce and service sometimes have to stop what they're doing to help cashiers out with carrying outs. the most enjoyable part is the customers. some will be very nice and help you move forward with your day with good vibes."
good,"It's a good first job, but it can take years for anyone to see growth. Very competitive job, if you're trying to grow within the company. They pay for schooling but more information is needed on that end. Culture was very diverse and patience is most definitely needed all around"
good,"it's a job, pays the bills.  If you have a family you will need another job to compensate for the low pay, Great co-workers and management, but no incentive for past experience."
good,The problem with working overnight here is the same as working overnight elsewhere: the lack of social life. Days and weeks go pretty quickly and then you ask yourself where did my time/week go? What have I done besides work. The management between when I got hired and when I began orientation changed and things got really confusing. There was bad communication experienced by most of the staff.
good,The people were very nice and helpful. But management was absolutely unacceptable. Only offered 401k. No health benifits such as health care dental or vision
good,"I was ""promoted"" multiple times, to multiple departments. Typically when you are promoted to a department, you are supposed to receive a raise. I was working minimum wage for my entire 2 year employment, even when I was a department supervisor. Human Resources is unreliable and does not take complaints seriously."
good,"this is a part 2 to a resume already posted. long days, stupid nights, store managers don't really care, everyone else cool though.....don't be a bad worker though they will fire you so don't come thinking your not going to do any work"
good,"On a typical day I would be given a set of tasks that would have to be done regardless of the hours scheduled for me. It was always the same tasks while handling immediate tasks given by other co workers. I learned how to manage my time, and get tasks done very quickly and adapt to new tasks.The management did not know I was underage for most of the tasks I was doing and if I were to get injured, it could have been a large law suit to the company. My co- workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part about my job was having to have everything done because the progress I made depended on other people. The most enjoyable part is meeting and helping new people"
good,"It was a good experience but I do not recommend the Antioch branch. I gained a lot more knowledge in retail, but management here was ever changing and the current store manager is not up for promoting any one who is not her friend."
good,Upper management in certain departments finds it hard to let go and allow the employees to perform their jobs on their own.
good,"Overall my experience with Smart and Final, I found that its going to require to retrain most of the management. To insure they know how to take responsibility for their actions instead of blaming others. The Corporate officials need to open their eyes and see most employees are seriously mistreated."
good,"Start off by breaking down and separating Load onto U-boats, then pushing them to their respective aisles. Once load is broken down, we begin working whats on the floor and Bale cardboard as we finish each aisle. Breaks are taken inbetween the shifts. Once everything has been stocked, overstock is thrown up on the overheads, and then we begin conditioning the store. After that, store is swept and spot mopped before the store is opened."
good,"I get to work around 4:30am and start my job, Iam the back room receiving manger, and key care so that means i do back receiving loads from vendors, and also run the front when needed. I have learned to be a great hard worker so i can move up. I hardest part of my job would be getting Fulltime, I have been with Smart & Final for over 5 years and have grown in my positions from working night crew, to deli, freezer, know to part management. I would love to work more hours."
good,Constant different schedules due to sick calls and no show. Poor communication of management with promises and lack of support for their employees . No life balance for families unless you don’t care on what hours you need to live on
good,Corporate is constantly wanting people to do more with less hours. Doing the work of 2 - 3 people IS NOT my idea of a good working relationship with ANY Company.
good,"If you are willing to work hard and want to move up in the company it is possible, they do ask and want a lot from there employees to get everything done and ready by a certain time, the managers do help a lot in getting stuff done and more or a leader then just a boss they tend to lead by example not by just ordering people around, they will work around your schedule to make sure that you’re priority’s are first."
good,"Upper management very professional, District management very unprofessional and Store managers are weak and not very knowledgeable . The work is easy but you better have a grasp on the supermarket industry because although they say that they provide training, there is none.They pretty much just gave me a box cutter and told me to work. Luckily I walked in with 30 plus years experience."
good,"My manager was not professional. I did not feel I was treated well, and I chose not to continue to work for the company because of the management that they hired."
good,Takes forever to get your raise after you get a promotion. Hours are very random. It is very competitive. Very stressful on some days where others are very relaxed. Very customer dependent.
good,"You’d constantly have to speak with management about your checks missing hours. Never had safety meetings, goals for the day, favoritism, management unorganized"
good,"-Being a cashier at Smart & Final isn't horrible but there are many things that play a role in it being very stressful."
good,"An averaged work day was lifting and throwing any where from 300lb to 1000lb in the meat department. For a cashier is was helping customers, cleaning, putting up end caps and of course working the register. Learned point of sales. Most of the management were great and knew what they're doing, but they didn't work well with each other. Hardest part of working was having to do a meat load that weighed a ton by yourself. Seeing the regulars made work enjoyable."
good,Management is pretty good enjoy meeting new people. Looking for something better more stable that can help me take care of my family. Tired of struggling living paycheck 2 paycheck.
good,"Management is great however they lack benefits, promotions and salary raises. I've learned how to provide better customer service quality on a daily basis."
good,Get to interact with customers and help them with any of there issues and needs. Help stock and organize all items in the store to make it look more presnatable
good,"If the team is all about team work.the job will be a peace of cake. If not, everyone is basically working by themselves. That just adds stress on you because if you're a lead and have no help it gets stressful. Especially during Holidays or sporting events."
good,"Can be tedious at times as you are constantly stocking the same shelves night after night. Although, with the tedium comes consistency, you know exactly what you are going to be doing every night."
good,"I didn't like the work environment there. The manger always playing  games making pick up there slack no team work , low pay everyone  complains good job if your in highschool."
good,Work load is very strainious and overwhelming. Management can and will be very tough on employees to work harder than recommended time giving per assignment
good,There is no typical day at smart and final stores.. its always exciting doing task and handling customers needs. The coolest thing that I learned is how to multitask and time management  so things would get the task done on time. The hardest part of the job sometimes when there are not enough staff on the busiest days. The enjoyable part of the job is you will meet different people and encounter different customers attitude. Over all experience was good because it made me a leader and able to now conquer any task that would be given to me.
good,"I worked for them for nearly seven years at a location they neglected every chance they got. I believe they cut corners where they can to make themselves more profitable every chance they get."
good,"Most of my day was throwing freight (manditory) the other part was finding time to do the manager portion of your job. The demand on your time is unlike most jobs, and if they still have the score card monthly review system be careful."
good,* i usually come in to relive someone off their shift and usually the closer of the night and from that point out is calm and easy going. in my time i have worked at this company my patience level has increased and i have learned to time manage with other employees schedules and delegate breaks and lunches
good,"I didn't get many hours, roughly 15 hours a week. I asked for more hours and didn't receive them, no matter how many times i brought the subject up to the management. I was left to operate a bailer with no assistance, even when i had little knowledge of how to operate it. When i ask for assistance from a coworker, it took them 5-10 minuets to assist me. A waste of time working there, and minimal effort from the employees."
good,"A typical day included friendly customers, employees, and working hard. I learned good customer service skills and a stronger work ethic. Management was poor. The manager was always forgetting things. My co-workers were all very nice and all hard workers. My job wasn't very difficult, the freezer was a little cold and made it a little difficult to work in but it was nothing I couldn't manage. And the most enjoyable part of my job really was just the sense of working hard and earning something."
good,I would do a lot more than my work description and customer service was the most difficult and entertaining. My favorite part of my job were my regulars and the conversations I had with my costumers.
good,Learned to work in a fast paced environment. Cash handling skills. A lot of customer interactions. 
good,"Fast pace and hard labor. However, pay is good and benefits are wonderfull. Difficulty getting time off and strick schedules are not preffered. They want access to you at all times."
good,"The place was pretty productive and it taught me some things about customer service when I was in high school. Although there was hardly and culture about it. The place was just dull. The most hardest was to keep track of the task your assigned with from collecting carts to go backs, but it was certainly most enjoyable since it was challenge I couldn't back down. In the end the place taught me some experience with customers although not much/"
good,Wouldn't recommend Smart and Final for family oriented individuals.  This job requires alot of effort and dedication away from home and very fast pace..
good,When go in I stretch first then I walk the store to see. How it look. I walk to  restroom to see want it needs. Then I walk warehouse to see want I need git the mop I supplied to clean the restrooms. After cleaning bathrooms then start sweeping the floor. When I'm finish sweeping . I take a machine to clean the floor.
good,"The hardest part of the job was how perfect you had to do the job. I"
good,Smart & Final is a good company to work for but unfortunately it is becoming less cultured in the ways of growth and employee relations. I do not feel I was provided the necessary tools to properly perform my job. Management did a wonderful job but unfortunately I do not believe corporate has the in store employees in their best interests.
good,It’s a pretty stressful job but the people are all great. All you need to do is what you’re told and there will never be a problem. It’s not super hectic working at smart and final
good,"Every employee working there complains about how bad it sucks till you start to see it. Unless you threaten to quit they will not raise your hours. You're never on just one position they have you everywhere at once, its not like a typical job where they'd have somebody to cover you, they put you on 3-4 very fast paced positions or cashier and expect you to complete all tasks at a high level of performance."
good,"I learned how to work fast, get tasks and the job done. Make everything look presentable for the public. I also learned new ways of talking to people, being helpful when needed."
good,"Overall, the schedule flexibility that is allowed to you, by the company, is a plus when it comes to trying to balance work, school, and home life. The wage that the company offers isn't remotely comparable to the cost of living, but adequate for the job duties. Dealing with the general public can be stressful and seemingly unrewarding, but there are some shinning moments of humanity in the customers you service."
good,It's a good place but they lack leadership or they have to many people in charge telling the same person different things i like to use the phrase too many chief's and not enough Indians. I also noticed they run around like chicken without a head. But overall not a bad place to work or to gain work experience.
good,Almost never has any help. they have people that call off all the time bug the management is to lazy to try to fire them. we are busy but never have enough key carriers.
good,"There isn't much space to grow, but the environment is perfect for a first job to gain experience and be able to look for better opportunities. Customer service is key."
good,A typical day at work would usually be fast paced and busy. I learn how to deal with all types of customers everyday. The management team at my job is great. The hardest part of my job is when i see an unsatisfied customer.
good,No real dress code. Laid back after hours work load usually 4 coworkers just do truck load and stocking. Easy job stocking inventory and organizing the store. Employee Discount
good,Have worked at several different stores and policies change at each one. Some of the managers don’t have a clue. Attendance is a very big thing. If you work hard and show an interest to learn their is opportunities for advancement.
good,I hang tags and scan product but never get extra help on ad day. I asked to get someone to train just in case something happened. They dont want to train nobody.
good,I come to work with a upbeat attitude. Ill check the freezer to see what I have to restock. If I get called to check people out then I head to the front to do that. what i've learned is patience. Management is ok. Everyone is nice. and the hardest part of the job is getting caught up on work.
good,Shift is predictable. Management is okay. fast paced. Friendly co-workers. They don't pay much attention to detail. Flexible hours. Different departments to work for.
good,Smart and final is a part time job the hours are not secure and it's very stressful and it's hard to move up and most managers are unfair but it's a an okay job for a part time I guess
good,was a good expeirence. learned alot aboutr customer service Managers where very professional. work hrs. were perfect. worked with me to have flexable sheaduile
good,"just do your job and your going to be fine, always be on time thats a big thing for them, help others if its needed, dont say thats not my job be a team player"
good,"Everyday is something new in the store, which is fun. Can be stressful at times but overall its a good job. in 8 hours you get a 30 minute lunch and also 2 ten minute breaks,"
good,Can get very stressful at times because of call outs or being short staffed. There are many opportunities for advancing if you work hard and want to move up in the company.
good,While they talk about teamwork I have found most if not all cases you are left to your own devices.I have seen departments work without help even when clearly needed because we only have the minimum requirement of employees present. They give you a list of items that needs to be completed by the end of your shift.
good,"My co-workers was awesome and we worked together so closely as family for the ultimate goal being to provide top customer service, as well as, profitability for the company."
good,"Good place for a first job, minimum wage. flexible hours. Not much space to grow."
good,"A customer couldn't find the item he wanted to purchase, so i ask him"" if he needed help ! and he said yes, so i did. I then found his item and he then took the time to advice my manager the way i help him."
good,Through my experience from working at this location i find that there arent many opportunities to grow and advance. Its a place that will keep you working but lack in taking care of its employees.
good,"Busy,Busy on the go all the time, very busy store. I learned to better multitask, time management, and get things done with very minimal help. Co-workers are good people to work with. Hardest part would be getting everything done."
good,"all the employees seem to get along and care for each other welfare. "
good,"As service, I enjoyed working at the daily department, produce department, freezer department, and loading. I also enjoyed with customer service, like helping people."
good,Manager always talked down to people. Made me follow her around any time I wanted to talk about anything work related even if I came outside of my work time. They look for quantity of workers instead of quality. The only thing that made it tolerable was some of the coworkers but that's about it.
good,"Decent job . Most product is bulk, so heavy to move, but doable. Pay is better than other grocery  stores I work/have worked. Over night shift  is best,  no people to deal with."
good,This was a decent and somewhat helpful experience and the workers were courteous and the customers were mostly polite. The store was also mostly organized.
good,"The break room was only big enough for one person and was always dirty, Homeless people slept in the parking lot and management did nothing about it, and coworkers goofed off all day."
good,"A day on the job can consist of working multiple departments and cashiering at the same time."
good,"overall it is a good job, perfect part-time job for high school or college students, hours are flexible and schedule can be adapted to the employees'."
good,"As far as cashiering goes it was not a horrible job. The community around the location wasn't always the best as to be expected. Management was not great, favoritism was rampant and people got passed for promotions simply because they weren't liked the most (I did not want to move up and preferred to stay where I was because of this). Overall not awful but not great either."
good,great  job for college students.flexability. teamwork. opportunity to move up quick.fair with there employees. Good first job for starters. Always learning new things.
good,"Personally, customer traffic was the most overwhelming part of it all."
good,"While the store is quite an amazement, it is hard to say that they are flexible about hours needed per week. They treat their employees with gratitude but are short to understand how there must be more understanding between fellow coworkers."
good,It was easy at first but hard afterward when new people in management came and wanted so much just from one person I didn't like it and the team effort was lost
good,"Is ok. The place is average. Regular day is working 5 to 7 hours shifts, 4 days a week. The warehouse is clean and organize. Supervisor are Ok, the give out reviews every week or month."
good,The labor is crazy insane 3 ppl on loadcrew that has to kill like 10 to an estimate 14 pallets daily and face the whole entire story I mean I don't even know how that's even legal if you can't even do OT these expectation from these managers our little bit too high. Especially for new coworkers that just got thrown into low crew.
good,"Smart & Final is a great place for students or for anyone looking for part-time work. As a company they are flexible with hours, and the workload is not physically exhausting. Although the job has its pluses, the job is not a career and room for advancement is limited."
good,"Work the tables, fill them make them look nice, the job is not hard but the managers do make it hard they want you to finish fast, sometimes is not even worth doing the job."
good,Managers & Co-workers are pleasant to work with. Is an extremely busy environment but your shift goes by fast so that makes it nice. I really liked working there.
good,it was an okay job for my first job I was 15 so I was making money so at the time I was happy but as time goes on I realized it wasn't worth it it was poorly paid and the work was hard
good,"I started off learning how to use power equipment, then slowly transitioned into running orders at a timely fashion, wrapping finished work and delivering it to dock"
good,Learned a lot about customers service and employees were very helpful and so was management. It also helped me be detailed Oriented and more responsible.
good,"Not much really to say, the job is rather lackluster with very little going on. Some days are busy some are slow and if you are looking for a job where you can go in work your day and go home without looking back, this is the place."
good,"company was good to me while i was working there, no big issue as long you came to do your work.n management was also good, lots of people moved up just as i did."
good,This store was a challenge to work for. The management was hard to get along with. as a store they are fine to shop at but not the best to work for. the end
good,The work given at Smart and Final was alright for a service clerk and the pay was minimum wage which was fair as it was a starting job position who is trying to get some work experience.
good,"Its a learning job for young people, not much room for excelling if your looking to make good momey and have solid steady hours unless Your full time but they hardly ever offer unless you become part of management."
good,Was real fun until management sold out and took away incentive besides that putting stars orders was pretty cool when you noticed you go to the store and you pulled that order
good,very fast paced work enviornment...there is a lot of overtie available even though ost times it is not optional. Very good wages and fun people to be around
good,Todos los compañeros son solidarios y apoyan al personal de nuevo ingreso.
good,"Everyday you work and rush the entire shift trying to get all the things they want you to finish but becasue lack of employees you never finish everything ontime and are basically forced to work overtime."
good,There is little to review about this company.  I was a permanent employee. my position was a sales associate. I worked there for 8-9 years.  there were no benefits for parttime employees
good,on bad days its very slow paced and boring. But most the time you are walking back and fourth doing the same thing stocking the same shelves. Most of the time you will enjoy it but then again if your not interested in working there you will not like it.
good,long hours i learned a lot about hard work the management was far and good the hardest part of the job was selecting and making sure to meet the minimum quota
good,"Worked for great managers, worked for horrible managers. Hard to have a life our of work when schedule is all over. Physically demanding. Mentally draining."
good,It was a good work experience with a lot of friendly co-workers. If I ever had a question on how to do something all I had to was ask and they gladly help.
good,"Late with payrolls "
good,"Good customer service of learning different aspect of people, different locations in store as well as what is sold and what is not, fun and serious good and bad"
good,work start of good every moring I clock in in at 5 starting my night . I have to deal with coworker that don't like to do anything I pick up after other some time. I get a brake around 7 chill in the back for a bet drink water to relax. 15 min are up I go back to work fill up the milk deal with customer all the time management help when they can.
good,"standard workplace, very normal. could be better, needs to have better management and its a corpoaration over all. Low pay, i rarely got pay raises, but the work itsel was very easy."
good,"Team player, fast learner, meet new people, there's always new  employees coming  & going, everybody treats u fair tot can learn new departments if u want to."
good,"Cashiering is fairly easy and only gets hectic around holidays and certain spiked times of day. I learned great customer service skills as a cashier there. The company itself is great and you have opportunities to move to different departments or management positions, but the one thing that broke my store was the management. It is definitely a team/family environment, and because the store management was lacking it caused the whole store to lack as well. If the management/coworkers are great, it's a pretty solid company to work for."
good,Store manager had favorites. Would work other non-hard working employees less and hard working employees to the extreme. Some and most employees did not get a break.
good,"Overall the store is a good place to work. Basic grocery store environment, customer service is a key element because of all the customers that come in to shop."
good,"If you are not related to someone or know someone you will struggle to move up. When there’s openings for a higher position you have to reapply. Most of the time they already have someone in mind. They also have you multitasking, you can be baking and all of a sudden they call you to get shopping carts from the parking lot."
good,"Had a great manager, but corporate did not understand how stores operate on a day to day basis. Fast paced environment in which a person can really learn a lot."
good,good place to work if u want to go back to school or have a second job they can work around your hours for both but you don't get as many hours as you would hope to
good,it was a great run at smar n final...but it was time for me to work a job that appriciate my skills although the managers were nice to me i will defitnatley return if they offered me more time and hours
good,the job was okay but only thing is that my salary was low there was stressful days and i learned how to stack and help out customers and did cleaning to maintain the work area clean.
good,"A typical day consists of fast paced environment for the majority of the day with little to no break. One of the hardest parts of the job is having to work a morning shift after working a closing shift the previous night. However, with all that being said working at Smart & Final you obtain a knowledge of how shrink works and learn how to take inventory."
good,"Working at Smart and Final was moderate. Sometimes stressful, overworked and under paid. and the store can be understaffed. 10 minute breaks are usually cut short because of their being not enough cashiers. the pay is not good for the work accommodations. Management is ok. More favoritism than hard work for opportunity to move up. Workers are usually good. I learned most in customer service being able to multi task and work several different departments."
good,had a nice weight room onsite i enjoyed that perk... they also had a voluntary time off and incentive system i liked. only issue was it was part time for most of the year until the heavy season
good,Was an okay job working at for awhile but walking up and down the aisles until your lunch break is just painful. But i would still work at Smart & Final just because i would still have a job.
good,Only worked there to fill in a gap before I joined the Military. stocked shelves and checked inventory throughout the day and maintained. clean up of isles
good,"I've moved up fast , working on sundays is cool  & the discount is cool. lots to do & learn which you will. flexible hours. the dress code isn't bad. the hours of operation are great aswell"
good,Lots of growth.  Keep working hard and you'll advance.  like to promote from within.  Many new store openings for all types of positions available.  Give it what you got!
good,Good place to work and the hours are flexible. there are a lot of things to stock making the store hard to maintain. Management is good and listens. there are overnight hours that are good for me working another job and going to school.
good,I learn some new things at smart And Final it was a very excellent sipirings to learn over there . The management is very good and very excellent service that they have .
good,"Smart and Final is a great job for a person looking for their first job. Working for Smart and Final will allow you the opportunity to gain customer service, cashier, and stocking experience."
good,"I've have learned  a lot from working at Smart&final, I have learned to communicate very well with people. I acquitted many new skill, such as learning how to keep the store presettable, answering calls and being able to help out the customer on the phone."
good,"Fairly efficient working environment but had to change jobs due to moving. Overall, not a bad place to work. I would have kept working there but I moved too far away."
good,"it was a simple place to work, with co workers that were easy to get along with. You could advance in the work place very quickly if you follow orders well."
good,"A typical work day at smart and final would be very busy lots of food customers and noise lol, loyal customers, its employees stocking shelves lifting and throwing boxes keeping things in order and keeping the front end clean moving pallets answering phones. Its a very diverse setting and good spirits, what i learned is  how to stay calm when dealing with a irate customer and how to still respect someone who can disrespect me with out being irrate. my co workers are funny funny and serious when the time is needed, there was nothing that was the hardest part of my job. the most enjoyable part of the job is me training new employees i love to help them learn new things, My customers are enjoyable because ive gained a somewhat personal relationship with them so when we interact its excitement."
good,"I hand a good work expenses , All was smiling and have fun with my co-workers get the job done that was need and then some time we have bad days when people come and leave stuff ever were and when it was a rain day and have to go get the shopping carts"
good,"I felt important to the company at the beginning, because the store just opened. After they cut my hours from 40 hours to 16 hours in a matter of a week, I knew I couldn't survive on that income."
good,"Being the produce lead and receiver, I had to finish a lot of my co-works job for them. our work had to be done by the end of our shifts, if not we would be written up. The job was very demanding but learned a lot."
good,this company is pretty good for a part-time job. it has a good work environment  and great staff to work with. its work really rely on keeping the store looking great and creating good customer service with the customers.
good,"management sucked, no room to grow, in order to get  raise you have to work one million years and will only get ten cents, not enough employees"
good,"Es una empresa donde se trabaja en familia,"
good,"Days are busy and full.  Multi tasking is a big part of this job which may be considered by some to be the hardest part of the job.  Time frames to be met also may be considered a hard thing to do, but it all comes into play with experience.  At the end of the day when you've met your accomplishments it's very rewarding."
good,checked out costumers and cleaned around my area. good management and co-workers.
good,"Decent place to work. Typical Grocery store atmosphere. Co-workers  are all decent hard working people. Quick turnover at lower positions (High School kids). 4 Store managers in a span of 6 months. Corporate's first priority is profit, last is employee morale."
good,"Through out my day I Helped customers find their items, push their carts and put away there purchases into there vehicle. Another task for this job was stocking shelfs and managing the restrooms to make sure they were sanitary."
good,Smart and FInal was very fast paced but it was ok because i like a challenge. I liked be able to interact with people and help others. My work days always changed sometimes id work nights and mornings. 
good,"Working at Smart & Final has been okay for the most part. I did gain knowledge on working the different departments they have such as freezer, produce, shipping & receiving. The majority of the employees are good people."
good,Being the last face the customers seen before they left the store. I was able to meet alot of people. Fast work place during holidays seasons.
good,"culture oriented, company standards not aligned, associate training and development good, pay rates above average"
good,I feel like our distrixt manager feels we dont need as many employees because we work at a small store but since its right by thr beach we get a lot of traffic. Of she wpuldnt know that because she just comes in to criticize everything when the stores slow in the morning and then shes gone before rush hour starts. My store get a small amount of hours vecause were a small store and full timers get priority. As a part timer this means that i could get 40 hpurs a week like i was in the begining. But when we get less hours for our store it means mine get cut. And ive worked when we only have 2 cashiers scheduled for the night ahift because of this. We cant get our clising duties and check out the customers at the same time. Its just a hectic environment amd theres no one to call because theres literally no one else but the closing manager and two cashiers for lines that dont end for an hour. It ridiculous
good,I was employed through my school for a part time summer job. It was a good work experience working with the public and discovering how this corporate entity operates.
good,Communication integrity respect value and compassion Is what ive learned from the job. Being able to have customers tell me their day have been made means everything!
good,"I was able to apply with minimal work experience and develop several skills, along with a fair wage. I had great managers during my time there and was happy to do my job."
good,"mystery shopper every monday"
good,"place was okay to work at. job was easy, the customers were fine. took a bit to get promotion,  management was ok, workers were cool, employee discount is not bad"
good,The company is very productive and will never find yourself getting bored. Management could be better in terms of actually managing store operations. However they are all still very supportive and nice.
good,"Overall working at Smart and Final was a good experience, i was able to increase my customer service experience since you interact with customers all day in your shift. Different departments to advance in, yet only a few employees are full-time the rest are part-time with mediocre hours."
good,"This is a place where it’s capable to gain more knowledge about the retail industry. Management is great, just have to prove that you can do the job. Being open to do any project and doing a good job will go a long way."
good,"Fast pace job, can be stressful, friendly customer service is a must, always start you off as part time, can be difficult to acquire a full time position. Pay can be good but but smart n final can suck the life out of you."
good,I worked here in my younger years and I was doing stocking and back then It was a crew of us and we all got along and we had a great time and had a very good work relationship for the most part and I was proud to be apart of the Smart and final family
good,"My store had great coworkers and staff who were all great people to work with. Management were very flexible with people who worked part-time or had to leave on emergencies. Although, it can be hectic because my store specifically was one of the busiest in the entire district. It was an old store too and suffered from many structural issues (that I think are now being worked on since I left). Workers do get a 10% employee discount card on all purchases made in the store, which is great. Plus, if you have to move to another location, Smart and Final can accommodate you to work in other store where you plan to live. Hardest part of the job was working irregular hours and dealing with unsatisfied customers. Most enjoyable part of the job were the incredible memories I shared with people working at our grocery store."
good,"Stressful place to work at. Never enough associates to help you out. Most of the time customers are angry having to wait in long lines. But to be honest,I like what I do. Most customers are usually cheerful an happy to see me. I've been there 13 years, I know most of them. I would miss them if I have to leave."
good,Ive learn you to work at a fast pace and follow directions with no attitude. Hardest part of the job is getting the job done in a timely manner. The best part i enjoyed was taking my break.
good,Worked here for 10 years it's a job and my pay is decent now but sometimes management does not recognize hard work. Can be cut throats at times have seen a lot of people moved up who did not deserve it.
good,"Smart and Final is not a horrible company. I have been there seven years and management was able to work around my schedule and I was able to finish six years of school while striving to graduate with my bachelors. However, the typical day at work isn't always the best especially when being overspent and having to try and finish the daily work load in less than eight hours."
good,"the most enjoyable thing about my job was the smiles we put on our customers face, and the work staff feels more like a family instead of"
good,"No day is typical, as it all depends on the ad that week and what one's shift is. Management varies from store to store, with some being willing to do whatever it takes to move up, even if it includes throwing others under the bus."
good,"I had 5 different job titles, which I loved because when hours were not available I could do other jobs within the company. Plus, I love to learn and self motivated to learn all the ins and outs of the company by doing different jobs. A typical day would consist of supervising and training new and current employees on specials and changes. Along with serving app. 75-100 customers daily providing them with excellent customer service. Answering phones, taking Togo orders and when problems occur I am the first order of problem solving ensuring the customer leaves satisfied and happy to return. Depending on the job I was doing that day for instance if I was a Line Cook the day id a bit different  I would start off by prepping and cleaning my line for my shift and part of the next shift production. I would also cook half of the restaurants meals for that shift including special orders at a fast pace. This was my first job I learned many many things like the whole ins and out of what it takes to run a restaurant on a cooperate level. I started off as a hostess for a month and then quickly moved up to a waitress and a CEO Trainer. "
good,"this job was kind of all over the place the people running it didnt do a very good job at preventing overstock, but the people were nice and i believe you can learn something from any situation whether its something to do or what not to do"
good,"A typical day at work would include locking up the store, working the check out process, receiving the truck load, breaking down the load, delivering each merchandise to its rightful place, facing the store, and making a bale of shipping boxes. I learned my data entry and management skills at this job. My management was very focused on organization and profit margins. My co-workers were friendly and took direction well. The hardest part of the job was working night shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming a successful manager."
good,Was a great company at one point but has lost track of its Mission statement. Company is just trying to stay afloat.
good,GOOD company  and lots of training. At times some stores can be a little slow.
good,"Get to learn a lot of ways to react with associates and customers, lot of departments to what fits associates and training."
good,My lead crew member was fantastic. Knew his job responsibilities in and out and was terrific at time management. He taught me something new almost every shift and was a pleasure to work with. My assistant manager was great. I felt i could ask him anything and communicate any concerns I had. He recognized my hard work and told me so. I enjoyed the work environment very much and ly still.be working there had it not been for the manage of this particular store. He qasnt the qorst boss id ever had? He seemed uninterested inanythingnthat took extra effort. I was often overlooked and never discussed with regarding the atore. Im not aure if this was because I was the only femake working an all male night crew.
good,"Good place to work, if you enjoy the food department. Would recommended to people who like to wake up early and enjoy the food department. Solid place overall."
good,Such an inconsistent place to work. Once you get up to any form of management they transfer you to different stores on a moment's notice. Some times you have a great manager sometimes you get a less than desirable one. Benefits are great if you are full time. The stores run on minimal help to keep costs down and its demanding on the employees. Nowadays you get so many underperforming millenials working here. You have so many sick calls and it's no big deal to them.
good,A typical day at this job would be me coming in after school around 3:30 and leaving at 7:30. The staff was really nice and i got along with them fine and the pay was a fair amount.
good,"Pay was better compared to other locations. Still could not keep paying my living on the salary I was receiving. Still had good coworkers and a very good starting manager. "
good,"is a privilege working with smart and final, they are a great company."
good,its a decent place to work it just wasnt right for me because your never guranteed the same hours and the schedule is never steady it changes every week
good,You learn a lot as well as great job training.Love the fresh free water.Fast pace great prices.Clean floors and rest rooms.Some one all ways ready to help.
good,Good place to work as a growing company!  opportunities for advancement if you work hard.  Many new store openings in the upcoming years.  Still lots of room for growth.  They like to promote from within.
good,"a day at smart and final is busy, at the end of it you'll be tired. very standard job. hours can be long at time and short on others, overall a good place to get started."
good,I worked there for about 8 months before a new manager arrived and he was the entire reason I quit. I was given nothing but 4am shifts even after explaining and proving I had medical reasons to not be given those shifts but he still continued to push them on me.
good,"Smart And Final Stores is a very fast pace growing company. On a daily basis, I would analyze security data using Splunk as well as other resources. Perform releases using either AirWatch or Subversion/TSVN. Troubleshoot Configuration Items with developers when needed. On a certain day, I go play basketball with associates from other departments during lunch time. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to resolve Configuration issues. My recent greatest accomplishment was completing the 2016 PCI Compliance."
good,"A typical day at work for me is signing into work on the punch machine, going to a register and signing in then ringing up items for customers that they wish to purchase.  I am supposed to take three breaks, two ten minutes and one lunch--30 minute break. I have learned how to ring people up with our cash register system and do duties within it. Management is okay but sometimes they don't have enough people for the amount of work and the flow that there is. My coworkers are willing to help but tend to flee as fast as they can.  The hardest part of my job for me is having to be in the same place for several hours and barely getting to move or do anything else. The most enjoyable part is the banter with coworkers and customers. I love customer service when everyone is being nice."
good,"Store level, management are supportive and demonstrates a strong sense of camaraderie."
good,A usual day consists of standing in place for a few hours and processing transactions with customers. We're required to multitask. Speed and efficiency are required for this store. Our management is very friendly and helpful but immensely overwhelmed. Some employees are more experienced but some are more skilled. The hardest part has to be customer service. The elderly are the most difficult to work with. There is nothing enjoyable about working in a store.
good,Smart and Final was able to pay me a decent amount for my labor.  The employees were all nice.  The customers were excellent as well.
good,I worked with many people in a fast pace stocked many different items also worked the register when needed.
good,"very easy job, staff is great and hard working. hours vary with your schedule. For the most part you are stocking and helping customers finding certain items. Every Sunday, we get an extra $3.00 an hour. There was 4 deliveries in a week and the back room must be kept clean."
good,It's a great place to work if they were better at seeing things for the reserved instead of taking other people's word for it they should appreciate people more
good,"If you do not have prior grocery/ retail experience, expect to spend a time in the minimum wage or close to minimum wage area. The environment with coworkers is enjoyable, but there is a fair amount of the blame game."
good,I feel working here is fun but times it’s nit really worth the 30 min drive considering I only make 13$ an hour. Over all certain management team members are really nice.
good,"Worked at Smart & Final while going to school, they paid decent for a 17 year old college student living at home. would come into work at 2 am stock shelves, around opening if busy would help on the cash register and helped build displays. There wasn't really a hard/enjoyable part about the job. management was good."
good,"A great job to work at where other team members are nice and encouraging, great happy atmosphere Overall fun place to work with constant work to be done"
good,Working here sometimes can be a good environment and sometimes it can be stressful. it can be unorganized in the way that people do not communicate often so sometimes they forget other things need to get done. Constant over ordering and overfilling overheads.
good,"A typical day would be interacting with customers needs, what I've accomplished is how fast you want to move up in the company. Your co workers all work together as a team, the hardest part of the day would be not knowing what to do the most enjoyable is being a part of the team environment."
good,"friendly employes , good costomers   had a great expirence   no stress ,easy work , day goes by fast , its never too much work  , fun envirment, learn new things"
good,"A typical day was easy going work flow, i learned a lot about food handling. I had a wonderful staff the hardest part would be holidays, the best part is talking to cheifs and people in the food industruy"
good,"Same routine every day."
good,Didn’t love it didn’t absolutely hate it. I just didn’t like working there anymore but it’s good for a first time job. Would recommend part time but definitely didn’t want to stay there any longer.
good,Smart & Final is a fun work place to do stock / Retail you have to have very good customer service and also make sure to be a team player with the workers you have around you.
good,"This job was very encouraging to people who were working towards advancing their education or advancing into management. The work environment can vary from store to store, however my manager was wonderful to everyone who worked under him. If you are a good worker, you are appreciated. My most enjoyable part of the job was implementing my education to improve multiple areas of the workplace as well as earning the respect of my collegues through hard work and networking."
good,"Smart and Final is a great starting point for entering the work life. i personally wouldn't make it a career, it was a fun job that did help build my customer service skill but not much room for growth in the company."
good,"Need more opportunities to advance "
good,"The point of this internship was to help me understand what it's like in the working world. And now thanks to that, I have a very firm understanding."
good,cool place to work at a lot of opportunities for advancement. work great with scheduling if you have school or another job
good,Work way to much for little pay stress you out to much stress not enough team effort or support from the management team don't teach you the proper skills to be amazing at your job
good,Smart an Final is a very busy and hardworking job. People usually come to smart an final for the best deals and nice people. This job has helped me work on my multi tasking and customers satisfaction.
good,smart and final is a great work place to work for your first time work. i love working for smart and final its fun. smart and final shows you how to communicate with the customer and show you how to stock the shelf's.
good,"I am the evening management in charge. I am in charge of cashiering, managing my other team members, customer service, load, stocking and cash handling. i have to be able to multitask as well as have excellent time management when giving lunches breaks and when most of my cashing staff has left. The hardest part would be making sure that i am taking care of everyone's needs including the customer in the best manor possible. the most enjoyable are my evening staff and my frequent neighborhood customers, every one is very friendly and pleasant makes the work day exciting."
good,"Smart & Final is definitely the SMART way to shop here in this town and the surrounding areas. Prices are comparatively lower than Vons, plus you can buy in bulk, without the bulk hitting your wallet to hard.😊"
good,"it was a good first job, i learned a lot working here. management could have done a better job in communication. all in all it was decent work for decent pay."
good,"It was good, my store closed so I got transferred to Diamond Bar but if my original store did not close I would still be there. It was always busy which is good, I liked the fast pace of it, the hardest part of the job was getting used to the overnight shifts. But the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the excellent staff."
good,"Everyday at work was a hustle, I would make sure I always finish my work before hand and to find something else to work on. I've learned how to work in a fast paced manner. The hardest part of the job was, i had to help out the service clerks to get carts while working on my load. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of getting my load done."
good,"difficult place to work with management, and coworkers standing all day can be stressfull and hard. customers are rude and a lot of theft happening. can be easy if you are not looking to advance"
good,"Typical day at the register, to me it was kind of boring because i was just standing in one spot throughout my shift just ringing people up."
good,not a great job culture management clearly needs more work in motivating there employees to work and get the best from each and everyone apart of there team
good,"Unorganized, hours were not consistent. You can't depend on getting good hours. Poor management. Type day as a cashier, handling money and working with people. Hardest part was controlling lines with no help from other cashiers walking store or management."
good,"But they leave a few things to be desired. At least for whats acceptable for a grocery store. Nothing is particularly bad though and if you'd work at any grocer, Smart and Final is about as good as any, really."
good,Good place to work and a friendly staff. Customer are mostly nice and respectful. Upper managment is sometime over baring and has lack of time management when giving out task
good,people and managers were awesome. jobs were delegated fairly everyone respected the store as well as their co workers.
good,You must be able to be constantly on your feet. Really nice cow-workers and a nice community. Must be able to work fast since customers expect fast service at the register.
good,"Every shift there was  some type of communication with customers. To me, communicating with the customers everyday and being able to assist them was the most enjoyable part."
good,Great platform to learn a lot and move on to a new chapter in life. I learned a lot of great things to help give me the tools to use my skills in a different industry.
good,"My issues have been with management being willing to give me hours in the time frames in which I am available to work. There seems to be an unspoken rule that if you are not able to come in around the clock, you will be skipped over and left out on getting more hours that you require. That, is my biggest concern with this place of business."
good,"Rush, Rush ,Rush no time to chit chat, cleanliness is next to godliness the cleaner and more presentable the area is more business seems to pour in. managers have no alone time they are constantly busy making sure there store is in tip top shape"
good,es bueno pero a la vez llegas y como que cada quien anda en su rollo todos te quieren mandar a algunos se les favorece mas que a otros y a unos nada si haces algo bueno por la empresa ningun premio te dan y si no haces nada peor aun algunos son muy criticones se meten con tu vida personal algunos no les gusta obedecer ordenes pero bueno que le hacemos asi es el trabajo
good,I learned how to restock items and order the store. I helped prep the store for inventory and learned how to use the stand up fork lift and electric pallet jack.
good,"Hard part of the day was when coworkers dont show to work then your plan changes , I learn that am capable of managing in the worst case scenario, I could get and execute an estragety."
good,This job consisted of me working the cash register and assisting customers in making sure that they had what they needed and that they were satisfied overall this job was a good job it gave me good hours and paid well for its time
good,"help costumers check out, loud and do carrie-outs,bring in carts, help people find stuff. I'm learning how to speak Spanish and communicate with people who I don't understand. I'm also learning how to look on both sides of a problem. It is a fast pace environment with lots of people."
good,"It was a big store, so I was always keeping busy in that store. The co-workers were pretty friendly and fun. Management was never really into communicating unless they need us to do something for them."
good,"The hardest part of the job trying not to get overwhelmed and the early hours. "
good,"This job starts off at 17.51 and is a decent job to have ."
good,Scanned customers items and used a cash register.  Cleaned and stocked during down time.  Hardest part was standing all day and most enjoyable was talking to customers.
good,"I was the opening cashier so i had the same routine every day, I would clock in and get right to work. Wiping down the belts, making sure the bags were full on all registers.Stock the candy and sodas. I got along and loved all my co-workers. Some managers were more understanding than others.Enjoyable part of the job would be just helping my customers to their cars if i could. The hardest part for me would be when the lines start getting long and your co workers are taking their time. I feel my face turning tomatp red all pressure on me."
good,"I had the best manager I have ever worked for at this job. Due to the amazing nature of this manager he made working there an absolute joy despite the low pay and advancement, poor working hours of grocery and the micromanaging nature of grocery."
good,"Company is expanding, however, the opportunity for advancement is very slow."
good,I was part time worked first shift and was the worst days to work only two days a week saturdays and mondays
good,"This is a good company to work in only if your looking for a part time job. Something that will get you started. Not as a career unless that what you want. This particular job is very heavy on your back. If you work in this type of job for many years like I did you will know what I mean. There are many people in this company that have worked their for many years and they are in the same position, because there is no where to go or you just comfortable with the pay. So you really want to think about that."
good,I was hired on the spot which was very surprising for me because this was my first actual store employment. I was a hard worker and I had the perfect hours during the summer. The managment went down south after the store manager moved to a different location and a new one came in. His skills as a manager were poor that it created a bad workplace for the employees overbuying products and not being able to give hours for his employees to pay them.
good,"Buena empresa, tiene buen ambiente laboral. Lo dicho son los horarios."
good,Love being part of the Smart & Final Team great and wonderful experience. Many friendly customers and staff member who really treat each others as a fairly behaved team. Thanks :)
good,Manager was very relaxed. Piercings are allowed. Very fast paced store. Must learn many fruit/ snack codes. Multitasking is a must. Answering phone calls while cashiering is very common
good,"Smart & Final is an enjoyable work place. Coworkers and customers are friendly and welcoming. If you are social and have a priority for customer service, this is a great place to practice those skills."
good,Smart and final has its ups and downs. Didn’t work out for me. A very stressful environment. Working there did help me improve on some skills. Overall great starting job.
good,"This was a good job, I work there for almost 7 years. I got to travel, and had 2 great bosses.  I had great co-workers. I just had a traumatic incident there that made it hard to work there. My store was robbed."
good,"Make sure you are physically fit, as you will discover your weaknesses in time. Also, dress warm for the refrigerated warehouse. In time you will get use to the chill."
good,"I started out as a service clerk and moved up to working the deli.  It was a really fast transition and it worked out perfect for me.  Working on a designated set of items and making sure you got them all out, it made it easy to get going with my shift."
good,"very relaxed and easy especially if you work in a side department. some of the corporate people are mean and bossy, obviously, but just smile and nod around them"
good,Working for smart and final helped me with my retail experience and also helped me with customer service. I also learned how to be a cashier and a servic3 clerk
good,Loved all the people I worked withe except the manager.  They offered flexible work hours but had very high demands.  The manager would sometimes demand me to complete a task that I had no experience or training in doing.
good,"Sad to leave in the way I did. IT department was outsourced. The company said it was done to save money but, they continued to spend frivolously. So not sure that was the only reason."
good,"My store was smooth. of course angry customers but we knew how to handle the situation. hours were flexible, manager was sweet.  Part time associates always received overtime."
good,on busy days it goes by quick and can be kinda stressful but its okay. on slow days it can be really slow and make the day feel very long. but the customers are you typical regulars and make the day go by easier.
good,A typical day at work is making sure everyone is on task and standards are being met. Many projects are always needed to be completed and it's the managers job to incorporate processes to get the projects completed in an efficient manner. Speed and accuracy is definitely a must if you are going to succeed in this company.
good,"This job was pretty easy to get hired seeing as they needed people. When I applied for this job I put open, big mistakes because next thing I know I was a service clerk and a cashier at the same time. This Job then quickly became stressful for me because of my personal life.  Nevertheless, my co workers were good to me . The work load was a lot for me and I quit and gave my two weeks notice and no one was rude or mean to me about it"
good,i work the night shift so i really dont interact with customers but my night consist of 25 to 35 pallets full of different merchandise and between 3 guys we have to put all the items on the shelves in a timely matter.
good,The employees were great and I loved my first store. The manager was great and we always had hours to work. Then I transferred to a different store and the management was not to great. They were more rigid and the turn over rate for cashiers to quit was like 80%. He made them feel uncomfortable.
good,Great pace to start getting your experience due to the many things you have need to learn that'll be used in the future. Helps the way you communicate and customer service.
good,"Constantly being stopped by customers to ask questions about a product, co-workers are enjoyable, management plays favorites, room to advance in the company, training provided."
good,"A typical day at work for me was filling end caps,customer service, keeping the lines down,special orders, and closing the store.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the customers. I loved working at my store simply because of them, from my coworkers making me laugh, the food parties, the sense of having a new caring family support you regardless if it was work related or not, all the way the customers being happy to see you. The hardest part was honestly the benefits and the lack of care upper management gave when it came to their employees compared to the store."
good,Some days I would come to work where the morning people handled the load which made it easy for me but sometimes i would have to come and pick up where they left off at because either the load came late or they just couldn't finish the job.
good,"Everyday is a day where we try to beat sales from previous years."
good,A typical day is happy environment good conversation and a lot of work to be done and good hours to put in overall a good job but I want better.
good,"As the shift began, I stretch out for the load of work I have. I worked with the managers, supervisors, co workers and the vendors and merchants that come into the store. I also work in the back room pulling loads and working them out. After working out the back room, the shift seems to be over."
good,"A typical day would start by stock the shelves both quickly and accurately.  Then we would restock the shelves throughout the day.  Our managers were always willing to jump in and help in all departments of the store.  All co-workers got along which makes your job more pleasant.  The hardest part would rude customer's, but the best part would be interacting with the nice ones."
good,Fun co workers. Fun managers. Learned how to work in a store.
good,"It's great place to work, fun people.  Can be fast paced at times or slow."
good,Job was more suitable for a male employee. Management was difficult to work with at times. Pay was great.
good,"Management was good, great customer service, reasonable pay. "
good,"stock shelves, stock shelves, answer customers questions, and order for the next shipment."
good,"As a newly graduated High School student, this job was great to get some beginners experience in the field. I learned cash management and customer service skills."
good,"The customers at this location are the best, but they always hire new people and don't have hours to give to anyone in the end. The hiring process takes forever and you'll probably never be able to move up in the company."
good,"Smart and Final is the smaller faster grocery warehouse store. We supply a wide range of product to the local community. From snack shacks to local events to everyday households, smart and final has you covered."
good,"i would recieve my load,work my load,and in between that i would do key flips,open registers,and help customers. i learned time management and to work fast."
good,"Store was frequently busy with long lines, usually not enough cashiers to have more than 2 lanes open...guests were often irritated with the long wait times."
good,It was good if your just a highschool trying to make decent kind of cash. It's hard to find the type of jobs that would flexible beside fast food places.
good,"I enjoy working with the company.  I started in 2006. There have been many changes along the way. I can tell you morale has taken a dip due to recent events that were negative at the company. Overall, people have a great attitude and everyone works together to get the job done. The culture is a vibrant one, and really encourages problem solving. Judging by what outsiders coming into the company have said, people are very nice, and are always willing to help out in any area needed."
good,I enjoyed working for smart and finale I just wasint getting enough hours and working nights is also hard to adjust to especially when you wouldn’t get 40 hours a week
good,Smart&final and final is a good place to start working for high school and college students to make a little bit of money. If you can any a lot of hours go to an extra store.
good,"Store# 707 is an incredible place to work with great management and incredible staff. Honesty had no complaints about that store or the people. Now, store# 335 has horrible management, Horrible structure, The employees are lacking any kind of professionalism, store is unkempt, and the organizing is a disgrace."
good,Not only can you move higher in the store but they also pay for your schooling as well. There a lot of things you can do because there many departments at the store and you get a lot of hours if you're a fast learner and know the right people like any other store.
good,it is a good minimum wage job for a college student but if you want to make it a career you have to fight tooth and nail to be looked at. pay well for a grocery store but does not make equal pay for managers
good,They no longer do outside sales. Had a good boss who was dedicated to his staff. Always enjoyed helping my customers with good products.The hardest part of the job came around 5-7 pm when it was the busiest. Having to work quickly to satisfy so many customers needs had to be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be how manageable the job was.
good,"Working here was no joke, I tried my hardest in my area but it was too complicated, I was given too many very small items to stock which made me take time to look nice on the shelf."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and going on the cashier, if you were asked to do something else you would do, until you were called back to open the cashier. Hardest part of the job was to be able to keep up on popular days such as super bowl, 4th of July, etc The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with amazing people."
good,I love working for this company management is somewhat good I learned a lot working here knowing all the product codes and being the fastest cashier is the most advantage I have over some. My work is enjoyable there hasn't been a bad day with this company but one thing I dislike is the pay rate I love working for this company but my pay rate isn't much my bills are catching up and I need a better paying job.
good,A typical day at work was very easy and straight forward for any other cashier but often times i would catch kids shoplifting while walking to the break room rather than the security.  if there was anything that i believe they should tighten up on would be the security other than that i believe it was a good experience for myself and brought nothing but improvement to myself and has put more experience under my belt.
good,"A typical work day is fast paced but pretty easy. You have to be willing to work hard."
good,"Company has competitive hours, respectable management, and growth opportunities. Became a manager after a year and a half, was transferred to another store for growth opportunities. Inventory was the hardest part of the job, challenging my organizational skills. Enjoyed the customers, and employee's who shopped and worked with me."
good,"Apredisaje de todas las areas atencion cliente ventas mercadeo,"
good,They paying 19 an hour plus 5.5 extra for incentive. U can live off it I guess. It can be difficult I think it'll make u realize wether or not warehouse is for U or not.
good,This place is a great spot for beginners in which they teach you how to rotate product and the in's and outs of a super market. You will be doing everything and anything to keep the customers happy including cleaning up the parking lot and restrooms. Your always busy but it's not stressful.
good,Working at smart and final helped me get the experience and skills to help customers and provide good customer service. It was hard in the beginning but started getting used to the several tasks that this job requires you to do. Managemeng is okay but they need to be more flexible with their employees.
good,"It is an okay job for people with not too many bills.  managers are nice, just have to work in a fast paced at times. the hardest part about this job is getting your 40 hours a week"
good,"I needed a job for the mean time but I ended staying longer than planned. I enjoyed the work hours flexibility and everyday duties. they have a good culture and my coworkers were nice. I left because I went back to school."
good,A typical day at work was unloading the delivery trucks; stocking shelves; helping customers with questions and other miscellaneous duties as needed.  The workplace culture was good at this company.
good,My experiences at smart and final were nothing more than constant hands on learning experience that helps you go about the store in a more fluent way.
good,The company goes out of it's way to train it's associates and is willing to pay for hotel costs when asked to go out of town. They always push to move e associates up and provide the proper tools to succeed.
good,The typical day is loading and unloading the trucks and stocking shelves. I learned in management that leading a crew is hard when you don't have a crew that's willing to work. The hardest part of the job is finishing the shift at a decent time of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job socializing with the crew members and getting the job done.
good,"When first starting it seemed really fun and a great place to work. It’s not hard to get in, just need basic qualifications. Toward the end it seemed to change and advancing felt hard and sometimes unfair due to favoritism."
good,"One of the best things about working at  Smart & Final was the social aspect of the job. Also, they pay pretty well and most locations are flexible with school schedules."
good,"Job culture & quality varies from project to project and teammates and management. for self evaluation, iEVOLVE and ASYNC ION programmes are there and material is also good as per industry."
good,"This job is great if you wanna work at nighttime and don’t mind getting up and do super hard work and carrying, it pains good you just gotta keep up with everyone else."
good,They really take care of their hard working employees. You can move up to management fairly quickly if you have the work ethic. It's great to deal with the customers and overall work environment.
good,"As a cashier we are expected to greet customers who are in our line plus those walking in the store, ring up items quickly, ensure customers had a great experience. Overall, most customers are nice and your co-workers can become like family allowing a pleasant workday to fly by."
good,My experience here was good. I love the fact that I had the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of people. Along with the idea of making someones day by providing excellent customer service. They say a smile goes along with no doubt about that.
good,The manager has no trust over employees and is constantly checking cameras to inspect workers. Department leads have no respect towards the manager and do not feel obliged to obey orders.
good,"Fast paced environment. No union, means unlimited advancement potential according to desire and results, not seniority. Expectation of absolute perfection"
good,"Very good company to work for a start up, gets very fast paced at times. Not enough labor to help achieve the daily goal. Have met some amazing associates, and even better managers. "
good,it was okay. i would clocked in clocked out. did what i had to do. co workers were nice. hours were flexible.customers were enjoyable. easy to find things.
good,I have been working at smart & final for 7 months and got promoted about a month ago. Its a good company but being a supervisor you have alot of stress on you . I was the closing supervisor most of the times and there would be inconveniences.
good,"Smart & Final recognizes hard workers and continues to provide growth opportunities for its associates. The management team is eager to train up new associates at store level and the corporate team takes consideration of new ideas, product concerns, and associate feedback well and act proactively to the best of their ability. Hardest part is weathering the storm during slow sale periods when hours are cut and corporate departments are down-sized and/or terminated."
good,"This is a good company to work for.  However, depending on the department that you are working for, your life work balance maybe skewed more towards work."
good,"Fast paced environment, decent pay. Takes a long time to get health benefits unless you're full time, which is also hard to get. Management changes often."
good,"I've been with this company for almost 7 years now so I can't say I hate it. I clock in and give it my all everyday. This is my first real job that has taught me a lot about how business works, especially in the food industry. Every manager I've had has taught me something new and I've always carried the information that they've taught me onto how I train new employees. The only negative part about this job is that the work hours can be very difficult to work around your personal life. What I really enjoy is the customers and co-workers. I do appreciate all my customers because without them, I wouldn't be able to pay my bills. I appreciate my co-workers because we work as a team to get the job done."
good,I have been working here for three years and they are very flexible with my school schedule and the management is realy nice.
good,Its a good company to work for but not a permeant one. its fast paced and keeps you on your feet if your working on the floor. Depends on what city you work for the people can be really nice or just plain rude. Management usually knows what they are doing and are always there to help as best they can. Its hard to move up positions to get the better pay.
good,8 hours of fast work where I just move things around and stocked all night not much to real do but it was easy work I liked it
good,"Assisting customers, stocking products, unloading and loading products, order products,office work, paper work"
good,"Cobrar y tratar con clientes personalmente"
good,"I would clean the store, stock the selves and help customers. My co-workers made the job fun and enjoable. Management was fair though at times would mess up onmy schedual. Learn about excelent customer service and team work."
good,"A typical day at Smart & Final is mostly routine.  Every day the manager will provide his or her employees with a list of things that need to get done throughout the day and those tasks usually remain the same.  A major goal of the company is to have a clean and safe store environment for its customers, so most of our time is spent ensuring that the shelves are clean and stocked.  The management pushes their employees to do better every day.  My co-workers are always friendly; I have never had a problem with any people that I work with..  The hardest part of the job is maintaining a fast paced work environment.  It takes a lot of energy to keep the store looking good.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find exactly what they are looking for."
good,Private Equity portfolio company that is actively managed and aggressively focused on growth and transformation.  Great corporate culture that is open and friendly and focused on achieving management objectives.  
good,"I was a night crew manager in charge of four employees we worked the graveyard shif,duties included unloading trucks.stocking shelves.making the store presentable.clean restrooms.floors.shelves.clean parking lots.and order mechandise. I liked the job because I didnt have to work with computers,Im not the smartest worker but when i learn something i always do it the same way.Im a hard worker.loyal. and i dont complain,and i never tell my fellow workers that im tired,because it sets the work tone. I have a love for people and it shows in all my relationships"
good,"I enjoyed working at Smart & Final. They are good about promoting from within. They train you to take on more responsibility and trust in you to do the job. Pay was not bad, they give cost of living raises which was nice."
good,Ok job if you don't mind part time hours. Low wages and too long of a wait time for company health insurance. Over all pretty good company to work for.
good,Smart and Final is a good place to work but being able to take orders and move at a fast pace is necessary. Making customers happy is our number one priority. We need to ensure that we greet ALL customers will respect and allow them to shop.
good,"A peaceful job to start going on to the grocery idle job, many happy faces of customers and employees, working as a team and getting the job done. A great start for job hunters"
good,This was my second job and it was really cool while it lasted. After the. a while the HRs start to get to you and your sleep schedule gets thrown off. The management at the job was great. More than willing to work with you and try to provide the days you needed off. The bad part about the job like most minimum wage paying jobs is there is a lot of labor needed. I just suggest if you. take up stocking like I did you wear a back brace. Trust me it will help you in the long run.
good,"This job was one of the few good ones i had, the work was not difficult, hours were good, the team was good."
good,It was a good place to work.  Schedules can be inconsistent but it's a good place to work with good people.  Friendly staff who work together. Room for advancement really depends on your performance and qualifications.
good,"maintained produce, deli and bulk stocked and areas clean. received truck loads of merchandise and helped cashiers with any issues they had with customer or registers. closing and opening the store."
good,Management is sometimes difficult to work with. I had a bit of a issue with a store manager who made things to personal and I got tired of it one day and quit.
good,This is basically an easy job. Only con to this job is your hours. They never give you enough hours. you probably only work 2-3 days out the week if your lucky  maybe 4.
good,"People that work here are what makes it worth it. I've gone through lots of trainings to do different things, and also done lots of things with a lack of training, but it's always a learning experience."
good,fast paced and physical. Makes work go by quickly. Learn multiple jobs instead of being stuck doing just one job. Mostly friendly staff. Flexible hours.
good,"I worked in the meat dept. and being a girl, I kinda got bullied. I'm used to it though and just continued to work. "
good,"Cashier- As a cashier the main problem I had was with the customer. Just about every problem you can think of working as a cashier at a grocery store will eventually happen, but that's just part of the job. Keep front end somewhat clean, stocked with candy and drinks, ring people up accurately, and managers won't give you any problems"
good,Once you get through the interview process they have you get to work real fast within the first couple days. Advancement for yourself begins the moment you begin to have credible work and are acknowledged by your coworkers
good,Buen comportamiento de los compañeros de trabajo en trabaho en equipo
good,"Great place to work at while going to school, they work around your school times. Start at cleaning, getting carts, and stocking. You can move up by showing hard work and dedication."
good,"Worked there for two years. Fun place to work at, good work environment, great work  culture.  Benefits were good. I would go back for them if I could, but they are only in California."
good,"Great company to work for, flexible hours. Can be very fast paced. Lots of room for advancement. I really enjoy working for this company and have learned a lot."
good,"Working at this company was very easy, but sometimes it was stressful. It would be days where I would have the best day ever then  it would turn into rubbish."
good,Deliveries don't always run smooth. Everyone including the dispatcher along with the team you are delivering to should all be willing to help make this a smooth delivery.
good,"Smart & Final is a fun & busy place to work. I learned a lot in my time there & assisted customers on a daily basis."
good,"Holidays are a bit busy and sometimes stressful. Being a woman in this field is somewhat challenging and co-workers, etc. don't always show respect. It seems as if they want you to prove that you can lift heavy boxes on your own and use the saws as they would. Once you get past that and the bad mouthing, it's all good."
good,It was a nice place to work I enjoyed it but when I tried to get a transfer my manager denied me. Would work there again just wasn't to fond of my manager
good,enjoy seeing my coworkers there when i come in the morning. everyone is nice . they can be helpful when i need help lifting heavy boxes. busy especially in my department.
good,"i enjoyed my time working at smart and final. due to some family health issues i had to resign. i worked in multiple departments and had great opportunities for advancement. Suit up, show up, do your job and management will see that!"
good,It was a good experience to have for a first time job liked it I can’t really judge the store because I’ve only worked their only a month and it was a temporary job
good,"It was my first job and it was very fast paced, having to juggle between helping customers, maintaining the store, and keeping it stocked. I was tasked with all the jobs that needed to be done and it had me quite busy."
good,I Learned How To Face Isles How To Remember Where Things Were When I Was Helping The Customers Find Things. A Regular Work Day Was Good There Was A Lot Of Activity Because It Was Busy Store.
good,"I really loved that diversity in management strengthened management is something they went by."
good,"Helping customers and working as a cashier / clerk."
good,Good training.  Basic grocery store tasks with special attention to customer service.  Friendly staff.  Promotes teamwork.  There's a reason why I stayed there for 17 years.  A reliable job.
good,"on the outside it appear like your average grocery job but you can take advantage of full benefits from the store such as some insurance, paid education, and paid days off. staff are generally friendly, personally only having one altercation with another staffer. management are fair and kind willing to help out in most situations for the benefit of all."
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of productivity and stability. I feel its important to understand what you learned and remember it in the future. Over the time of my working days I've learned to take orders as well as handle money, respect my employees, and do the job and do it good. I feel the hardest part of most jobs is when two people don't see eye to eye. One may not be able to accept your recommendation and want it their way which tends to complicate things. My most enjoyable part of working is simply taking care of business. Accomplishing and taking care of business makes me feel good and better about myself."
good,"No place to grow as an employee, bad managerial and bad organizational culture. Supervisors wont have the right training to lead."
good,A typical day at work is busy filled with learning more about products and the signs. I also work closely with management to learn about pricing and how to fix any errors within the system. The hardest part of the job is keeping within the time constraints and still getting the job done. The most enjoyable part is when I interact with the customers and hear how they love the new store.
good,"Depending what shift I worked I could spend the whole day maintaining the store and assisting customers, or just operating the cash register. How to work with a retail team, operate a cash register, and maintain a retail environment. Management was always working just as hard as any other employee, and very easy to communicate with. There was never anything that was particularly hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a grateful customer."
good,I didn't have much work experience before I was hired by Smart & Final. I started off as a Service Clerk which was about right for someone with little to no experience. I was hired a second time and was promoted from the start to cashier. I would suggest working here if you need a job. They are always hiring and willing to give you a chance to move up.
good,Great time when you are able to interact with people and them out. You learn so much about the business in a short time its a good place to start and grow if desired. Hardest part of the job is the long days dealing with mad and stressed costumers. All worth it at the end of the day.
good,"Solved problems and provided customer service. Made sure the store was up to standard. Served as service clerk, cashier and on the night crew. Greet customers and help them find their purchases. Co-workers were very friendly and hard-working. Hardest part of the job was closing duties. I enjoyed helping customers inside the store and helping them  with carry-outs."
good,I go into work with a strong mentality expecting the unexpected. I need my music to get pumped and ready to go. we meet as a group and we talk about the how the company is doing and what we need improvement on and what we are all doing as a team. we stretch out for a proper amount of time to warm up the body and get ready to work. My coworkers and I encourage ourselves to run better and faster everyday. Management plays a part in encouraging us and keeping us updated on our shift goals. The hardest part of my job is running against the time to participate on our incentive program and dealing with real heavy orders and promos. Going to work and making money is fun but seeing all my coworkers and competing with them  is an enjoyable part of work. Having fun and laughter is a key to many doors in life specially work. Having a great environment to work in is what makes the job enjoyable as well. While in my company I've learned teamwork and accountability.
good,"This job has helped me learn that I can do anything I want to do if I put outstanding planning and effort into my goals.  The culture is very straightforward: if you want something, go and get it.  The management is very supportive to those associates that show a genuine interest in advancing their careers with the company.  "
good,my typical day at work revolves around my customers and giving excellent fantastic service I like to smile and do my best Ihave learned a lot at smart and final we respect each other and have great teamplayers at our store Our management is always there 2help when we need them and our district manaer is simply Awesome! I get along with my co-workers and my most enjoyable part of my job is answering the phones and helping make our store look great andbeing part of the group and ofcourse taking good care of our customers they love our store...;)
good,there's always something to do while working there. People and management are friendly and understanding. Always something new to learn.
good,"A typical day was making sure all registers where kept with a low amount of money. making sure all staff took meal breaks, and that all perishable departments where clean and up to date with expiration dates."
good,i would work there agian it was a good job and good coworkers i enjoyed going to work everyday
good,I learned a lot from this work place and the job i hold currently. You do get advances every 1000 hours or 500 hours i believe. Co workers are very funny and friendly but when it comes down to business and working we do it as a team. The hardest part of the job is figuring out which list of stuff you have to put as your priority.
good,"Some Nights Would Work The Register And Others I Would Fix The Store, Gave Me Better Customer Service Skills, Management Was Helpful But Sometimes Not Helpful, Some Employees Were Good And Did Exactly What They Were Told While Others Slack Off"
good,"Very good company, pays pretty good , and the company is well organize."
good,over all smart&final was a great place to work. the day crew was always polite and night crew always worked hard just to get home. over all i would give them a 4 out of 5. i worked there for allot of years until i decided to move on.
good,It was a good experience working here for my first job. The people were helpful and kind to showing me how to work there. Then I got the hang of it and I enjoy working there.
good,"If you are a good worker, then you do not have to worry about your hours being cut here. Many of the complaints here are due to very few raises and slow time hours. They try to cut hours evenly, but if you are open to doing several different things then you should be fine and always get hours. Management is not always the best, but there are some really good managers depending on the store you work for."
good,"T - Team work"
good,"In the beginning the job was good, but I started realizing the expectations and amount of work was not worth 9 an hour pay, so I chose to leave the company with no problems."
good,"Great benefits, HR and people culture is great - if you are a manager and below life is great! If you are director and above, you have to learn to play the game with leadership - especially in marketing and sales."
good,A typical day at work was fun you just get there and get straight to work. I learned where everything was at. The hardest part of my job for me was cleaning the bathroom sometimes it would be super dirty.
good,Excellent benefits for full time associates and flexibility with schedules depending on the manager.  Hardest part of the job is that you are not able to finish work 100% before a new task or several new tasks are given and this happens daily.
good,Im thankful to smart and final for giving me the chance to work there im not quiting i just need another job to support my family an especially my baby girl.
good,"Smart and Final is a challenging company to work for. I enjoyed working with a close knit family oriented operation. The job was a lot to handle at times,  but that's what makes working there worth it."
good,"great customer service, fast pace environment, staff friendly, always busy, store clean, friendly management, able to relocate, training in different locations when needed, able to climb the ladder, meeting new staff from other locations, training, helping out when needed. able to meet the DM, and get reviews of your preformance."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Obviously you have some customers that are a little difficult to work with which isn't a probably, but some customers I built a chemistry with every time they would come in the store and I felt a simple friendly bond with them and it makes me feel good."
good,Great people all around once you get to know them you all help each other like a team. its not an easy job standards are tight but if i'm able you can too. management really leaves you alone which is a good thing it makes you consentrate on your work. Work place is great. The hardest part of the job is the standards and i mean tight not enough time to complete the order so its best to know your product to make time..the best part is you get a check.. cant complain....
good,I enjoy meeting and working with people. I love being hands on and being able to be in charge. I learned more mgmt skills working here and the help they give you towards advancement
good,A typical day at Smart & Final consists of many small and tedious tasks as a Service Clerk. The same services are performed every time and become very overbearing and boring. Though there is a lit to learn from working retail:you learn many skills and understand how to work with a variety of people. The workplace is very accepting as well and open. The hardest part of the job is during holiday's when it becomes very fast paced and indulging. Though the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with new associates and customers all the time.
good,Smart and Final is a good place to work for because they instill qualities that could be conveyed throughout any aspect in life. They work well with your school schedule.
good,"Honestly, it's been so long I can barely remember what it was like working there outside of my duties. Although the manager did get tough on us from time to time, but he ultimately taught us what to expect in the working field."
good,Every day is different with projects and tight deadlines. This is a very fast paced environment. Great coworkers and benefits with the company. Most challenging part of the job is unexpected projects with tight deadlines.
good,worker and management only looked out for them self there was no team work within the company it was a missed managed company thing were always wrong never knew what was going on or even happening with in the company
good,"Always on the move. Rarely ever a dull moment or sitting around twiddling thumbs. Co-workers were, generally, friendly and helpful. Store Manager was one of the worst & absolute laziest Store Managers I have ever encountered. Assistant Store Manager was an amazing, energetic, hard working, and friendly person."
good,The workers and manager were all extremely nice and helpful. You have a lot of work that will keep you busy but there are some slow days where you don't have to do every task as fast.
good,A typical day at work for me would be to clock in and go to the back and start bringing out the pallets to start unboxing. I have learn how to handle tasks at a fast pace with precision and accuracy. The management was very professional and very clean work environment. The hardest part of my job was to unload and to stack all the materials on the shelves. What i enjoyed the most about smart & final was the people i was surrounded by where very hard working people and where wanting to grow and make a difference in there life.
good,"-make sure to know your basic math skills "
good,"It's not too bad here.  I like the attitude of my coworkers, but my managers kind of seem to just be focused on getting through the day and always seem fed up."
good,"*clock in do my work fast and clean"
good,It was a good job to have. The pay was good and so were the hours. The hours were consistant. The people working there were great and we all got along pretty well. The customers are so nice and friendly
good,"I would enter work at 6 in the morning and go straight to stalking isles, cleaning the store, and helping out customers. I liked working there because everyone would communicate and help each other. I felt like the assistant manager was biased due to unfair treatment i received while I was working as a courtesy clerk."
good,High work volume due to the high number of new hires and the opening up of new locations. Upper management is great I worked corporate cant attest to working In a store.
good,"The co-workers I had were really nice and fun to be around. Our managers always told us to be professional on the work floor. If it was slow some of the cashiers would go on the floor and fill in shelves, face shelves, and do other duties that needed to be done. On busy days I would never leave the register and sometimes I wouldn't take my both breaks."
good,smart and final gave me the opportunity to go to school and become more in life. people there were great and gave me memories to cherish. It wasnt hard to let go because they were very encouraging to move on
good,Working at Smart and Final is a great first job experience. The staff and environment is friendly and accommodating and the work scheduling is flexible. The downside is the benefits are decent and upward mobility is difficult.
good,"There is room for advancement at smart and final, but you will have to earn it.  They typically promote from with in.  It can be a fun job if you make it that way. They will train you with everything you need to know to be successful."
good,"En general el ambiente de trabajo es muy agradable, hay mucho movimiento tanto de dinero como de clientes, tuve una muy buena relacion tanto con mis compañeros como con gerentes y subgerentes; a pesar de los años que estuve no tuve mucho conocimiento de todas las areas la direccion de subgerentes y gerentes hacia los asociados era siempre de manera amable y siempre en bienestar de la tienda, la parte mas dificil fue la entrega de valores y el cierre de tienda pero en general lo que mas me gusto fue que participe en todas las areas"
good,"I receive store loads, break down pallets, work product to the shelf. "
good,I was in charge of night crew of 3 men. We work graveyard shirts we unloaded and reloaded trucks. We stocked the shelves and fixed and cleaned the store for the next day. Also when I worked afternoons I did pull downs and fixed the store. I worked register when they needed help. My co-workers where easy to get a long with. We had fun working nights together they where like my family away from home. The hardest part of works was working the night shift. The most enjoyable part was knowing the next day the store will be easy for shoppers to shop because we had stocked the shelves and made the store cleaning.
good,A normal day would actually consist of overnight hours.  From 10pm -7am. night would start slow due to waiting for load from truck.  we spend about 1 hour and 30 min. getting shelves faced and ready for restocking . very slow.  Then kick in to gear at about 12am .I learned how to plan and organize my work space in order to complete loads in time.  Management was fair and allowed me to work comfortably.Co-workers of the night shift were no problem to deal with however the day time crew were a bit annoying .  I would say the hardest part of the job was maintaining the same sleep hours outside of the job.  It all changed aournd naturally. it was hard to manage my time to do things outside of work from sleeping all day and being awake all night.  Through out working here i really enjoyed working unsupervised for most of the hours.  We would go over instructions once and worked as a team individually. Learning after one demonstration and a few words was all i needed
good,"this job is there us always something to do. and I love to stay busy. between greeting customers, ringing up items, and assisting people I was always busy. I loved my co workers I get along with everyone."
good,"Smart&Final is a good company. They do have their own problems but they always manage to fix it right away. The managers are always on task and never complain how late they stay to just fix a problem and dont get pay for it. The employees there are very friendly and always help you out when you need help without any complaints. I did actually enjoyed working there. I just dont like where it is located but i guess its not that bad compare to other places. The most enjoyable part of the job is just getting to work with my co-workers and getting to talk to my usual customers. They make my days go by faster. The hardest part would be just dealing with the rude customers, but i try not to let it ruin my day. While i was working there, i learned that you shouldn't be complaining at the workers anywhere you go because they have alot to do. Especially when you are in line at a store n the cashier takes so long to get to you. You just have to be patient because complaining wont get you anywhere but into a big argument and fight over nothing."
good,smart and final was my very first job and it was interesting all we did was clean all day and whatever else was required
good,"It's a good company to work for. It's very fast paced, flexible when it comes to scheduling. Smart and Final was very good to me while I was completing my undergrad work."
good,"I would say that you can learn a lot of abilities there since preparing food up to management. You can improve if you really want too and the people there are not bad. "
good,I didn’t really work there long but when I was there it was pretty good the people was nice work was smooth you had to move very quick move lots of box
good,"Just always do your best, never be late and no absenses. Always pay attention, especially when you are cashiering, so you do not commit errors and won't get a memo."
good,I worked nights so we was closed but it was a learning experience I learned inventory rotate shelfs and items when I worked day shift it was fast paced i build up customer service stocked store and it was something i was excited about when i started working thier
good,"I started off at the location on high st. (445) then transfered down town .I loved working there only problem was .Alot of theft,not enough protection."
good,Really easy job just needs more hours to be handed. The leaning pathway is very easy. They even have a session on teaching employess how to work. They just need to give more hours
good,"formed great customer relations, worked on designated holidays got along great with co workers always stayed busy was able to multi task & learned new skills"
good,"Always something to do, time went fast."
good,I just started working at this company. So far everything that their doing sounds overly amazing compared the company I used to work for. I am excited to work for this company
good,This job was fun but after a good minute it was boring because they made me clean over and over everyday I enjoyed stocking instead. There were days I didnt do anything just clean.
good,honestly it wasn't a very fair place for workers.they should focus more on giving workers better hours then just hiring new people.it had cool people but very stressful.
good,The hardest thing is to keep smiling all the time and always called out by someone which I didn't mind but it was too much for some days are busy and relaxing
good,"-Usual grocery store things."
good,"While I worked at Smart and Final, I learned how to speak to customers well and how to remain professional in all situations.On some occasions the customers would be irritated; however, I still spoke and helped the customers in a professional manner."
good,"debido a que no estaban bien defindas las actividades de cada puesto pude interactuar y aprender un poco de todo, pero considero que eso tambien afecto en mi salud, pues el estres y el compromiso que yo adquiri eran bastante. sin embargo a mi salida di mis puntos de vista sobre como mejorar y equilibrar la carga de trabajo, y tengo entendido que se han creado nuevos puestos y se formalizo la asignacion de actividades y responsabilidades de cada puesto."
good,"My work career started as a box boy, worked my way up to department head to assistant store manager. I also was award many times for merchandising awards"
good,"Smart and Final was a decent place to work, once you get the hang of things it’s repetitiveness and consistency. It could be fast paced or it could be the easiest job you’ll ever come across. it’s what you make of it. the better you work the better experience you could have."
good,It is a good foot in the door for somebody fresh out of high school or even in high school to get their feet wet. I recommend Smart and Final to anybody that wants to learn the value of a dollar.
good,Had some peak hours but good to keep me busy. I was able to interact with the costumers. Hours were flexible and management was good. My experience was okay.
good,"Capacitación constante, compromiso con los colaboradores y sus necesidades."
good,"My managers were always fun and awesome. I was in school at the time and they were very flexible around my hours. Training wasn't great, but I found if you ask lots of questions, you'll do well. They're willing to train you if you show an interest. Super sweet coworkers, love everyone"
good,Smart and final was a good first job and paid well. It was however very fast paced and required that you get things done by a specific time . But people were nice there and got work done.
good,Yeah this job is good I got paid more in a year compared to the yearly average you would get due to the extra work they gave me to work on new stores. Great benefits 401k and health care and something about education for college students.
good,"Fun environment, great co-workers, meeting new faces, a place to learn and grow It teaches you patients as well as a chance to see things from a cultural prospective."
good,"This company isn't bad to work for,  Good for your first job.  Easy going vibes.  The customers are alright. Hardest thing is  finding where Items are through out the store."
good,This was my first retail job and a very good experience. I had an opportunity to move up in my position and gain some leadership skills. not enough benefits as a part time employee.
good,Smart & Final was a typical first job where you are able to gain the experience needed to move on to the next level. There you are able to acquire the necessary experience.
good,"had a lot of fun working here. Managers were always fun and reasonable. The job was very easy, and i never had that ugh i have to go to work feeling. Smart and final is a good place to work."
good,I enjoy working with others specially been able to help customers with what they’re looking for and help I can assistance them. But what I don’t like about the company is how they are always changing Managers every 6 months.
good,It was a very nice laid back but quick-paced job and it had a peaceful work environment with friendly co-workers along with pretty nice customers too.
good,"Good workplace not to hectic at most times. Management does step into  a lot of things, i.e. district manager is coming in so they overreact. Other than that its a good place to work."
good,"If I didn't chose to leave for the military, I would've stayed longer for advancements. The woek environment was fun and the co-workers made it enjoyable to arrive to work everyday."

good,One great company to work for. The environment is nice and the people of the team are very helpful and family like. Management is easy to work with. Learned a lot of skills from working with the company.
good,Its a fun place where everyone got to know each other and they would have heap each other. Sometimes the manager will put us on track and made sure that everything was going as planned in the job.
good,"My duties were to face the isles, ,make sure that everything looks nice and try to make sure that all of the customers needs were met, but they made you do some ridiculous stuff."
good,Smart&final was my first ever job it was a good job I learned a lot at that job I meet a lot of nice people working there it was a great job I worked with a lot of good people
good,"I learned how to work well with other employees, stock shelves, learn how to assist customers, learned how to work with a register and learn different types of codes. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people as well as making customers happy."
good,"A typical day at work is always fun, and very outgoing people, clock in do what your suppose to do and the day goes by smooth. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the happy customers."
good,Smart and Final had to be my favorite job experience. I worked for the company for 8 years. I started at 17 years old and left in my mid 20's. The grocery store business shaped me into a fast productive worker. I will always remember my first and longest job. The skills I gained there have helped work in my favor amongst other new jobs.
good,Working here is really nice. They really care about communication and keeping a positive work environment. They also make safety a high priority. the working hours were flexible and the pay rate was average but they did offer benefits and extended trainings.
good,Smart & final is a good place to work at people become your family their. And they are trust worthy and times it will get to busy but working their made me more open and not shy anymore I'm out going and more fun.
good,"Easy to get along with and communicate with both supervisors and other employees. "
good,Working with my co-workers was great. It's a productive job. I learned to do things on my own. As a shy person it became easier for me to help customers by time.
good,I love working for Smart & Final and The CEO is a great leader. This company is growing with good career opportunities. Great customer service is very important to the company.
good,"Smart  Final Food Distribution was an excellent work place."
good,"smart and final is a great place to work for. i work as a cashier, helping the customer is the most important thing in my job. my mangers are a very good and experience person who knows a lot about the job. the hardest part of the job is to keep pleasing the customers.the most enjoyable part is when i can find everything the customer is looking for it."
good,"I had an awesome team.  I was the management. The hardest part of the job was inventory.  My coworkers were team players and were very enjoyable.  They did anything asked by me.  I learned to climb the career ladder,  I was very liked by my corporate office. I made MY stores very profitable I kept everything stocked and kept my customers happy by going above and beyond for their needs."
good,Out of all the jobs ive had I think Smart & Final was the best one. It is a very fast-paced and hands on type of job. You are always on your feet. There is always room for advancement here. Interacting with customers is always fun. The managers are usually very nice and always come around to help. It is hard to get a raise since it is based on the hours you work but you just have to do your job well in order to get more hours.
good,"over all smart and final is a great place to work with good pay and benefits its fast past,my manager make it very easy to work for smart and final.They are understanding,respectful to your work and home life needs.I would say i truly enjoy going to work everyday because there is always something that needs to get done so i am not just in one spot doing one job i am  all over the store trying to accomplish what i can in the short period of time i don't mind because it makes me feel i make a difference in my store and the customer are usually very cool ,"
good,"Very accommodating to students who are going to school, they will consider your class schedule and a very pleasant work environment."
good,cashier stocking co-worker worked good with me company work well put a lot of stuff going on at one time but was a good work place
good,Enjoyed getting experience hands on in a warehouse environment. Employees were helpful and friendly.
good,"stocking ,coustumer service, work well with others. tidy up around the store"

good,"Really good place, to work very friendly & understanding & flexible with schedules."
good,"Great place to work. Many aportunities for growth. While many retailing are strugling, Smart & Final has been agressively growing and opening new store creating oportunity for advancement."
good,"It's an alright job, i think i have better options out there that can be better for me. I enjoy working with my co-workers, they are nice and productivr. This job doesn't suit me because it tends to complicate my work persona."
good,What to expect for a normal night at a Extra store is 15-25 pallets of merchandising. With a crew of 4-6 people and everyone helping out most days should be smooth because everyone is a big help.  If everyone communicates and works in equal parts you will always be successful.
good,Great company to work for. You work hard and put in dedication to this company and they will move you up for your hard work. Customers are great and love making conversation with cashiers.
good,"The dress code wasn't a priority"
good,Management is cool if you do your job. Fellow employees are also fun. It is always a good place to be. They also have great benefits and you get treated well.
good,the work profile gives me opportunity to learn a lot on IS technologies and new platforms. Management is friendly and work environment supports enthusiasm and energy.
good,I loved my 3 years there. They were extremely accommodating. You basically could make your own schedule. You got sick time. You got pto for every hour you worked. Your shift went by in a jiff. Management is stressful sometimes but there isn't a job that isn't a little bit stressful.
good,My managers will always give me tips and advice on how to maintain stock and products. Only worked 4 hours as a service clerk with lots of responsibilities but in the time being would complete all my work. Great place to start a job career.
good,"Most of management was really laid back and down to earth, that was probably the Cali life aspect, but it was still really nice to work here and thrive!"
good,"smart and final was a good place to work. there is always something to do and never boring. I learned how to multi task in smart and final. the reason why is because I didn't have an official job title. I just restock, cleaned and worked in the back. the coworkers were nice, they tought me how to do things right and what to clean. the manager is cool, there were two of them and both are friendly. but hard part is to remember everything in the store and the prices."

good,"Clock in on time, sign in to your register, maintain your work area clean and organized, stock up on bags to register if needed, greet customers with a smile, ask if they found everything ok, call the manager over the intercom when you have a service/901, face the coolers near the register when it is slow, stock up sodas, water, and energy drinks, make sure not to have more than three customers in line, provide excellent customer service."
good,"Smart and Final stores tend to have less employees than other major grocery stores which means everyone has a lot of work and responsibility. This can sometimes become difficult when the store gets very busy, but normally it's not too bad. I actually enjoy it because it keeps you very busy and the work day goes by extremely quickly. You will really get a hands on approach from all angles of how a grocery store works due to the small workforce. Also, it breeds a closeness to your co-workers since everyone works together most of the time."
good,Working at smart and final was productive. I personally enjoyed it only because of the people I was working with but the job itself was not for me. I stocked the shelves every day and faced all the products. The job was to repetitive for my liking but I did enjoy it for it to be my first job.

good,The thing that I learned in at this company is that you have to always put yourself out there or else you will not get noticed. If you don't follow up on things that they will get unnoticed. I enjoyed my time there but I felt under appreciated and there was to much favoritism involved.
good,"Its basically a senority based company, if you work hard it does not matter they will not hire you full time based on your performance. This company does not hire full time, the only chance to become full time is to wait it out until some full time guy retires. They only hire full time and work you like a full time job only that they work you 32-38 regular hours, the rest is overtime."

good,"*break down palettes and restock shelves "
good,"I enjoyed working for this Company, I enjoyed my job, and tasks that needed to be done, I had excellent customers, that kept me motivated to my job, and i enjoyed serving my customers with excellent customer service. I learned to handle large amounts of money, to keep the front end clean and in great shape,I learned what expired products were, checking dates on products, I overall loved my job as a cashier, and serving people in my Community. The management was not fair in my favor. The workplace was decent, due to it being in a poor neighborhood. The hardest part of the job was people stealing from the company. The best part of the job was all my customers and my customer service, I enjoyed serving over 500 customers per shift."

good,"The Smart & Final crew was about the best team I've ever worked with. As an old team member we defined the definition ""Team Work"" we picked up each others slack an also motivated an corrected one another when needed. The Manger & Key Holder were very patient when it came to answering any customer's or co-worker's question. I've learned how to deal with customer's on a busy day and how to deal with an upset customer who either had a complain about the sales on the ad or when we would be out of stock of an item on a empty shelf. The only difficult experience I had ever had as a cashier was when a customer was upset of the weighed of a bulk item an well yelled at me in front of customers. We did fix the problem, with my manager assisting me. Other then that, I did enjoy my time working at Smart & Final."
good,"This is the best place to work. It has its good and its bad, but the overall staff is great, hours were incredible, customers were nice to us, the store was neat."
good,I worked an overnight crew stocking shelves and bringing in shipments which was a blast to do. Only real issue I had with the job was that there was no pay raise for doing that position and it would get stressful at time when we were understaffed or had inexperience people working the shift off and on with us. My crew consisted of 5 people including myself and we were a dream team. Our management was a great guy who would be able to joke around with which helped make the job seem less stressful and made it alot of fun to work there.
good,"While the job may be fast-paced and stressful, there is a lot of room for advancement and growth while direct customer contact affords you the ability to become a pleasant and integral part of the communities in which you are doing business."
good,A typical day at work is a fun workout when there is planning implemented.  I learned how to prepare a store before it opens.  I like my managers.  Everyone has good attitudes most of the time.

good,"I liked the job .. I would have liked more hours.. Days go by faster when you work quickly to move your lines down.. Enjoyed"
good,"The job seemed challenging at first but it ended up being moderately easy. You'd show up to work, clock in, and then start your day following your list. The management and other staff was great and they all seem like they really liked each other which is fun. The hardest part of the job was remembering what specific items go in each ail and the most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the shelves alone or with a coworker."

Was recently given an award on my customer service skills. Company acknowledges hard work and dedication. Feels like a family with most employees. I’ve moved up steadily and will continue to do so with the company. Took a chance leaving a job to come here but was worth it.
good,"Time limited for the stocking and those who worked well had more hours than others. The manager is very nice and understanding, but the assistant manager is a little harsh when it comes to the work ethic. She would want things a different way the they normally would be."
good,I loved smart and final i truly did but it wasn't worth it i was such a great worker but they didn't care they just really worked me i couldn't stay and put up with it so im done with them i would work there just a diffrent location nothing wrong with the establishment except the pay which is why a location with better people is required

I have worked in different departments such as meat department, produce department, bakery and bulk, freezer, a cashier, and as a load crew/weekly ads. I became the backup for deli and then became the Deli Lead. I order four times a week. I receive my loads three times a week. I check for upcoming expired products that way I can put them out on manager special. The hardest part in my job is breaking down the Alta Dena load (milk). The most enjoyable part of my job is price verification. Price verification is checking if all priced items are correct and if any are discontinued. A typical day at work would be filling the milk, cheese, eggs, and facing in deli."
good,smart and final is a good place to work only because of the coworkers. the hours suck only because you start their as an part time employee.
good,Smart N Final was a very challenging job but I really liked working here the employees knew everything about the store like where to find a certain product and everyone was generous with me while I was there.

I did have a great manager who cared for me a lot. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing regular customers who would always come to my register and hold a conversation with me.
good,"For a typical work day for me is knowing that the day would not go as a routine, like any other day. Working at Smart and Final, they teach you all the necessary skills that are needed to work within the company, such as working a cash register to driving an electrical pallet jack to properly closing the store. I would work different task at hand because of what management says, I would work in the freezer if it needed handling, work with the deli dept if they needed assistance, work a cashier if there were a lot of customers, restocking the store as well as grabbing shopping carts in the parking lot. Working at Smart and Final keeps you working on your feet because your always going to be doing something for any department within the store just because the services are there."
good,"clock in go to your assigned cash register, then you would count everything in your register to make sure accurancy was collect. Cut you light on and check customs out with a courtenous behavior"
good,"I was the head cashier, and performed customer service. I also took orders, prepared orders, stocked, produce manager."
good,"As store manager runing the store, controlled inventory, increased sales, ordered merchandise, payroll, built displays, period plannning, budgets for the next year, weekly schedules, invoice reconcillation, resolving employee and customer problems, price changes, unload delivery trucks, training new associates, assign daily task to associates. Hire and terminate associates. Went through Smart and Final 3 month extensive training program to become an Asst. Manager but after the training was promoted to Store Manager and received Rookie of the Year award after my first year. Management team was there when ever needed to answer questions, co-worker worked well together, hardest part of my job was finding out one of my Asst. Managers was stealing from the store and had to have him arrested. Must enjoyable part of my job was dealing with my customer and working with my co-worker"
good,it was a good active environment. Nice people and cooperative members. Was very on top of duty work. Good for helping the customers for any needs they request.
good,A tipical day a work ..Work hard eveyday i learned how to be patient and im very happy with my promotion people very friendly i love to do my job is very kool nice people
good,"A typical day at work would have to be working in the back room checking in coming and out going inventory also working in the freezers and stocking shelves, as a cashier, collecting carts and go backs. What i learned from working at this job was time management is important to get my tasks done and i also learned how to speak better with customers because im a very shy person and i tend to get nervous."
good,"This being one of my first real jobs, I'd say that it was a wonderful experience working for this company. If I needed assistance or help with anything it was met by my managers with a smile and immediate guidance, the staff was extraordinarily kind and we each had a set role to play to keep the balance. While I was there I moved up quickly from strictly stocking and janitorial duties to lead of bulk, where I handled incoming and outgoing resources. The only difficulty for myself was heavy lifting, I was given a few new members to train in my department and to help with this sort of thing."
good,Store mgr changes every couple months. The new took my hours from 6 days a week to two because he would not accomodate my school schedule. Even after we discussed it.
good,"Working at Smart and Final was very interesting. "
good,"The employees all get along and work together , everyone has something to do either a task or job title"
good,Not that difficult. Have fun moments goofing off with other co-workers when its not to busy. Pretty chill and the community isn't bad. Sometimes bored when there's nothing to do so ....
good,"Working at smart and final was good. Helping people find their groceries. Maintaining the store clean for the customers."
good,I do recommend someone to work here . They was actually cool I thought it would be difficult but they showered me the ropes and it was actually easy . My day went by even faster cause the good vibes with the employees
good,"Smart and Final is a great company to work for. I have been working here for 4 years and looking back at how I used to be, I have grown a lot. I started from a service clerk and have grown since then. I have learned a lot about the importance of customer service, sales, shrink, leadership, and communication. I have an amazing team and have no complaints."
good,Smart and final was a strong company that had many nice workers and opportunities for advancement. It was a great new  opportunity that i will remember.
good,"Work graveyard shift, job is easy and people are easy to get along with the downfall sometimes is my work life balance, being that I work nights and sleep during the day it is hard to balance. I like working here!"

good,"it was a great place to work for, great benefits and the other employes were great. i enjoyed my stay there and the hours were good."
good,"Work days can vary from slow to fast paced, though I always have a lot of work in front of me. I learned that teamwork is the usual (and most of the time) method to get a heavy workload finished. The managers I have worked with so far are great. Like friends you can joke around and have a good laugh with. I would have to say that the hardest part of my job so far is trying to work both produce and deli departments at the same time. The most enjoyable parts of my job would be working produce as I have a responsibility to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to the customer, which gives me challenge. The second would have to be the register because I get to interact with customers."
good,Smart and final was a great company I Would of love to work for them here in Texas butt unfortunaly there isn't one here. I loved working in merchandising with S&F it was rewarding seeing a store that had nothing in it to the finished product.
good,"As long as you come in with a positive attitude and a drive to work, the mangers will take care of you. Smart and Final really care about the quality of your work. The hardest part and only negative is the bouncing hours. Some months it will be forty a week and others it could go as low as twenty four. Other than that, what I've learned was a great will and drive to always better myself. I enjoy working and love seeing my hard work pay off."
good,"Great store, great staff and different people. Great chances for advancement and encounter different people."
good,I’ve worked as an intern the managers there were really cool and teached me how to clear the carts off the street. I definitely recommend working here.
good,A normal day was at fast pace but relaxing at the same time. I learn a lot at this job for being my first one. The manger was the coolest manager i had he really cared about his employees and talk to them with respect.
good,"Smart & Final was a wonderful company to work for"
good,Smart & Final has a great work environment . It is very organized and clean. Every isle is stocked and well put together. When empty and shelves are always re stocked again
good,"I loved working at smart and final, however due to my location and fellow co-workers I could not keep up in the language barrier of not speaking Spanish. Another problem was no budge in management in changing schedule due to school schedule."
good,"Smart & Final is a wonderful company to work for. I have been working at Smart & Final for almost 5 years and have greatly enjoyed it. I never find myself to be too stressed out, because with the support of all my associates I am always very confident in the work I do. Here at Smart & Final we strive to be the best not only for our customers, stores, vendors, but for all our associates as well."
good,I spent 25+ years with the company and was part of the team to help it grow from 118 stores to well over 300 stores in 7 Western States plus Mexico.  Always a super-busy work environment with rarely a pause in the action.
good,"stock shelf when product are empty, clean restroom and floor, carry out when customer needed, cart run when empty. I learned to be productive and greet customer service. friendly workplace. heavy work and do carry out for customer."
good,"A typical day at work was usually the same. for about the first couple of hours i would clean the shelves around the store, but after that if the manager saw i needed something else to do he would tell me to either do go-backs or stack shelves, so overall the whole day was fair productive. As for what i learned while i working at Smart and final, i learned how be organized and keep things in order."
good,Smart and Final is a great place to work for the upcoming manager and job seeker. One can spend their college career or even their entire life working there with no issues. It can be a great place to advance your skills and learn a new trade in the grocery business. The hardest part of the job was the close watch the managers had on the employees sometimes. Without the openess to innovative and try new things it can be difficult to follow the old ways of things. The management team was always supportive and the workplace culture was great to be part of. The most enjoyable part of the job is essentially you are working along side your friends and making a difference in the workplace to provide a service for customers.
good,"I loved working for this company, their is always room to grow and improve and they always show appreciation to a job well done, but only thing is when its slow the hours get cut or you get very little hours."

I learned a lot working at Smart & Final i learned experience on the register i learned how to count my till out properly and to meet certain goals. Management was great my managers , nice guy very on top of his game. Always had the store in top shape. My co-workers were great at times we all work together to get the lines down and get people out on time so their is no problems. The hardest part about my job was when i felt like i couldn't do anything to help a customer, i was  either stuck on the register or i was off the clock. The most enjoyable part was when i had this lady come to my line with four baskets full of groceries, she told me she was sorry and it was for a company she also said she has one more basket but cant get some stuff down , i closed my line helped her pull what she needed and started to ring her up. Her total came out to nine hundred and thirty six dollars and twenty eight cents. After handing her the recite and thanking her she asked if she could speak to my manager i said yes and called him up. She then spoke to my manager thanking me for my great customer service, also going on how i was a hard worker and so polite.She the thanked me once more and then left. That was the best day at work."
good,"The hours were early from 4am-to 12pm, but the work environment was good. I learned how to run capacity test on inventory,audits on inventory, and forklift operation. Co-workers were helpful and easy to work with. What I enjoyed the most about the job was knowing that what I was doing made a difference in the company."
good,"On a typical day it usually busy and we have a lot of regulars come in which makes me happy. I learned a little about working in produce and in deli as well. I learned how to rotate and check for expiration dates. My co-workers are great to work with, they help me when ever I need it and they are always on top of their job duties. There isn't anything hard about this job, if I need help with anything I always have my fellow co-workers to help me out. The most enjoyable part of my job has to be when it gets really busy because I love the fast past  environment."

I have the concept and the idea of the more you know the more valuable you are and that is why in my last job at smart and final I could learn three different things(cashier, service clerk, meat clerk) in less than one year. The managers looked at me as one of the few people that worked fast and hard  without making excuses to new tasks. I am not gonna lie but I got three offers from customers that wanted me to work for them because the saw on me a good potential. I am always willing to learn anything but of course I like to be rewarded for my job done. For me the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. They were more than friends to me. And of course there were some hard customers but nothing that I could not resolve in a good manner. Also, I can say that the hardest part of my job was the beginning because its not easy to learn different things, but not impossible. Thank you"

good,My co-workers are very productive they finish with their work on time. My co-workers are fun and so as my boss. I enjoy working with them because they are like a family to me.
good,"I would be answering phone calls and helping customers with their needs. Also doing closing duties which include; cleaning the registers,changing trash bags and cleaning the area."
good,"Most of my time at Smart and Final a typical day would consist of assisting customers, most co workers were very positive and influential on my stay there. I had a very motivating manager that was eager to see me succeed, very inspirational in the talks we had, open to suggestions and change. Customers were a plus, most of them were regulars."
good,"I have already completed the survey on S&F. It is a nice store and customers and staff are very friendly, Would work there again in a second."
good,"i learned how to become a leader"
good,"Smart & Final starts off with the time clock. From there you are assigned to the duty in which you were hired for, in my case - a cashier. After about 9 months or so I had become in charge of the Bakery Department which my shift would start there. Those days were a bit different."

good,"Im a fast worker organized "
good,"Work days can vary from slow to fast paced, though I always have a lot of work in front of me. I learned that teamwork is the usual and most of the time method to get a heavy workload finished. The managers I have worked with so far are great. Like friends you can joke around and have a good laugh with. I would have to say that the hardest part of my job so far is trying to work both produce and deli departments at the same time. The most enjoyable parts of my job would be working Freezer and Produce as I have a responsibility to provide frozen items and fresh fruits and vegetables to the customer, which gives me challenge. The second would have to be the register because I get to interact with customers."

good,I show up to work normally one hour or so ahead of the time I am suppose to clock in. Reason why is so I get settled in at work and prepare for my shift by walking around to see what needs to be done first. Learning something new is always hard to anyone but in a fast pace environment you have to keep up or be ahead of in your work and that is what I learned  as well as providing 100% positive customer service satisfaction. The best part about a job is the people who you work with to make your store customers happy. With that said making friends with co workers and with people in general comes naturally to me.  Hardest part of the job is learning but once you got it down its not hard at all. My favorite part of the job is meeting new people who ever they are from customers to new coworkers etc... I am always positive and love learning new things its a joy I have.

good,"a typical day at work: interdepartment coordination"
good,At my job i usually go in and get right to work. I ask my manager what he needs me to do and he will tell me very specifically and i will do it. Basically my day consists of what others want me to do. Since i am not an official employee i dont have a specific work area. The management is great and i am always greeted with a smile. the employees are nice and are very good workers. The hardest part of the day is when enormous amounts of people come in.
