rating,review
bad,Company is horrible. Everyone talks behind someone behind their back. Pay is horrible compared to other airlines. Benefits suck as you have to pay for everything. Travel benefits are horrible as we have to fight for the benefits to become active.
bad,"Management is HORRIBLE! Very two faced, special treatment to certain employees. Hours are horrible. You do not get to use the benefits of flying very often. Just all around horriable."
bad,"Skywest doesn’t care about their employees. Their turnover rate is unbelievably high for a reason. Had to call out of work to go to the ER for having stroke symptoms, I was physically incapacitated. Paralyzed on my right side, blind and deaf on right side and speech impaired from it. They fired me for this call out. Provided doctors notes and everything. They said it was no exception. So just a heads up, if you suffer from paralysis, stroke, heart attack, or anything life threatening or physically damaging, they don’t consider that excusable and will fire you. Welcome to the skywest “family”"
bad,In recent times they would hire unskilled personnel to be supervisors and general manager. If you were not of the right job persuasion they would not listen to you if you had complaints and they would ignore that complaint or cover it up. It’s a very unfair place to work if you don’t play their game. Never ever complain or make any statements that caused an investigation or you will have an unpleasant uncomfortable stay in your employment at SKYWEST.
bad,"Pueblo is a tiny airport and yet SkyWest is always hiring. Raise any red flags? You work 2 hours or less per shift and can have up to three shifts a day so enjoy that unpaid commute to and from the airport for your $15. Minimum wage, no benfits, haphazard training and endless computer classes. Management is a joke - latest guy was gone for 6 plus months for death in the family and"
bad,"This place pays poor.  They have a system that protects them.  They allow their Management to Bully employees.  They don't give breaks, they lie to crew members, they falsify numbers to make crew legal to fly when they are not.  They lie to their partners.  They ask you to lie.  When I wouldn't lie or go along with the crowd, I was blamed for being Hostile.  HAHA if you ask those that know me they say this is not true.  They retaliate, and they blame you if you are not in their click"
bad,Company is just a sorority teen age high school competition always being threatened about loosing their own jobs to new more talented people. Not a good company at all to work for
bad,Training manager is a liar and formulates ideas about employees that she gossips about to other faculty. Should handle work disputes more professionally. Would not recommend working at this job.
bad,"I was released a week before graduation because I got nervous on a drill when I calmed down a second later teacher said too late you were unsuccessful after I gave up my job, left my family for 3 weeks and took the drastic cut in pay. They need to work with people more like the larger Airlines. Complete waste of 3 weeks they asked me to return to start over and I would never go back who wants to repeat the entire class they should have said you can come back and pick up where you left off. Insensitive people, low pay, expect the world for the chump change and stress they give you. No Thank you ! I would never recommend them to a soul."
bad,"So, if you work the ramp, or customer service.  The company looks at you like your disposable. If you work in maintenance,  watch your back. People will make it very hard for you to do your job."
bad,"poor management not fair, favoritism, a lot of supervisors will just take care of there friends in all ways  hours, Overtime pay and schedule really bad place to work."
bad,very poor place to work. you  never would recive any credit for a good job done. very little training and if you did get it it was poor. useless manangemt.
bad,"The GM is a complete douche. Created a very lazy culture, 10 people to turn one plane, doesn't know how to schedule correctly. His favorites do half the work and get promoted. If you are willing to brown nose you will get ahead. People literally clock in and take a nap in the break room. Happens every day. Right in front of supervisors who look the other way. Lots of horseplay on ramp, bunch of idiots out there, love quarrels, etc. Very immature staff including upper management. Tons of unnecessary gossip. Not recommended. If you are lazy and like to do everything but work. This is your station."
bad,Horrible pay and terrible hours and terrible benefits. Leadership was not really there to deal with customers and there needs.
bad,We were very under staffed and we weren't being paid a reasonable wage for the workload and other things that the job entailed. This was the worst job experience I've had.
bad,This company has no respect for their employees.  Lost both customer service and ramp agent contracts do to very poor management.  Senior leadership only cared about their bonuses and avoided relationships with employees.
bad,"SkyWest (Memphis Station) was so POORLY MANAGED (the ""manager"" was HORRIBLE), one of the supervisors was awful. Corporate knew that the station was extremely short handed but the manager kept relaying the message that ""it wasn't in the budget to hire anyone"", but continiously allowed one agent (MYSELF) to work Operations, Bagroom, & the Ramp alone with no help from management. That should NEVER happen, I'm not disgruntle (just tired & fed up): I just REALLY HATE SKYWEST for treating their employees at the Memphis Station so poorly."
bad,The only pro about working for Skywest is the flight benefits. But even those will cost you hundreds per year. The company doesn't pay well and is full of horrible management.
bad,A great place to get aircraft maintenance experience. Cool aircraft to work on. They have the new ERJ 175.
bad,"Basically your a number. Your supervisors think they're god. you may be able to fly any where but you don't have the money to stay. in winter you freeze when your outside but when in the pitt you sweat and when you step out side it freezes. your in charge of documents ""clr"" and if its filled out improperly you get a write up. just a lot of drama back breaking work (literary) for 10 an hour."
bad,Very poor management. Poor pay. The culture of the organization is very  negativity and back stabbing. When issues do occur management doesn't do anything. Only benefit is the flight benefits.
bad,"They terminate fully qualified employees at the drop of a hat because they have a lot of applicants due to ""free flight benefits"".  They pay extremely low wages and expect perfection in every aspect.  They claim ""fair and consistent"" policies, but every situation is different, but apply strict adherence to policies with no exceptions.  They call their station managers ""leaders"" but they are simply followers of their policies."
bad,"Pay is low and turnover is high. The employees that stay bear the burden of this. I am not sure how much longer they can sustain this lack of experience before there is a serious accident. Safety does not come first here, money does."
bad,"If you need your income, don't depend on your employment with Skywest. They will promise you they need you and you will never work the minimum hours, but you will."
bad,"For this job the company requires you to be very flexible. You will check-in customers, sometimes sell tickets, ensure passport info is accurate (or you could be fined personally... so I've been told) load and unload bags, work in extreme weather, de-ice airplanes (huge responsibility by itself), clean airplanes, be responsible for ensuring hazmat isn't loaded onto the plane, search the plane for things that could go boom (yeah you're responsible for that), empty the lavatory ( that's the bathroom). Besides some of those responsibilities, you also have to deal with irate passengers when the flight cancels or gets delayed or if their bags don't show up when they arrive and do lots and LOTS of training. When you DO go to your initial training the company is so cheap that they won't even give you your own hotel room, you have to share with some person you've never met before. You are normally scheduled 5 days a week but only working maybe 16 hours because you go in for a 2 hour shift in the morning and then have to come back in the evening for another 2 hour shift and if the flight is late, you have to stay as long as it takes (sometimes 3 or 4 hours) until it's gone so don't make plans or have another part time job. This company will make you think it's a great place to work with lots of corporate propaganda but the truth is, they take their employees for granted. Bonuses for your department are not held to the same standard as another department even though you're supposed to be one big happy family.You start off at $8.50/hr and you get a raise to $8.90 after working 1900hrs."
bad,"I started in the company as an aircraft mechanic and I was very happy for the benefits they offered me but not for long. Its a very fast pace environment and on top of that the company it is not well organized causing people to make mistakes in paperwork all the time. "
bad,"being with Skywest airlines for over 9 years I've seen many changes in the only for the worst. pay cuts, hours cut, more work less staff. the great thing about it use to be the flight benefits but even those have went downhill. you're only a number and not respected as an employee. they're huge safety concerns in my opinion as well. I would advise choosing a different airline. you will not have a future here and they only talk out at 14 dollars an hour after 15 years of service. also take into consideration that there is an added half an hour to your time you each day because you do have to take an employee bus. sometimes it's delayed for weather which means you may have to leave your house in an hour early to make it on time because there is no leniency"
bad,"I worked for Skywest Boise for almost three years.  Enjoyed the job, passengers and fellow co-workers, but the management was horrific!  Very inconsistent, favoritism, and working with two different set of rules for United ""who they contract for"" and Skywest rules.  Can't keep people due to rate of pay which is $9.00 hr.  After two years had a .42 pay raise.  This job comes with a lot of responsibility.  Hours are given by bid/seniority.  Be prepared to work @ 4:30 am.  Most everyone has other jobs to work around this low pay, low morale Boise base. Inconsistent supervisors who don't operate on the same page.  All for the free flight benefits which is the only reason I stuck it out as long as I did.  It is hard to get out of Boise standby, the flights are always full.  Just not worth it.  Go for Delta, Alaska or Southwest if you can get on if you want descent pay and culture......."
bad,Just like any other airline its a very high passed stressful day. Their was a lot of favoritism going on with in the company.  Co workers were very nice.  Hardest part was not know if you were going to have a job every three months due to SkyWest having a contract with DIA.  Best part was the flight benefits.
bad,"Hate their impersonal video interviews. Pay is far below what is reasonable for the job responsiblity snd minimum qualifications. If you enjoy working hard to remain at the poverty level, go for it."
bad,I was working as a ramp agent which is the ones that load the airplanes. It was a nice physical job and the people that you worked with is like every other job hit and miss. There was a lot of variety in what you could do and that was nice but I was hired at one pay rate and before I could even start I lost .20 an hour. Flights benefits were nice but a pain to setup everything else wasn't worth it
bad,DON'T DO IT! This company is going downhill. The work culture is frustrating and terrible.
bad,When I started here this company was a great place to work. But things started to slip about a year ago when the give us a bogus TA and we only got a 1% raise. Management is slipping and so is morale. The new thing is to recruit pilots from Australia because upper management knows most pilots are now going to other Airlines because of the pay. The company often preaches quality of life that no loner exists and some of the worst reserve work rules in the industry. SAPA the pilot rep group has no real power. As I said when I first started to work here is was a great company now pilots would do well to avoid this company and go somewhere else.
bad,the company is mostly contract there is little room for advancement low pay and no work life balance. its a good place to open doors for a major company but not someplace that you could make a career out of.
bad,"The jobs here are great. but the pay isn't good and the people are not the nicest. and they don't have good management. As much as I love what I do, the people don't make it worth it."
bad,"I loved going into work everyday, it was a very challenging job. There was never a day the same. I was taught that there is only one way to treat our passengers, to always give the best customer service. Our management team was the best. In the seven years that I worked for SkyWest, we were all family and keep in close contact with each other. Happy passengers."
bad,"I work at the LAX station and the company is run so poorly even the CEO would be highly dissapointed. Supervisors act like children in a elementary enviornment. With the $11 an hour they give you, it's not worth all the BS you have to go through. Supervisors and the shift managers do not know how to do their job, they are never around to help when your stuck, and they find every little reason to write you up, degrade you, and belittle you. I don't know about other stations but LAX is HORRIBLE! And the co workers you work with?? Let's just say you're better off keeping your mouth shut and not talking to anybody about anything. Trust no one. Just like Skywest management the co workers conduct themselves in a childish manner."
bad,"I went into this job excited, something new and different. I knew that being Low on the totem pole would mean that I would get the short end of the stick on almost everything; schedule, pay, etc. What I didn’t expect was that I’d be treated like a modern day slave. Typical day working the Ramp for SkyWest,; you wake up at 0300, get into work by 0400, work your tail off making sure you get each and every flight out on time, suffer back pain, knee pain, wrist pain and all other pain that one would get from constant lifting and hauling. Then after your last flight goes out and you walk back to the office, ready to clock out and relax, you are told that you cannot leave because of irregular operations. Mind you it’s 1400, you’re tired, everything aches, and you’re only being paid the bare minimum. Yeah, I never knew that hourly employees could be forced to stay on the clock. On top of it all, you don’t even get a thanks, or an attaboy for your hard days work. All you get is a threat of termination if you leave at your scheduled time off. They don’t care for their employees, you are only a body to them."
bad,"This company can afford to pay their employees better. In training, they will go on and on about the flight benefits to get you excited about the career. You soon realize you can't afford to eat or sleep after your free flight...if you're lucky enough to get a flight. Don't forget, you have to get on a return flight to make it back to work. Stand-by can be a real struggle. Unless you can preserve a lunchbox for a three or four-day trip, you will end up spending your check on the expensive airport and hotel food. The time you have to sit in airports is very frustrating for 1.95 per diem. The probationary period is a year long. They could reduce this time to six months. Management including crew support are bullies, especially to new hires.  They do not do anything to make your job easier, and this is a tough job. It dictates your life. Most of all, it is very hard physically and your health goes down the tubes. You can't eat right and you don't know when to sleep. The company offers very little resources to support your efforts."
bad,Was expecting to use my flight benefits but it's kind of hard making $11 an hour and only working 11 hours a week. They sale you on a dream but it's not reality
bad,"Corporate training was great, however local training was not. Locally assigned trainers seemed to lack knowledge and bothered by having to sign employees off on training. Station overall had zero teamwork and management was very disorganized."
bad,Plan and conduct domestic and international passenger flights in accordance with FAA regulations and company policy.  Analyze weather in all portions of route for safe and legal feasibility of operating each flight.  Monitor airports for restraints as they apply to aircraft performance.
bad,"Horrible pay and hours. You won't have time or the money to use flight benefits. You'll average about $10/hr, work 12 hr shifts and gain 10 pounds. No room for advancement and terrible retirement options. The industry has completely changed over the past 20 years. There is nothing fun or glamorous about this job. Be prepared to pack up your belongings and move half way across the country with less than a weeks notice-(and pay for the relocation expenses). There is a reason why 50% of people who get hired quit."
bad,The new direction of SkyWest is nothing nice for employees outside of UT. I would not recommend them for any minority. Majority of salary management is Caucasian.
bad,"Pay cuts made it less than worthwhile to drive and take employee bus. It can make average part time pay come out to anywhere between $7-$9 to start after transportation costs. Be prepared to add up to 3 hours travel time or more to and from work. Shifts are staggered so it is hard to get hours together so they can get you to work more without paying OT by bridging. New night ramp agents stay well past times scheduled to be off most days, which can make it more worthwhile or less- depending on who you are. So desperate for people they sign you off on things you don't really know how to do. One supervisor is unaware of what the other is doing, making it easy for write ups. Breaks can be few and far between or at times that don't make sense:beginning or end of shift. Fun job, warm lower level employees but made difficult to justify by being seen as a number by upper management. Advice: work minimal hours for benefits. Don't complain about ill equipment, unfair practices & don't make this your only job. Many unhappy employees due to pay cuts, benefit cuts, and soon to be again... Hour caps from Obama Care. Over all- fun job, demanding, but illogical. Pay too low to do anything when you fly somewhere, travel time to and from could be best spent on being paid lower at another job to buy your airline ticket & not have to deal with the stressors of non-rev, and trying to trade shifts or get rid of hours to make it worth it or not be over worked. My advice too... probably apply at a different airline if it is something you wish to do for a long time. Not many employees have stayed more"
bad,"It is just a job. Need work equipment, most of the time is unsafe work and if you complain while training they would let you go right away. The flying benefits still good, the company is reducing the flying benefits every time."
bad,"Salt Lake City airport - fun place to work, awesome coworkers. The work is not hard, but you are literally running from one gate to the next to bring in the aircraft and get the luggage unloaded. We are always short handed because skywest refuses to pay its ramp agents what most other airlines at salt lake city airport pays their ramp agents. The supervisors will tell you to go outside and work the flights and to help other agents, but they themselves will never lift a finger to assist. There have been many instances where a supervisor will see an agent loading the luggage onto the aircraft by themselves and make no effort to go help them. They have a point system with no flexibility at all. When there is a snowstorm or accident that brings the freeway to a standstill, even if you call to notify them of the situation,  you still get points. If you are on time and get to the terminal and realize you forgot your clock in badge in your vehicle, you will have to take the shuttle back out to the employee parking, which takes about 20-30 minutes round trip, then get points for being late. If there are coworkers there at the terminal with you that can vouch for you that you were on time, it doesn't matter. Employee appreciation day is a joke. They feed the pilots, flight attendants and mechanics good food (bbq steaks, ribs, cafe rio), but they feed the ramp agents something of lesser quality (fritos taco salad).  All departments start off at a higher rate, while ramp agents start off at $10.50. Despite the unfair treatment of ramp agents, we are still able to get all luggage loaded"
bad,Has gone down hill over the past few years.  Also would not do customer service and it will be discontinued soon.  The training department is the worst!  The manager and supervisors are the worst group you could work for. Awful pay.
bad,"The job is stressful because you will be working for several major carriers who are company partners.  The job can be life consuming.  You do not earn much, and you're away from home more than half the time; and while on trips, staying at hotels can lead to solitary confinement, boredom, and an unproductive personal life.  The company demands much of you and nearly exploits your personal time because they are inflexible and only pretend to care as long as their bottom line is not affected.  Some of the people they hire can be quite problematic and unprofessional; and if you're stuck working with them, it makes for a much more stressful job.  The rudeness/high demands of the public is a quick turn-off.  Their is plenty of backstabbing; predators go undetected or pardoned.  The job is a high-risk to personal health physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.   Low-pay means living expenses or paying down any debt will be compromised.  The lifestyle makes for superficial, short-lived flings and attachments.  Management can be unfair and very selfish."
bad,"my shift was always busy. how to maintain a flow with a million things to get done. management needs improvement in a few areas, my co workers for the most part were great it was the brown nosers that would create things to had to watch for dont want any involement. making sure everything was done, having everything a million people needed right there in hand"
bad,It all starts with management not encouraging a positive atmosphere and keeping employees focused on the work at hand. From the top tier it is possible to inspire a well integrated work place but not with a negative down side being presented. I learned a lot about jets from the amazing teachers hired from within and adamant about updates on company aircraft. Some co workers were good people but the rest were probably affected from years of being layed off. The hardest part of the job is the time needed vs the time allotted. A typical day at work is waiting for something to fix and keeping managers happy.
bad,"I made the most of my time with Skywest and fun coworkers. Supervisors and management are not flexible or considerate with employees and focus on their overall outlook to the public. "
bad,The management is a complete joke. If your not friends with the manager good luck....  I worked at Skywest for over 2 years and never got a raise. No sick pay or vacation time. Minimum wage....
bad,"I was a parts clerk and my boss was horrible. All she did was walk around and flirt and flaunt her money, she is married to a much younger lead there so it's perfectly acceptable. Everyone in maintenance is either dating someone in the parts department or married to someone in the parts department. It's ridiculous. If there is a problem with parts they automatically call their significant other instead of handling it like adults. At least one of the leads thinks he's Gods gift and runs to the boss over everything and so happens he's married to the parts sup. Good luck when he's the one that's complaining about parts since she's older he whines to her like a child instead of being a lead. As someone who was military I personally think some of the maintenance team brags too much about their military career at times as well and I believe at least one uses stolen valor, which should be totally unacceptable and checked into but again it's all in who is sleeping with who. Management sucks there, pay is decent but unless you want to bed a manager to be taken seriously like some of the employees did then I'd look elsewhere"
bad,It is sad that when you disagree with a supervisor and are actually proven right that they will will be childish and put a note on your file that hurts any advancement. It is also sad that that one person is never ever questioned by higher management especially when you prove that individual is messing with your time card. in other words if the name Jim Mooney comes up run the other direction.
bad,Like the title says the management is poor and you are always on the move with little to no time to rest. Would not recommend working here unless you like being treated unfairly.
bad,"was a great place to work in the BOI parts room Manager was very knowledgeable and approachable."
bad,The amount of studying you have to do on your own time at home to learn all the information needed to do the job and the amount of stress from trying to do 3+ jobs at the same time are not at all worth the $12 per hour.The only way someone would keep this job is if they love the almost free stand-by flight benefits so much that they can take the crazy am shift (3am to 1pm) or late nights (3pm to 1 am) and the 10 hours of constant stress.
bad,"Being optimistic, my quality of life has been minimized as well as the opportunities for advancement are limited; because of the pay and schedules it very difficult to use the travel benefits."
bad,"poor management, non union. if used correctly this job may offer experience and a pay check while training for another job in aviation."
bad,Typical office type work. I go over the daily maintenance schedules and make sure that each aircraft will be put on a flight line to make it to an overnight maintenance base. Follow up with each base to make sure each planes work was complete and that it will be flying that next day.
bad,"Moral is low, pay is low, Corporate has their head in the sand.  Pay cuts made everything miserable."
bad,"Not only is it stressful as a customer service agent (in a hub), but their benefits have become increasingly horrible the last few years. First they increase our deductions on medical, then they cut our pay (to be more competitive) and now they want to make us pay for our segments when we fly?"
bad,"Inadequate staff planning therefore you can't do your job properly. Many irate customers miss their flights due to not enough staff. Pay is unacceptable at $9 an hour for the work they expect you to do. Skywest promotes ""safety first""  That's a joke. Management don't seem to care about their staff or their customers. They feed you incorrect information in their initial training class. Be prepared to be scheduled for double the hours for part time (it is NOT 12 hours like you're led to believe). Very disappointed with this company. Go with a mainline airline. Just saying."
bad,"Been with Skywest airlines for over 7 years and seen many changes mostly for the worst. "
bad,"Skywest would be an excellent airline of choice to work for if the company held itself to their own ""Company Standards"". The Supervisors at LAX lack social, leadership and communication skills. Some people have their own agenda when working with others and some, let's just say will let you do all of the work. Team work is only shown by a few not many. Last but not least learn as much as you can and either move up or move on."
bad,"It has every potential to be the best airport job in the industry but with failing contracts and little to no management the airline has gone down hill. Unfair wages, horrible equipment, and supervisors and leads that act more like children than their title."
bad,I feel i was let go on something that was not my fault Superior did not have my back
bad,A typical workplace is never typical. Everyday is a new adventure filled with new experiences.
bad,Not enough hours to balance the amount of employees.
bad,3rd shift parts clerk. Good company. Learned shipping and receiving. Terrible culture among co-workers
bad,"Skywest boasts integrity, but it's meaningless. Rules are rarely upheld and favoritism is abundant. Find a better airline to work for. There is job security because they won't pay you what you're worth, but they won't lay you off. If you can handle the BS and outrageous health care payments, this may be the place for you!"
bad,"So called crew leaders and management at Palm Springs maintenance facility were abusive and callous."
bad,"When I was there, the management was horrible.  They could careless about family time.  From my understanding they still don't provide adequate compensation for comparative compensation for what you will be doing."
bad,I enjoyed my job but coworkers made it very hard to want to drive four hours a day just to work.......................................................
bad,Would not recommend this job to my dog. You are forced and pushed to fit in their way or no way. If equipment breaks down you are forced to work like a robot.
bad,The job is labor intensive and the pay is simply not high enough for the amount of work performed. OJI's are common and most employee's have no urgency to work leaving you to perform the work faster to pick up their slack.
bad,"I worked parts department, job was awesome. Just alot of double standards with management. Workers cant leave early but the boss does. Workers cant sit around but the boss does. Horrible management vibe. Have to lead by example & they do not."
good,I was working roughly 60 hours per week. The hours started at 0430 and ended at times 2 am the next day. There was a high turnover during the time I was there.
good,My daily work routine was to get the planes in/out on time.  Learned about avionics and compliance (which I enjoyed).  The hard part of the job was face-to-face resolution with disgruntled passengers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the passengers and being able to meet on time departure criteria.
good,"No job security, benefitis, poor pay and very poor moral at times.   I have enjoyed the job itself as it was new and exciting!  It is difficult and challenging as no two days are the same.  The shifts are split and does not work for anyone that has a full-time job.  If the plane is delayed, you are stuck there!  Management is silly as it is a contract company for another airline so there are different policies and no one person can give you a true direct answer!  The PERKS--stand by travel!!!  It was amazing!!  I was able to fly for free or dang near free to several different countries and all over the USA!!!  I would go back if it paid more or was structured so that I could work a fulltime job!!!"
good,"I work 10 hour days 5 days a week.  I make 15.85 an hour, but there is no job security.  We have a large management turn over. The co-workers are like a work family and for the most part get along well together and work well as a team.  I work around air craft and it is mentally and physically challenging.  I load bags wt 70 plus pounds in the back of an aircraft. It is a fast pace industry that you need to be alert at all times.  The hardest part of the job is the weather and issues that come with late flights and having to get planes loaded and unloaded in a very short amount of time.  I guess I would have to say the co-workers when we get a chance to laugh and joke around,"
good,Stable work environment but long shifts. Company benefits are decent but management can make for a stressful and unenjoyable work environment. You are scheduled 4 10 hour shifts per week but it is 3rd shift so free time after work is limited.
good,Job security is the major concern due to the company's frequent reorganization plans.  You can never feel secure with this kind of environment and you must be prepared for the worst.
good,"I worked as a flight attendant. The first 2 years you are their slave. They literally own you. The tell you where to live immediately after graduating the inflight program. You have 3 days to get to your new domicile and figure out where to live before they start working you to the bone.  If it's the holidays, it's even worse. Be prepared to work around the clock due to delays and weather. You can work 4-7 days straight 12-20 hour days. No lie. And if the hours are ""weather related,"" then are legally allowed to work you that long without overtime. Speaking of pay, whenever you are waiting in an airport or sitting in a hotel (sometimes for a day or 2), or sitting in the plane that's going nowhere, you are making per diem "
good,"Management at the station level is questionable, basically exalted administrative assistants."
good,Can’t complain about the benefits. You get to travel all over the world. The pay is not enough to live on though. Most flight attendants live in a house or apartment where they share rooms with other flight attendants.
good,I enjoyed the work but we were always short handed and the management were trained poorly.  Could be the reason they are no longer at Roanoke Regional Airport
good,"The manager I worked under was a wonderful woman and the majority of the people who work here are always helpful and always happy to teach a new skill. The only people I disliked working with left without two weeks notice shortly after being hired, so no worries there. "
good,"Just don't waste your time! Yes, the company is not bad. What is bad you'll come to find the hard way, is the despicable salary amount. The company fairly compensates everyone else in all other positions. It seems to be an issue only in this area."
good,"You only have to work a minimum of 12 hours a week. It's all shift work, 8-11 then back from 3-6. If flight is delayed or anything could be there u til midnight or longer. Managment is friendly but very very unorganized."
good,"Working for skywest, shows you how to get your foot in the door, if you are seriously considering a job as a FA permanently in the future with another airline.  "
good,"The people at SBN airport are great. Company caters to the younger people not the older. I found it very hard to move up in the company due to the company focusing on the younger mechanics. When I would sign up for training I would get denied and younger, lower seniority mechanics would get approved. Over time was open and the mechanic could put in almost as much time as he/she wanted"
good,"If you’re just tying to work to obtain flying benefits,  then Skywest is the place for you. If you want to be a flight attendant as a career, then go mainline. Don’t waste your time here"
good,"It's a low paying job that requires low amount of skill."
good,"after working there more than 5 years, I saw the moral go down due to pay cuts, under staffing and over worked employees. it is a contract company which adds an element of stress/ job security. and the ratio of working employees per amount of flights worked increased... the best part used to be the flexible schedualing, but when people began to quit, giving away shifts became a struggle."
good,"Met a lot of Great People, In and out of the Airport. Worked with some Amazing coworkers. I made the plain a safe and fun all the way to your Destination... I would say the hardest part would be away from home and being by your self a lot!! And the most enjoyable part was that I got to meet a lot of fascinating People and was able to see a lot of great city's..."
good,Benefits are okay. You’re basically just a number though. Probation is over a year long from hire date. Pay is garbage. Lower management is nice. Upper management doesn’t care about you.
good,"So the Chief Commercial Officer let the financial department know in a staff meeting how much he valued them. When an employee who had worked there and reached the pay ceiling in her position asked if after the Trump tax cut for corporations meant that there would be an adjustment to pay for the employees, Wade Steel said ""Why would we pay you more? If you quit today I would have 100 applications for your position at starting pay. That would save us money."" So pay is low and will remain low, benefits are decent. Flight benefits are becoming more difficult to use. "
good,"It can be very exciting. But it is also tiring. One of the hardest parts is being on time (EVERY TIME NO EXCEPTIONS)  and staying awake. The hours can be long and some of which you won't get paid for (with some exceptions). This job is for someone who loves people, is flexible and open to a completely different ""corporate"" structure."
good,The flying benefits were the best part of this job. The workplace culture was Work Hard and Play Hard Together. The weather can harsh and make things rough.
good,This was a company a lot of people spent years at and in the end they were messed over. Compensations were taken away from the employees in Los Angeles and all over the company at a time where you needed to make more but money was being taken from us and we were given more work and in the end the company folded. This is also a company where upper management would Express their raises in cash while their employees were getting more work and less pay
good,"A typical day at SkyWest Airlines, You are working under pressure from the time you start until you end your shift. "
good,"It was a great opportunity.  The down side is not growth as a flight attendant.  The training was ok, the pay was terrible.  The benefit were marginal. Not much else can be said"
good,fun place to work but you are constantly busy with multiple tasks to do from driving jet bridge to checking in passengers
good,"A day at work is fast paced and you must do your job in a timely manner with quality service. Fun atmosphere with great co-workers. Within the first couple of months of being hired I learned all there is to know about the position which would typically take a person a year to do. Learned customer service procedures, problem solving situations between customers, communication between flight captains/crews and tower control. The hardest part of the job would be the shortage of manpower, there have been lay offs due to loss of business requiring us to take the tasks of others on top of our own. The enjoyable part of the job is being able to communicate and aide passengers with all their needs with the best customer service skills I have to offer!"
good,"I don't feel that there is a lot of room for advancement nor is the pay that great, but having flight benefits will change your life if you're able to make the job work for you financially."
good,"I worked as a TDY agent helping out at airports that were understaffed.  Management rules differed from station to station.  Coporate rules were constantly changing and were restrictive, constantly changing and sometimes insulting as if they were trying to catch you doing something wrong.  I loved the people I worked with and the team atmosphere at the airports was great."
good,SkyWest is a great company. Great travel benefits. Flexible work schedule. Twenty crew domiciles to choose from. A family atmosphere. The largest regional airline.
good,"great benefits and free flights but requires a lot of physical work and demanding work...learn a lot on the ramp, poor management could work on training managers better so the work environment is better"
good,Skywest Airlines had a good formula with a structure but their failure was placing poor management in place. The place was great with employee culture and the benefits were awesome but the pay was extremely low and the managers that ran the departments and station were very distant and not open to ideas or feedback. They lost their contract in Denver with United because the corporate side gave up on the station. Zero support.
good,Lots of responsibility with low wags and long hours. Poor quality training. High stress job. Long hours with maybe a break or maybe a 30 minute lunch. High turn over for supervisor who are not trained for the position.
good,"benefits are fantastic,"
good,"Long hours, delays and reflow of schedule.  "
good,"SkyWest is a very busy airlines, you have to have the patience and energy to work in this type of environment.  Work with a lot of enjoyable people.  The hardest part of the job is having to deal with flight cancellations, and irate passengers. Most enjoyable part is meeting new polite people, who have something nice to say, or acknowledge the work efforts put in while helping them have an positive traveling experience."
good,Job has good flight bennys. Advancement in denver was basically based on who you were friends with. Management changed all the time. It was obvious that there was a management problem. Alot of unqualified people put into positions that should not have been. The schedule was very flexible. The job was not a bad job but overwhelming at times for basically no pay. You could work at starbucks and make more money.
good,"The job's fairly easy, you have a break in between planes, you do basic ramp operations. After training where they say everything is peachy and professional, the reality is that the pay's pretty low and the people they hold on to are unprofessional and looking for an easy buck. This results in somewhat horrific safety practices, people disregarding operating procedures and nobody reports anyone for it."
good,"Creatives are not appreciated at SkyWest.  While the flight benefits are good, and most of the people you work with are great, the people who manage the creatives are out of touch with trends, and think you can do what you do with pennies on the dollar."
good,"flight benefits are good , Good place for start your career . lack of communication between management & employees . No motivation , no appreciation ."
good,"SkyWest has made a lot of changes over the years, the most recent had the biggest impact.  Financially the Executive team has done a great job turning things around.  When it comes to people they have truly failed, in my time at SkyWest employees always were taken care of(even though salaries stayed low) but current leadership has forgotten how the daily operation happens(unless you are a pilot, then they kiss your feet)."
good,"Came in as trainee for E-175 Regional Jets.  Initial training was OK, very intense.  Initial Operating Experience training had no clear goals.  Line procedures at times conflicted with those taught in ground school."
good,"The atmosphere was good there. The employees were fun to work with."
good,"I love the crews I work with, and the support form management is pretty good, the salary is very inadequate to survive on, but the flying benefits for the company is great, can't be beat. I think they try to be as giving as they are  able to."
good,"The only thing good I can say about it is the flight benefits. Other than that this job sucks. Management doesn't give a rats butt about the employees. Women will work the counter and gate, while men will work outside loading and unloading planes all for a whopping $8.50 an hour."
good,"Coworkers become friends for life. Work/life balance is extremely difficult. Always living life out of a suitcase is extremely hard. Although the job is great, be prepared for a lot of alone time."
good,"Decent pay for the area considering how little education it requires, however wages not keeping up with local economy especially for a family.  Usually abundant seasonal overtime."
good,"SkyWest is a good place to get some experience working as a mechanic on airplanes. As a new mechanic, you'll be working third shift, weekends, and holidays, but the pay is decent."
good,Fun place to work pay was not good nor was the amount of work you did worth it. Lots of training to learn your job and how to do but shifts only lasted a couple of hours at a time 2 different times of day.
good,"The job itself, I loved. But this is not the company (or industry) to be in when you have a family, because they are not flexible and do not have any personal interest in your hardships."
good,It is a great way to see the country.  It can be quite physically taxing but the people are great!  You have the opportunity to see different places and people all the time.
good,I worked for this company 11 years. Fun working environment. I enjoyed every position I worked. Very flexible. The pay wasn't great. The flying benefits made it worth it.
good,"You and your family can travel the world at little to no cost. Quality of life differs from person to person, benefits provided however are expensive."
good,The best regional airline to work for however their communication is not up to par. The chief flight attendants have too much to handle so many things get slipped through the cracks. Make sure you have all your questions and concerns in writing.
good,"It was ok working there, the place was great but not so great management. It felt like some of the supervisors were more concern with what power do they hold then caring for the best interest of the employees.  There are may favorites and things like that which I didn't like at all."
good,As you will read with many other reviews it's the so many hours you don't get paid for that ruin this job. Plus the excitement of travel and seeing so many new places wears off quickly.
good,"If you are just breaking into the airline industry, then this is the company for you. SkyWest is a slow pace airline that allows you to catch onto the industry and what it offers."
good,the job itself was a god job but i was looking for something to pay a little more and that when i got the opportunity to work for the united states post office
good,"Working for this company was a good experience to learn how to safely work around running aircraft engines. Good pay and benefits, They took care of there employees."
good,Very good place to work at if you enjoy the out doors and fast pace enviroments.  This job is an easy job you drive around delivering luggage ensuring you arrive in time.
good,"Working for SkyWest as a Flight Attendant you could be based in several different cities. I was based in Chicago, IL and it was very cold when I went."
good,"Long work days, poor training, low pay, travel benefits but hard to get out on standby and hard to travel when working 40 hours a week, brutal industry to work in - must be very tough skinned and take a lot of abuse from passengers.  The job isn't that hard just dealing with upset passengers constantly due to cancellations and delays and working long hours, 10 hour shifts on your feet all day.  Turnover is very high."
good,"The crew culture is good, scheduling, and management can be supportive depending who you talk with. Overall the company is good but reserve life is hard before you become a line holder. The probation period is also a year which is longer than any other regional perhaps even mainline."
good,A typical day at work for SkyWest was usually maintaining and servicing the fleet equipment . You were on a plane to repair equipment in other airports.  Hardest things about the job was you were working in either cold or hot conditions.
good,"Trained in Denver, Colorado. Holiday Inn training facility."
good,For the record i gotta say that i was grateful to have the opportunity to work for them. its not the best job in the world only because the pay sucks. i knew people that worked there for year only making 14 bucks an hour. life as a ramper is tuff on your body and stress on your brain when working a flight.
good,A typical day at work could be working in all types of weather. I learn to work as a team to get air crafts out on time. I enjoy working with all my coworkers were like a family a home away from home. The hardest part of the day could be getting delayed planes because of mechanical issues or bad weather. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and seeing happy passengers.
good,Co-worker are great. Limited interaction with people throughout the day.
good,"Lots of duties to do in all types weather, inside and out.  Hours not the greatest but benefits were good."
good,"Pay and benefits are good, but communication needs to be better between the leads and the employees"
good,"Good fun position and experience. Company just has a very obscure way of integrating employees comments and opinions. Its not unionized and they have set up an internal union which is paid by the company so its pretty pointless to get an issue addressed or resolved. However, the employees are awesome but there's not a lot of support from management."
good,"The day start with briefing before each shift,-update information on flights, delays, gate changes,"
good,"Fun place to work. I deal with different people everyday. I check people n for their flights as ell as load and unload aircraft on the ramp. We go through lots of training....computer, cargo, hazmat, security, and disability. Supervisors are good and easy to work with. the hardest part of the job is working in the extreme weather. The most enjoyable part of the job is flying for free."
good,"You get to work on the ramp and inside if your cross trained, marshaling in the airplanes is fun also"
good,"Load and unload planes, check in customers, rebook customers, learn safety procedures, clean RON aircraft and some other stuff. I learned to work individually, and worked hard at what I did. Management was unorganized, sometimes missed your hours, some watched as you struggled and there was some favoritism. Co-workers, very very very few, actually cared about one another, very nice and worked hard. Hardest part of the job was getting people to work for you even though you worked for them many times also getting planes out on time when people would just sit around, talk about life, and walk away when the hard work needed to be done. The most enjoyable part was when you got to fly for free around there world and of course you had to find someone to work for you."
good,"Parking planes and loading and unloading of passengers and their luggage. Learned los how the weight of fuel passengers and their luggage can affect planes takeoff. Management and co workers were the same all arround , everyone had the same responsibility. Hardest part of he job since its outdoors would be the rain and hott weather."
good,it's a good company to work for good travel benefits. I just don't understand why they have to stick to the minumum wage. we deal with dangerous things every day.
good,"It takes years to build up enough seniority to have a decent schedule, but if you can stick it out its great.  Great travel benefits.  Pay could be better, but if you wanted better pay you should go with a Main-line Carrier.  Traveling for work was fun for the first few years, but it gets exhausting going to the same places and living out of a suit case."
good,Job was ever changing on a daily basis. It was fun not getting stuck in the routine. Hours kind of sucked and your schedule was based on seniority. Pay could have been a lot better but the benefits were awesome!
good,"Fast paced environment with a variety of things to do"
good,Overall nice place to work. Can be fast paced. Our can have extra brake time between flights. Getting planes ready for departure. And bringing in planes. loading and off loading baggage. Supervisors some do not have a lot of experience working on the ramp. Weather plays a part on the days out come. Loading luggage can get difficult some times. Meeting a lot of people traveling.
good,I loved the flight benefits. it was worth the long hours and made up for the pay. I loved my family could fly free as well
good,"Excellent field including aircraft, secure area and customer interaction. No room for advancement or career, highly competitive field, high training high responsibilities low compensation."
good,"SkyWest is an excellent place to work. Living in St. George, Utah is a bit challenging with the current pay. However, I would still recommend SkyWest Airlines to family and friends as an employer."
good,"The fleet service team is great to work with incredible teamwork. Supervisor turnover rate was terrible.mechanics turnover was also not so great, but I guess it good they were talking about turning into a training facility."
good,It was great to be able to fly anywhere I wanted to and flexible schedule while I was attending school.
good,Working for them is great. You get to travel to different places everyday for work and when you are not working you get to travel the world for free. Great
good,"no flight contact no union. Very predatory. with your schedule. getting time off is very difficult. For a six figure education the pay and quality of life are sub standard. Not a place to park your career, more of a stepping stone, and they know so they try to fly you to more than is good for your health."
good,Typical day would be to come in at 400am get together with my crew go out together and get the job done
good,"Made it through INDOC and the other FAA test, failed just prior to the simulator training.  Had no idea what a ""flow"" was, and company seemingly unable to teach me, so bam, see ya."
good,"Great people, works not too hard, but definitely not easy. Flight benefits dont really work unless you're part time or have alternate income via a spouse or VA, and your flight is free, but discounts on hotels and such dont really make travel any cheaper, and your flight is never guaranteed."
good,"Overall, an amazing place to work if you're trying to get your foot in the door in the airline industry. They provide some of the best flight benefits I've seen in the industry. However, if you work at a smaller station, the pay does not really match the benefits. This would make a great part-time job for anybody who loves to travel."
good,"Great Flight benefits, flexibility with schedules by trading shifts (no paid time off as part time), and get to be around airplanes all day."
good,training is hard to get from supervisor. low hours and pay. love the actual work though want to stay in the industry. 
good,If you want to fly and don't care about making money Skywest is where you want to be.  You don't have to  be on reserve for years unless you want to work out of a very senior base.  Flight crews are professional and mostly nice. Trips are decent and the hotels are nice.  I left because I couldn't survive on the wages.
good,I love working for Skywest. My role is stimulating and I am continually learning new skills and meeting new people. I work with a great team of people and feel supported and appreciated.  Sadly the pay is not enough per hour to make a living.
good,"A typical day at work involves having meetings with the crew leaders to go over the work flow.  Many of the projects are moderate to experienced as far as range of difficulty.  They include but are not limited to gear changes, engine changes, troubleshooting wiring issues and other problems on the aircraft. I have learned many things about aircraft maintenance including all of the systems on-board the aircraft and their functions.  I have also learned how to provide quality as well as productive work.  I have learned how to manage my time and use it wisely to accomplish the job tasks in a timely manner.  There are many skilled technicians and co-workers where I work.  They are usually willing to answer any questions and help out as a team.  The hardest part of the job can be making sure to remember everything.  Sometimes we might work on a project once and a few months or more goes by without performing that same job again.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with friends and the flight benefits.  "
good,A typical day at work consist of working in a timely matter and prioritizing each task to meet specific timelines. Working in the great Colorado weather.
good,"If you plan on working this job, you should know that you will be working in a fast-paced environment which requires a high level of patience and composure. The airlines have not only gotten more negative, but passengers themselves are less civil and reasonable these days as well. It is, nonetheless, a good job for someone who is a ""people-person."" You do meet people from every walk and cross-section of life."
good,"typical day you are assigned either outside on the ramp or to the ticket counter or gate."
good,"Well respected and and top regional airline.  Provide great training.  Should start flight attendant salary out more, but pays at the top of the regional airlines pay."
good,"It’s a repetitive job but once you learn what is needed for the job,it becomes easy and routinen. Just be ready ti weather the elements both hot and cold."
good,"We all come to work and get what we need done. Once we are done, we are able to sit around and I use the time to do homework for school. Sometimes I get a nap in before school, but the down time we get is definitely beneficial."
good,"Becoming a flight attendant with any company is a major adjustment financially and mentally. The fewer ties you have to family, friends, and home the better and easier it is. the first two years can be tough financially depending on where you are based. But overall it does give you experience with working with the four major airlines Delta, United, American, and Alaska, which may increase your chances of being hired by one of the mainline carriers."
good,"busy place to work, lots of lifting, Be safe always. meet lots of people, travel for half price. All season weather, If you have full flt. it's hard work."
good,"great company to work for and they have educational classes to help "
good,"Left when my husband and I were unable to juggle schedules with kids any longer. Enjoyed the work, both inside and outside. (Customer service and ramp). Enjoyed the people I worked with and benefits of reduced cost flying."
good,As an instructor to new hire pilots the days could be long with many hours of classroom instruction. When classes were not being held reviewing training material would become monotonous.
good,"A typical day starts with a call for Maintenance Control with information about a plane that needs a repair. We proceed to the place to troubleshoot and repair the aircraft in a timely and safe manor. Perform operational checks of the system repaired, complete all required paper work and off to the next plane in need."
good,Great company to get started in the airline industry. Unfortunately there is not much room for growth as the company continues to downsize.
good,"passengers and baggage on plane "
good,A family company that is fun and challenging to work for. Learn interesting things about the airline business.
good,"Great opportunity to meet people and travel. Co-workers were respectable. I learned the importance of time management, communication and self reliability. The most difficult part of the job was not having a consistent schedule or lifestyle. The most enjoyable part was the opportunity to see some rare finds on layovers in other cities."
good,"A good company to work for, lots of experience gained."
good,Great travel benefits. Must be flexible with schedule. Strict company policies.
good,"My every day, every month is different! The most enjoyable part of this position is meeting new people every day, seeing new places, and having new experiences constantly. Unfortunately the hardest part of this position is having a life outside of work. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with Contract Stations
good,A typical day at work was usually fun. You could really tell that some of the supervisors stood up for all the other employees in order for us to be treated as we deserved. It was a pleasant environment with very little conflict.
good,"+ Your coworkers got your back! Our flight crews are definitely some of the best! Not to mention the absolute best perk of all, our flight benefits! Got to visit Japan multiple times and took my mom on multiple vacations which made it so worth it. Of course finding the right timing (off season traveling mostly) to ease the stress of non-rev travelling is always a challenge. I was also able to go to school part time online while flying so that is definitely a bonus. "
good,"I'm a former employee of the Fort Wayne parts department.  My time in the department was miserable do to the two faced parts manager and her supervisor.  I highly suggest applying for any other department within the hangar.  The turnover rate is horrible for such a small department.  I believe they've gone through 8 people in 2018 alone.  Honestly, I'm not sure how she still has a management job.  I choose not to get into any more detail just trust me when I say. . . . RUN. . . . . WORST MANAGER I'VE EVER HAD.  It's inevitable that YOU WILL get multiple write ups and YOU WILL eventually either get fired or quit.  "
good,Best airline travel benefits around. Sacrifice benefits for very low pay. Hourly wage is good but will not work more than 100 hours per month. Flexible schedule and decent seniority after 1-2 years
good,I worked at the Colorado Springs Airport. They are always understaffed. The team does work well together. The smaller planes are always breaking down.
good,"When I first began working there we had excellent travel benefits but as time went it almost became impossible for family to fly."
good,"Skywest Airlines is a phenomenal company with a true team atmosphere.  Travel benefits are a big perk as well as working in a team atmosphere!  As a cross utilized agent, the work is all about working together whether at the counter, gate or ramp to offload and onload passengers, luggage and cargo into the aircraft with safety, security and service being the top priorities.  Very challenging and very rewarding at the same time.  The pay could be better, but the people and the company make it one of those jobs you just look forward to going to every day you work."
good,This was a good job to work. The co-workers were awesome to work with were all friendly and were willing to help out whenever asked.
good,"A typical day is to be on time for your assigned work schedule for the daily briefing regarding the loads, weather and delays (if there are any due to weather), and other pertinent information that affects the company or the overall flight schedule at the airport."
good,"Work in all weather conditions, operating all types of heavy equipment. Load and unload aircraft. Direct aircraft in movement area. Maintain effective communications with dispatch, operations and pilot in command. Meet all airline SOP's. Complete all testing, certifications and recurrent training. Certified to conduct aircraft FFOD 's (first flight of the day) security searches. Enjoy working with my co-workers and jet aircraft."
good,"Employees make the airline. SkyWest values their employees but there were some managers, who may no longer be employed with the airline, that played favorites and this affected moral. Overall, the employees and supervisors were great to work with and the top management of the airline is dedicated, professional, and very competent at operating the best regional carrier in the world."
good,Front end was great to work with. Answered your questions. Back end helped with lot of cross training. Answered any and all questions. Very courteous and polite and fun bunch of people to work with. Enjoyed my time there.
good,"Skywest Airlines offers you a great in to the airline industry. It is always a fast paced, and detail oriented job. The culture of travel and aviation is amazing."
good,"SkyWest has allowed me to be a successful flight attendant who is able to maintain a safe cabin environment and give excellent customer service as well as train new hire flight attendants."
good,Skywest is a great place to work.  The environment is fun and always different depending on crews.  You are also able to travel and see places all over the world!
good,Pay and low hours isn't conducive for anyone who is trying to support a family. Flight benefits are the main reason for working here. Only work 2 hours shifts. Good opportunities to work temporary duty in other stations within SkyWest's domain.
good,"Best airline to work for if you are solely looking for flight benefits. Pay is not sustainable for living, so a second job often accompanies this one. Great first job for new workers. Great first step into the aviation industry."
good,"SkyWest was an airline that served hundreds of smaller cities. Very fun to work with, travel benefits exceptional, hard work, but had periods of lulls between flights."
good,"As an aircraft mechanic i feel the company is ran pretty efficiently, although there is always room for improvement they have given me the training and experience to move up in the company."
good,"If you like to travel and make very little money, Skywest is the place for you.  I have worked there over 8 years and still can barely make a living.  changes occur quickly yet advancement occurs at a snail pace.  lots of secrets and drama."
good,You earn your pay. Hard work pays off. Great profit sharing. Good location and generally take care care good care of its employees. You work for your level upgrades in order for higher pay. Great company overall.
good,A typical day involves working closely with other crew members and ground personnel to have timely departures and arrivals as well as safe working conditions.  We have to be prepared for any emergency situation and be ready to assess the threat and act accordingly.
good,"Scheduled airline, and every airline has it's ups and downs. :D Rather hard to describe to non-airline folks, but good people and relatively good compensation. "
good,"I've worked part time at Skywest for nine years and though it always seems our station is on the edge of losing our contract with either Delta or United - it hasn't happened yet.  With a family of six, the free flights are irreplaceable; especially with kids in college and family across the US.  Schedule bidding is frustrating but after some seniority is gained (3+ years) it is much easier to bid for a schedule that will work.  Travel is awesome and well worth the work stress!"
good,Seeing different people everyday from different walks of life. Learned a lot about aviation and how a normal day to day operation works. Your coworkers becomes your family. really fun times everybody helps one another especially in busy days. the hardest part of the job is the weather since you are working outside with the elements but other than than the most enjoyable part is how much of a family you feel once get to know everyone
good,skyWest Airlines was an awesome company to work for and they cared about their employees and customers. Safety for them and for all.
good,Great and diverse group. I have enjoyed my time here and look forward to many more years. Variable schedule that is easy to work with
good,"Provided senior agent skills including, but not limited to information systems and security in support of providing the best experience to the user community and represent SkyWest professionally."
good,"Nice place to work.  The trainers were very nice and helpful, I felt ready to perform the job."
good,"Everyday is different from the last. You may fly the same routes all the time, but the people are always new and entertaining. You get to hear the best stories, from all different types of people. Some flights are good, some bad, but thats the fun in it, you never know what your day is going to consist of."
good,Consisted of hard labor at times on a daily basis.
good,"This is one of the better airlines, not just as a regional carrier but as a company altogether to fly for. No other carrier, that I'm aware of, has better travel benefits than SkyWest. Yes, you may be working on smaller, regional jets, but you're working for 4 major carriers! The income isn't great but that's standard in this industry - at least for the first several years. So be prepared to either work A LOT (after youve done your penance on researve) if you need to survive on 1 income, or have a flexible second job."
good,I didn't work for Skywest that long due to my other job.  But I cleaned planes for the majority of the time as they landed to get the next one loaded on time.  Skywest was enjoyable to work for and the benefits were great!
good,"Pay is super low, and they will place anywhere regardless where you live. There is room to move up in management and you can have a flexible schedule. But overall be willing to have low pay and live far from home while on the schedule."
good,At my location there is a lack of organization for training so the process is a bit frustrating while trying to learn. My team is helpful. The flight benefits are nice. Pay is minimum wage. I only work 8-10 hours per week at obscure times so it’s flexible for a second job. It’s not something I would do as a career but for now it’s worth being able to travel the world.
good,"Once you get to be full time, the travel opportunities are endless. You can transfer to a new domacile once youre off reserve. All hotels are paid for with added per diem"
good,Very professional place to work.  The training is excellent and they place a great interest in you and your development and do their best to help you succeed.
good,"•	Performed scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Troubleshoot and repair aircraft systems which include hydraulic, anti-ice/de-ice, pneumatic and flight control systems. Performed engine R&R, Landing gear R&R, Component R&R. All Maintenance performed on CRJ200’s, CRJ 700/900’s and EMB 175."
good,The career itself is very easy going. The probation is 12 months which is 6 months longer than the industry standard. It is also hard to be away from family for extended time...especially if you are a parent.
good,SkyWest is a good company to work for if you are interested in traveling.  They have the best travel benefits as a regional air carrier by far.  As a full-time employee you can enjoy very good medical and travel benefits.
good,"The first year was tough on reserve, but after that things smooth out. Equipment is kept well and all the folks are fun to work with. Upper management is sort of in tune, but not completely, as the norm with any airline.  Pay is okay for a regional but the region is North America, and otherwise, so?"
good,"SkyWest is a great place to start your flying career.  Awesome people to work with, great equipment and travel benefits for you and your family.  Apply  now."
good,"Serviced inbound and outbound aircraft, assisted travelers with flight schedules and ticketing.  Performed various job assignments typical of airfield industry.  Teamwork very necessary to keep aircraft and travelers on schedule.  Great team of people to work with, very helpful to each other, very supportive of customers."
good,learned a lot the hardest part of the job is dealing with delays and angry passengers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being aable to make a difference
good,SkyWest is a great company to work for. They care about their employees and their customers. Safety is of utmost importance to SkyWest and it shows. It was a great place to work.
good,Loved the company for the most part. Only left due to location closure and did not want to relocate at that time. Cross Utilized position was great. Every day seemed like a new day. You had an appreciation for every aspect of the job.
good,"SkyWest started out as a small idea with simple service to 3 or 4 cities and has grown to be the biggest and best managed commuter airline in the USj."
good,"Working for Skywest isn't the best career choice if you are looking for financial security. The ability to move up is definite and possible for anyone. But the real reason to work for them is their amazing travel benefits, and the genuine care the company has for its employees. They fully encourage employees to travel as much as they can, within reason of course, and are more than happy to help accommodate anyone's wanderlust."
good,Worth the experience. A typical day involves great team work to turn around aircrafts with occasional periods of high pressure at time constraints.
good,"Great place for training and/or building time."
good,"I commute from DFW to my job in DEN. I am usually gone for at least a week, sometimes more. I love the job. I am not a fan of the commute."
good,I work  for Skywest for along time and i miss working with the company i love the TDY and  volunteer  to help out other stations  hours are awesome and  just love being challenge everyday  knowing being in charge of the flight are very awesome
good,"Long hours on and off the aircraft"
good,Amazing crews and opportunity to see domestic United States and Canada.
good,If you are looking for a very challenging job with great benefits this is the place.  Finding time for the personal life is a bit tough and makes using the benefits difficult.  If you want to see the world then this is a great place to do it.
good,"A highly engaging, mentally challanging position. A very stressfull, as well as rewarding job."
good,I enjoy working in the customer service field and assisting customers in anyway that I can. The atmosphere is fun and energetic.
good,"The training you will receive is exceptional, They support a good team environment, Decent benefit plan for employees, but a little expensive for family plan, Profit Sharing after one year, Fast paced."
good,Nothing really out of the ordinary. For Profit Company with decent employee programs and average industry pay. The travel benefits are what make it worth working for an airline and SkyWest probably has the best travel benefits.
good,The company culture is great! I'm honored to have worked with such a great & professional company. There is a reason the turn over is low. Great employee bonuses every few months. Yearly pay raises. & the opportunity to meet people from all over the world.
good,SkyWest was a dream come true. I enjoyed every minute of being a Flight Attendant. You work with amazing people and everybody has a story and are willing to share them. It is a great culture of people and a really wonderful experience.
good,Great introduction into the workforce. Awesome place get introduced to the airline industry. Plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion. Quality of life gets better the longer you are employed here.
good,I worked with some great people. The pay was very low for what you do. Hard to move up with the company. There were many perks with the job like flying for free.
good,On the job a lot in a very busy yet rewarding position dealing with people and traveling. Met hundreds of multi cultured travelers on flights. Seeing new places was very rewarding.
good,"Excellent place, planes were small and boarding process was different however that was the challenge that came the the job being able to board everyone without anyone trying to get out of line to touch the aircraft."
good,"the shift was from 9pm to 7am"
good,Great family oriented company that has excellent benefits and perks.  A company where a majority of the employees have 20+ years of seniority.
good,I liked working with a team who was always willing to help out when things were stressful. The company has great benefits that they offer to their employees.
good,"A day working at skywest airlines can be hard and easy. Loading planes, dealing with baggage, COMAT etc can be pretty heavy at times."
good,"1. The typical day at work here was to go and start working riight away with over 200 account a day. "
good,Good working environment. Enjoyed working with people. Cultivated many relationships
good,Being a Flight Attendant was wonderful!  I wouldn't take it back for anything!
good,Everyday i go to work im happy and wonder what job duty ill have for the day. My co workers are all fun to be around with and make the day go fast. Everyone is willing to help each other out so your never alone if you need help.
good,"Great overall company with fairly diverse staff as well as great company and department wide communication tools. It is both fun and rewarding to be a member of the In-Flight team, but equally challenging at times when you are at the mercy of weather and delays."
good,"SkyWest is a great company to work for. I enjoyed being able to work for the Chief Pilot and work with over 1,500 employees."
good,I absolutely love this job and will continue to do it at least part time as long as I can. Unfortunately the wages for regional flight attendants are not enough for cost of living in most major cities where we are based. I don't foresee financial security with this job alone.
good,"good stedy job full time ,plumbing putting cooper pipes together,a/c  fueling equipment, changing tires replacing swamp coolers with new parts. I feel I was not treated fair by management,i did like longevity of the job with SkyWest airlines for 13 years."
good,fleet service is for someone that likes to clean and enjoying detailing. the job is real relaxed as long as you get your work done. I worked overnight from 8pm-6am. that was hard getting used to but I made it happen
good,"4 hour shifts could work up to 3 shifts a day. I learned several things in this job mainly about airlines, airplanes and airports. Hardest part of the job moving heavy equipment by hand and heavy luggage into the cargo area. most enjoyable is working with great people and learning about airplanes. Traveling"
good,Fleet Service at SkyWest Airlines. 10 hour shifts. Clean on average 12 aircraft per shift up to 17 aircraft during the peak travel times. Fast paced labor intensive work. Good shift supervisors have made a big impact on morale  Staffing is a challenge. High turnover is an issue.
good,"Working for the airlines is a very exciting and fun job to have, however the supervisor that is currently stationed in rks is very hard to work with.."
good,"nothing special just a daily and normal airline operation. check flight get back out to gates for the customers in a timely fashion.  i enjoy working for skywest airlines, but not happy that they lost the contract in Denver Co"
good,"I enjoyed my time at SkyWest because of the exposure to different cultures and , balance and compensation and benefits. "
good,"If you like routine, this isn't the job for you. If you enjoy costumer service, flexibility and surprises then you should apply right away. The most consistent component of working in aviation is change. You will need to be adaptable and open to all sorts of work environments and schedules. "
good,"Cross-utilized agents do everything from greeting passengers at the door to loading the aircraft; a coworker describes it as doing everything except flying or fixing the planes."
good,"SkyWest was a good place to work. They are not protected by a union so if you run into any problems, you will not have representation. That is the only thing that I can say I disliked about the company."
good,"Best job I have ever had. Would have loved to stay but their pay is not competitive, and part time get almost no hours in a week. Awesome management and people."
good,tough and rewarding. Challenging with great benefits. Travel and experience transfer to other areas of life. This is the best job that I have ever had
good,I worked at Skywest when I first entered Aviation and it was a great experience. I worked a lot and my training was good. Everyone I met from corporate to trainers were professional and friendly. I recommend them to people telling me they want to start their aviation career.
good,SkyWest is a very good place to work if you are looking for a starter airline and then get yourself prepared to move to something bigger after a few years of getting the training and some knowledge
good,"very interesting workplace, at the airport, the planes and most of all you working in an airline and can fly free anywhere you go."
good,"got pick up quick "
good,"They try their best to do as much as they can with who they have. Very tight knit and down for one another until your tardy points rack up, then you're out the door like a stranger."
good,"One of the best jobs I had, It was constant work to do a exciting experience the only negative was the unpredictable weather conditions"
good,When your a people person this is the place to be. The challenges of every day are part of the job. Got to improvise every day is a new adventure.
good,"Fun place to work. The people where great the benefits were really good, and the aspect of working with planes every day was just awesome."
good,"A typical day at work is flying all around the United States with tons of passengers. The planes that SkyWest have are small aircrafts, either one or two flight attendant aircraft. Serving the Passengers and answering any questions they have is my everyday task. Being aware of my surrounding and ready for anything to happen is also part of my job. Talking to the passengers and giving them the best experience i could provide is probably the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is being away from home, family, and friends."
good,"Provides impeccable customer service, performed front line operations daily,"
good,SkyWest Airlines was an awesome company to work for and they cared about their employees and customers.  Safety for them and for all.
good,Sky West Is a great company but my job has changed. and I would like to get back in my field.
good,"As an commissary agent we stocked the planes with food, drinks and snack for passengers and flight crew. What i learned is safety is number one there. Management was good. Open door. Room for growth. Co workers were all supportive but all seasoned and been with the company for a while most even working two jobs. Hardest part was working in the rain and wind together also completing the turn around time that the plane needs when it comes in and taxis to when it must depart."
good,"It was diferent everyday it was nice to be outside, the people were fun to work with"
good,"While working for Skywest is nice, it is very faced paced with many rules and security checks. Working with airplanes is handled quickly and efficiently but can be stressful during weather situations."
good,If you like to work hard and play hard then this is a good job for you. I loved working there with a good group and being able to play hard and fly anywhere for my days off.
good,Not like any other job out there where you can fly to an amazing location for lunch and be back by dinner. Fast pace with an ever changing environment where safety and efficiency go hand in hand.
good,"I had a great time working at SkyWest, I left the company because I had problem with one coworker, otherwise I would be there until today ... this person was abusing his position as a supervisor, and taking others needs for his own benefit..."
good,It was a great career traveling in all destinations in the United States.  Flying benefits were awesome for vacationing when traveling on non-peak time.
good,"Had a great time, Hours were hard split days work but you and your family fly free... We went to Canada Panama and several cities in the U.S.A in a year. paid 30$ a round trip ticket to Toronto..."
good,I was a flight attendant for SkyWest Regional Airline. It's fun to fly but you will eventually start going to the same cities and hotels and you will miss your bed. I would go for a mainline airline before applying to a regional but SkyWest is definitely a great regional airline.
good,"Low pay, hours somewhat flexable, great Travel benefits.  This is a part-time job and a good 2nd job for those that like to travel!"
good,I'd say it's very stable and they don't work you too hard which is nice. Great benefits. Pay negotiations have been going on a long time and they really are pretty conservative when it comes to increasing your hourly bonus.
good,The job brought together folks of excellent character and combined them with good opportunities to learn the aircraft types in detail.
good,Good work load great co-workers. Great flexibility with work. Hardest part was being part of a small department it was very hard to move up.
good,"Great place to work.  I worked there from 2002-2007.  Your hours are flexible, as you can trade your swift away to coworkers.  You get to work with great people, all wile receiving free travel on multiple airlines."
good,"Skywest was my first job in aviation after earning my A&P certificate. In my first month I was allowed and encouraged to grow as a mechanic. Each night there are new and challenging jobs and duties on different systems and sections of aircraft. As I took different jobs I learned effective ways to use AMM and FIM to troubleshoot. While the work can be challenging I have always found it rewarding and exciting, there is no better feeling than watching an airplane, that I worked on the night before, taking off in the morning. "
good,I would still be working here if it wasnt for having to move out of state. Wonderful benefits and work to life balance. Plus you can't beat the flight benefits!
good,Loved my 7 years with the company. Would do it again in a heart beat! Great atmosphere and co workers. Fun trips all over US and Canada. Live the Dream!
good,"good company, management needs to improve, good benefits, you can work over times, they have bonus after 2 years, alot of responsibilities, team work."
good,"As an Airline customer Service Agent, I like what I do on the daily bases whether it be helping customers with their travel, assisting passengers with disability, multitasking and problem solving. I am happy to work in the industry that allow me to travel the world, meet different people and learned different things. I have the opportunity to work in diverse environment. management is great empowering their employees to make great choices."
good,"Although the pay and benefits are low compared to major airlines SkyWest does have an excellent employee culture for the most part. Also their Flight Operations training department is excellent with alot of good dedicated instructors and a well organized training department."
good,"The work environment can be nerve wracking, theres a lot of work to do constantly on early shift; if you can get past that, the people are great and it is a good place to learn and grow as a mechanic."
good,Typical over night maintenance in the Hanger. The best part of the job was being able to taxi aircraft from the hanger to the terminal on a daily basis. Learned a lot of basic skills to work on aircraft and fundamentals of basic sheet metal operations as well as non destructive testing of key equipment on the aircraft.
good,"One of the best jobs I've had the privilege of working for. Immediately acclimated to the people, and work to name a few. My work was acknowledged, and whenever I needed extra help with my duties, my fellow coworkers were there to back me up. Anyone can do this job."
good,"I enjoyed working for this airline, I had flight benefits as well the people I worked with were like family. I enjoyed helping people booking their flights and finding good deals. Management were train well."
good,"SkyWest was a great company to work for. They treated their employees very fairly. If considering becoming a Flight Attendant, please expect to work very irregular and long hours. If you are able to do so, then definitely consider SkyWest."
good,Met many different people in this industry.  The different cultures and world the people they would bring with them.  It was fun and challenging.  I did not want to leave.
good,"* Typical day didn't truly exist in the airline world, but could be anywhere from 1-6 flights a day. Needed excellent customer service skills to be able to assist the passengers on our planes. "
good,I enjoyed working for the company. Good work ethics and i enjoyed the family envirnment and team attitude
good,"The job there is great."
good,"This was my dream job, to be able to load and unload baggages and marhall in a plane. I love the adrenaline! i really enjoyed working with my colleagues outdoors."
good,"Marshall in aircrafts, wing walk, push back planes, offload planes."
good,"I learned a lot from a lot of great people, the training process is amazing and well worth every second being there. Would love to move closer to have less commute."
good,Skywest provides a great culture. Employees are recognized and encouraged to grow and develope. The hard work in all types of weather is balanced with flight benefits on some of the partner carriers.
good,"Good job and great people to work with, great supervisor and friendly people to work with. I enjoyed this job due to the fast pace of it.  Flight benefits was a plus."
good,I love being a flight attendant for SkyWest Airlines due to the fact that I am able to make my own schedule and work with new people each and every day.
good,it was an amazing job so many wonderful experience I'm glad I got a chance to be part of their team amazing work member very comfortable work place great energy so many good memories at this place defiantly a experience I wont forget   .
good,"I loved working here. The people, the fast pace, a different situation everyday. It was great. There can be a bit of pressure with this job, but if you do well under pressure, this is a great job to have."
good,"I loved working for this company hands down. I have nothing bad to say ever. I loved the atmosphere and how they show appreciation to its employees. This is a tough job, so its nice to get a pat on the back."
good,"it is a fine place to work,no complaints from me just wish they paid more,and it takes awhile to obtain the top out rate pay"
good,I worked outdoors directing the planes and handling baggage. My staff members were helpful and pleasant to work with. There were opportunities to grow within the company. Overall a satisfying work environment.
good,Skywest Airlines is an organization that is inspiring to individuals to seek out your passion. I encourage people to seek employment as a flight attendant once they have graduated from college.
good,"pull aircraft parts from mechanic request"
good,"I interned for them and had a blast. I wish I could get hired on with them permanently. You gain a lot of experience in marketing, promotions, and PR."
good,Taking care of passengers needs. Lots of travel and great benefits. Loved meeting new people and seeing new places. Wonderful job if you traveling.
good,"I've worked for Skywest for almost 10 years and love the flexibility, the travel benefits and the conservative way the business is run!  It's wonderful to work with just one other person, to serve people, to have a varied schedule."
good,"a typical day consisted of assisting passengers, loading and off loading aircrafts, and transferring luggage."
good,"Awesome place to work, very family oriented with great benefits to cover all the time our away from home."
good,I was a customer service agent for SkyWest Airlines and I would board the aircraft and de board the inbound planes as well. I would also provide Customer Service to the passengers that would have cancelled flights and assist with the boarding of wheelchair passengers when needed. Work multiply flights in a boarding area that would board 4 gates and sometimes we would be boarding all 4 gates at the same time.
good,"A typical day at work was to board flights, check passengers, have customer service, help others that need it help."
good,My time with Skywest was a great learning experience. It is an exciting job that has many benefits if you are willing to work hard. Your sacrifice will pay off.
good,"I show up for my 3 or 4 day trip prepared to ensure compliance with all aspects of the Airline industry. Prepare & serve drinks, snack & meals; greet passengers, and be prepared for any emergency or irregularity in the flight operation. I continually work with different crewmembers, which is a great part of the job as I get along with everyone and make life interesting. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry passengers, and have learned not to take anything personal and look past the exterior and consider each person has issues they may be dealing with in their own life. "
good,"This company is fare to work for and it is easy to balance work with pleasure.  Typical work day would be getting self together and firing up the computer system and greeting your first passenger.  Then time flies because from your first passenger to your last you are busy with all their arrangements and making sure you have an aircraft on time for your departures.  Co workers are great and friendly.  I enjoyed the bouncing ideas off one another and knowing someone had my back.  If you like to work outside the Ramp keeps you physically in shape and there is always something happening, but never worry there is down time to catch your breath before going onward."
good,"The job was a little stressful at times. Little pay but it was a fun and I got to meet a lot of people from many different places, it is always fun and exciting to meet new people from anywhere!"
good,"Its awesome... Loved it. It was great working there. I got to meet a lot of people. Its a diversity work area, co workers from all over the world. I also got to learn more about the operations and equipment. It was a awesome experience. Theres room to achieve in this company if you want to. Flight benefits area great but I seen better, sorry. But its a great place to work."
good,Loaded and unloaded bags. worked with awesome people and the job was always fun and something new always happened. Great enviorment.
good,Very good company to work for. Pay was good and work was interesting. Working at the Tucson Maintenance base was very bad. Extremely high turnover rate as a direct result of poor management.
good,"PRO...Best aviation entry level, no degree needed job. Once seniority/longevity has added up job can be very flexible with reasonable days off . Fess or nearly free flight benefits. Insurance, 401k match. No one micromanaged you. Working wit a diverse human population and peers. You will visit cool places you never thought to go."
good,Training was longer than expected but there is a lot to learn. Schedule was difficult to accommodate due to split shift. And low hours. Very rewarding to work with a team around aircraft
good,"Really enjoyed working as a flight attendant.  Enjoyed inflight crew.  Enjoyed traveling seeing new places."
good,"I love to travel as most coworkers do, its great for that but its a demanding job as there are alot of things to remember and learn and you are on your feet the whole time. There is lifting up to 50lbs regularly and you have to be able to manage time well as nothing should go out late. You are expected to juggle any irregular thing thrown at you. Accepting that people naturally go crazy and get stressed out during travel... i probably have experienced and seen it all, well you would think. I personally love a fast pace environment that's unpredictable. The madness does payoff!"
good,"Skywest was a great company to work for, any difficulties in the job were due more to the industry rather than the company.  It is not a job, it is a lifestyle.  The pay and training was excellent but it is not a job for everyone.  Long, exhausting hours and overwhelming customer service duties on top of FFA requirements, safety and emergency duties and constant travel.  Scheduling and placement is complicated and based on seniority and availability."
good,Great people in a great environment.  Too bad I live 120 miles from that airport and the schedule was impossible with 2 to 3 hours travel.
good,"I loved my time with SkyWest Airlines. The traveling was a blast, both for work and for fun. They really take good care of their employees. The only hard part about it was when our employment got restructured and I went from full time with benefits and hours and a semi-decent pay, to no hours, no benefits, reduced pay, all because of a bigger airline wanted to take advantage of us and reduce what we got, and still got to use us as a smaller contract airlines."
good,The workplace is very oriental and fun. A few challenges but nothing that I couldn't handle.
good,A good place to get started in the Aviation field. They have a culture of autonomy and accountability. I can honestly say that SkyWest made me a better person.
good,"If aviation is something you are passionate about, then this company will be perfect for you. The people are like family and they go out of their way to make you feel included."
good,"It's an awesome job, would recommend to anyone at the beginning of their career as an A&P and/or anyone looking to settle in the Boise area. The only real challenge is going from nights where there is nothing going on to all of a sudden, everything happening at once. Outside that, I found it a great place to work at."
good,SkyWest is a nice company to work for. The pay is very low but the flight benefits are a great perk. This is the perfect part-time job for a college student or someone who has flexibility in their existing schedule.
good,"report to airport 45 minutes before flight. 30 minutes prior to flight, board passengers.  do safety/security announcements.  provide snacks and beverages to passengers.  take care of passenger questions and concerns.  deplaned passengers at destination city.  if overnighting there, we travel by van to hotel.  "
good,"I really enjoy my co-workers at Skywest. It often feels like family.  You got the weird Uncle, eccentric Aunt, rambunctious cousins and your black sheep.  We do work together and get flights out with a smile. ;)"
good,"Fast paste "
good,"From booking reservations and flights and ticketing to checking bags and checking passengers in, marshaling aircraft in, unloading and loading luggage into the cargo bin of an aircraft, checking passengers through security and onto the aircraft, closing all doors to the aircraft and sending it off.  And, doing it all within a 20 minute turn time, or less. High pressure job, all down to the last 20 minutes. Loved it!"
good,"Great experience but not for me, would recommend to those that are young and ready to go explore the places beyond their living room"
good,I love this job because we have great flight benefits and a once in a life time experience where you get to know what happens below the aircraft that typical passengers don't understand.
good,I really love the company. I myself am looking for something long term . I really worry about my company pulling out of the Nashville airport . Would I recommend someone to SkyWest yes I would.
good,"Not one single day was like another. I learned how to interact with many different types of people, how the airline industry actually operates, and how to maneuver a multi-million dollar aircraft like a master! My coworkers came from all walks of life and each had something unique to offer to my life experience by far the best group of people you'll meet! The hardest part of the job was the long hours, not knowing when you would have lunch, and the constant physical demand. This job is not for the week but if you think you've got what it take this company will take you around the world!"
good,"SkyWest is a non union airline with an excellent open door policy for all employees,. We are a very community geared company - always ready to lend a hand"
good,Love the job good company easy job life balance very flexible part time position flight benefit great supportive managers great team work good company morale
good,"A company on the rise, meaning that you will have great flight benefits and an expanding network of travel options. The pay, like all airlines, is low."
good,Everyday was different. You get to meet people from all over the world and even famous people. The beginning of every shift started with a team meeting to discuss any changes or issues for operations.
good,"The flight attendant position requires a person that can be free at the drop of a hat, doesn't mind not having a consistent social life and isn't afraid to live out of a suitcase.  Best suited for those that are free of children and/or spouses however, it can work with both.....its just tricky.  Skywest is a great place for a young person looking for a starter career and willing to live with many others to make ends meet because the pay is pretty lame at first..."
good,"This position gave me a great chance for advancement.  I will always appreciate my time with SkyWest Airlines, this got me big promotion to Delta before they spilt."
good,"The people at SkyWest Airlines are great, we were a family. The work was also stressful, due to the nature of the industry. The pay was low, but the benefits of working are tremendous."
good,Skywest is a blast to work for you are constantly learning something new. It can be challenging somedays but it is rewarding as well. I absolutely love being able to meet new people all the time!
good,Loved the flexibility.  I appreciated the ability to work without direct supervision.  I had control over how much I wanted to fly or not fly in a months period.  Seniority was so fair.
good,"I learned many different things working here for 13 years, I was ticketing, Ops , and customer service.  It was a fun place to work most of the time."
good,"great place excellent enviroment, great people, they care for you great benefits."
good,"SkyWest Airlines is a great place, it is a smaller airline and very family oriented. I enjoyed my time with them, if it were not for my fathers illness and relocation I would still be there. "
good,"Skywest was a amazing company to work for. "
good,"SkyWest Airlines is better than most other jobs I’ve had. Very friendly and respectful environment to work. Like most airline job though, the work is fast paced and must be done Expeditiously. The end product is rewarding personally."
good,"As a scheduler you are working in a fast paced, high stress environment but the over all feeling is laid back.  You are part of a great team that goes out of the way to help each individual.  Even though my background differed from most of the other employees working at SkyWest HQ in St. George, UT, I was never made to feel out of place."
good,Great travel benefits with opportunity to switch shifts to be able to travel. The pay could be better but I was there for the benefits which were amazing.
good,This is a great job! You get to travel and meet alot of new people. Everyday at work is a different and enjoyable day. Traveling all around the country and the world is an amazing experience.
good,"I had an amazing time flying for SkyWest Airlines. The job was tough at times because of the crazy schedule, but the benefits are incredible and the freedom to fly anywhere at any time is fantastic."
good,"The job was changeling, fast past, lots of pressure,  but we had a great group of employee. "
good,SkyWest was a great and fun place to work. The schedule was bad as planes are only down at night so not SkyWests fault. The people and management are great and work with you. Great place to work.
good,"Unfortunately due to unforeseen relocating back to Arizona with my wife I was unable to make a career with SkyWest. However, my experience at my station in Durango, Co was amazing. I truly enjoyed my job and even more so the people I worked with. "
good,"typical day at work is preparing flight that i am assign to work on.what i have learned working in this industry is how to be patience. My co workers, very friendly, we worked with one another, family oriented people. There is nothing hard about my job, i enjoy working with one another, i am a team player,"
good,Being a flight attendant is a very exciting job! Working in the aviation industry is one of the best experiences ever. Making sure that my passengers were safe and happy was my number 1 priority.
good,Enjoy the work enviornment and the people are friendly. Would highly recommend this company
good,"If you enjoy working with people and traveling the world,this is the career for you"
good,"I'm quitting my full time OR job to go back to flying full time (currently part time). Great people, better medical benfits than my hospital's benefits and decent pay if you manage your money well. You can't beat the schedule and quality of life whether your down time is spent with family or travelling the globe."
good,"Great company to work for; nothing bad to report.  Great people that they hire.  The camaraderie between the pilots, flight attendants, and management is very impressive."
good,The company has a wonderful culture of making sure their employees are taken care of for the long term. Many advance within the company and attain more from the company as well as personally. The additive of flight benefits to travel around the world is a wonderful bonus. SkyWest is more like a family business than a conventional business. Co-workers become family members and the job itself is very rewarding.
good,"Handling passengers, their luggage, Checking passengers into their flight, solving issues with booking travel, payment "
good,Great company to work for. Never felt like I was at work because I loved what I did. There were co-workers of mine who didn't cover the tattoos and it wasn't a big deal. Once in a while management would walk around and point out things that weren't considered policy apparel. Nobody got fired for it.
good,"A typical day in this position is be prepared for anything. This means your life should be very flexible to fit around your career here.  It is a great company to work for and the culture is wonderful. Mostly positive companions to work with and with the love for traveling. This a fast paced job with a good amount of planning necessary."
good,"Aviation maintenance can only be done when planes are on the ground, so working nights is a given. Working a 4 day on, 3 day off schedule was great, plenty of time to do stuff on your weekends. Overtime was offered on a seniority, as needed, volunteer basis, but always seemed to be available when I wanted to work for some extra money. Flight benefits on almost any airline, due to the nature of being a regional airline, were easy to use. Benefits were as good as anything I have gotten anywhere else."
good,"I was hired as a temporary, but event then was a good place to work. Liked my coworkers, and my managers were fun. My only complaint was that I was only temporary."
good,great place to work hard work but fun. You have t be willing to be a team player if you are not then more than likely you will not make it. Suervisors are fun and thy do have high ecpectations this station BOI is usually one of the better performing stations in the company so expect to be held accountable
good,"If you enjoy to travel this is your place to start!!  Great airline, Great employees!!  17 domiciles throughout the country.  Fly for multiple carriers!!"
good,You work 2 hours at a time. We get done what needs to be done but have a great time doing so. The management is great our manager is awesome. The hardest part of the job is moving the equipment to the plane but its like doing a work out for 1 hour every shift. I've learned so much about airplanes and what it takes to keep them going on a timely basis. Going to work is the most enjoyable part of my job I look forward to going. The hardest part I would say is not being able to work full time here.
good,"Amazing job that afforded me travel through the U.S. And opportunity to work with and learn about both fellow crew members and passengers from all over the world.  The job kept me on my toes with many emergencies, both with plane and illness of passengers."
good,"SkyWest Airlines is a very well ran airline in which I take pride in working for. A typical day at work isn't like any other job I've had. Flying days are long and tiring but fun because of the people you work with and the people you meet. We are to ensure everyone is safe and satisfied while flying from one destination to the next. The only downfall is that there isn't much room for growth. Once you're a flight attendant, the only way you move up in the company is through seniority, which you acquire after years of employment. That would be the hardest part for me, not much room to advance. Other than that, the traveling is fun but exhausting if this is the only source of income. The benefits to the job are the best part."
good,its been an amazing experience for me to work for an airline such as skywest and im hoping to becoming more involved in the aviation industy hoping one day I can reach my long term job to become a pilot.
good,"The experience as a flight attendant was unlike any other job. It is a very time sensitive industry that enhances one's punctuality and thoroughness. A regular day consists of checking in with airport security, performing a preflight inspection of the aircraft's cabin, welcoming passengers aboard, ensuring that the aircraft departs on time, and welcoming passengers to their destination. Most importantly, the duty of a flight attendant is to ensure passenger safety and consistently be prepared for any unexpected situation - whether that be turbulence or a disgruntled passenger. "
good,"Really good place to work at. People are friendly."
good,"The flight benefits are INCREDIBLE!!!!! I loved my time working for Skywest! You had the benefits of a large company, yet the feel of a small, homegrown place."
good,"By far, some of the best people I've worked with! A fun, fun group that made the work day fly by. Yes, leadership has it's issues but what company doesn't have management/leadership issues. Very modern software, and I know because I've work for half a dozen airlines! Best training in the industry."
good,Great company to work for. Pay is fair. Benefits are better. If you are looking for a company that appreciate their employees and strive to become employer of choice. This company is for you .
good,"I have loved working for SkyWest. This position presented so many different opportunities to me. Met some amazing people, learned great emergency response skills as well as communication skills, and had to chance to travel a lot."
good,SkyWest is a great company to work for and I’d still be there if I hadn’t been medically retired. They have an excellent work environment and highly motivated training team. Pay is good and benefits good as well.
good,"It is a fast pace environment you have to think fast on your feet and like people. The pay was low 17,000.00 the 1st year so it makes it hard to survive. The benefits were the best! I had the opportunity to travel and see lots of places. It is hard on the family life as you are gone from home 2 to 3 weeks out of the month, unless you live close to the airport and take day assignments.   I loved the job and working with the public. but I missed all the holidays with my family."
good,I loved working for skywest i wish they wouldn't have lost there contract to DGS. they had great benefits and great people if they come to a place close to me i would gladly go back to work for them
good,"Loved working for the airline industry I could have still been working there if the station would have still ben operating for United Airlines. Skywest ground handled for UNited and lost the contract bid to Delta Airlines. Best environment ever and you get a great satisfaction of what you do and how you help people with the travels. Good stress, fast-paced at moments and then relaxed at others. Benefits are great and paid time off is based on the amount of hours you work per week (PTO) rated at a percentage of time work and sick time as well. Some people accumuulate so much time off that they can take up-to 30 days or longer. WOrk culture is awsome!! lots of things to encourage a positive environment and potential for career advancement."
good,Management is amazing and the benefits are spectacular! The hours do seem to be difficult during the morning and late night flights but everything else is fantastic I can't say enough good things about this job!
good,Awesome company to work for.  It is like a family environment.  Team players. Aviation is extremely interesting and faced paced.
good,"A great group of people that all get along well and are easy to work with.  Highest paying regional airline, at lest for mechanics."
good,Skywest Airlines was a nice place to work.  I grew as a person and became an important part of daily success of the group.  I moved up in the company and became a leader.  I enjoyed the willingness of management group to help you grow and become more than you thought I was capable of.  Skywest taught me to believe in myself and to be secure in my abilities to do anything I ever imagined.
good,Movement of bags from one plane to another. I learned how to work planes. Management was very helpful in teaching all the aspects of the airline business.My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. The hardest of the job was pushing the out. Learning all aspects of the airline business.
good,"Fast pace working environment. Pleasant coworkers. Meeting customers from every part of the world on a hourly basis."
good,Great entry level position if you have aspirations in working for airlines.
good,SkyWest was good to me I have nothing to complain about. They took care of me.
good,Fun place to work with and they more flexiable schedules..management was alright...co-workers becomes friends ..hardest part of the job is winter..working in the snow...fun part about the job is ..you get to meet new people everyday..you get to see different peoples everyday..
good,"Arrive 45 minutes prior to departure and get pertinent information from flight crew and perform safety checks on aircraft.  I learned I had the ability to set the mood in the aircraft cabin by being polite, positive, and helpful.  My crew was extremely helpful, supportive, and responsive to my needs.  The hardest part of my job was being away from home base for continuous days at a time. The most rewarding part of my job was being able to make my customers feel comfortable and secure.  "
good,"SkyWest is a fun company to work for, they appreciate their employees, they offer incentive plans. "
good,"Love working there , they are my family . I have worked at Boise , Jackson hole ,  sun valley . you can transfer and grow within the company. Safety is a priority along with customer happiness . I appreciate being able to be around free spirited individuals who all share common goals"
good,I enjoyed working for SkyWest. The  company is a great place to work for. Enjoyed every moment. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a start in the airline industry.
good,"Learn a lot about the airlines business and culture, room for growth, good team work fun place to work if you love traveling and visiting  other countries, the hardest part is weather snow, rain hail, ice, Learn to respect and work with all types of culture"
good,"This job requires patience and excellent customer service skills.  As a cross utilized agent I am responsible for duties starting at the ticket counter and then proceeding to the ramp to help load the plane.  My position then takes me to the Baggage Service Office to help a customer process a claim for a delayed bag and then setting that bag up for delivery.  "
good,"I love working for SkyWest Airlines. The people here are amazing and ""SkyWesters"" seem to treat one another as family, no matter where their base location, if you stumble across a fellow ""SkyWester"" you are always treated with kindness and respect no matter their job position within the company. "
good,"With SkyWest Airlines, there is a lot of independent work and each day is different.  There is also group coordination and team work involved at times, especially when working with other flight attendants."
good,"Treated fairly by management, great benefits and great crews.  Always had trips and extra to pick up.  Loved being able to go different places. I would recommend SkyWest Airlines as an employer."
good,I worked for the airline fresh out of college and had a wonderful experience. The travel benefits are amazing and the opportunity to travel anywhere in the world.
good,"If you aren't able to adapt to an ever changing industry, then this isn't for you. SkyWest is an amazing company that's afforded me the opportunity to see the world. I have travel benefits on the big three (United, American, and Delta). I have better seniority in just 11 years than I would in 25 at any of the majors. Though the pay does take some time to get used to, my quality of life is like no other. I love my company and I have amazing co-workers."
good,Most of my work days consisted of lifting and operating equipment required for the job. I learned a lot about the Airline industry and how well an effective team is safe and productive. I had amazing management and great co-workers who later became friends. The hardest part about this job was the split shifts throughout the day and the most enjoyable part about the job was the environment and the excitement of the business.
good,"meet with crew, brief, do security check of airplane, greet and service passengers, check in at hotel and do it all over again the next day."
good,"SkyWest was a great company to work for.  Aside from flight benefits, I had the opportunity to do a lot of business travel.  I can easily say that this was the best job I ever had.  The work was challenging and rewarding."
good,"We did maintenance of the jets used by skywest airline. As most flights are during the day time, we did most of our work at night. Once you get past the fact that you will probably be a night owl, it is a wonderful place to work. The environment is inside a hangar, which is not wonderful in the winter, but otherwise is ok. The mechanics are some of the most over the top, crazy funny people you will ever have the pleasure of working with. The management there is suppportive, but allows for you to get the job done in your own way, allowing for a lot of profesional freedom (which I loved). Honestly, if I hadn't moved I would still be with the company and loving every minute of it."
good,Best airline I’ve ever been apart of this is an amazing place to start your careeer. The company truly values you and makes sure you know it. I worked here for 3 years and loved every minute
good,What i did was a little bit of everything. I loaded and unloaded luggage from tha aircraft. I also parked and sent out aircrafts. I also did ticketing and boarded customers. I also did security screening whule passengers boarded aircraft.
good,Working flight operations is fast paced and hard work. I learned about managing weight and balance of an airplane in order to operate safely. The station I work at is wonderful and the flight benefits have allowed me to travel many places!
good,This company offers plenty of opportunities and growth within the company. They treat the employees well and is an amazing place to work. I recommend this company to anyone in aviation

good,Good place to work.  Easy to trade shifts with others if they are available.   Manager cares about employees.  Pay is ok. But benefits are very good. Insurance good and reasonably priced. Flight benefits are great. Able to fly yourself and family for free on United flights anywhere.
good,"SW is a great place to work, high level of technology and organization. The maintenance is highly professional. The crew team work is outstanding"
good,"Working with skywest has been amazing. The benefits are great, paid time off, the always busy having something  to do is awesome. Sometimes it gets stressful, but that's only when we are short staffed. When we have a full staff it's awesome."

good,I love customer service I love providing a great service and getting to know my passengers I have received alot of raves and personal letters sent to company on what a excellent flight attendant I was I was never late I was always on time for departures I really enjoy being a flight attendant
good,Would still be working for SkyWest were it not for corporate closing the PDX maintenance base.  It was a positive experience.  Some stress finding the part and delivering it to the mechanic on time but manageable.
good,"I loved working in fast paced environment , the flight benefits were great ,  Management staff, supervisors were great people,  meeting new customers on daily basis,  meeting new  flight crew , pilots, captains were great to know , The training skills were excellent and I wished l could had done more in training. I am waiting on new airport location to open up in nearby city  then l would re-apply for position"
good,"I was a Flight Attendant at Skywest, so my typical day was on the airplane doing all the necessary pre-flight emergency equipment and prep checks, briefings with the other crew members, greeting passengers as they board, and working the flight.  The management at Skywest had an open door policy, they were promoted from within the company, with a great bonding workplace culture because everyone had a common goal to get the flight out on time with safety first in mind."
good,I always had a goal that when my customers walked away they felt I took care of them. My manager was positive and uplifting. The job was rewarding and I enjoyed working with my fellow employees.
good,"This is a great company, they care about their employees. The flight benefits are amazing! They make all the days that are hard worth it! I love working here and I plan to stay for a long time."
good,Great place to work and enjoy the outdoors. Friendly atmosphere. Great benefits and opportunity for growth. Healthy workplace and great flight benefits.
good,Skywest Airlines is a good employer.  They provide a safe work environment.  Opportunities for advancement.  Provided continuing education.  Offered flexible hours
good,I was a flight attendant for almost 25 years at SkyWest Airlines. They treat everybody like people rather than numbers. I loved my career. One or two flight attendants per aircraft. One flight attendant every 50 passengers. Yearly recurrent training. 3 to 4 weeks initial training.
good,I would highly recommend this company to anyone who aspire to work in the airline industry.  I was able to let my light shine!  I really enjoyed working with the public and my co-workers were great to work with as well.
good,"i would recommend SkyWest to anyone who enjoys the aviation industry. By far, the best job i have ever had. The people are nice, professional, fun, and value their employees."
good,"Check safety equipment, make sure its properly working and not expired. "
good,"For an Airline Pilot, the job will be stressful in the area of training, and keeping current.  Checkrides are very stressful events, but the training department at SkyWest is second to none.  That is very important, as it takes everything a pilot has to learn and an experience training department is critical."
good,"This job challenged me and taught me so much. After a few years working at SkyWest, I learned invaluable lessons and skills. I will carry my SkyWest experience with me forever."
good,Working for an airline has its perks and the benefits of flying were great meeting people from all over the world was great sometimes it got stressful when flights were delayed or canceled however the people that you are working with outweighed anything that would have been negative
good,I would highly recommend the airlines industry. It is an amazing place to be and you can learn a lot. The benefits are extremely hard to beat as well.
good,"I always enjoy working in this company, management, co-workers and the teamwork was great. I oved working with skywest everyhting was great in this company is just taht I reach the time to retire"
good,"My first real Job!  This taught me how to work hard as well as grow myself effectively with the workforce.  I learned excellent customer service skills including phone etiquette, conflict resolution, and sales."
good,"I love my job at SkyWest! Each day is different which I love because it's not the same repetitive work. Each day you have new scenarios that you have to deal with each day. You never know what to expect at work honestly. I learned a lot about the aviation industry just in the last year and how things work from the ticket counter to bags being lost etc... I have learned new systems for different airlines and really enjoy being able to understand the terminology and codes for airlines now. The hardest part of the job is probably those early morning shifts at 4:30am or sometimes earlier depending on the flights schedule for the month and sometimes it's hard working outside because the weather can get up to 110 degrees or in the winter it's pouring rain etc.. Also you never know if you'll leave work on time because if the plane is delayed 7 hours you're most likely going to be there a majority of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flying! Flying on standby is hard at times but it is definitely the best! You can fly anywhere in the world and all you have to do is show up and be smart about which flights you're booking. I went to Germany for a day because I was bored and a business seat only cost $100! It was about a $20,000 seat when I looked up how much it cost. So traveling is definitely made easier plus working for an airline gives you discounts not only in airports but for hotels, car rentals, theme parks, cruises, vacation packages, tours and more! It truly is the best industry to work in!"
good,"SkyWest was one of the best company to work with.  The travel benefits and health benefits were top of the line.  I also really appreciate the additional programs the company offered to all full-time employees,"
good,I loved the company and the people that I worked with leaned all aspect of working the ramp.  I traveled a lot using my flights benefits and been to places that I wouldn't have been to if I  didn't worked for the company
good,Greeting passengers and making sure they made it safely to their destination. What a great job.  I loved seeing the country and the crews I worked with were amazing. Great Comapny
good,"The pay, while lower than I would hope for, was fair for a smaller airline. The medical, dental and vision insurance were good. The flight benefits... they were OUTSTANDING! We were constantly being trained and we really felt like a team while working together. I always felt like management cared and was interested in employees being happy and succeeding. Despite having left the company 11 years ago (possibly the biggest mistake I have ever made), it doesn't appear that anything has changed. I recently called to get some information and told the person I spoke with that I was a former employee. Her attitude was very cheery and she sounded as if the genuinely wanted to help me. In conclusion, if SkyWest were to make Houston, TX a maintenance hub, I'd immediately quit any job I had and apply right away."
good,I worked as a Flight Attendant for Skywest Airlines and it was a joy and a pleasure to work there for the 9 years.  I truly enjoyed working with the crew members and the passengers.  It was truly a pleasure to assist.  I feel it is an honor and a pleasure to work as a Flight Attendant.
good,"Would wake up very early everyday to meet my crew. Prepared the plane for passengers to have a great flight. This job was so enjoyable being in a new city everyday, meeting new and interesting people."
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting your crew, greeting passengers and flying to new and fun places.  Management is exceptional and the culture is upbeat, kind and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is being away from home for long periods of time, and flight delays which make for a very long work day."
good,By far the best airline company that i have worked for.  Great management and great co workers.  Awesome benefits and i always look forward to coming to work.
good,"Incredible company with great family values and incredible benefits, gr at travel, good trips, good people, fun job, easy to learn, training is awesome"
good,I love skywest as a regional. It is the best out of all regionals.  They treat us well and I wouldn't leave if there was based in the east. The flight benefits by far are the best.
good,A fun and exciting work place if you're looking for adventure of your life!!! Scheduling can be a little unpredictable at first but that's the best part of the job and not knowing where you'll be traveling to but once you get a more stable schedule you're your own boss! I absolutely loved working for SkyWest!
good,Skywest Airlines was a terrific company to work for.  I learned a lot of terrific people skills and it made a terrific impact on my life.  I would recommend this job to anyone who is qualified.
good,I have been with Skywest for just shy of 17 years.  The people make this one of my favorite jobs.  Great benefits for front line employees.
good,"Working for Skywest was a pleasant, exciting, adventurous experience! I have acquired many skills from working for the airlines, and would highly reccomend skywest for employment."
good,"friendly environment, always on the move getting to see new places and faces. Customer service is a huge responsibility in this field of job. Feedback from others is what I work for."
good,"The Navy offers a diverse work environment with exposure to so many skills and trades. If college isn't an option, the Navy can be a great steeping stone."
good,"Really enjoyed working with these guys.  They were focused on their task at hand, and never complained about the weather, or workload.  The locations of work changed constantly, but the get to it attitude never did."
good,Flight Ops/Crew Support is a great area to work in.  It can be a very high stressful environment.  If you don't love what you do in our department you won't last very long.  Most people within our company do not want to work in Crew Support because they know how difficult it is.  There is a minimum of 6 weeks of training just to know the basics and then 40 more hours on the legality side.  I have loved training and working all aspects of our department.  You have to have a crazy fun intelligent personality to work in our department.  The hardest part of my job was some of the very difficult phone calls...dealing with it and then taking the next call without a breath.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers.  They are my work family.  Since I have worked there for over 16 yrs we have shared each others joys and sadness.
good,"Boarding the plane, making sure it was clean and tidy for the passengers, checking all emergency equipment to be sure it was functioning and readily available.  My co-workers were normally always very friendly.  The hardest part of the job was being away from home so much. While I was flying my children were small but now they are all grown.  The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to new places and meeting people."
good,Skywest Airlines is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. This airline focuses on it's customers and their needs. Customers are first with them.
good,"perform front line operations daily, comply with FAA regulations..Meet and greet hundreds of passengers on a daily basis, issue boarding passes, make announcements airport terminal and boarding area via intercom.also help disable passengers with their needs, such as wheelchair.. work closely with pilots, if flight is weight restricted, also team player with my co-workers."
good,Love to fly free. As a company great job. Like working outside. You need to have safety in mind every second of the day. Travel the world for your hard work.
good,"Fast paced working environment, emphasis on teamwork and job culture. I greeted passengers, monitored the boarding process, checked tickets, and most important was making sure the plane and everyone on it was safe and knew the procedures in case of emergencies. I was always working with different co-workers and it was a challenge to get used to a different flight schedule but overall a very enjoyable experience,."
good,Working in San Francisco was very challenging due to the weather that San Francisco has. Working as an express carrier due to weather was a great experience. Management group was always helpful and made sure we had the tools to do our jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and interacting with the passengers not to mention the flight benefits. In a day we would average 140 flights or more made the day very busy but loved it.
good,"Best job in aviation i have had so far. The facility was amazing, had every tool you could want. the people and staff are also friendly and great to work with."
good,"I retired to move to Phoenix, AZ.  I only wish I could have transferred my employment with this company to Phoenix, AZ but there were no jobs with them in my specialty as an Avionics Technician."
good,Was awesome to work for them as I enjoyed being around airplanes as much as possible. I would love to get back into the airline industry as traveling is a must.
good,"I learn so much about the operation of an airplane, loading bags, printing tickets,communicating to customers and becoming an all around customer service agent"
good,"Answered phones, prepared for customer service training classes, assigned log-in, and payroll, booked hotels for students, sent confirmation letters and wrote per-diem checks."
good,I loved my time at SkyWest I would love to go back again if I could stay in the Denver Airport
good,Great experiences and networking. Fun work environment. Everyday is different. and a new experience.
good,I really enjoyed my time as an employee for SkyWest. I learned a lot about the work done outside and in this case under the airport. Working outside on the ramp trained me to be physically fit as well. My management was always understanding and a lot of my co-workers were always eager to help us newbies to the job adapt to the airport environment. The hardest part of the job was probably the weather. The summer was always too hot and the winters ridiculously cold. Overall I loved working on the ramp for SkyWest in general because of the great staff and work environment!
good,I love working with Skywest because they have really great people. I love the benefits of travelling all over the place. I think it's less stressfull to work with great team players. The only thing I wish we could have more of is the salary. But in all I think it is a great place to work.
good,"great place to work. great place to work. I love working in a such a physically demanding environment and the the people are very team oriented.  I love the fact that my benefits include flying for free, friends and family.  the only drawback to the job is that it requires the we work outside in the elements."
good,"Skywest is by far the best place I have ever worked, although it was a night shift, the overall company definitely placed their employees first and took good care of us.  Benefits were great as well.  Management was constant and very workable."
good,"•	Prepared materials for pilot training required by the Federal Aviation Administration"
good,This is an excellent company to work  for.  They make sure all the employees are properly trained and they have continuing training. 
good,"A new day each work day. A very fast paced work enviroment, never the same co worker, so it teaches you to be flexable and get along with all types of people."
good,"Its an amazing journey to work as an employee for Skywest Airline. a typical day at work is expect the unexpected and that's the best part. You will have team work, communication, and commitment to get the job done. You want to always make sure the area is safe for the aircraft, passengers, co-workers, and yourself. I have learned that each day i work to ensure safety the job gets better. The most enjoyable part of the job is that, we are all working to be the Airline of choice, the Employer of choice, and the Investment of choice. As being apart of Skywest we really are committed to promoting dignity and trust in all we do."
good,I love everything about the training. The trainers are very informative. The people here are sincere and will help you with no hesitation. Ask and you shall recieve.
good,Great Company to work for. Flexible work schedules and decent pay . And you cant beat the flight benefits.
good,"This was my first flight attendant job. My number one concern was ensuring passenger safety at all times. I also excelled in providing superior customer service whenever working with passengers. You really must love to travel in order to perform the duties required of this job. There is very intensive training that includes very little regarding the service aspect. The majority of the training is safety related and lasts between 4-6 weeks, daily. If you are late for class, you are dropped from training. There is no place for those who cannot be reliable and punctual."
good,A typical day at work was loading and unloading planes with luggages. Maintained and stocked airplanes with necessary items needed for next flight. Learned to have everything ready on time for flight ready for next airline arrival.
good,SkyWest is one of the few companies that truly care about their employees. When other companies are asking how can we improve for the customer they ask the question what can we do for our employees to help them better assist the customer. The training there is superior to any other training I have received.
