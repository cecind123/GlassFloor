bad,"I spent 15 years here. In Fife,Was, the management was the most vicious, mean spirited, anti-worker group I have ever known. Every single day was a fight to keep your job. Vindictive people at best. No matter how hard you worked , they were never satisfied. Run screaming in the opposite direction. This place is TOXIC!"
bad,Don‚Äôt respect the drivers making it impossible to do our job they implement guidelines they couldn‚Äôt follow with there cars never mind tractor trailer
bad,unfair and power hunger staff that doesn't care about workers personal life and the union only backs class A workers even though there are class AC and B drivers at the company.
bad,It  is the worst place I have ever worked at.don't waste your time with this place. the trucks are junk.management is even worse.they have overtime over 40 but will not let you get it.your lucky if you get three days a week.you have to work all holidays.
bad,This job and this company will sit there and preach about ‚Äúget home safe‚Äù but they do not give a f*** about you or any lower level employees. I put in over four years here and can say that the amount of unsafe practices at this company is unbelievable. They will cut 15 routes daily and overload everyone else‚Äôs trailer to the point that you have no room to break anything down. Drivers are constantly getting injured dues to unsafe conditions and yet management does nothing about it
bad,"Horrible management. They lie to much. They make favours to the people they like. And they let them cheat the system. Descrimination, no respect. They push hard workers üí™."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this place to my Enemy. They will lie directly to your face. Working for this company you will feel like a slave! Constantly, running up and down stairs. Pushing and pulling a Dolly weighing upwards of 350+ pounds. Don't believe the 70k a year BS . You will average $800 a week here. Rain, Snow or shine. They will make you drive in dangerous weather in order to make deliveries. Be prepared to wait at stops because routing fails to make it more efficient for drivers. Which the delay pay is only $12 hr. So enjoy that. The VP is an arrogant piece of work, the safety manager is a snake in the grass, you'll receive 1st day insurance, but not holiday pay until after 90 days.  The other drivers will steal the stuff you need to work, the customers will curse at you. Etc....Just don't do it. Horrible  company.."
bad,the managers there had no ideal what they were doing.  they ran the company into a s*** show.  the employees saw what was going on but the manager were too busy stuck on bulls*** things that never saw the big photo of whats going on.  I highly advise find a different job than this place.  it is not worth the time or life spent here.
bad,Worst 8 years of my life. Horrible pay. Horrible environment. It doesn't matter if you can meet the production standards or not. If you can they'll find a way to slow you down so they don't have to pay you your full wage. No opportunity for advancement. Eventually they'll get tired of having you around they'll make up a reason to get rid of you. Can do attitudes and great work ethic won't get you anywhere with this company.
bad,I've worked at plenty jobs. This is one that I surely regretted. the cold side is just as it states. You have to break down frozen foods and sort them by hand and place them on different pallets. Then place them in the freezer which is even colder. The work and pay is way off. Your killing yourself just to make a portion of what you should've made. The managers get paid alot more while you freeze
bad,"No family life, and worked like a slave. Early mornings, longer days. Overloaded trailers. Broken equipment. No respect for the employees. Managers want more but give less"
bad,"It‚Äôs being run by shady people, the don‚Äôt care about the worker anymore, all they care is about themselves. It didn‚Äôt use to be like this before, new people have come to run the place and they run it by putting fear in the workers, they treat the employees bad."
bad,Bad management. They hire people that don't want to work hard. And talk bad. About the people that work hard. Most of the workers are lazy. They want to go home as soon as they get to work. I waste the best years of my life working there. I would not recommend nobody to work there.
bad,Topeka is management are heartless if you get hurt the main guy that starts with a d will make it a living he!! for you doing things that will go against your doctors orders.then find a loophole to fire you stay as far away from there as possible.
bad,Management needs to be revamped. The people who are in place now talk to you like your trash and you should be grateful to them for allowing you to work for them
bad,Worse place I've ever worked! Management doesnt know how to manage a business. You dont know what you're doing from day to day. Can not keep employees there. Someone new every week
bad,exspects  you to break laws and pushes you to the limits in your mental stability  put you in dangerous situations   Reverts your energy and sends it to benefit them
bad,"When I got hired I was told Mon-fri 40 hrs and on occasion 45 hrs per week. Starting time from 3-6 am, which was perfect because of my 5 kids.That was a lie it was more around 55-60 hrs per week. So after 2 months as a delivery driver a shuttle position opened up. In order to switch positions I had to get my doubles and triples endorsements. After 3 month with this job I got a 1.42 per hr raise, after 3 months  they took the raise a way.  Their reason was oops we made a mistake. Then just days later now they want me to work on my days off and now longer hrs. From 10-12 hrs a day to 14-16 hrs a day. They have lost 5-6 people in the last couple of months and getting ready to lose another one."
bad,Doesn‚Äôt care about nothing but getting the job done at any cost. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre injured sick or whatever you better pull those batches. They think your a robot!
bad,Cut throat management always angling to pass the buck if things go wrong or take credit for your hard work if they go right.   They have a what have you done for me lately mentality.    Pressured me to get rid of older veteran drivers for younger lower paid drivers.   Did not even follow their own policy for discipline and retraining.  Made up rules as they went.   General manager was a creep with little man syndrome.   Human resource should really change their name to corporate resource.   US Foods is the very worst of what corporate America has to offer.   They will break your body for mediocre pay and throw you away when you cannot keep up the punishing workload anymore.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with too many loads that make for a 16 hour day. Management changes can make a situation good or bad when they aren't aware of the day to day operation.
bad,"Long workdays , promises of better pay, mandatory quotas, becomes very slippery when it's warm out which makes it very dangerous especially  when you are on a forklift."
bad,Not a family friendly place. They do not care about their employees or their problems. They acted like they wanted feedback but did nothing with it. Not very diverse.
bad,"...US Foods portrays themselves as a company with opportunity for advancement, when in fact you are stuck in the mud. Also poor training, guidance, and management. If you want a work-life balance, go somewhere else. They expect you to do a good deal amount of work at home after you have left the office. Some days were 14 hours without the commute."
bad,"During the interview they made it seem like it was such a great job and the pay would be great if you reach over 100% efficiency. Realistically that 100% is extremely difficult to reach and good luck staying above it to make any type of money. Management only cares for themselves and there are way to many supervisors just sitting around. They brag about safety but in order to do the job you have to work extremely fast along with 30+ people all trying to reach 100+%. Very unsafe work invironment, terrible culture and just a negative vibe all around."
bad,Supervisors are just harrassent you around to critize your work but they will not help you to get better .. they arr trying to wrote you up for the most simple thing.. bottom line US foods employment turnover rate is so high thanks to their management.. at least on tampa division..
bad,"Management is really bad."
bad,"Used to be #2, now number #3 food company. time for a change at the top. old ideas, old methods and old follow through. Stay away if you can. Poor decisions in Operations that is not getting any better."
bad,"They want to know when you take a poo! It‚Äôs ridiculous! Do yourself a favor a don‚Äôt even interview! Hours of school work (on your own time, no help from management) weeks of training vs selling!"
bad,Managers are not the best at what they do nor do they help anyone around them. If anyone has a problem it is ignored and not taken care of even when you talk to the managers boss.
bad,"They doing construction and they hired alot of racist managers and they keep people who steal, lie on other employees,  they changed the way you get paid now"
bad,Do not work here if you like being lied too they tell you a 5 day work week then force you to come in on sat then threaten your job if you dont. Your overworked everyday for minimum pay constantly sitting around waiting for your load and paperwork. If you get injured they treat you like a slave forcing you to work through your injury. Stay away you'll regret it first few months
bad,"Unless you like hard labor, mental stress long days and un predictability dont work here. When you are new you get worse or no equipment at all. They want 90 days probation but its really like 180 days because they only count work days not date of hire. It barely gets any easier after probation and at least half of the 100+ drivers there are happy and want to quit. The company has potential to be better but will not change. From management being terrible to warehouse loading the trucks wrong. There is no accountability. U.S. Foods goes thru trans managers often because of all their lower tier problems. They need to start fixing all small problems then work their way up or are always gonna need employees."
bad,"Management is lazy and invisible, pay is 14 an hour you will work 12-16 hours a day except one which is 8-10, you only have one full day off. Safety is non existent, theft is rampant but no management on floor. Turn over rate is incredibly high. Can‚Äôt leave until workload is done, at times you only have 8 hours between shifts. 90% of the shift has been here less than a year. I‚Äôm out here myself. This is by far the worst place I‚Äôve ever worked."
bad,"Not a good place to work, too many hours they deal In intimidation instead of respect and appreciation for being a good worker.Management does not know how to work with employees, pay is good and union benefits but wants you get sucked in you realize that you made a mistake staying there"
bad,Started in 2012. Looking for a better company that values hard working people. A company that recognize good people and promotes from within. A company that's treats people equally.
bad,When the company was Hawkeye Food Service it was a great Company.  With USfoods the dynamics changed and outsorcing is how USFoods works.   It is a temp only company now with very few full time workers.
bad,This place simply sucked... never know where your going till u come in and when u do find out your load is never ready on time..... they always say safety first but you drive the worse trucks that are so old they brake down daily.... u go into businesses that aren‚Äôt made for trucks and management doesn‚Äôt care how tired or how long u been working they only care about getting the food delivered.....simply a bad job to work at revolving door
bad,"Was not happy with the various managerial issues within the company"
bad,The schedule is bad. Managers were not fair & they over work you. You are very limited to time with your family & friends while working for US. Foods along with absolutely no holidays off for new guys.
bad,"After working here for decent amount of time, I feel I can fairly write this review. I spent about 60 hours a week here, and was terminated due to a wage issue from hire. Doesn't matter what position you are in, they use you and then toss you away. Don't believe the hype about their sign on bonuses, you sign a contract that states you get it over several years and if you leave you have to repay it. "
bad,Stay away the place is bad. Union is connected to management. You work like a dog for no money. You get low case count just under 500. Need over 500 to make money on cases. So $215 for 11-14 hours. Seniors go out with 1000-1400@53 cents per case. Guys in there making 215k with ease so they are protective of this perk and make sure no one under 10years is allowed to make money.
bad,"bad job to work at poor mangement various hours they hire you part time just not to give you insurance.union there is a joke they know ways around the union ,only thing good is starting pay.osha needs to come in an expect the place shut them down."
bad,"No Family time, poor management, stress full "
bad,Don't even try to work here. Don't waste your time. What they pay is not even close enough to how much hard work you do everyday at the job. In my opinion they should start there drivers at $27/hr That's how hard that job is
bad,N/a - dont have anything to say about this company.  I worked there as a temp and got fired because there was lack of training for the temps.............
bad,I would not go back to work for them. My father actually put 20 years in for the company and left feeling the same way i do about the company. They only care about certain people who suck up and brown nose
bad,"Long story short, they used to be great, but when they tried to merge with Sysco and failed, they learned too much about how Sysco does business and they're becoming more and more like them all the time, to the detriment of their employees and customers. My division was based in my hometown, of about 5,000 people, many of whom worked at US Foods. They decided to close that division down, putting a large portion of the town looking for work. Such a shame."
bad,"Don't treat employees like people.  Buyers yelling at sales people stating ""don't talk to me!""  "
bad,"Working at the US Foods Lexington SC division was probably the worst, most stressful job I've ever had. The management was a group of ultra conservative, middle aged and up, white southern men..A couple of them looked and acted exactly like Boss Hog from the Dukes of Hazzard. It was hard to believe this  kind of thing was still going on, in this day and age. Anyhow, they ruled through intimidation and fear, viewed their employees as units of productivity and not as human beings..Very political and lots of beauracracy..Only those who played the game were promoted or looked out for..And no matter what you did it was never enough. Compensation was poor compared to similar companies. Zero work/life balance..Physical symptoms of stress began to manifest, for example hives, heart palpitations, headaches and exhaustion..Also high levels of anxiety..Once I made the decision to leave - suddenly these symptoms vanished..To this day If I see a US Foods truck I still shudder..."
bad,"US Foods is only interested in what it wants to sell"
bad,"Poor training, worse communication. The fact that a pulse survey shows a 0% for management says everything. Everyone I know there is trying to leave. I am trying to get some of them out."
bad,No matter how hard you worked at your job it was never good enough. Management never listened to feed back even when they asked for feed back. No support from HR on any level. Training is none exsistant. Antiqated software still using Tandem ?
bad,I learned alot here from my coworkers. They were great. but management was difficult.Good benefits but expensive for them and pay not that great for the area. raises hard to come by
bad,You job is not safe at us food the cameras activate and they write you up and you get fired. No matter how good you are these people don't care about you you just a number
bad,"don't be fooled by the shiny objects.  This company is nothing like the culture they say they are.  They can't deliver products to their customers on a timely basis.  "
bad,Worst management ever. Keeps piling work on you but not big on increase in raises. Management does not listen to employees at all. Looking for a new job
bad,"Terrible quality of management and therefore they bring in people like them. It is not a great place to work and people don't move, so there is no career advancement."
bad,"Extremely biased PMO "
bad,no family life don't care about there drivers they only care about the accounts workers where great  very early starts they don't care about your saftey
bad,"Their IT dept. is highly political and doesn‚Äôt retain good talent"
bad,US Foods is an awful place to work.  the environment is not pleasant and the work is unappreciated.  the sales reps can be awful to work with although they are under a lot of stress to make their quota.
bad,"No Management, always wanted you to work many many hours even if you were over no help and like to steal pay checks. didn't pay me for all the hours worked"
bad,this place is horrible the managers are stupid.!!!!!!! don't wok here I got really bad experience withe the driver managers they are really mean to the drivers
bad,Run by a bunch of uneducated good old boys.  Some great salesman hired.  Weird politics surrounding US Foods.  Management hires who they know not skill set.
bad,Pres and all staff have been fired and culture is one of work or get out. No patience with establishing new business and has lost 50% or more of sales staff in Phoenix in last 5 yrs.
bad,"The management team was poor at best, nothing ever got solved and the customers we serviced were very uncompromising. Overall the mindset of the company was a fiasco from the top general to the foot soldiers. It just wasn't a place for me."
bad,Current turn over rate is 1 person hired 1.6 people fired. The time to select an order is borderline dangerous because people are having to literally run through a warehouse faster than they should constantly crashing the jacks and getting hurt. Injuries from over working is high and supervisors are very unprofessional. Many people have come on and severely hurt themselves to the point they can never work again
bad,There is no life/work balance. The night managers are very unprofessional. They don't keep anything confidential and they play favorites. Being a hard worker only gets you screwed over.
bad,I honestly cannot say anything good for this company my manager did everything to get me fired instead of helping me advance in the company for personal reasons.
bad,"I worked for that company 2 weeks only and it was because of poor management, a lot of lazy people, pay was terrible and in general the place sucked."
bad,"If you are middle management you might have some challenges, Union employees have the run of the place.  Upper management will appease the union.  They have no problem explaining that with a Union although you haven't made any mistakes if you are without effort motivating the employees and empowering them to take ownership of the work then you are creating a wedge between the need of a shop steward so the Union boss will tell you that although they agree with you they have to back the Union Shop Stewards.  I you don't have ambitions and want to run a cookie cutter system without actually Leading and developing individuals then this is a great place."
bad,"There was not much to do here. I had to often twiddle my thumbs as my supervisor did not have any extra work to give me. The only time I was busy was when supervisors were gone, and I covered for them."
bad,If you are a person of color do not go there. Human Resources in on the discrimination. Benefits are good tho. Coworkers are good people for the most
bad,A very toxic work environment! You are just a number here. You don't get paid for the job you do....You get paid for the stupid you put up with!! Downsizing is going to kill them. It's all how much can we make for corporate! Run as fast as you can!!
bad,Didn't enjoy this company.  The accounting department was very more so like a call center based experience.  Management was always at edge with each other and hence brought bickering amongst themselves constantly.  Atmosphere was very pins and needles with management.  Many employees were not happy there.  Many complaints from employees regarding management.  Very much so on the clock and constantly micromanaged.
bad,"Worst Job I have ever had. Management will lie to you. Management has favorites. Management refuses to give you your back Retro pay. Management does the blame game. Coworker's will say things behind your back NOT to you. Coworker's will say they make 80K a year, but NOT come close to that number. The branch is screwed up the way it ran. Be very afraid."
bad,Management does not care about employees. Company organization is extremely inefficient. Office employees are dispensable. Treatment of employees is terrible.
bad,"They will send u to SD, HIGH DESERT, and L.A. To report to work then you got ten hours to roll over till u start again but they don't care if it takes you 2 hours to get home and if you have to go to SD oh well they'll tell you and sometimes you go to Vegas for three days"
bad,"I have never in my life seen a company more poorly managed. I don't know how the hurricane wv branch is even still open. To start your gonna be lied to your very first day there. Get used to it. Your told that everything is based off of seniority. Not the case, seniority only works for the ones that management like. The routing makes no sense what so ever. You have no home life Monday - Friday that's a fact. Some routes are 15+ hours long so you start your day behind. I've been told multiple times as well as all the other drivers to bypass the weigh station that's a mile from the yard. No worries, they will give you directions on which way to go. Those are the only directions you'll get. Most all the addresses on your paperwork are wrong. So are the phone numbers. They never get updated. Use a gps? No they want you to come in an hour early and get directions from the other drivers instead. If your doing anything other then looking straight ahead with both hands on the wheel that's a write up of the camera goes off. DOT says you can't work past 14 hours in a day? I've seen guys work 18-20 hrs in a day and not even get a thank you. According to management ""I can keep you on duty 100 hours it doesn't matter. You just can't drive."" Your told that all you need to keep pace with is 120 cases per hour. No, not even close. The customers are always extremely upset  because they are lied to just as much as you are. I could keep going. The main point is these people don't care about you or what you have outside of work. They want your life to revolve around their needs at work and will"
bad,Crazy goal time incentive pay that makes the job sound great but realistically impossible.. Low pay back breaking labor long hous and they screw you on hours.. Run as fast as you can..
bad,TM8 ESRYSLDRIT6 SQ8O0W37C56; asryo;se78ry6a vsl;ieruvl awu4eyr;sdyft a;spiawerutdfjhgzfxlcjfta8oe7tr6v kzxjhgfL ASDgf
bad,"Worst job ever! Short like 7 drivers due to work stress. Many drivers are on limited duty due to injuries. Routes are extremely overloaded. Your day is never organized, and drivers don't have designated routes.Lost daily"
bad,"I have years of experience in distribution and I have to say that US Foods tampa is ran by a bunch of selfish, greedy, non caring hypocrites for management. Their pay system is on performance and u can make up to 22 hr but that is impossible to achieve because they have placed a system where they can brag about how much they pay their employees but make it impossible to reach. And if u somehow do throw 20,000 cases in one week,  5 errors knock u down to 13.00!! That's 5 errors out of 20,000! They have no respect and talk down to their employees like their kids and they preach respect and dignity but it's them that lack it. Communication is awful, good luck calling off for an emergency. They have 4 supervisors and 1 manager and none of them pick up their phone. Its just sooo many things wrong with this warehouse even the HR manager is useless. Look elsewhere, I'm bailing out like a few former employers have. This job is way too stressful if your a selector. Apply for something else. "
bad,"Work you like a slave! Back breaking slave work and you are required to work 14 and 16 hour days or you'll be fired! They treat you like dirt and you'll wish ever day that you would have never started working here. Save your back it's SUPER HARD work it's a young, young man's in your early 20's job. If you have any reason for getting hurt on the job they will fire you! Do not work here."
bad,This was the most horrific job I have ever had.  The management was horrid and I did not care for the communication style she exhibited.  She was hostile and insisted if you did not speak in the meetings (there were so MANY meetings) then you were not a team player.  It was crazy.
bad,"‚Ä¢	Receive inbound calls and place outbound calls to customers "
bad,Hate your life wanna do nothing but work and get treated worse.come work here. never been treated so bad my life.
bad,"Sysco ,pfg , us food,, dicarlo food,jb hunt is no for good driver is for animal ,,,dontt try no life,, work for them stressful. Long hr an new driver going to ny city,,,"
bad,management is more concerned about writing people up then how the co runs
bad,"long hard physical work back breaking supervisors are lazy cant ever give you answers for your questions in a timely matter,havent learned anything valuable, management only cares about whatever makes them or company money, i like all my co-workers hardest part of my job is my job, most enjoyable part of my job is clocking out and going home"
bad,"Mice,bugs,birds,bats, throughout warehouse inside food product."
bad,Not a very good company to work for. they dont treat you very well as a person
bad,I worked for the Nashville TN branch as the terminal supervisor. I was managed by people based in Alcoa TN (Knoxville). They wanted to use me as a strike buster in areas outside Tennessee where they had union drivers. I was told to be ready on 12 hours notice and jet off to who knows where to deliver groceries during a strike for an idefinite amount of time. The clown that was the VP of Ops in Alcoa was arrogant and cocky. He couldn't keep people under him. Since I left there in 2010 I have seen numerous ads to fill that position. As far as I can tell the whole company works this way.
bad,Not a good place to work. Management shoves sales down your throat and your not compensated effectively. The pay is not worth the bs that goes on. There is no advancement opportunity unless you're a managers pet. They don't care about actual skills just what they want when they want it
bad,"Beware do not go there ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó"
bad,The compensation plan is designed for USFOODS to make more money. The TM loses money every time you lose an account. Usfoods service is so bad that you lose accounts often.
bad,12 hour days poor management broken equipment ice in isles also  manipulate  The percentage you have to maintain so you have to work harder the union  presence  Is non existent
bad,US Foods is not a good place to work. It is a unsafe culture that focus on profits over human life. The training is a joke and HR don‚Äôt protest Anyone
bad,"Scattered uncoordinated management.  It was an every man for themselves culture.  While some people were very helpful, most could care less if you were successful or not."
bad,"I don't know about  other us foods, but the save on branch wood rather have drug dealers as managers, instead of loyal employees  A man controlled work place. Women not given fair opportunities."
bad,"over worked, poor management, dishonest with no room to advance."
bad,Very poor Management in this company. Overtime/ on call are mandatory. No compensation for being on call. If you have a decent route they figure out away to take it from you so you don't make any money. A lot of favoritism. The amount of hours you have to work to make any money is ridiculous. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Everytbing gets put on the driver. Trucks are loaded not in accordance with stops. To many work hours no family time. Management is poor. Office employees put the blame om the driver for everything even when its the office employees faults. To many stops for a day trip and stoos be like far apart with a route that doesn't add up.
bad,You are just a number.  You are talked down to.  I worked there 7 years and still couldn‚Äôt get a vacation from May to September.  You are constantly put in situations to fail.
bad,Was told they dont lay off but was laid off the day of new years after working new years eve night. So I didnt even get paid the holiday due too them laying off the morning before. Classless place which only cares about the bottom dollar and their personal bonuses.
bad,"High turnover with upper management. Managers will react with their emotions, often giving more weight to the regional offices than the corporate office."
bad,"I loved my job, my customers and product lines were decent. "
bad,"This job is terrible to work , they only care about numbers , all you are is a number , they don‚Äôt care what you have going on outside the work place . The management is horrible!!! No paid vacation, 10to 12 hour days EVERYDAY , no life outside the job . Pay is good but it‚Äôs not worth the labor, there‚Äôs no structure or organization, and the on it self will break your body down literally!!!!!!"
bad,"If you are coming from an outside Company and have not worked in Broad Line Food this is a difficult place to work.  This is a matrix organization that you ultimatley end up working for sales.  Very high turn over in Operations but very little in Sales.  The Health insurance plan is horrible / very expensive.  10K out of pocket before they cover at 100%.   The Union members are given a Cadillac Health Plan, however Non Union employees are given very little options with VERY HIGH premiums.  On a good note, Non Union Employees can buy pet insurance and 1 week of vacation your first year."
bad,This place has a real high Turnover here! Supervisors  manipulate your production times.Management and culture is horrible.The training is poor! The old veterans are giving up $25 to $28hr to go somewhere else.
bad,normally my hours of work is 7 to 4 but my work started at 5 am to 7or 8 pm in the evening. My manager was new appointed manages no management skills. he was IM me at 6 am in the morning. no enough people to handle the work loaded.
bad,"unprofessional, boys will be boys mentality, management is complacent and doesn't care, if you want to make a decent check and have no life then you are golden, if you want respect and a nice exciting place to work try walmart  you will get more respect."
bad,Management is an absolute joke! No work being done just looking at Jeep and gun parts . Transportation manager shows the most favoritism on God‚Äôs green earth! They will work you to death !
bad,"Way too much favoritism in the workplace that cause tension in between employees and supervisors, and in between employees.  Benefits were great but not enough to keep me there due to the favoritism, long hours and pay."
bad,Management does not understand the direction from corporate therefore they are all over the place.  They expect you to work 365 days a year. NO work/life balance.  ex: I was at a funeral and was expected to answer calls.  They will say they welcome work/life balance when you interview but once you are in the company it is a different story.
bad,"I needed a position and went there.  it was a mistake.  I hope that I do not make the same mistake again."
bad,"Take it if you really need a job, but avoid otherwise. Most managers have no clue what their employees do and senior management is more concerned with footwear and what time you take your lunch than sales strategy and customer expectation management. You will be appreciated by the people you work closely with, but otherwise are a resource to be wrung dry of energy, drive and enthusiasm for going to work."
bad,"The sales team is incredible, but lack the support they need.  The operations is completely inadequate and careless if the sales can keep a customer or not why, because they still get paid."
bad,Horrible work environment. The culture is all about being micromanaged and treated poorly from Senior Leadership. I would recommend staying far away from this company.
bad,After interviewing for the job I realized I was the wrong color.  They only hire people far less qualified that way the boss always looks good.  It's job security for management to keep the door revoling.
bad,"As a driver, If you want to just bust your butt and get fired after 90 days this is the job for you. Management has been fighting the Union for years and using the drivers as leverage, they hire about 6 drivers every few months but when it comes time to sign your union protection papers they let you go on the 89th day. Managers mistreat and lie to your face, they should be ashamed to put the US in there name."
bad,"I work for us foods portland.... unfortunately.  The trans supervisor for that area is a complete liar. I was promised wages that after being hired they reniged on. I was promised lots of work and that never happened. This place will lie right to your face to get you onboard and then stab you in the back after being hired. The working conditions are unsafe. The loads inside the trailer are a complete disaster. Pallets of food poorly built and not stable or secure. Boxes of food fall on you and at you when opening doors to the trailer. The management in this place is a complete and utter joke. There is no common sense or intelligence and is poorly managed, thats why sysco and fsa dominate the northwest because us foods has treated their workers horribly and their customers as well because of their dysfunctional and inept abilities. Bottom line for anyone thinking of applying here: DONT!!!! Corporate needs to come in a complete clean house from the general manager to all supervisors both wharehouse and trans and put people in who have intelligence and common sense."
bad,They want you to do things in half the time it should take you.  They want you to approve to run trucks and trailers that shouldn't be on the road. The company hires 20 people every week to get one person to stay and work.  Run away as fast as you can.
bad,Do not apply at this company they will work you 40 hr and not give you any benefits. I. Worked at this facility for approx 1 yr or better didn't want to make me full time went out found another job much happier now all they worry about is productivity standard which I was meeting every week . Still nothing place is probably going to close when sysco takes over go somewhere else it's a joke
bad,I worked here for over four years. I was fired unjustly without provocation. I was given no indication that I was being fired.
bad,"the first couple years i made decent money. then they started working us to death, injuries through the roof. I worked 55 hours my first 2 years the past 3 i have worked 67-72 (yes over HOS) and have taken a 40% pay DECREASE. the management is awful. and they will cheat you if you dont go through your cheque with a fine tooth comb. they abuse their help and practice unsafe procedures just to nickle and dime the bottom line."
bad,be ready to take 2 to 3 cans of energy drink and smoke what you can to stay energized through the night so as to make your numbers.The work environment is too rigid and doesn‚Äôt meet modern warehouse operational standards. They pay lip service to safety. 80% of their employees won‚Äôt pass a drug test.
bad,"Managment terrable, treat drivers very bad. unorganized do not have tools for drivers, failure at begining ... stay away trucks are in very bad shape..."
bad,"This place Exploits good workers and makes them pick up everyone else's slack...... maybe if im starving to death ill go back,maybe i rather die ......"
bad,To much work and not enough pay all you are is a number the harder you work the more you get and less work the other people get and no incentive to work harder and no advancement
bad,"After over 13 years of working there I was fired over the telephone.  I was never written up or counseled.  I won numerous awards in sales and was one of the top producers but didn't fit the ""profile"" for new management.  I did not personally know anyone that liked their job and many of the tenured reps have either quit or gone to work for competitors."
bad,will not be given any time for time loss while selecting as in a forklift operator doing let downs in the tight areas in which you are working and their slot picking have extremely heavy items above shoulder reach and ticket orders must be held in hand as you pick product from slot allowing shorts and mispicks. there is more but you would have to see for yourself.
bad,Changed the comp plan so your pay will go up or down every 3 months.  There is no commission here anymore.  Managers would rather sell a product to hit a numbers goal than truly find fit for restaurant.  Dealt with a lot of micro management and company was hiring outside hires with no food experience.  The training they give nowhere comes close to real life.  When I started we had close to 60 sales people and that was down to low forties when I left.
bad,"Very old fashioned work culture"
bad,"This company takes advantage of their drivers. When over in hours they have you pull over and swap into a van. Driver‚Äôs have to break down pallets to get their stops orders, they are NEVER LOADED so that your first stop is the first to load off your truck. They mix frozen and regular food together. Items are not in freezer as suppose to be. "
bad,Prepare to be hurt somewhere down the line.....Like 90% you're spine and before you get medical treatment you are drug tested and interrogated as if you're a criminal
bad,Job culture is terrible.  Job security is always an unknown.  You live every day just trying to protect your backside.  I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Don‚Äôt do this job unless you are DESPERATE. Your body is used so bad from the hard work everyday. You have no life, you have to get to sleep as soon as you get home. Should be 100k job it‚Äôs bout 60-65k!!! You will get burned out trust me. Turnover is huge and constant, lose drivers EVERY week. Job really sucks."
bad,"use two wheeler to haul upwards of 350 pounds down a ramp, up or down stairs. management expects you to run everywhere you go, every stop is timed, cameras in cab monitor your every move"
bad,"New comers are treated better than people that have been there for many years, pay is low compared to other regions and heaven forbid you have a life. The management does not stand behind  you. If you keep to yourself, then you are a problem. They try and call your personal phone all the time, company policy, not to talk on phone at all while driving, then they want to know why you don't answer the phone right away. They don't like it when you utilize programs that you qualify for, they will give you a hard time. The sick time pay is basically non-existent. All the good management that was there, has either quit or been fired. It is good constant work, but they will constantly change your start times on you. Even though it is a 4 day work week, you are on call and be prepared to work that 5th day and even be called in last minute to work. If you don't come in that day they call you in then that will count against your attendance. Pay attention to wording on paperwork that you sign, it will say one thing and they mean another or log incorrect information."
bad,"I would never tell someone to go and get a job at US Foods in Jackson,MS! They treat you like nothing and no one has your back. Its like dog eat dog. Management could care less about you, and that's from HR,to the VPO, Transportation Supervisor,Transportation Manager, Fleet Manager, you see where this is going. If you are the type that stays to yourself then this place is not for you. Staying to yourself will make them really treat you bad. You will get all the junk equipment you can handle. Very bad place to work."
bad,US Foods only promoted those employees that they liked and was a part of certain groups. Managers were not trained for their jobs properly and ethically underdeveloped.
bad,Anybody in charge from the lead on up is worthless.  Poorly managed.  Nobody helps when we are short handed or busy.  Leads and supervisors sit in office and talk about sports all day.  Change vice president of operations every year or two.  Communication between shifts is non-existent.  This job will drive you crazy.  STAY AWAY!  TRUST ME!
bad,"management horrible no life long hours very cutthroat no loyalty from company union sucks,right to work state group of guys wont join makes it worse for all"
bad,"Leadership is a huge clique, they hire only friends for managers and directors. Culture is horrible, always on edge. Directors micro manage managers and managers micro manage buyers. Do not work here, really terrible environment."
bad,current leadership lacks team building skills.  does not engage with the workers to get a true picture of what is going on and how employees are working for a mutual goal.
bad,poorly ran and dirty and dangerous work enviorment.  pallets all over the place.  hard to get around and pull orders.  if you pull 100 percent the short you a case or two so they don't have to pay your incentive pay.
bad,"There is a lack of communication on all levels as well as lack of driver appreciation or acknowledgment. Company rarely replies or acknowledges feedback, there are no opportunities for growth extended, and all terms of pay are on a variable scale which is altered weekly."
bad,Do do not like it they work you have to death on night shift and HR don't care about you DO NOT WORK NIGHTS THERE!!!! Warning the place is very very bad place to work
bad,"I was brought on for just long enough to train my replacement, a friend of the manager's. Manager ordered receiving clerks to falsify shipping records to avoid detention fees. The shipping receivers (unionized) treated clerical staff (non-unionized) with open hostility. Illegal immigrants work as selectors with managers' apparent knowledge and complicity."
bad,"A once good company under a different name."
bad,"Very small credit office cramming 7 people in there with an extremely loud and rude employee who basically controls the department. You do not work for the managers, you work for her, and if you don't do what she wants she will do anything to make sure you get fired. Managers/supervisors do not have your back when you make a credit decision and will allow sales staff to run all over them/ you. Very unorganized, chaotic, unprofessional department."
bad,"Not a healthy place to be - due to water damage -water stains on walls, carpet - they never replaced carpeting everything in area smelled like mold, mildew, the office near the kitchen smelled of gas all the time, it was dirty and greasy, not a pleasant environment to have lunch. Just say the ""cultures"" did not mix."
bad,been at Montgomery branch for over 20 years they still look at me from the past different manger still the same to much buddy running good people out bad place to work night shift is joke to many winy baby they cry to manger and get what they wont  diversity right manger are poor judgeimint
bad,They have significantly struggled since going publicly traded...they no longer care about the customer nor the associate only the cases out the door.  Great peer team and customers.
bad,everything about this job is no good. EVERYTHING!!!! well you do get a paycheck once a week. that's the only thing good. It's no wonder they are always hiring.
bad,"Too many stops for new drivers, schedule is horrible for new drivers.  14+ hours per day is too many for anyone.  Need to add more trucks and routes. Pay is good."
bad,"Just too stressful, body aches all over. No appreciation given to the employees. Did not enjoy the employment. When short staffed, must take over work load, meaning longer than 12 hour shifts"
bad,"They hire you with the promise of an ""established territory"" but there isn't one"
bad,"Work 16 or more hours a day as the company does not value it's employees in middle management. Employees, especially in operations are viewed as just a number. There are no discounts or benefits, very family unfriendly. Supervisors and Managers are asked to work long hours and are used as scapegoats. Very hostile work environment."
bad,I work in the Phoenix warehouse worst place ever night shift managers have no experience in managing at all you have to really break your back to get 100% daily their equipment is useless which makes it hard for you to work and to get 100% that's y people walk in and they walk right out their pay is ok but is not worth getting hurt your running all night non stop to try and get that 100 %
bad,"no life terrible management, bad loads. Nothing changes when you show them theirs problems. Management changes the rules whenever they want to. Supervisors do whatever they want."
bad,"Poor Business Model from Corporate."
bad,"I took the job for the money and opportunity. I worked literally 12-14 hour days watching the employees under me earn a better paycheck than me..then I got to take the fall for their mistakes. The company always looked for a scapgoat rather than figure out the real problem. "
bad,"Nice people "
bad,"There's a reason this job consistently pops up  on job searches! I would strongly discourage anyone from working at the US Foods location here unless all you TRULY care about is the hourly pay and you are willing to work and bust your butt in conditions that DO NOT help you achieve pick rate. Equipment-TERRIBLE Pick/Check Number system-TERRIBLE. Expect to work most days around 12 hours almost every night. VERY unsafe working environment when I worked there I saw many employees get injured and it was all because of the race to hit your pick rate. That's how you know that the pick goal is unreasonable. The injuries play a factor into the long 12 hour nights. We would start at 6:30 pm and you knew you weren't getting out until 7:00 am the next morning most nights. If you think you can pick at a 100% for 12 hours then hey good for you! Add on the fact that some part timers would leave work early and you can imagine how long some nights were. Management was subpar overall rarely did I witness them helping out unless we were under the most extreme circumstances. Training is subpar so that puts you behind the ball before you even step on the floor. Overall team work amongst employees is a joke for the most part. There are a few that will help you out but most only look out for themselves and really don't care about anyone else. When i think about it though, the way the job is set up I don't blame them."
bad,"Management doesn't have a clue on what to do on a daily basis. Routes are constantly running behind. Our trailers are filthy inside, I don't think they ever get washed out. Some product looks like it's been drug down the street by the way the cases look. Don't count on home time because management and all their mistakes will have you working all day and night even on your day off. This is absolutely the worst company I've  ever worked for. "
bad,"The Denver office has made some terrible management choices in replacing one or two District Managers and keeping one or two very weak managers.  The newest Regional Manager, from one of the Carolina's, was very divisive and not a leader, a leader coaches this guy just has no personality and changed the office from one of which everyone looked happy to be there to one of where reps were leaving in droves, either by choice or not.  Overall this company has middle managers that are somewhat conceited, cocky and only worried about covering their own backs, not interested at all in how they can work with reps for the benefit of the rep, the manager and the company."
bad,"Senior leadership team is all from Canada on a short term basis wit hthe goal to make the compnay look profitable at any cost and then sell in 2014."
bad,"Former Delivery driver employee ft mill sc"
bad,"work was physical off loaded 80 % of trailer by hand aa inside deliveres. got along great with all my steady custermers. had one prob lem with one manager wich cost me my job.90% of my co-workers were great guys the rest i didnot care for . upper managment was very good ,lower managment not so much!in the almost 13 years i worked there i only missed work once due to injury."
bad,I've been at this company since 1998 and it will beat your body down. The loaders cant stack the pallets right and the routers cant route . Management preach safety but there actions dont reflect it. They pack the truck with 800 to 1300 cases a day and have cameras in the cab to watch your every move. The tractors are garbage to be such a large company. Its not for anybody over 35 years old. Those cameras in the cab was the last straw for me. It has turned cult like.The good pay is not even worth the stress. Enter at your on wrisk.
bad,I indured 3 union contracts while employed at us foods each one the would put a chain link fence to intimidate their employees they where going to be locked out. Next contract comes up in September of 2013. Be prepaired to be on strike last contract barely got through. They treat their employees like dirt and work you like a dog. New hires got hosed on the benefits. You'll be on call unloading some of the worst loaded trucks in the business. They will have digging through a whole pallet for the one case you need. BE WARNED STAY AWAY
bad,This place is a pretty awful place and the ethics are deplorable. Run away from this place as fast as you can.
bad,Management is the worse...They make a killing of your accounts and pay you pennies. Corporate asss kisser employees always with their nose up managements asss hoping for promotion
bad,"No matter what good you are at work, they look for any excuse to fire you and even make a plot to lie and make you a case. The union is sold with them and they will not defend you, the new employees are fired just before they have to enter the union justifying with any excuse"
bad,"It‚Äôs a okay job. You down stack ,  rotate  , and you fill the shelves that‚Äôs it. The worse part of the job is the management all the way up to  regional  Management all the way down to the management team at the store. It‚Äôs terrible. They fire you for no reason, it‚Äôs no moving up in the company unless you kiss butt to management. The turn over rate is  ridiculous . They don‚Äôt give you time off. It‚Äôs so much micro management. All I can say is treat this company as a steppingstone to something you really want."
bad,"Hostile work environment, micro managed, managers are no help, constant negativity in office, out bursts daily by fellow co workers, foul language used daily, others make up work that others don‚Äôt do, lies daily, drama filled, no discipline for problem employees, drains all positive energy out of me daily due to co workers. Three years no change. I do not recommend"
bad,They say you have 90 days to make rate Lie! You have one week after your hired. If you dont make rate after one week they fire you. They expect you to build perfect pallets and move fast after one week..It is a very hard job although it sounds easy its not. They do work people like animals.  Do not work at US foods not worth the money.
bad,It‚Äôs a job if you really need one but wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to many people. Management was not the best but the co workers were great. If it was better pay and possibility of moving up I would of stayed but clearly those never happened
bad,"No training on systems. Management only functions to CYA themselves. Aggressive, disrespectful treatment by management. Great financial incentives. Management expects you to work 7 days/ week."
bad,Mangement Mangement!!! Timed routes. Would finish your route go home then wait to call at 9pm to see what time you start.Would start as early as 3am. Mangement was racist against white and hispinics. I would not revommend working there.
bad,"Poor management, poor communication, and horrid communication in the management.  Haven't seen it that bad since the Army.  Most everyone I spoke to hated their job, and their employer.  Lots of complaining among the work staff"
bad,Good pay terrible training management is poor at best..you never know what time you will be done..12 hour days are the norm..management talks a good game NEVER follows through..this is a job if you absolutely cannot find anything else..the pay is the only good thing but no one and I mean no one would work there if they paid a dollar less..
bad,"Open door policy is a joke and not taken seriously by Human resources or upper management."
bad,"Manager in Charlotte NC is a racist, and a bigot. He sneaks into the shop at 3:30 in the morning trying to catch you doing something he can hold over your head, but he never succeeds."
bad,"As a broadline distributor, US Foods offers good products and services.  However, due to unions, operational inefficiencies and cronyism it is no longer a well-run organization."
bad,"It's a hard job for sure, but after 15 years with the company I was only $680 in my pension plan. I was told that we have 401k. YES we do have 401k, but that's just my own money. The company was sold 3 times in my 15 years of employment and it's still up for another sale to SYSCO foods. "
bad,The job can run smooth if the trucks was running & selected properly by that i mean the lowest stops are always on the bottom so you‚Äôre spending unnecessary time digging products out.  Some of the supervisors need to go to a cours because they talk at you instead of to you then everybody‚Äôs a supervisor unless you need assistance then they don‚Äôt no the answer to anything. It‚Äôs a lot of favoritism in there and to me it‚Äôs just my opinion the African American drivers get all the worse stops without the proper equipment to do the job and the wonder why so many employees are hurt.
bad,Many changes are made with duties on a weekly basis. Many people that I worked with are very unhappy with all the constant changes. It appears that older employees are let go more than average age employees. Extremely unhappy environment to work in.
bad,"The problem was the managmet, they are an experinced and not willing to take advice of the employe who have to do the job, also they never stand behind there employe"
bad,I have worked at the Tampa location for over 3 years . The management is not very good ! They always ask to express your concerns but will ignore you when someone finally gets the courage to speak up ! The system is flawed and not accurate so you don‚Äôt get the neccesary time to do the orders. Not to mention you have to argue with co- workers everyday because they won‚Äôt let you pass or try to avoid work ! This by far is the worst place I have ever worked! Management shows favoritism towards certain workers which lowers the morale of the warehouse . If you plan on applying to this place plan on never spending time with your family ! There are others jobs this one isn‚Äôt it trust me !
bad,"With 8 people crammed in small quarters with no windows, it's a horribly depressing environment.  There's one long time employee who runs the show, she's the real manager in the department. To make matters worse, she's loud, rude and swears on the floor.  It's a very unprofessional, toxic environment.  No life work balance and need to work Holidays. Overall, not worth the salary or benefits.  I needed to leave to save my sanity."
bad,you have to work harder than a person can without have to take something to work faster.  Also you did not get water breaks or bathroom breaks without losing money on your production goal.
bad,not even wasting time filing this out.  It was horrible. pay was great. nothing else was as described. They tried to force me to go back out without proper time off to sleep. that's just the beginning of that rabbit hole
bad,"After merger with Waukesha foods everything collapsed went from a good place, to everything just being to stressful. Too many managers, and still poor working conditions"
bad,"Usfoodservice drives hard to service the customer but lacks in the employee care. I have been a night selector for 20 years. Watching employees come and go, one thing is certain ,they are quick to throw you out for any reason. Once they throw you out your offered a last and final under ridiculous stipulations to return to work. Us foodservice plays favorites to certain employees, sugar coating the bad and making the good work harder. I was wrongfully terminated for using their hotline to report retaliation against myself and others. Pay is great but not worth the stress. Usfoods San Diego has not one upper or lower manager in all depts. that has been there longer than 10 years. Night crew has been without a manager for a few years now. Makes you think ""how far do I want to go in this company"" Usfoods is a dead end career"
bad,"Management does not care about you at all.  They do whatever it is they please and pick their favorites who get better treatment.  Seniority doesn't eve play a role at this location.  Hands down, I was one of their best drivers, where customer's were beyond satisfied with my deliveries.  That never mattered though.  My route was changed to where I was working 70 per week.  They target the employees they don't like and throw you away.  I was overworked, stressed, and never saw my family.  The union is useless and sides with the company.  The shop steward could care less too.  Such a phony place to work for.  Pay was good but your overall mental health is not worth a dime of it."
bad,"This is a very high stress environment where they put no effort into training you at complex positions and are severely under-paid. They also work you terrible hours with no regard to your personal well being. As a company as a whole they offer wonderful benefits and an organized work structure, as well as very nice offices but the work environment is toxic and filled with drama. At the end of the day you're a number, just a worker bee, and not valued as a person. This is great work experience but absolutely not an environment you will want to stay in long term."
bad,"Every day has challenges, unfortunately the left hand doesn‚Äôt know what the right hand is doing, due to growing pains. If you like to work 7 days a week, this is the job for you."
bad,Bad choice on my part to go there. Frequent turnover in senior management is a clue to problems. People tried hard to make a difference but you run out of time.
bad,"very stressful job, corporation/management is always changing job structure, commissions and duties.  "
bad,"No path to grow unless you suck up to management hard. - IT"
bad,"Management staff is very negative towards associates. Managers believe all salary staff work 14+ hours regardless if your work is finished or not. Company does not train you, the follow a sink or swim mentality."
bad,Worked short time in Decatur supervisor was awful was yelled at and cussed at numerous times while in training worked similar jobs for years never any problems was let go after scheduling doctors appointment and approved then called at 9 o'clock night before and told be at work or fired loads awful routes terrible good money but treated bad
bad,"Answering emails"
bad,"Low pay, long hours, out dated equipment and very disorganized."
bad,nothing good to say but the pay but technically is hard work so you deserve to be compensated.
bad,"the good is if you like to work hard you can make some money. but if you want to think for yourself, its not the place to be. you will be treated like garbage, called at all ungodly times in the night. even when they know your asleep, or your out of town, you will hardly get to see your family and to top it all off, after you get done working like a dog. you will get nothing, not even a good job, thanks for helping us out,"
bad,"Honestly I can not find the words to describe how disorganized this corporation is. It is indecisive at every internal level. Constantly changing,  implementing, re figuring, confusion, etc. etc. No clear direction. Always alterations. Business 101 deficient in my opinion and I'm not disgruntle at all. I was just culture shocked while employed there few years. Needless to say I resigned.   Sysco recently purchased them hopefully to disassemble them from existence."
bad,I've worked for us. foods for over 7 years now and I hate it. management sucks and favors certain people. everything there is supposed to be done by seniority but that is not the case at all. they pull part timers off the floor to train. they will skip over you if they don't like you for no reason at all. the company is a joke!
bad,I would highly advise any applicant to steer clear of this company especially when applying for a management position in the field.  Forget about work/life balance.  There is none.  Be prepared to travel 70% of the time and work 7 days a week.  There Is no training at the Billion dollar company.  They look at you strange when you want to get trained on something you never worked on before.  You also MUST have Foodservice experience (they won't tell u that ).
bad,"drive cam , no eating even a candy bar,no drinking coffe water ect. no head set fore phone, no cb's and so on any thing that is done they are waching u will be let go no matter what.12 to 14 hr. days they don't care about drivers management is allways right drivers are wrong"
bad,"If u want to drive a tractor trailer dont come here. Management is terrible, the looads are bad, the routers cant route, cut throat. They also have cameras inside the cab to spy on you. Im 42 years old and looking for somewhere else to go work. Word of advice stay away."
bad,One of the most dysfunctional departments I have ever worked in. Get disrespected by management on all fronts. Micromanaged. Our personal time is not important (having to work Sundays) Constantly having work dumped on us with no regard to our work schedule. Treated badly by most sales people. No appreciation from anyone. Payscale is unfair.
bad,"Company treats all drivers like a neccessary evil; will run you ragged! Gave Minneapolis drivers a small raise every year we could vote for a union, but on the off years even smaller... maybe a nickel. Fought for the union hard and finally became a Teamster organization, but the company is still a miserable place to work. Run away."
bad,"It was the job to get in the area. I was very proud to finally get in. Then everything changed ,iincluding the management"
bad,"As long as you don't have any ethics towards your customers it's ok. Little yo no support. On your own, management is extremely incompetent. Routing is horrible. Pay is great"
bad,"Wasted 15 years of loyalty to a company who only cares about bottom line , doesn't treat lower management equally or fairly makes decisions based on minimal input from unreliable sources"
bad,"The management does not care about their employees.  They only care about if the job gets done.  They get mad at you for being sick and calling out.  And all they care about is how fast you pick and to make sure the day is over with before the day shift gets there.  Great money, great benefits but poor management.  They fire the slow selectors and only keep the fast selectors.  If you want to get paid good work for them but you spend more time at work then you do with your family, you get one day off.  You'll be constantly mad every day you walk into work. But good luck. (Manassas, Virginia)"
bad,"Lack of communication makes it difficult to work with other departments on departments."
bad,Get 2 mispicks and your pay goes from 20+ to 12! Outrageous!! Be ready to be thrown out to the wolves!  99.9% at the end of the week equals a write up. No exceptions!! Possibly make a lot of money but no time to spend it. You live at work!
bad,This place would give you so many points till you where let go. But they picked and chooses many times. Sometimes they would point you for things if they felt like it. The union did absolutely nothing for you. Left a bad taste in my mouth.
bad,"Management is more like a Partisanship if you not with the in crowd you get treated badly, very unhealthy work place unsafe and the equipment is very poor when you need help with it they look to you as if you are the problem even if you are telling the truth SAD!!"
bad,The worse management system that I have ever seen and worked for. They tell you one thing to your face and stab you in the back. To all Veterans seeing this do not work here. Save your self the head ache.
bad,If you don't reach the time requirement they ask for selecting orders (which is very difficult because their products are heavy) within 90 days you will be fired. Hours are terrible and the people are even worse. Everyone is worried about how much pay they will receive so it's a very hostile environment.
bad,"Managers and Supervisors are the worst. They treat union guys like garbage, hours are longer than expected. You think you‚Äôre done at 3-4am to find out you have to wait 5-10 minutes for them to go invent a label just for them to keep you longer. They don‚Äôt help trainees at all. Most union guys see you as in the way of your job instead of helping."
bad,Dont do it dude! Therrrre is always a warning before destruction. US FOODS IS A BACK BREAKING COMPANY! If you went to driver's school to drive tractor trailer then stay away from US FOODS bc you will be unloading a 48 ft trailer 85% of the day crying bc you didnt listen to me 10% of the day and driving the rest. That camera will go off if you so much as cut a smelly too loud and when you get back the supv will write you up! Respect your body KNOW YOUR WORTH! Or choose to be a US FOOL.
bad,"It's a good company, but the pay just not good to out standard living. When you get paid, your medical goes up too. "
bad,"Money and benefits  awesome , run far away  find a day job for less money and have a life, save your  back , save your soul, save your family  from never gonna see  you. You will never see the light of day ."
bad,"Not a healthy environment. As far as they're concerned work comes first. Corporate culture and upper management is one of not caring about employees. Trucks are not loaded appropriate for deliveries, upper management complains about overtime but won't listen to drivers' suggestions, physical and mental stress, GPS and cameras are always watching you, and written warnings are given for minor violations. Routes and equipment are not consistent, don't know where you're going daily even though drivers bid on permanent routes. Expected to deliver product even when access to deliveries are extremely difficult to get to (i.e. up/down staircases, ramps, basements, etc.) Would never recommend or go back."
bad,Good place to work if u r alone in the world the production times are crazy u never meet them u will have 2 put 250 pieces on 3 pallets and they want u 2 do it 50 minutes or less and u have 2 go down 20 lanes. U start at 4:30 in the afternoon and may not get off til 8:30 in the morning high turnover rate need to fix the production time then the job would be perfect
bad,They work u to hard an all they care about is production all your breaks are cut an hafe it's just not worth it but if they do away with the production it would be ok
bad,"This was the worse decision I ever made !!! While the money is good you are going to earn every bit of it, the equipment sucks, tractors are terrible,  and they do not want you reporting issues with trucks on the computer. As a delivery driver i was in a Solo / helper route and was not given a helper ,i notified the transportation manager three hours before i was out of time because i know i would run out of DOT hours. After completing my last stop on a Friday i notified him several times ,only to get i dont have no one and dont know what to tell you. Have had had he laughed and said catch an uber to a hotel until your hours come back. ...smh mind you I was In the north Georgia mountains with no hotel around for miles only resorts. "
bad,"Poor performance with the leads,supervisors and management they need to get rid of the percentage it be a great job the management needs more training"
bad,"I was never given the opportunity to learn the job in its entirety. A typical day cannot be described , as my duties changed from day to day. Workplace culture is very political and not well managed."
bad,A bunch of two faced people that will say one thing then turn around and stab you in the back.  One particular supervisor there doesn't even know what I was even responsible for.  Got accused for things I never did.  Then you go to the supervisor with concerns and get totally ignored.  Tried to better myself and my family and tried to get CDL training that the company pays for as soon as the people from transportation talked my supervisor all of a sudden I couldn't even get a response about the situation.  If you don't know anyone of importance there don't even bother on trying to move up they will sweep you under the rug then stand on the rug and treat you like that permanently.
bad,"A typical day was me arriving on time for my shifts"
bad,Don't waste your time ...no job security if your 1% off from hitting your numbers they fire you ...its a revolving door with selectors and managers ..I was there only 6 months and had 2 bosses...the place is a joke
bad,"Management makes it impossible most of the time to make it an enjoyable work place as hard as selecting is   at this facility. Favoritism towards certain employees is out of control, if your a new hire brace yourself! Training is horrible the only way you might have a chance to make it here is if you have some previous experience! You will get FIRED if you do not run 100% after 90 days of being hired which you are not TOLD with only 1-2 weeks of training at most. Management messes with selectors time to make you work even faster I was so discouraged after 6 months of working here and I have been selecting for over 5 years for other top food distribution centers. They don't even have a pallet sorter on hand to sort pallets that are broken selectors have to sort through them while time has started running on your next assignment! I wouldn't recommend this place to any HUMAN!"
bad,Very very fast paced. Voice picking which is helpful if the voice in the headset can understand you and you don‚Äôt have to repeat yourself 50 times. The times to pick orders are unrealistic 90 min to pick a 350  pice p.f. Chang‚Äôs order while your stuck in isle 72 for 30 min of it. Then want you to work 16 hour days while keeping a 100% rating. The pay is good they start you off at awesome pay just walking in the door but there sure  not giving that money away. They‚Äôll give you 90 days and if you aren‚Äôt moving as fast with out dying they‚Äôll let you go. Your just a number and replaceable they don‚Äôt care about you. The work and speed they want you at will break your body. I need rotator cuff surgery because of that place. Moving 1000s of 6x4 cans glued together and 1000s of cases of water took it toll. But your trainer that‚Äôs been there 20 years skips down the aisle like it‚Äôs nothing then looks at you like why are you so slow. They have triple pallet jacks abc so your filling 3 pallets at once. Work crew was cool made lots of friends. But you see a lot of turn over a lot. One min some ones there a month next min there gone and you have 10 guys to replace him.
bad,"Little to no support from directors. Left to figure it out on your own and is truly a trial by fire position. Make a big enough mistake that you were unaware of because you were never told of the process, they will fire you. No work life balance for managers. Culture is terrible the markets scream and yell and treat you like garbage and upper management does nothing. Director spends more time on catch phrases then actually developing a solid plan."
bad,"Management micromanages and treats you like a number.  Only one sided conversations with management. No ability to grow. Great hourly team, horrible manager at this facility.  Worst job ever!!!  If you want to experience being watched on camera by your boss and then having him call you on the production floor to degrade you, then apply to Stock Yards in Blasdell. You'll love it!!!"
bad,The salary is good but it doesn't justify the poor management. The benefits are nice but again doesn't justify the poor management. Coworkers are stressful to work with.
bad,"Roanoke Division Virginia"
bad,They are horrible short days never had work for us workers to do the employees are very kind supervisors were nice the breaks were short stockers never finished their jobs
bad,"I worked at this company for 2 years. The Supervisors don't care about your health, family or well being they just want the order delivered. If you have a family and you like spending time with them this is not the right job for you. It also wear and tare your body, no sleep and the top manager who was a supervisor when I was there is a üêç.  So many people come and go there. What you have to deal with its not worth it. Its just like a prison there."
bad,"The Minneapolis/Plymouth credit department is not run by management.  Don‚Äôt expect your manager or supervisor to have your back unless one long term credit coordinator gives approval first. Managers have no backbone.  The environment is loud and hostile, not professional at all.  Swearing and yelling at coworkers.  If that long term credit coordinator decides she doesn‚Äôt like you, you had better move on. She will make your life impossible and try to get you fired. "
bad,I truly enjoyed working with the creative chef's. Working with territory managers and trainers was less than pleasent. I woman in a 1920's mans world.
bad,"No accountability depending on your role. Good employees get extra worked dumped on them, bad employees get to skate by. The sales team do and say whatever they want with no consequence. My current manager is fantastic, it's the only reason I'm still here. Executive staff leaves a lot to be desired. They have no money to give decent raises but shell out thousands of dollars at a rip for the sales team."
bad,If your wanting to get your job threatened and work your body to the breaking point then this is the place for you the management likes to play blame games and make sure they do the least amount of work as possible.
bad,"This place will work you like a dog every night until you throw your back out. Your life will revolve around U.S. Foods, you will work 9-10 hours a night literally busting your behind for your pay. Management don't care about nothing but percentage rates. They measure your performance based on a automated computer system that never layed hands on a box. They want you to run up and down 12 aisles on a pallet jack, pick 85 to 100 pieces, build 2 pallets, wrap and stage them on the loading dock in 25 minutes....Employees have to skip breaks and cheat the system in order to even come close to making percentage..witch is 95%. What a joke! ..Its almost impossible to make the union witch susposed to take 90 days. This company will wave the carrot in your face and make it sound real nice, but everything that glitters aint gold. Be prepared to lose 20lbs and work every holiday ......dont say I didnt warn ya...."
bad,Went for an interview seems like a decent place to work but the work load they put on their employees compared to how much money the corporation makes is terrible . Pay is like 10.85 and with incentive you'd have to kill yourself to make 18 an hour . Probably the worst selecting job I've ever seen
bad,"This place is corrupt, if you want stability...do not work here. Management is sneaky and will lie to do anything they want with you. They are slimeballs. I personally have a family and don't have time for games and bs so the dedication and hard work I have shown US Foods has meant nothing and oh well I must suck it up and move on for my family. They act like they care about employees and families when in reality they only care about bottom lines and who kisses whose butt. Hopefully Sysco will rid US Wixom of the terrible management when the acquisition is completely done. I have a soul and could never be as spineless as the hr and management I have worked with."
bad,Stray dogs are treated better than the employees at this place.
bad,"Nice place to work if you like to be on disability before you 50 . you going to work your butt off and be to tired to have any family time and when you take your 10 hrs off duty time you going to get just that 10 hrs. That's to drive home do any work around the house, eat, get ready for tomorrow (which give you about 6 hrs to sleep or less) get up in the morning get ready and drive to work . They route u any kind of way(lot of back tracking, delivering 20 miles off route only to finish up where you started) loading crew just throw stuff on the truck any kind of way (lot of time take 20 mins to find 2 cases) and to many people in office never driving a truck . and too much double working cause everyone else taking short cuts . truck also have camera no phone, drinking or eating you have to pull over and learn how to drive they think a 48 ft trailer can go any place to deliver"
bad,"If all is what you care about is money this place if for you. Negative atmosphere, horrible management, and bad hours."
bad,would not work there again and the workers that I work around didn't have anything good in the beginning to say. people that work on day shift seem more happier all depending were you work.
bad,"Was let go on 89th day of probation. Had a write up for wearing tennis shoes (due to blister on my foot the size of a golf ball from humping groceries up and down stairs all day) and one for smoking in the truck (well I'm a grown man, enough said). Never brought any stop back, no accidents, very happy customers. All I could figure is business was slowing because they were asking other drivers if they wanted to take a voluntary day off the last week I was there.Very bad experience,  seeing that I had a good job to take this one. Professional drivers be very careful because this is definetly a pattern with this company.they do pay well but believe me when I tell you, YOU WILL EARN IT"
bad,Was at one time a great place to work. New President brought in a culture of in fighting. There is no longer any team work with every member of staff striving for one goal....increased sales!!
bad,"worked for 16 years and management is TERRIBLE ,CUT THROAT,and management has no ETHICAL STAY A WAY"
bad,"I worked for a subsidiary company, Stockyards Meat. Ultimately SY will become just a brand. US FOODS cannibalized center of the plate business, and whole accounts. VERY inefficient for a custom cut meat house. Actually COULD NOT deliver certain accounts due to trucks being oversized for the street?! HR manager was a horror, with a dubious track record. Procurement moved like a duck in the mud. I never said ""I can't do it"", to customers so often, in any sales position. Vaunted CODE of CONDUCT was a joke at my location. COmpany is owned by private equity firm, and after massive re-branding is likely , and ultimately looking for a potential buyer."
bad,"Overworked, not fair and consistent with all employees, sales people are praised and others do the job, you have to suck up in order to move up. Management sucks you can't defend yourself or you are out the door. Anyone that works there will be micromanaged."
bad,The company pays good money. The benefits are top of charts. Advancing is very seldom. The management is worthless. Most of them are about the money and not the workers.
bad,"16 years and I finally couldn't take it anymore! Long hours no life , my family suffered to make sure company profited.. I regret that I stayed as long as I did.. wasn't always that way but seems to be the new normal.."
bad,They don‚Äôt know how to talk to team members an want u to do everyone else job an get mad when you can‚Äôt fully complete yours an they give overtime when they want to.
bad,Need to focus on sales and go after all of sysco accounts.We have lost the customer first attitude. With out our sales people we do not exist. We need to grow not go back words.
bad,It will be up to you to make it as positive as an experience as you can. Management is a poor quality it's severely under-qualified. Promotion and advancements are dependent upon social and family relationships.
bad,Management doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing they over work you 14hr 6 days a week!! Great pay with all the over time you get but not worth it. Get only 10hr to rest and back to it again!
bad,"They will work you hard as a probation until you want to quit will be dog out badly on the job , never have a Friday off until they feel like hiring you on."
bad,"We had to b there at 6 am everyday which was hard enough. Then everything we had to take off the truck was usually heavy. In the frozen section the boxes where twice as heavy, my bids was cool just didn't like people moving skiw or being late."
bad,wish i didn't join management  I worked 6 days a week and 10 to 12 hours days to keep my salary job. I was sick and had to be at work. good people in some places . expected to do the job or two people have been gone for a year and they still cant find my replacement
bad,Probably by far the most labor intensive job I had.To be an order selector in my opinion is like having a temporary job your body will last but so long before it breaks down
bad,had a great boss and great co-workers but corporate doesn't know how to do anything and screwed over the workers twice in two years by firing everyone both times.
bad,"Cut-throat among the employees. After multiple rounds of downsizing, many people had been moved into less desirable positions. Junior staff would try to get senior staff in trouble or fired in order to move back into their former positions. Staff meetings with management, whatever amount of work you did, it was the worst in the company. This company is in a protracted multi-year battle to rid itself of unions, so if you're in a unionized shop, they want you GONE. Pay and benefits were very good for the work we did, and that's why they got rid of us."
bad,"This is the least professional warehouse environment I have ever experienced. The management has absolutely no idea how to manage the staff, obstacles or peoples inefficiencies."
bad,This was one of the longest 3 and 1/2 years in my career as a food sales rep.   The upper management there was unbelievable rude and nasty.   You were just a number that was easily to be replaced.
bad,"There load are always wrong, there is always problem there, this place is a joke the are always on strike here so remember you don't get pay wen you are on strike,the union only give you 200 for that week , my truck uses more gas to get the."
bad,"No training, coworkers kept walking away when I had an question. One Manager didn't introduce himself. Very bad experience"
bad,"Arrive early morning hours,hook up tractor/trailor,pre-trip truck, and do proper paperwork...deliver food in a semi-truck most of the big cities on the east coast from Boston to NYC..got experience driving and backing up in big cities with very tight spaces..Management very hard to talk to your just a number..very high employee turn over rate,,co-workers are helpful and friendly just fed up with the operation of the company...hardest part is it's real physical work...alot of lifting,walking up and down a ramp numerous times to deliver with alot of heavy weight..The pay is pretty good and the benefits..Company's future is up in the air,us foods just got bought out by sysco..alot of drivers including myself are looking elsewhere for different employment.."
bad,"Upper management has no regard for the way nightshift employees are treated I've seen open racism, favoritism, retaliation and overall unfairness in regard to advancement and the supervisors are totally bias and cannot separate their personal feelings from the job."
bad,Production is to high to do 6 days a week  we are not machines we are humans who get tired. Your goals are not humane and should be re-evaluated . I believe this is why turn over is so high
bad,"This is a place to work if you love drama! Very crazy atmosphere to be in, supervisors were the worst, they were so unorganized. Good job, if you didn‚Äôt have the management so disrespectful to drivers, and so unprofessional. Great drivers at this site, but sorry, lazy management! A normal day at work is like being in a boxing ring with your eyes closed...YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR WHERE YOU WOULD GET HIT!"
bad,I wish I had never started my career at US Foods it started off really well was making more than normal pay. But after the new owners took office the company went downhill. They try to work you to death was very little time off. The supervisors were some of the meanest people you would ever know.Plymouth Mn
bad,Just note if a driver dont like u n the norcross location u outta there. They let the drivers control what u got goin on. We all got a CDL but if u ride with someone and they dont like u u are out dont waste yo time. Yo money in the hands of a driver just like u. Dont depend on they money I showed up Sunday whole route changed cause a co driver want me gone cant depend on them
bad,Terrible equipment!! Trucks and trailers constantly breaking down. Management is a complete joke! On call days are horrible! They expect you to eat sleep and dream US Foods
bad,"This is by far the worst employer I have ever had. Incredibly unorganized and due to the way things are run, the moral is extremely low. Employees are very negative and I see it as a direct reflection of how little upper management cares about doing things right. Employee concerns are covered up with a ""Bandaid"" such as serving cake and food every now and then."
bad,"I've been here for almost a decade, and it's never been fun or enjoyable. The inexperienced new management is the biggest problem. Since they don't have any clue, they'll try all the wrong things and make the same mistake over and over. Most people who come to work for this company, no matter which position, leave within their first year."
bad,"Get your truck in the morning not knowing what to expect, whether your tractors marker lights don't work or a favorite - the check engine light is on. There's always something wrong with their equipment. If you're lucky the warehouse guys will load your trailer the right way but that would be wishful thinking. It's only 4am and already stressed out so get ready for a dissasterous long humping, back breaking, 8 - 14 stops, were the heck am I going telling myself I love my job, living the dream bullcrap saying. Making sure you can finish your route in 14 hrs or less trying to save your 16hr day for later in the week, Friday preferably because it's pay day and on that day you work more than usual. Don't have a 16hr to spare, prepare yourself to stay overnight in a hotel then finish your route the following morning head back to the warehouse to pick up another trailer of unexpected suprisses. So when you finally get home, 10 hrs of rest and hello!! Doing the same back breaking, I think I can attitude, it could be worse. I hope today is going to be a good day... Yeah right"
bad,"as you can see on all job board sites, u.s. foods is desperate to hire in all areas. in the union environment, lower level management is always blaming the union for all the problems the company faces and since the upper level management disapproves of the union as well, they just believe what they are being told."
bad,It's a food facility that is below 40 degrees inside it's a place we're you have to check food for right temp it's a place for No advancement a place I wouldn't recommend to noone
bad,"Everyone there usually suffers a career changing injury,  many try to keep working, met many senior employees who didnt want to report injuries because they were afraid of the company."
bad,"When I started my career this was a fun company to work for.  After multiple ownership changes, a near merger with Sysco and the corporates offices insistence on centralizing everything this company is a shadow of it's former self."
bad,"Management very demanding.  This company has no regards for you and your family.  They give you vacation time & sick time, but if you are off all your work is there for you to complete plus what's currently due.  Emails are overwhelming and expected to be answer immediately.  A lot of work put upon your desk and every week their add more.  Cost/Item Analyst job is very demanding and stressful.  High turnover of employees."
bad,"Management will do as little as possible and will hold your job over your head everyday to get you to move faster. Management doesn't have a clue about the job at hand. Turn over rate is insane! Moral is all time low everyday! Alot of favoritism. Been here for 2 yrs and it has gotten 100% worse the second year!"
bad,"This place is not a ""career"" environment. The supervisors try to get over anyway they can. Your co-workers are all back stabbers and cry babies. They sit around watching what you're doing to find a way to create an angle for themselves.  For instance,  if you get a favorable assignment, they'll be asking questions and using what you say against you. "
bad,"The management at this place is AWFUL!  Unless you are one of the managers pets, you will be harassed daily.  The managers are ineffective and don't care what happens with moral as long as they get their bonuses.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU LIKE DRAMA"
bad,"There is no team work it's everyone for himself, some co-workers treat you like trash when ur first learning and if you have a family don't count on seeing them during the week with the long hours you'll be working but I can't lie the checks looked nice bit I was took tired to spend the money. You will never have fun which I think you should always have a little fun at work you a happy worker is a productive worker. The break times are a joke for the amount of time your on ur feet and lifting 50lbs continuously.  If you want to work here be a truck driver"
bad,70 hour weeks no time home. No rest. very disorganized in very physical if you don't have a family and want to work like a slave this the job for you. worst job I have ever been a apart of.
bad,"Stockyards cut shop turnover rate is at 70% because of Director treating employees like sub-humans. He is never held accountable and is aloud to do whatever he pleases with no repercussions ."
bad,"Management don't really care how long you have been with the company, when you leave the company you can forget about unemployment to help you out untill you find another job."
bad,"The supervior use to be the manager's gardener, no management skills what so ever. Didn't know what he was doing most of the time.The choice for supervisor was a bad one to say the least."
bad,Supervisors can never be found they hide who knows where 7 hours out of 10??? Instead of doing they're jobs they chase people around the warehouse like we're in a daycare... Instead of doing supervisor duties like making sure our inbound trucks make their schedules and getting control of the dock to keep us from working 55 hours a week... They are busy being very very petty...
bad,"Very busy and stressful. They expect a lot from their employees."
bad,"The managment is not good ,they will throw you under the bus as fast as they can ... they have no idea how busy it is , they just at their desk .. they dont help you , they just criticize you"
bad,"Bad upper management ruins what could really be a good place to work. Union's in the companies pocket. They'll take your dues, but when you need REAL support,.....sorry, it's not in their best interest. Warehouse is not designed safely for long term working environment. Rolling racks were taken out of the warehouse when redesigned to save the company $900,000 = more injuries from having to crawl / hunch-walk under shelving to pick. Co-workers are almost all great to work with, even supervisors not hard to get along with if you come to work ready to move, but management will kill your motivation. Great place to make quick money, especially from April to October, you'll be working so much you won't have time to spend it. Long term though, not so good."
bad,Management at usfood ces is terrible the place was stressful there ia always a turn around people never came to work you do your job and theirs it came to a point where you just did not want to be there it was like you was there just to get a pay check and go home a sad place to be
bad,Inept upper and middle management.  No chance for promotion.  Pay and benefits were good but atmosphere was not enjoyable.  Go to market strategy is wrong for regular businesses.
bad,"The managers are all morons who have little or no knowledge as to how to smoothly run a business. The only reason it is as successful as it is, is the drivers"
bad,"hard physical work, with almost impossible standards. Night shift. Very little time off. Not for anyone who enjoys spending time with their friends and family."
bad,"If you like working hard and getting little sleep US foods is the place to go. The pay is great and the benefits are excellent, but the don't care about your health or well being"
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone .. I was lied to from the time I interviewed to the time I walked out... promises were made and never kept.
bad,"Working here is always being stressed "
bad,"the place was very unsafe,too many accidents(some very gruesome) due to coworkers rushing to make their numbers,management did not care about the people"
bad,"The pay was great, benefits good, and management did there part. But then corporate got greedy, or at least that's how it felt, they made Alot of changes, lied about Alot of stuff and made a hard job harder and the hours longer if they would have kept everything the same I would have happily stayed and probably would have retired there. The job itself is physically demanding and the hours can be long but they made it all Alot worse"
bad,"Shady management plain and simple"
bad,"I have been with Us foods for over 5 years, the pay, the way they treat there employees the benefits the people and the warehouse in general where the best I had ever seen or worked for... In the beginning. In the last year or two things cant get worse, the management and HR department are terrible , the new incentive is a joke, for exempt if you select orders at 100% you make the top out wage I worked two years for, if you select at a 95% or lower you take a 6 DOLLAR pay cut for a month, if you select at a 130% you only gain 3 dollars, the tracking system for a miss pick or short on a order is a joke, they have no way of showing you where the mistake was made and what it comes down to is what the delivery driver says goes, the order timing is terrible, they went from a 2 pallet jack, to a 3 pallet jack so order size has doubled in most cases and the selection time was reduced. the atmosphere and moral is terrible and you could have a better time and be happier at a funeral . the only good thing I will take from this job is the friends I have made. in my opinion 75% of the selection crew is just trying to hold on to there jobs till the merger of company's is complete in hopes that things there will get better."
bad,Management is very inconsistant and treats people differently. You don't get anywhere unless you know someone
bad,This is the worst place i ever worked because of management this old lady in inventory  needs to retire omg she is stuck in time she has no respect for others she talks to  you like shes  some master  on some planantion back in the 1950 she needs to retire.i wouldnt recommend   anyone to work there.she needs to get up and help out she doesnt know the job .all she does is micro manage trying to tell you how long it takes u to do something  and she cant even do it
bad,The only thing good about us food as if now is the pay but they have bad management racism everybody is high off of something they work tou like a slave/ high school student taking a test if you dont work through lunch you won't meet their expectations and you will hey terminated no matter what
bad,"Centralized many departments compromising customer service, employee moral, and still asking for more sales with fewer help in accomplishing goals to get those sales. Very innovative corporation in the food industry just that Houston management not keeping up with the competition in servicing the business. Went from a sales force of over 60 to less than 20 in the 4th largest market in the US."
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've had. At any given time there will be mass buyer hirings because so many people leave. The buyer position is stripped down and costing and logistics get farmed out to other departments. This means multiple people have their hand in your order and problems quickly multiply, which is blamed on the buyer by default. Management is really, really terrible here. Senior buyer is useless, and our manager is clueless plus has multiple personalities. You never know which personality is in control that day when an issue comes up. No positive comments when things are going well, only bullying when there's an issue. I have a better relationship with the manager at the division and get much more guidance and positive feedback than my manager sitting five fee from me."
bad,"This job isn't worth the money, though the money is decent it doesn't match up to what is expected of an associate.  You WILL have back problems for the rest of your life if you work there more than a year!! I've seen new hires 18 Years of age require surgery on thier back after being there for less than a year and more than 90% of the work force there has had serious back issues. You will not have a life away from this job because all you will want to do on your days off is recover from the long hard and stressful workweek from trying to make your numbers. This job is good for those who don't have or care about family or there own physical being and just want to make money."
bad,I would not tell anyone about us food the work is very slow pace the travel time in the wenter isnt the grate so thats one reason I give us foods a two star over all.
bad,Corporate is out touch with the field. Managers are cut throat. The culture is racist. Sales does unethical methods to drive profit. Employees are afraid to speak up because when they do they are retaliated against. Pay is not fair between blacks and whites.
bad,Middle mgt hired with no food service experience.  Micro management top priority.  Failure to grasp challenges associated with market area and customer needs.
bad,Not a very family friendly company.  They expect you to work 14 + hour days.  Communication needs to improve.  Very high turn over rate.
bad,I have 13 Years Experience in the Beverage and Foodservice Industry's.
bad,"OMG! Where do I start!?!?"
bad,Worst job I ever had. Superviser was a corporate mush head.watch your back!
bad,It's hard to even say they are at best Mediocre.
bad,"Face paced, good pay, safe work environment, one on one training, job advancements, great benifts, 401k, great work environment, safety training, forklift training,"
bad,Job is great but the schedule will ruin relationships and you will lose almost all family time. You will make a lot of money but in the end it is not worth it.
bad,Never work there again. Over work the employees. Communication with employees stinks. Understaffed ninty percent of the time. Terrible hourly rate. Wouldn't work there again.
bad,"The job task instruction was not clear and getting the necessary data to complete the task.  When seek out to management for help, they seem to be too busy to assist.  Had to seek out information through other colleague who was willing to help."
bad,Expected to do as told no questions asked even if what you are being told is proven inefficient. Managers play favorites  while pretending they are there equally for everyone
bad,"middle management is a joke, they are under trained, don't value the employees. don't care about sales force , only bottom dollar, but dumb enough , to walk away from money, and opportunities, would work there as my career for the rest of my life, but middle manager was a clueless tool, who did not support the sales staff. what a shame!"
bad,"I worked as a temp. Promised temp to hire in 30 days. For a year and a half I worked multiple  positions and covered multiple people when they were absent.  I have more knowledge and more skills than the average full-time US foods worker.  Despite this I was let go because they were loosing more money then making, and they had to make cuts. I was giving no notice. No severance. No time to find something new.  I live paycheck to paycheck. This was sudden and devastating to me. I formed great relationships with the lower level workers and enjoyed my job. It seemed the one who made the decision for me to go is also the same person who has no clue what any of his workers do.(And who you NEVER see) Mistakes by the company are often repeated and never fixed. And managers and supervisors are constantly replaced or fired.  Which also explains why they can never get anything right because ideas are always conflicting  and contradicting.  I never got one paid sick day. I never got vacation time. I never received holiday pay. I was used,  and abused.  I was convenient because I would have cost more to hire as ‚Äúcompany‚Äù. So it was cheaper for them to hire me to do everyone‚Äôs job and never give me any benefits. I was there a year in a half and had no infractions. I was a respected worker.  Don‚Äôt work for US foods in Perth Amboy. Also spoiled food gets shipped right back out despite it being a health risk. Don‚Äôt even do business with US Foods in Perth Amboy."
bad,"If you have your class A but no experience, then this is the place for you. Other then that if you have a family or like to have a social life this is not the place for you."
bad,"horrible management, HR doesn't care about employees, tampered with my time. They have a stupid point system that they give you a point for even having a doctor's note!!! they said it wasn't valid bc the nurse signed it and not the doctor. I fractured my foot and i got in trouble for it!! They change up your schedule with out warning. The culture? What freaking culture."
bad,I worked there for 3 years and had a hard time with the culture. They are not very employee centric and do not properly compensate those that perform above average. Instead they pile on more work rather than holding others accountable for not doing their part.
bad,"Third rate foodservice company with difficulty hiring and keeping solid staff, either in the warehouse or in the front office setting.  This could be due to the extremely low salary levels compared to the amount of work required."
bad,"After several months of on going lay offs, and my work load tripled, no compensation what so ever. Management is just as bad,"
bad,Often met with many uphill battles. Can often overcome those battles by thinking outside the box. Management stuck in 1980. Top down approach no longer successful.
bad,"All street sales work at least 65-70 hour weeks without full week ends or holidays off (ever) as the minimum effort required to remain on the payroll, but only those favored by a select clique of ""leadership"" actually propel forward. Beware of those in power who for whatever personal bias will set you up to appear perfectly replaceable. At US Foods it's far more likely that your manager or your manager's manager or a more favored coworker is far more dangerous to your livelihood than any market competitor could ever be. It's a special combination of cut throat high school as far as street sales is concerned and not at all the warm supportive team selling model as presented to new hires. They are, however, one of the few broadliners that provide a base salary with a monthly expense stipend and the employee contribution to excellent health care is 1950's style negligible....which all does tend to be beside the point once you're positioned for disposal, so proceed with caution and ALWAYS have a backup job lined up."
bad,"The management really needs to be revamped. They spend so much time on hiring people for ""continuous improvement"" but are not working on improving the managers and their leadership."
bad,Union prohibited any advancement outside of the local Denver area. Working was fine but the company took care of the local / regional drivers in Denver. We were located outside of the Denver area and they didn't care if we worked there or not.
bad,"US Foods is going through a culture shift and it is hard to get along with the markets. The markets are very unprofessional and get away with this behavior. The company has a lack of standardization, which makes it confusing for new managers and buyers."
bad,"Customer satisfaction was a distant 2nd. Employee satisfaction did was a minimal 3rd place initiative. It was a, ‚Äúdo as I say‚Äù work environment. No onboarding or concrete direction given by manager."
bad,"If you apply for part time they give you like 60hrs a week. They want you to hit your productivity at least to 80 to 90 on your first week. They give new employees the worst equipment possible. You are racing against 40 other guys to meet your numbers, so insafe. Uniforms for the freezer they are in bad shape. Overall not worth the pay."
bad,Hostile working environment.  Associates jobs were always threatened.  Associates were forced to work in areas that they were not assigned to.  Managemet showed favortizm to certain employees.  But overall I enjoyed what I did and they gave me opportunies that others had applied for that were good employees and had been with the company longer.
bad,chaotic and negligent work force with poor  management and unsafe work conditions. People are paid based on the time they decide each order should be done in.the orders are all different and some people get better ones than others because management plays favorites with certain employees whom do not work harder than others in fact the selectors that make the most money here do the least amount of worrk even though they have the same responsibilities they get special tasks given by management solely on the fact that they are liked personally more than others.
bad,"If you're over 40, don't waste your time, they won't hire you."
bad,"Wasn‚Äôt paid overtime as crazy as that sounds but true. Fired after getting hurt while being on fmla. Not promoted because,‚Äù not coming to speak to management on a daily basis‚Äù. Written up fraudulently on numerous occasions. I was a stellar employee but treated as if unimportant to organization by management. Inaccurate accounting of payroll. Witness osha violations in meat room while there."
bad,"Its basically a third shift job there's no work on 1st shift. Do to all truck are out during deliveries.  So it's no way to work your way to any other shifts. Shop tools, software, and training is very limited."
bad,"US Foods management has been heavily influenced by those with a strong bias against older workers.  While drivers and warehouse workers are largely safe from mass-layoffs (except when a warehouse gets closed down, especially due to unionization), the IT folks take it on the neck every several years with a mass layoff of about half the huge IT staff, such as at the end of 2016 and early 2017. Many of the survivors get demoted a pay grade or two. Eventually they rehire some of the laid off staff but as ‚Äúnew employees‚Äù at a lower pay grade in another city but without relo. They also rely heavily on low-cost employees brought in from India in violation of the letter of federal immigration law."
bad,"They need anybody and everybody to work your 110% just to find find out you can't keep up. Turnover rate is rediculus. When I was hired at least 30 new people came in and half that were fired/resign in less than 3 months"
bad,"I worked overnight and you had to stay until everything was done, regardless of your set hours. Also, the shift before yours never cleans so you are left to clean up a mess that was from the prevoius shift. Not worth the extra pennies they pay you to freeze in the freezer."
bad,some people in the department I worked in liked to get involved in aspects that they should not have been involved with. If they don't like you they place false complaints with corporate about you.
bad,NIght shift hard work with no concern for work life balance. Order pickers pull product from slots on tripple jacks. Supervisors are responsible for auditing pallets and checking loads.
bad,I enjoyed my work place when I worked in NC. Once I transfer to Sc I didn‚Äôt like the work place. The environment wasn‚Äôt good.  It‚Äôs hard work.  Some people can handle it and some can‚Äôt. But if you work smart it will go well. It takes a lot of psychical strength.
bad,It was good pay but hard work.very physically demanding.make your based on how hard you work which is good.people were very easy to work with and good managers
bad,"toxic culture, no regard for work load management throws at subordinates, leadership doesn't promote healthy work environment. Leadership decided a few years ago to consolidate operations (reduce costs) by eliminating president, finance manager, buyer and many more roles once done by talented seasoned veterans at the local divisions  and moved most to region or HQ.   Loss of true talent hurting morale and numbers."
bad,"If you're young and no kids or family and ready to be cut throat to get to the top - great place to work. "
bad,"Started at 11 pm, drove a tractor trailer in the mountains delivering food products. delivered from 800 to 1000 packages. Very stressful and driving in the snow and ice was at sometimes very difficult. delivering products on 2 wheel carts which were very heavy and going up and down the skinny ramp and up and down stairs was very difficult"
bad,Management doesn't care about your problems. Do as your told or your written up. Everything goes by seniority low man is dirt. They want the job done but don't go over on hours. Don't get pulled over by DOT. And moving violations are yours to pay.
bad,"I feel management is very biased when it comes to certain people.  And they are very unprofessional in keeping up with time off requests and vacation requests.  management tend to try to sabatage their employees. There are 14 hour work days, very fast paced and not all employees do their part, many call offs, and other workers quitting because of such management"
bad,"I started working for this company in September 2015 as a temporary employee.  I have now been there for almost 2 years and want out.  The stress of the job of a collections assistant is a given, but for the last few months we have been over the top. Most companies I have worked for have the sales people release orders. In this position it is up to the collections assistants to release orders and apply all incoming checks. In addition, you have to send weekly statements to all customers, make collections calls, and send final demands for payment. Other employees find it necessary to make up stories to get others in trouble with management and make themselves look good. If a mistake is made they won't take responsibility and will attempt to lie their way out of it. There is no talking in our department unless it has to do with business and we can be called on the carpet even in those cases."
bad,As one of the distribution supervisors US Foods Norcross is by far one of the worst places I've ever worked for. They have no structure or control over the operation. The managers do not have any idea on how to run the entire operation. The VP of the building does not want the management to do what they need to do to keep the operation running to its full potential. The only thing i learned while being there was how to properly handle and ship food. The work place culture sucked. The hardest part of the job was getting up to come in to deal with incompetent individuals that were in higher positions. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the associates.
bad,Management very poor.  Just sit around running reports all day doing nothing. Promise customers the world and never come through. Dealing with strike issues with drivers and warehouse who are part of a union. Hoping your customers get their deliveries. All corporate driven.  Not what it used to be.
bad,"I worked for US Foods as a driver for almost 4 years. I started in Omaha, Ne and later transferred to Tampa, Fl. Omaha was a great location to work for. Management was organized and helpful. There was a strong team environment, as well as a driver's union. Then I transferred to Tampa, and got to see another side of the company. Horrible management, poor routing, no union which meant that management could play favorites and only assign the good routes and days off to their favorite employees. Pay was not the same either. It didn't measure up to the cost of living. Be careful which branch you work for, and make sure you are in a union."
bad,biggest mistake leaving MB to come to US foods. Money was good but not worth the hours and work load. Management was like being in a HS locker room.
bad,The company structure was mediocre at best. The territory management was not very supportive to analyze and resolve issues at hand. Most of the solutions were the salespersons analytical ability and keep the customer buying. Not very much support from the back end.
bad,"The whole time I worked here I felt very micro managed. They were writing drivers up for not being able to keep shirts tucked in after unloading 15000-20000 lbs of groceries with a two wheeler . They installed cameras in the truck that watch both the road and you at all times, which they insisted was ONLY for insurance purposes, but after 2 months of the cameras, they used it as a whipping post to punish their best drivers who never even had accidents. They drive you hard, after working all day to unload your trailer, you would have to go bail out other drivers who choose to not work as fast, (being punished for working hard). Management had no experience in driving a truck, but wanted to tell drivers how to and not to drive. Routers would not listen to your advice on how to run the route...they would do whatever their computers would tell them, and you would pay dearly for them not listening the next day on your route. Warehouse could not stack product where it needed to be. I was aways delivering damaged goods, and shorting customers on what they ordered because I couldn't find it.Pay was decent, but would never go back to work so hard for the average pay...would not recommend this job to anybody"
bad,i worked nites. my hours were 7pm to whenever the warehouse was done. i love all my co-workers got along with them. The hardest part of the job is there is poor communication. The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing I always get things done in a timely fashion so our customers are happy
bad,"Everyday is hectic & unpredictable."
bad,Company is VERY unorganized. Laws for Class A CDL holders are not followed.
bad,Watch this place go from a good place to work to being micro managed in there so called tranformation. When I first started with this company the night shift was great because of the people I worked with and the pay.
bad,"Undergoing changes that must have been thought up by a college freshman, Change the look the name but not really change the culture."
bad,"Long hours , six days a week and no family time till tou work there at least 2 years cause thats when your allowed to get and use your vacation time .."
bad,I was promised so many opportunities and none were fulfilled. A bunch of lies and lack of management skills. Watch out for certain employees as well. They spent money on things and didn‚Äôt even utilize them. They cut corners occasionally so watch out for that. Fake smiles and purposeless conversation is HEAVY!!!
bad,"Politics in the workplace are awful. Speaking up for your customers is frowned upon especially if you try to speak to transportation. VP had it out for me and she created an unattainable goal to meet. While most of the criteria was met I missed the mark and was fired even with great sales numbers. Lost several customers to transportation issues but ultimately the blame fell on me for losing business. Awful, awful, awful culture. Fired several co-workers who had devoted many years to shave of last quarter costs in order to make stock holders happy. It's not worth selling your soul to lie to your customers."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had they don‚Äôt tell you what time you work until 7pm and then call you in to tell you pull at 3:30 at 7 o clock at , night they tell you this ! On top of all that . They have no organization whatsoever non of the supervisors communicate with each other which means you have drivers running around with no idea what‚Äôs going on because the night supervisor has no common sense . They don‚Äôt care about sleep. They watch you like a hawk with location gps in your truck and drive cam . They rather write you up and yell about your scan rate than tell you anything else stay away from this place you will be miserable they pay good but it isn‚Äôt worth the headache they give you . You get pushed and pushed around like a piece of meat . If you like to be taken advantage of this is the job for you if you don‚Äôt . Want to have a life and be treated like a human being look elsewhere lol GOOD LUCK TO YOU!!!"
bad,"Night selector    "
bad,No respect for personal life/time. Mileage reimbursement is not good at all.  Always out of stuff at the warehouse.  No resources to go to when issues arise.
bad,"Poor place to work, long hours and if your salary no extra benefits for working 13 hours a day. Poor upper management. Crazy hours, Upper management does care about the ""little"" people making there big bonuses for them"
bad,"to work at this job you can not have a other life, your life is the job. also they want you to bend over backward just to make 500 a week and they dont care if you tired or hurt they still want you to come they have no understanding and if you have a problem or dislike someone just keep your mouth close because they will start to do anything to fired you"
bad,"Schedule would be Monday-Friday 8-5, then Sunday through Thursday 9-6. Only have Thanksgiving and Christmas Day off, have to work all other holidays unless they are on Saturday. Squeakiest wheel gets the oil type culture. Say they are big on promoting from within and continued to say ""hang in there"" when they would go with an outside hire."
bad,Was never told sales goals that needed to be met was terminated and could not be told why would not recommend working for this company because of this they are shady to say the least
bad,Started as a temp and loved my job. Company went through a reorganization - laying off the entire office staff with the exception of one. I gained that position full time - worst decision ever. management doesn't listen to those in the position rather than statistics. Mgmt is satellite and all communication is done via email or phone; doesn't realize the more time spent on email or phone with mgmt. is less time spent on work. Unrealistic deadlines. Workload for 1 person is 5 jobs in a standard work day. Mgmt didn't listen to suggestion on how to improve system/logistics. Repercussions were severe for mgmt never being on site and actually witnessing the issues.
bad,"Review customer status , make sure they're good standing."
bad,Dont work there unless you want to spend most of your time stressed and undervalued. No work-life balance. You barely have time to take lunches and breaks are nonexistent. Training is horrible. Management is a joke. Senior management has no idea or care about what goes on. Managers do not defend their employees. You're left to fend for yourself.
bad,"I was horrible, had bend low under shelves and stuff all on the floor to grab 50 -60lbs cans and who knows what else... not really willing to recommend anybody to US Foods"
bad,Very high paced.  Management doesn't know anything and does nothing to solve problems.   They push the older drivers to take on more work because the new drivers can't handle the job.  They baby the new drivers and kill the older drivers.
bad,"culture is not good, they say straight but if you do there will be retaliation, there is so much stress at this company. Moral is at a all time low. customer service is gone, upper management is horrible."
bad,"Confused Company or Confused Management or Confused Culture? "
bad,"Very unstable company at the time. "
bad,"the company is undergoing a paradigm shift, switching from an emphasis on food to an emphasis on value added services.  lots of turmoil in the process."
bad,"Business is changing quickly, needed a new challenge, company was ok, micro managed with many chiefs, brought great value to the company especially during the Sysco merge fiasco"
bad,"You start at 4 pm and are done when you're done, usually around 3:30 am. So you never get to spend time with your family or have the energy to enjoy what little time you get."
bad,"all driver management is too close. their are very arrogant, treating employees unfairly without worry of recourse because they are all friends. mark huntsman has allowed a bullying atmosphere to exist. driver management team should be broken up and moved or fired to bring in new people that treat others as co-workers vs servants."
bad,"US Foods is in major transition. "
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for! This may be solely associated with the warehouse I work out of, but there seems to be a common theme across the board. I was told I would be working either 4-10hr days or 5-8hr days during my interview. Management failed to exclaim that on your ""days off"" you will be forced a route and have to work, making it a 6 day work week at 12-14hrs per day. All they care about is that you get your 10 hours off and you show up, to the minute, when that time has elapsed. If you have a family or value your sanity, don't work here....it's a joke!"
bad,Management lacking skills needed to build and maintain a strong team and work atmosphere. My co-workers worked well together but due to management we were never given the credit deserved nor encouraged to grow within the company.
bad,"Extremely poor regional management more worried about placement of blame than problem solving."
bad,"Work until you are done job. Management is horrible, severely under qualified and very negative. Employees are descent people. hardest part of job was dealing with management. Best part of job was leaving."
bad,"I enjoy pulling orders, but the managers made the job joyless. I was given an occurrence when I had to go home for having torn a hole in my boot on a pallet. I didn't want to be put in a situation where I could get injured for having insufficient PPE, but my managers insisted I work, I had to tell them I wasn't going to put myself at risk for having torn a hole in my boot, they thought I should continue working rather than them being concerned about my safety in the first place. In which case, if you're a good manager, rule #1 would be how can I keep my fellow employees safe. That situation turned me away from the job, and I quit soon after."
bad,"there were 3 people doing the same job all full time employees.  there was not enough work for the 3 of us combined to be busy for a full 40 hours a week.  "
bad,"Unsure what the bosses get paid to do as the employees run rampant breaking rules daily without punishment. Major favoritism is shown towards people the bosses are more friendly with ignoring which workers actually deserve credit. No law or order on the warehouse floors as the bosses find their offices much too comfy. With that being said drama is typically at a high with the blame game always being very prominent. These things can only be said about this location but if they did a random drug test, maybe a handful would remain. I've witnessed many drug deals in the parking lots from cocaine to marijuana. If you can keep to yourself and take anything thrown at you for long unknown hours, the job does pay well for what it is."
bad,"They do not load trucks properly, which causes you to touch freight several times daily. Then they scold you for it. This company is ran like a joke. They lie about unions to keep them out. They cut your days and hours. Definitely not a place to retire if you want to walk the rest of your life."
bad,"The Lakeland Division is closing it's doors on 08.01.15 due to lack of customer base allowing our sister divisions, Pt Orange and Tampa to absorb the remaining customers we have."
bad,"exec mgmt team all transplants, w/no realistic picture of northeast market...very impatient, massive micromanaging..."
bad,"Good opportunity, however were biased to some cultural differences that individuals had."
bad,"So the pay at US Foods is decent but very hard to understand because they do not make it clear at the Charolette office  I am paid $.215 per box that I touch  40% per pallet of a pallet drop. Attendance pay, mileage pay, stop pay, and incidental pay. The management is the WORST!!! First off all they care about is the deliver is made and that is all. They have no communication skills at all and communicate nothing.They do not care about driver safety at all. The equipment is sub par because their motto is run it till it dies. There is no clear organizational structure at all. The have what‚Äôs called truck shorts, basically if something is missing from your truck they take the money from your check without investigation or anything. If you get them to investigate they say if the warehouse says it left you basically stole it."
bad,"There is a lack of management, no accountability, no ownership, a crisis in leadership since they bring their friends to work for the company and not the type of leaders that are needed."
bad,"Us Foods is all about what you make it! Just a physical job to work at. If you like hard work and heavy lifting, it might be the right job for you! Just watch your back in all aspects, no matter what!"
bad,"Schedule is very hard "
bad,US foods is a place for ppl who don‚Äôt have a life and don‚Äôt care about how many hours they work a week . Working here sucks and they give job openings to their friend or someone close to them at the company not an applicable person who applied. They will stick you at a job and expect you to do everyone else‚Äôs job too. Night shift don‚Äôt get the same holidays off like first shift and overall you never know what time you‚Äôre getting off. And it‚Äôs full of drug heads don‚Äôt work there
bad,Good mix of people being placed with consistent change. Too many objectives that are not allowed to work through before they are changed for an alternative objective. Not enough time in the day or week to fulfill expectations.
bad,They think that people are robots and should be able to work at an extremely fast pace for 10-12 hrs. Don't be surprised if you're asked to work on off days. Managers want for you to do things that they aren't willing to do themselves.
bad,"This is a joke of an establishment, who refuse to pay their employees. As a newly onboarded Territory Manager I was promised 6 figures after commission. They lie. More than a year with this company and saw not a dime of commission dollars even after growing the business significantly. I worked with a terrible district manager who had no idea what he was doing. In fact most of his team members made a mockery of him and called him the longest standing idiot at US Foods. Others in the company never received a dime of commission until after their 2nd - 3rd year in the position. If you're a salesmen with experience and not just a chef looking to leave the grill...this isn't the job for you."
bad,Working at US Foods in sales grinds you down over time. The demands of weekend 24-7 on call does not allow for truly unwinding on weekends. This is a tough place to work in sales.
bad,No real advancement in technology or updated business practices. Most seem very ‚Äúcatty‚Äù and very few put care into their work. Pay is good but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
bad,PLEASE DONT WORK HERE EVERYONE TRYING TO LEAVE THIS PLACE. All they care about is moving at fast pace. Your back will be so messed up. You will have back pain and muscles locking up. Management is horrible but the HR is a good person.
bad,"Don't bother they have the good ole boy system. Terrible management in place, doesn't listen to drivers, and has terrible business practices. Fire upper management"
bad,"need to hire better management. never let you finish a job, always trying to make you look stupid. people that work there are very unfriendly and always trying to start trouble"
bad,"fast paced environment with little room for advancement, poor management and long hours. little to no focus on the safety of the employees or the cleanliness of the warehouse"
bad,Really hard work.  Limited people in some buildings since company went to a different set up with a lot less support for the non-hub companies.  Numbers focused company since it started being publicly traded.
bad,"The place was a revolving door. I must have seen 20-30 people in the accounting department come and go in my short time there.  Management was cold and distant and everyone just seemed out of touch with each other, not a team."
bad,The management team in the beginning was really good and then new managers were brought in from other locations that were liars and cut throat and were only out for them selves.
bad,"My boss was loved by VP (even though VP moved this person from under them). Manager could do no wrong as the VP kept protecting this person and moving them laterally within the company. Favorites are a big part of hiring, promoting, and bonuses. If you're not willing to blow smoke then head for the hills."
bad,"You work a lot, and they take money away from you. The management gives you a lap top and says go get em.  Upper management says they need certain things accomplished but your direct manager does NOTHING to help you."
bad,"No support by management to further your career or training.  My peers were great to work with.  I liked what I did, but the role was not supported by the company."
bad,Would not work there.  Not supportive. All about who you know and what you can do for them.  Lots of buddy buddy system.  You get the feeling that you are not important. They just the job done.
bad,US Foods is a food service company that sells all products that pertain to restaurants and hotels.  They deliver products to all establishments in a geographic region.
bad,I have been with US Foods for about 18 years and the company has sold 3 times. Made it hard having to adjust to new rules on how the company worked as far as the buying part that I was involved in. Some companies you could no longer purchase from all had to be bought from specific company mandated companies. Only certain trucking companies could be used. Getting answers to questions from management became more difficult. I feel managements hands were tied in too many situations
bad,They have a great culture in place but they do not practice what they preach.  No advancement for women with the current management in place in Los Angeles.
bad,I enjoyed the challenges of my job and US Foods.  It took a while to get use to the workplace culture but it challenged me to grow.  I gained valuable experience in helping with recruiting.
bad,"fast paced high stressed job. Sometimes it would be fun but not to often"
bad,Very stressful to work for.  Many employees appear to be dissatisfied with the changes being made and are in fear of losing their positons.  Nothing else to add
bad,Corporate is making bad decisions regarding every aspect of the company.  Not a good place to work now.  They are losing a lot of good employees.  hopefully they will go back to buying in the divisions.
bad,Not a bad place to work promotions can be very politically driven and an employee has to be in certain circles to move forward. With all of the changes since the SYSCO by out fell through things have taken a turn for the worse.
bad,This job is very demanding altogether. Very physical and taxing on the body. Very hard to have a balance in life and work. The work schedule is very unstable.
bad,"There is a high amount of the buddy system in the management area. Also, with working with food the sick leave is not up to par. Sick employees are forced to come in or be pointed and fired"
bad,"They pay very well and have some nice perks (employee purchasing opportunities; meals, etc) but the culture and work itself is quite depressing.  Your day could be 6 hours or 12+ hours... depending on the orders and how many ppl show up that day. This can makes things difficult if you have young kids and getting them up for school the next day, as everyone here works night shift to start. "
bad,I will not recommend US Foods as a good working place. The only way you get promoted is if you are someones favorite it is not based on contribution to company
bad,"the job of shuttle driver is easy, but being watched by camera's all the time, I.E.  if you are on camera taking a sip of water while driving a truck you will be written up, work very unpredictable hours, lack of communication from managers and really no training, kinda  do it own your own, pay is ok, but it is not worth the what you have to put up with, there are many more jobs that pay better and are more worker friendly and have stable hours"
bad,Very understaffed and over worked. Department of 7 people to handle over 400 accounts. We are required to work 6 day work weeks due to lack of staffing. There are very few opportunities for growth or career advancement
bad,"I know everyone says favoritism is a part of every workplace, but I've seen certain individuals ""get away with murder""  By this I mean costing the company tens of thousand of dollars in damages to equipment and others who seem to do as they please and cost the company just as much in stolen wages and wasted resources.  "
bad,"The old VP of sales was not bad but the new one that they have now is terrible and could care less about the TM just produce your numbers period. Don't ask for help or support because you won't get it, if you don't figure it out on your own you will sink here fast. As far as family life ""forget it"" you won't have any."
bad,Deliver all good that was loaded on the truck. learned what kind of manager I didn't want to be. Management never had the time for you. Co-workers were divided never a smiling face in the co. Having to spend the night in a hotel when you didn't finish your route and getting up to do it again. there was nothing enjoyable about this job. 
bad,Company pays well although there is no support or guidance from upper management. The environment is one of finger pointing and back stabbing to get ahead.Supervisors instruct one way to resolve issues and get the job done all the while knowing upper management wants something different just to place blame on you and keep their position safe.
bad,"We communicate with Sales Reps about what customers to communicate with daily. We then contact the customers and discuss their menu and the products we have available in stock or warehouse. I have learned alot about the food industry, different food items, equipment, and menus."
bad,"a typical day starts with you getting on a forklift for 8-9 hours running around crawling under shelf's in a hot warehouse, or a freezing warehouse with temp as low as 0 degrees. you have nothing to do but to grab boxes and confirm it with a low quality voice recognition soft wear( pretend your on automation calls, with no push button option)."
bad,"Thoughtless management with no concern for employee health or safety. Complete disregards to any requests from employees. Management is very unprofessional via telephone, constant cursing and frequent hanging up abruptly."
bad,Company is going through reorganization. They are concentrating positions.
bad,"they do nothing for your safety"
bad,"used to be a great place to work."
bad,"Great company if you are of the majority. Everyone else is under appreciated and disposable at the whim of underwhelming and untrained managers. If you are liked you will be promoted without skills or experience. Culture says ""Talk Straight"" but I watch everyone that ""Talks Straight"" get ""Walked Straight"" out the door."
bad,"Changes are made rapidly with little to little notice or clear directions. This company relies heavy on emailing, little person to person contact with out department."
bad,Good pay however the management is unfair to employees. They will send you home if work is slow. At times management will call at the last minute to let you know not to come in work but your already in route to work. Very inconsiderate
bad,"The culture and management needs an overhaul."
bad,"If all you're interested in is making money then this is the place for you, the only upside to this company is its benefits and its pay this job will leave you with no work-life balance and they don't really care. "
bad,"They will fire you on the drop of a hat , they lie and tell people you have 90 days to catch on but truth be you better catch on asap if you don't want management calling you in the office telling you they gonna fire you . The lead will just look at you not give you any feedback on how you are doing till its to late . Labatt food service is a much smaller company but in work values they suppass these lying backstabbers by miles and Im greatful I do not have to work for that night manager in Buda Texas no more . If you are thinking about working for this place catch on your first week and believe no one about a 90 day limit its a white lie to get people on . they fire loyal people over stupid things then the ones that quit and abandon them they love and keep . Labatt food service is miles ahead in company values then this company ."
bad,"Little room for advancement, Poor management, Long hrs, poor schedules, don't expect 2 consecutive days off until you've been there at least 3 years. Night supervisor is practically useless and doesn't know how a warehouse functions."
bad,"This company used to value employees,but now all they want to do is find you doing something wrong so they can write you up or fire you. The pay is ok,but it could be better. You need overtime to make a good living. Management is so bad at US Foods. They want to over manage everything. They won‚Äôt listen to the driver who knows what the customer needs. Don‚Äôt work here if you want to have a good job."
bad,The bottom line is management has a buddy system.some people get away with murder. And hard workers don‚Äôt get 2nd chances.its sad.wish the union would have won to keep the management in check
bad,"High pressure to process and analyze checks and payments. Typical work day was monitored by clock management and soft skill process. Management was great, but the expectation was too much."
bad,Not for the weak. Only the strong can pass probation and then end up working 6 days a week while senior drivers enjoy 4 days on 3 off. Senior drivers are whynie cry babies and always complain about how much work they have to do.
bad,US Foods struggles mightily from a culture stand point.  There is a massive void of leadership from the top down.  If a culture of support and true leadership is established then the sky is the limit for this company
bad,Areas we deliver are just dangerous sometimes.  The weight of the product we have to drag up and down stairs makes is ridiculous.  I have over 10 years in and now that I am stuck financially I can say it was the worst mistake of my life taking this job.
bad,Worst accident and injury location to work for.  management did not provide porper training or supported supervisors when it was needed.  too busy   too much going weong then good.   cunstomer complaints  damged product.
bad,I would suggest it for the young ones who are single and the ones who want to save money . I would suggest working atleast  2 to 4 years  and get out and make a carrer move.
bad,US Foods could be a great place to work but the company is it's own worst enemy. Because they are both publicly traded and private equity owned most decision revolve around stock price and not overall long term growth of company. As a result the company is constantly trying to reinvent itself and this leads to cycles of mass hiring and mass firing.
bad,"when i started with this company it was great, after many changes in management the down home feeling of family went away quickly. I would still be there if not for there lying to employees and telling them just wait...."
bad,"Union environment terrible ,  employees work harder finding ways out of work."
bad,"Management there SUCKED. Never experienced such snake behavior. They promote Buyer IIs to be managers, less the management training needed to get the job done. The environment is great, but the behavior from the upper ups makes everything fade to black. You can easily work 12 hours a day, with no overtime pay bc you are salaried as a buyer."
bad,Oppressive work environment with very poor management.  Management was high pressure and made promises but did not deliver. It seemed like some employees were favored over others.
bad,Management was not helpful in providing the tools needed to be successful.  Many people were promoted that did not have the Creditionals or skills to be promoted.
bad,"I believe US. Foods could be a positive company to work for but based on my experience in the Seabrook facility, I could not recommend the company to a friend. The management team has made many cuts of long term associates and then struggled to find experienced replacements. There seems to be no strategy to build a cohesive team."
bad,"Pressure of meeting sales goals. Unrealistic goals, little coaching. weak manager. Excessive reports and paperwork with constant monitoring. Managers often time are not qualifies for the role."
bad,"it was a job, people were nice, we had some sale meetings and nice lunches. nice people and good food overall okay to work in this environment. it was temp"
bad,"The culture is toxic.  It is a ""look out for yourself"" company where nobody takes responsibility for their actions, or lack of action.  Compensation is fair but the commission structure is always changing and impossible to totally understand."
bad,very challenging job with US Foods in their healthcare division.  Worked with several different types of healthcare groups in US and learned skills on Computrician Program and dealing with several different diets levels in menu development.
bad,"supervisors are lazy and ignorant, expectations are far too high, system is broken and you're still expected to preform at a certain percentage despite not having enough time to do so, and there's a lot of favoritism"
bad,"Go by ""what have you done for me lately philosophy for management, even if you have been a positive influence to culture and bottom line for several years. Promote positive employee engagement yet do not "" practice what you preach"" when it comes to hourly employees, primarily drivers..."
bad,Typical corporate America job that was very competitive and stressful environment.  Not much room for advancement and management did not place much value on staff and employees.
bad,Temporary Position- I was only there a short time. I was commuting from Rocky Mount to Zebulon. The compensation was not inline with the cost of my commute
bad,"Responsible for daily maintenance teams tasks and equipment maintenance. Be aware of all expenses and track. Responsible for contractors work tasks. Define building improvements, secure bids and schedule time frames for completion. Manage expenses of approx $600,000 per month. Little support for managers and supervisors. Culture in building very negative and many long term employees leaving. The employees I manage are a great team and have been the most important part for me. Most are long tenured employees that I personally hired and have a great relationship with."
bad,The corporate culture didn't materialize in offices outside IL. Was employed very short time before entire department was laid off. Corporate office didn't invest in new computer systems.
bad,"Work directly with suppliers/Vendors for best cost and quality of goods on all of our fresh produce. Using that information and those relationships to grow gross profit and case sales while reducing the spoilage number. "
bad,"This job is physically demanding with long hours.  My first 3 weeks i dropped 15 pounds and my body was constantly in pain, but after about a month and some experience you will get use to it.  Typical night starts at 6pm and will end no earlier than 3am on a good night, but typically expect to be there until 5am. There are nights especially Sundays and Thursadys you can expect to be home anywhere from 6am to 7am.  One benefit of this is the amount of over-time you will receive which helps when it comes to making good money.  Without the over time you would not make much money here.  The pay rate at this warehouse starts at $15.45/hr and after 6 months IF you make the union it goes up $2.00.  At this warehouse you hit top pay in 5 years which is around $24.00/hr.  Some of the senior selectors make up to $65,000 a year so there is potential for good money if your are up for the hard work.  Payday here is on Thursday and is biweekly with the option of direct deposit or check and benefits dont start until you make union.  Before you make union you will work Sunday through Friday, but friday is only a few hours and once you make union Fridays will no longer be mandatory. Your expected performance at this location in order to make union is 100% which in my opinion is not obtainable due to the size of the warehouse, the number of employees that crowd the aisles when you are picking and management and in order to make union you will be a probationary employee for 6 months before you can be considered.  On your 3rd week you are expected to maintain a 50% performance rate and then every"
bad,Interesting place to work. meet different people along the way. Friendly place to work. Never a day the same. Would still like to work there if it was possible.
bad,"Management is out of touch terrible training in the chef store .stealing,favoritism, fraternizing with the staff . the experience was good and bad staff was great management was terrible"
bad,great money but that's it management was bad didn't know anything old out of date equipment just get prouct off truck routing was bad then let you go right before your probation is up an bring in the next crew of people don't waste your time here
bad,"Trying to get some large account for them while I was there."
bad,"Some drivers are ok, most don't care about their job or the happiness of the customer. Customer service is not a huge priority to the company. No college education required to be a manager. Sales force is of no help."
bad,its a great company to work for. benefits are great and management is some what fair. The hardest part of the job is you never know what time your getting off of work.
bad,"The pay is good but not even worth what they put you through. Will take a dedicated, hard, honest, happy worker and put them through he$& and turn them miserable. Your body will be put through he$&, working long hours, coming home exhausted not even able to focus on your family by the time you're home. Things like telling you that you're vacation was approved then 3 days before you leave telling you nevermind. Warehouse needs to get there stuff together, routing is horrible. Theyll tell you to go in for your shift at 3 am and not even leave the plant till 6:30 due to warehouse being so slow then the bosses yell at you that you're behind when THEY got you out of the plant 3 and a half hours late. Happened atleast twice a week. Upper management could not care any less. If you need to talk to them it takes forever and they don't take care of it, they dont care about a single employee it's just about money to them. They don't hesitate to fire anyone, not even a write up just fired. Got out of the truck to figure out which door the owner of a restaurant wanted me to deliver to, got back in backed the truck up (all while in a parking lot) to that door. 3 months later was called in to the officed and fired for not putting seat belt back on just to back up 150 feet.  Had NO idea just left cut and dry with no warning, two weeks before my baby was due. All around the job isn't worth putting yourself or your family through."
bad,My day would usually start around 4 am and i would not get home until about 630pm and would have to wait up until about 9-10pm to call and find out what time i had to be back at work the next day. No home life and hardly and sleep
bad,They need to go public or sell. The investment banking company have owned the longer than expected. Work life balance does not exist.
bad,"There is no way i would recommend this place to anyone.  They pigeon hole you into a position and don't let you move up.  The training is terrible and almost non existent.  Fire people without trying to teach them,"
bad,"We started work at 5:00am and finished around 3-4:00pm! We worked at a fast pace which made our center one of the top leaders in production (manpower verses product handling). We stocked product for nighttime warehouse selectors. We stored all inbound freight into warehouse racking using laser scanners for location. We swept and picked up trash over large warehouse areas. The quotas were  set at a very high rate which created unsafe working conditions. The management was always concerned with the bottom dollar and disciplinary action whenever someone got injured or something got damaged or inventory was inaccurate. Management always expected quality to maintain at high levels even though they constantly cut manpower and pay! There was not a very good incentive system in place! The bonus system was based on safety but any accident of any kind between the transportation department or warehouse department severely crippled any bonus for each individual employee. The management team did not have people skills and treated employees as a number and much less as a person. They weren't interested in ideas or solutions to problems until  the almighty bottom dollar went belly up! This could have been prevented if only more time, care, and money was invested in the employee! It was no surprise to we, the employees, that our center cut its own throat and closed its doors for good in 2014. Companies should be concerned about their bottom dollar but if they really care about it there should always be a strong commitment to the company's first customer and that is its own employees! Otherwise,"
bad,"I enjoyed going to work at US Food.  I loved my job and had a good relationship with my co-workers. Throughout my employement, I learned how to be patient, expeciallay when it came to management change.  I learned how to adapt to different job. "
bad,"The manager I had was cranky and short sighted.  The pay was low, and moral was low."
bad,Work 8 hrs. a day with no overtime. Break down machines and put it back together. Operator 4 machines every night. 
bad,Pull orders all day and clean up.Learned a lot about customers wants and dislikes. Management too wasn't to helpful. Worked well with co-workers they helped me out a lot. The hardest part was that i could never spend holiday with my family because all the holidays were taken by employees with more seniority. The freedom of working on my own.
bad,"Good starting pay at 18.50 hr. Partimer is expected to work 10.5 hour shifts plus mandatory overtime, sometimes twelve hours plus a night. You are also required to work fours day, sometimes five. Very high turn over rate. Nothing but negative energy when you first start. Employees aren't friendly to you, they feel why get to know you when you might not last long. Management tells you right off the bat, people don't make it one, two, or three days. The longest most last is two weeks. This is a red flag, why tell people that? That's why they can't keep people. They become intimidated right away and quit. Union teamsters local 120, the most corrupt union and local. You can't sign up for direct deposit until after ninety days probation. Another red flag. Weekly pay, good benefits only if you get fulltime. Management and human resource are useless, even the hr lady didn't know, or claimed she didn't know when you can sign up for direct deposit. Come on human resource didn't know this. Very physical work. They fire you if you don't keep up your percentage rate. Cant fall below 85%. Top out pay 25.00 hr for picker, warehouse. If you have a life, family look for something better. Money isn't everything. If you like working your but off, no life, family, and like money then this is for you. My opinion look for something better."
bad,Do not for work for this company they are liars and sneaky im not going to say I'm that innocent but IL tell ya the truth in may 2012 i had a small incident involving property damage and if they would have suspended or fired me within a week i would have chalked it up as a mess up and moved on instead they said nothing they have a review board when somebody has an accident with safety and your peers to discuss it your supposed to be there or on conference call they did it in the middle of my work day and didn't tell me till a week later then they tell you about pay for performance LIE! yea if you can pick your own root what they don't tell you is that if you have pickups or customers not open or ant extra stuff or generally get delayed its bad you make no money so be careful its a joke now back to the accident i went to work in august .....august is said and when i get there the boss who conveniently drove 300 miles was there and handed me my termination papers WITHOUT WARNING
bad,"The work itself will keep anyone's interest.  The culture is constantly discussed however lacks consistency behind the talk. Very fast paced environment, challenging day to day work with flexible work schedules to fit employee needs."
bad,I mean hands down the job wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if they really cared more about the workers than the work the company need more help so that we could eliminate the long outrageous hrs we work
bad,"Over the years, US Foods has become quite the salt mine, steeped in nepotism, and office politics.  Beware of automation & RIFs via attrition in 2019+"
bad,Seabrook NH is the most messed up US food Hub in the company! If your a good driver then they slam you and if your a slow driver then you get less work and actually get paid more because it‚Äôs hourly.
bad,"I worked at US Foods for 5 years, and at first I loved it there. After about year 2, they started to tighten up on production, at the cost of employee safety. The orders grew larger, and the time given to complete the orders shrank. There was no work/life balance there, and upper management, was extremely untrustworthy. The only positive thing about the company, was the pay/benefits, and that was thanks to the Teamsters Union."
bad,"Co workers are great, The entire management department needs to be replaced ( transportation department at the flowood,Ms are the worst of the worst) the Jackson division period is the worst"
bad,Working at US foods was a harsh experience. Lifting cases above the OSHA weight alone and having to be incredibly fast at it. Morale is always low there.
bad,"Operating electric pallet jack picking orders"
bad,Dont look to make a career out of working there. It is a cut throat company from top to bottom. If they mess up your hours you would have to fight hard to get the money they owe you.
bad,"Beware of what you say and who you say it to. Products are superior. Distribution out of warehouse is less than desirable, and product availability do to inbound freight struggles to keep its customers supplied."
bad,Good for a little while to make some money but takes a toll on your body quickly.  Do not stay long if you intend to not live your life in constant pain
bad,Tough work with long hours.  Poor management. They micromanage by following you around and watching the drivecam.  The decent pay and 4 day work week is about the only thing that keeps you there. Work all holidays.  You start $2 less than everyone the first two years
bad,"Had the opportunity to improve my skills on the following platforms: IBM mainframe, Tandem O/S and A/S 400. Typically we monitor systems and record program time data, monitor autogenerated trouble tickets for completion and create tickets, when necessary, contact next level support if needed. I enjoy the staff that I work with. We work well together as a team."
bad,"Not a bad company to work for, until about mid-2012.  Apparently (from my experience inside the company and from news reports) this was the time that their upper management decided to sell the company, and they started laying off and downsizing.  People with decades of experience were let go, fired or cowed into leaving.  (I remember seeing three receptionists come and go and one vice president fired--none voluntarily--in less than 1-1/2 years.)  Before this, it was a very pleasant company to work for."
bad,The atmosphere is awful; the VP of OPs can't be trusted says one thing and 5 minutes later does another.  the division is currently short staffed and he does nothing to fix it.
bad,"Their promises regarding compensation fall very short of reality. Even when in the group of top performers, you can make much less than those in middle to bottom given that incentives are based on growth. Slow and steady wins the race. Management positions employees to succeed. This position is as much about selling yourself internally as it is external sales. There is a serious sexist culture in this region. Good old boys club until somethings change at the top locally."
bad,Whenever a problem came about we used the chain of command to try and get it fixed. Problem with that was that you had to track down 4 different supervisors to get an answer. also when you let one know the others had no clue to why they weren't told. lack of communication.
bad,"If you stick it out over a year it could be a decent place to work. Money was great, benefits are good. Very early morning starts or late night starts. If you're lucky you won't be switched between nights and days weekly. Schedules are tough to have a home life with."
bad,"At the headquarters location, you will not get promoted into a director and above position unless you are connected to someone on the executive team through previous employment in Canada at Loblaw.  There is a culture of external hiring rather than any promotion or internal development, which is extremely discouraging."
bad,Lots of turmoil and constantly reorganizing.  Some good people to work with but many that have been there too long and don't react to change well.  Pay is good.
bad,My experience was being moved around between freezer and dry and not trained. They rather fire and keep hiring new people and keep the cycle going. They will fire you even if you‚Äôre at 99% with no write up or anything just will fire you out of the blue. Very disorganized they don‚Äôt even have a night manager. Pay is good but stay far away if you‚Äôre a hard worker interested in job security
bad,over seeing the day to day activities is a fun part of this company. I learned a lot from my co-workers. the hardest part is keeping up with accounts receivable as sometimes people fall behind on their account. Management helps out a lot with your a/r
bad,"You will spend a majority of your time breaking down pallets looking for cases you need that's all the way at the bottom and even on the backside. Just to get one case you need. Warehouse has no structure. You may have stops 1-4 on one pallet and your first stop be on the bottom. It's stressful and aggravating. Us foods has no successful system for building pallets for Us drivers. They should make warehouse workers ride with the delivery guys so they see how much harder they make our day when they build our pallets so horribly. Then our ""dry"" pallet will be so messed up you most certainly always have to break it down and find places to put the cases just to get maybe 2-3 things you'll need."
bad,"This was a wonderful culture and a great place to work until they went public.  Multiple reorganization efforts make the future uncertain and many things have fallen through the cracks.   The new structure does not work and we are losing good employees and good customers as a result."
bad,"Poor management and toxic culture.  I would not recommend this company at all. The company seems to be growing but the management isn't equipped to plan that growth.  It is all ""guessing"".  The climate is very unstable.  You can feel it.  Unfortunate."
bad,"Transition period, they want to go on line with customers. Loosing the human factor. Many products need to be special ordered, not in stock and available to customers for next day ship."
bad,Hard work but it work if your looking for a job stability their is none one day you may work their the nexts you may not .No route your first year your all over the places some of the stop shouldnt have a tractor their but they send you any way and if you end up having accident they want to take your safety bonus for you
bad,Very organized very small I feel that need to relocate way too much for eight and one spot it'd be jam-packed two one no one can get their orders in on time
bad,"Generally good intentions, however perception on what employees do is often very far off the closer you get to the top.  There are a number of leaders who treat employees with very little respect.  The problem is some of them are within 2 levels of the top.  Not very motivating if your leaders are rude or disrespectful people."
bad,I have never worked for a more Toxic Work Environment. It is unfortunate that a company of this size still can't pull it together and hold the management team accountable for the high turnover and EXTREMELY low Employee Promoter Score ratings each of us provide.
bad,"ive worked as a selector for about 5.5 years now. this by far, is one of the toughest environments ive worked in. 8 hours a night 5 nights a week is normal and still pretty tough for a selector. however, if you plan on working here, you'll be working 11-12 hours a night EVERY night. im on my 2nd week here and my body feels like i got hit with a train. "
bad,"All pay rates on the the incentive scale used to be obtainable.  This was from 100 percent to 125 in 5 percent increments.  One recent year our raise was shifted and distributed throughout the incentive scales which then ranged from 101 to 146 percent.  Our initial argument was that these rates couldn't be reached in each department for the week so it was like we didn't get a raise.  However, some very enduring workers, including myself were able to reach this numbers for a week's average."
bad,"The people are great, the corporate windmill however is in full control and dictates everything.  Directly before, during, and even after Sysco's failed acquisition of USF, the company got in it's own head and got away from what they had done so well, and that is treating their people with respect and appreciation.  Took me leaving to realize just how bad it was.  Gave me my opportunity and am grateful, but never looking back.  A shame too, because it use to be a company many people envied."
bad,Upon arriving to work at your scheduled dispatch time be prepared to wait upwards of 3 hours for your day to begin. If you aren't one of managements favorite 5-10 drivers then you better do everything by the book because you will not be treated the same and they will write you up for violation of company policy.
bad,if you work hard you'll get paid good. You start at the evening and there's no telling what time your leaving. you'll be around your co-workers more than your family
bad,"If you're a cashier, that's all you do.  If the higher up management is having a bad day, so will everyone else.  Shift leaders are great once that one who refused to give breaks got fired.  Coworkers can be catty, but what do you expect from mostly female cashiers."
bad,"They made the same mistakes week after week, month after month. The skids were picked anyway the pickers wanted. It did not matter if stop 2 was under stops 3,4,5,6,7,or 8. It did not matter to management. As long as it got on the truck it was now the drivers problem."
bad,Liked working with the people and good pay. Management need to communicate with each other. Old equipment needs to be replaced because it was dangerous. The hardest part was getting product from the third level of certain pick slots and breathing in bacteria from trailers that have not been cleaned out. Worked long hours during the summer and holidays.
bad,"Mode of operation for the time I spent with the company was in constant fire-fighting mode due to a poor culture of entitlements lacking accountability and responsibility, heavy management turnover (due to sub-par leadership skills allowed to exist for many years) resulting in non-stop service level challenges to our customers."
bad,Too many backstabbers who will not let an outsider succeed.Vp and warehouse manager micro- manage and are never wrong or willing to listen.
bad,"I worked at Phoenix tax department and the management is awful. The evaluation is based on if they like you or not, but not on the work products. Turnover rate is very high because people play politics and the management does nothing to improve it."
bad,"A typical office environment.Daily work was opening up drivers route bags, ordering office supplies, veriying that all cash receipts are in drivers bag."
bad,"The warehouse environment is so grey. Work pace is to busy to properly train new hires, your easily forgettable. 9 to 12 hours per day of laborious work. It‚Äôs rushed as your timed by the headset. Most people seem to stay for the money, of which you only make if your orders are error free & you move your a** all shift. It‚Äôs not enjoyable enough for myself so I‚Äôm looking for something else."
bad,"Bad management, talks about drivers in the office. Equipment always breaks down, drivers are treated like it was our fault. Swing driver until 1-2 yrs"
bad,They are not what they claim. Not employee friendly in certain departments. The best part about that job are the other empolyees you meet and work with. Some management is ok.
bad,"Great Cultural Beliefs. "
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 plus years, with my experience as a chef and having a sales background I didn‚Äôt care for the culture and management style the company implemented. The job balanced out work and family life. There were several situations with sales support for products and on time deliveries."
bad,They wanted me to work faster. I was only there two months and they expected me as fast as other drivers.I would come back with trailers empty meaning I would finish all the stops...but not enough for them to keep pass my probation..great retirement union pention..great pay rate..trucks have cameras cant use head set..zero tolerance...
bad,"The company is concerned for achieving their goals, sometimes with a 'the ends justify the means' mentality. "
bad,"No joke hardest job I ever had most money I ever made too though, if you can get good at it and you have to do that quickly they don't play, but I will say this management was as fair as can be expected after all they have people to answer to and have to get results. If they would just give people a little more time to adjust to the job I believe the turnover would go down significantly. If you want to make some good money give it a go and if you get good. YOU DA MAN! PROPS TO ALL THE GUYS WHO BEEN AT IT 1 YR OR MORE."
bad,Does not help people that they claim they want to hire permanently but does not help you suceed.  Needs to learn how to be more helpful for people they want to hire and stop being lazy.   I did enjoy working for the company
bad,Place does not care about you at all. you are just a number there and they don‚Äôt care about customers or the food they receive.truth will come out one day.great place and environment and equipment.management is only issues.so many unhappy people there
bad,"Hard work and long hours by yourself and the company really doesn't care about u long as u get the work done..."
bad,"No respect from the management to the employees."
bad,"If you are looking for a fast paced, in  your face type of job, this is where you should work.  Depending on your job description, a typical day consists of work and more work.  It helps the day go by fast but in some cases, you get overwhelmed and underappreciated."
bad,Nights are fast paced with constant movement. The pay is good compensation for the work you are required to output but not the b.s. and lack of management.
bad,don't even apply for this company if you want to enjoy life.This place would make you work like a robot. expect to work at least more than 10 hours in a shift.
bad,Pretty stressful job. Workers are not treated fairly and no room for advancement if you work in production! Reconsider before you apply to work at this place!
bad,"When I left Sysco to work at US foods, a week later an announcment was made that they were being acquired by Sysco my former employer for 12 years."
bad,"US Foods will likely be a good place to work in a few years when they work the kinks out of their restructure.  Company went public and is re-vamping every aspect of their organization.  Their goal is to be like Amazon.  Which would be very hard to do with food distribution.  "
bad,"Management at US Foods was just like the management at IMV Nevada. General manager and his shift foremen all have the same attitude. They reactive not proactive. They would yell at employees, instigate problems and point fingers."
bad,Stressful.  Went from 60 plus reps to under 20 in two years.  Relying on technology to replace sales reps. Do have stocks and good benefits.  Constant truck break downs and out of stocks
bad,"Very high stress, with little work life balance. Nice benefits, room for growth, but overall job satisfaction is low. More often then not, you'll find yourself working at least 10 hours per day at the office.  "
bad,"The only good thing about this job is the chance to make money, thats it. They treat their warehouse workers terrible. The union is 1 of the worst that i know of, if even considered a union. The union's motto is ""just sign off on your discipline sheets regardless if warranted or not"" and we will fight it later down the road. Never question the buisness agent about where the dues go!! The company disolves positions whenever they want without a fight from the union. Majority of the supervisors are former employees who couldn't pick enough pieces per hour and made supervisors who then turn around and try to tell the pickers how it should be done."
bad,"A very impersonable place to work.  The upper, some are huge liars and backstabbers.  So glad not to work there anymore!  Would not recommend this to anybody.You are just a number."
bad,"My experience wasn't so good here. Very minimal training for a job like this. I learned almost everything the hard way. The worst part is the length of the shifts. They tell you it's 8 to 10 hour shifts but it's usually at least 10 hours. They don't give you very much time to do each order, so you must work very fast. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Long hours and incompetent managers. The good supervisors are overworked and under appreciated. This division is WEAK at the top!!! (People making big money to Direct the division don't have a CLUE!) "
bad,gave 14 years with little or no appreciation poor staff bad supervisors  no discipline or follow up on procedures that were not being followed
bad,"Change is relavent to all companies, but this organization just can not  find it identity. Overall financial week, and reactive Management."
bad,"Very hard work,pays well but you earn every penny,at the end of the day your body is totally spent,you learn Patients,because dealing with management,and unruly customers"
bad,"Learned about how to operate ""my"" own business. Was able to develop lasting relationships."
bad,"They lie to you about the type of training you will receive. I hired in for long distance driver and while in training was put out on a local route by myself with very little training. They will fire you at the drop of a hat. Benefits and pay are very good, but you will work your guts out. Be prepared to unload 700 - 1200 cases of stock each day with a two wheeler."
bad,if they like you they like you if they don't you will get all the heart orders and work harder than everybody else for your money. They like to play favorites
bad,The warehouse and drivers are great people to work with. They will provide advice and criticism where needed.  The problem is upper management. They have zero clue of what it take to do the job and will retaliate against you on a whim
bad,Ok pay. Production is spiteful w/ picking orders. Holding labels while steering and grabbing cases. Systems. Jacks. and headsets are 15 yrs behind. Can't be lazy working here. Must work super hard all shift to get your numbers. No time given for wrapping pallets. Grabbing split products. Heavy items in top slots for back breaking opportunity. Must go back to get shorts on every trip. Special orders for special people to keep their numbers up. Pallet setter for quick pick up and go action. Bad pic path
bad,Long hours good pay and benefits nightshift is long hours company follows guild lines for the care of products. Safe place to work. Must be wiling to work holidays
bad,Entras a las 4am y sales reci√©n hacer ruta a las 7 u 8am llegando tarde a las rutas quedando mal con los clientes  y sin helper en trabajos de dos personas haciendo m√°s dif√≠cil el trabajo
bad,"Very hard work poor management.equipment old. Nice drivers lounge but you can't sit in there very long , had to keep eye for green light at dock door.. decent pay"
bad,"The pay is competitive, but the management and warehouse needs vast improvement. Long hours and low appreciation toward drivers. Good time off and fairly flexible if you have years put in."
bad,There is no growth here. You walk in the door making the same amount of money a person that's been here 20/30 years. So I can't understand why you would be here so many years. Management isn't in favor of the shuttle drivers. They put you in some of the worst equipment/unsafe. They expect you to take this messed up equipment that isn't safe to drive to get it fixed.
bad,Good money bad management and un realistic requirements be prepaired to work extream overnight hours and work like you've only been there for 1 hour even though your pushing 12 possibly more
bad,"US. Foods is a decent company to work for, Far and beyond better than PFG. At least this branch but while the compensation and benefits are good the transportation department is not. transpiration manager is extremely incompetent and not qualified for his position. Neither is anybody else in that transportation department for that matter. Why is it at PFG and Sysco it is mandatory that all supervisors in transportation must have been drivers at one point. Big picture is glooming over US. Foods head they are several billion dollars in debt and the company has changed hands a couple of times in recent years. Big time buyout from Sysco is coming."
bad,"no I was there and then I left, I thought it was a great move I was wrong.I moved on and thought that i could make something better, I was close i'm still working on it! I have been in the food service business, my entire adult life!"
bad,"Very stressful job environment. Due to continual ""restructuring"", there are not enough people to get the job done."
bad,Why do I have to review my current job. I am not happy and that's it. Too many changes of jobs and no one knows what to do. Horrible place to work and horrible benefits.
bad,A typical day is overwhelming for the most part things are not organized it makes the job difficult to complete. I learned how to work with and socialize with a lot of people. Management is okay but seems to show favoritism with the employees. The job is pretty simple but the way the management runs things makes it hard for the selectors. The most enjoyable part is you work alone and you don't have to worry about supervisor standing over you while doing your job. Another thing i like is we on production and everyone gets paid different according to what that individual does their self.
bad,the job was good and Use to be Fair Employment Growth. now its all about who you know and not what you know. Its sad but true. I have been there 15 years and I have been passed on promotions. there is no loyalty from the people running the operations. The company is a good company. people running it is not.
bad,Management has no idea what goes on in the day-to-day lives of their employees. When employees attempt to tell management anything that goes on they are not taken seriously and are merely patted on the head and sent on. Middle management is ineffective and useless. Policies change on a weekly basis and are changed by people that do not utilize the policies with no input by the employees who actually DO use the policies. There is no request for employee feedback or input. Poor employee behavior is rewarded by taking away work from those employees and heaping it on to those employees that actually DO their work. Morale is terrible.
bad,"It‚Äôs an entry level job. Essentially, if you enjoy sitting all day, and being an assistant, this is the job for you. Whenever the district managers need something, that‚Äôs when they will talk to you. Otherwise, you‚Äôll never hear from them. As mentioned, you‚Äôre an office assistant."
bad,"The position i worked in was completely horrible from the way they start your training up until the end of your 90 day training phase. People would follow you around, tell you to do something a certain way, and then completely mess you up by doing it a different way. Time to complete tasks were WAY too fast-paced: you could hardly ever get them done on time. overall not a great company to work for, just good pay and benefits."
bad,Too much micro management.Lots of time spent doing tasks at night and on the weekends keeping people from spending time with family and friends.Lots of compliance.
bad,The good pay/benefits are fair but you need to constantly be moving @ break neck speed. The impossible is asked all day every day. No coasting whatsoever. Physical ailments WILL pop up eventually.
bad,"The work is not that hard. Just unloading groceries in a timed environment. Equipment is junk however. Out of 16 tractors on the yard, only one was less than 3 years old and it was the only one road worthy. During orientation, transportation preaches an entirely different way of operations than what actually happens on the yard. The ramp door on every trailer I used would not stay closed. The ramps require most of the wasted energy of the day. Hand trucks were junk. Every load I got would have turned over pallets. Product for one stop would always be in the wrong spot on pallet. Supervisor rode with me first 3 days and we got detoured off of the interstate due to a wreck and he made me work through my break to meet time schedule only to write me up my first day on my own due to clocking out for my break 4 minutes late. Upon receiving my first paycheck, they lied about what they were going to pay me during orientation and cut me entirely out of a day's pay. My first day after orientation, I rode with a gentleman(a really good dude) and I was driving the truck and when we hit a bump, the air horn stuck and would not stop blowing, which was really embarrassing and funny too. I lasted only 2 weeks here and it wasn't due to the work. I have worked for another grocery company before and they were gold compared to this place. If you like BS, this is the place for you!!"
bad,Great benefits but wages were not fair. Management was so sad the turn over ratio was ridiculous because of the management. Didn't care much about employees just wanted you to be out on the road no matter what. The work was not to hard.The co worker were nice the ones that stayed around.
bad,The job offers great benefits and the position is great as well. However the company is not organized at the time and management lacks affective communication.
bad,"We go in and everything is a mess, we have to clean up after the previous shift. 1st shift has a set time in and set time out where 2nd shift does not. 1st and 2nd shift don't seem to work well together, they lack respect and communication with each other.There is no shift premium, no bonuses, they do what's called high 5s but I've never seen anyone in QA get one or heard of them getting one, you never know if you'll be working the weekend until the day before or day of, and there is no double time even if you work 7 days continuously on. You're there until the job is done which could be midnight or 4am depending on what job you're doing and where you're assigned. Management seems to be more worried about quantity as opposed to quality and the wear and tear on their people. Turn over rates are high, temperatures are around 36-40 degrees throughout the plant floor. Management claims to want to help you grow within the company but fail to set you up to succeed, and then give you a poor review which in turn means you aren't eligible for a raise. The hardest part of the job is not knowing when you're going to go home to your family, sub par pay, not consistent wage increases, always short handed, overworked, and under appreciated. The majority of the people you work with are friendly and work well together. If it wasn't for the management, inconsistencies, and the constant lies/drama, it wouldn't be a bad place to work."
bad,Different standards for some employees over others. Lack of communication between drivers and mangement. Health benefits are fair. Routing is chaos no direction by the day.
bad,"They seem to always promote the ones that kiss the managers rings the most. You can be the best sale rep and never move up as they just want to use you as long as you allow them"
bad,"A typical day at work would include: having a pre shift meeting around 6, get pallet jack and 3 pallets, go to office and get orders and start selecting. The job itself is not that bad if you work smart. Use your legs and not your back. In my opinion, what makes the job unenjoyable is the people. Most people working there are between 25 and 35, but most people act like children. Everyone is two faced and trying to get everyone else in trouble in order to benefit themselves. People are petty. It's like working at a daycare center. Management is pretty laid back. If you show up every day and try your best, you will be respected. The hardest part of the job is the goal times for each order. Most goal times are unfair. This job is designed for a robot. Yet the productivity standard was set in place by someone who has never picked cases in their life. The pay and benefits are great. Pay day is by far the most enjoyable part of the job. If you're single and wanting to make some money, this is for you. If family time matters, you should not apply.  The job security is unlimited, It's as great as that of a nurse or doctor. People are always going to need food, and US. Foods is the second largest food distributor in the country. Excessive overtime can come without notice. All it takes is for a hand full of people to quit and /or get fired and you're pretty much guaranteed a 12 hour shift."
bad,This job sucks long hours and days and if u live an hour away u only get 8 hours off never enough time off between home and life and you work 12 to 16 hours a day
bad,Overall it is a good company to work for. Several long term employees that align company standards with personal standards. I would recommend to a seasoned veteran that has a tech background
bad,"For a while, I really enjoyed working at USF.  But over time, I really didn't appreciate being passed over for promotions by new and younger hires.  My attitude went south after that."
bad,"Good company to work for.  The people are the best part of the job, they have wonderful staff of buyers.  I would have stayed but, I just needed to be closer to home."
bad,Overall the work is plausible. Its just the management is very poor. They show discrimination between workers.  Coworkers are good helpful people to work with.
bad,"Everybody does everything so nobody is good or great at anything.  Great example of mediocrity as the standard of operations.  Understaffed constantly with high turnover.  The clients were friendly but frustrated about out of stock items.  This was do to poor scheduling, misguided priorities, and poor communication.  Could be a great operation with a more modern approach to leadership and team building."
bad,"Great work life balance and compensation"
bad,I learned a lot while I was there: dealing with people in general. They have a primitive technology. Some co-workers are unwilling to learn a new way to be productive. Communication disparages from top to bottom.
bad,"I liked my job I enjoyed working with coworkers"
bad,"Great Company, but in the process of a merger. The company is in the midst of a buy out by competidor Sysco and alothough the company is focused to pervail, the uncertainty is difficult."
bad,"a typical day at us food tampa is always to expect to work unbelievably hard to get that 100% as a selector. there system is messed up where you can throw 2000 cases for a night and your fellow coworker 1500 cases a night and could end up with a higher percent than you. management in the night are horrible they will tell you that there to help you succeed thats not true ,they dont really value there employees, very unorganize. co workers were great to work with but extremly low morals due to very poor management and pay deduction from mispicks and left in slots they cant prove. the hardest part of the job is keeping your job! turn over rate is very high due to unrealistic selection goal times making extremely hard for you to keep your percentage above 100%. the enjoyable part of the job is the pay check thats what kept me holding on"
bad,"I know everyone below says the pay is good, and maybe it is for Missouri , But it is mediocre at best comparing to the warehouses in Illinois and twice as much work."
bad,"Nice people, but it is hard to provide customer service when your delivery trucks are 3-5 hours late on a daily basis. I learned how to overcome obstacles and resistance, and developed a thick skin for sure working there. The best part of the job is working with customers on a daily basis. The hardest part was fixing the companies mistakes while trying to open new business."
bad,"Answering calls,scheduling appointments. Filing and assisting DR."
bad,"Very stressful environment..must work six days a week.you must be out the door in twenty minutes prior to your route,company didn't have electrical pallet jacks available."
bad,worked long hours selecting orders onto pallet jacks or cherry pickers in freezer or cooler enviroment....good pay but long hard hours hard on your body
bad,"Developed business strategy to meet changing needs of clientele. Hired, trained, and supervised staff. Eventually expanded business to include a farm in Leogane, which supplied chicken for supermarket, in successful cost-cutting endeavor"
bad,They basically use you until you either leave or get written up and fired. Wont refer anyone to go. Tough job but easy to lose .. pays good money tho worth the headache? I dont think so
bad,Poor communication between offices in the company. Run the driver way to hard to keep on schedule. My fellow drivers were great. We all worked as a team to get the job done.
bad,US Foods was an overall good company to work for with the exception of how often they would change up their system and management team. I was taught how to use a system called VOXWARE which made selecting my ordders much easier. They had a great staff yet unfriendly management. I enjoyed the reasonable work days that were provided for all employees and the great compensation and benefits that were received.
bad,many ppl were getting hurt. work many hours little home time. 6 days of work. only Sunday off. drivers are great management unorganized at times
bad,It was a ok experience I liked it at first but down the line it was hard to manage my life and job at the same time. I would go back if I had that opportunity
good,"It took almost two months for the company to sign "
good,Call hrs were 24/7 no schedule for work it was work no home time and long hrs . Management was a joke always throwing drivers in unsafe situations......
good,"Us foods operates as a company who developed their employee benefits in the early 1900's. They are stuck in the stone age along with their methods of leadership and management. Would never recommend this company to a friend because they only care about profitability, the company could care less about the employees who work there."
good,USFOODS  is always looking for ways to fire employees so they won't have to pay benefits or give pay raises. They are changing company policies every few months to keep employees on edge.
good,Worked there 14 years and the job wasn't bad what made it difficult was the management. Some supervisors were good but when i worked the the warehouse manager was vindictive and if you wasn't in his click you'd have a target on you. The company itself wasn't all that bad though.
good,This place has terrible communication and they will throw you straight to San Francisco your first week on your own management is horrible and doesnt care at all about the drivers just as long as the route gets done and you never know where your going or what your doing this place is a joke stay away.
good,Way too much stress and hard work. Good pay but they're always looking for ways to take money from your check. You WILL consistently wait on paperwork. 1-2-3 hour delays. Constantly short on help.
good,"Great place to learn the business."
good,"The job was ok.  It has its ups and downs.  you have to have the right supervisor that believes in their employees to advance."
good,Very long work hours contribute to poor work life Balance. Productivity standards are challenging but obtainable. Pay and Benefits are very compentative.
good,"CEO - Fantastic"
good,"Each CSR was given accounts to handle. I was given 400 and no help. Management too busy helping others who has less work. No availability to move up, because I could apply but never choosen."
good,"Loved the job & work.  Pay was terrible & no compensation for the increased work load, which always happened.  It's the type of place where you do all the work & management takes all the credit.  All the ""Big Wigs"" are friends of friends from the ""local tavern"" & if you don't fit in that mold, forget it!  Oh, and not to mention that management is more concerned with their in office randevu's, that if the fling of the week says me or you type of deal, you end of fired.  Otherwise, great place to work!"
good,"Typical day at work."
good,"COLD, very, very,very COLD the ppl were great the hours could have been better, but all in all it was too COLD!!"
good,"I worked there as a contractor during their migration process. The processes were sound along with their execution. The only thing I did not like is that they want you to work overtime but they do not want to pay. The IT Team was pretty cool but there were two people that worked there that were two faced. However, some of the people what work there are good people but a lot of them get their feelings hurt over anything and everything and then they make you life a miserable."
good,There is no room for advancement with the company for certain groups. Working conditions are not favorable to having a good work/life balance and the schedule is horrible.
good,"From the beginning of the day to the end, it felt there was no time to breathe, it was constantly busy.  Felt like wall street environment with everything changing and moving continuously for which you had to stay on top of.  Time management was the biggest takeaway from this job in the sense of how to tackle each day the best you could but needing to deliver before you left."
good,"Fast pace workplace,everything you do there is timed,not enough time to complete orders  they only care about productivity but not about the employees being overworked"
good,"In my role and dept, they will work you to death without any pay incentives or be appreciated for the work successfully completed.  This is a very specific foodservice role in the industry."
good,I loved working for this company for many years.  I was able to advance and learn in my career. The last few years when Pietro took over everything went down hill for employees.  They went public and achieved their goals. I just couldn't do everything that was asked of me anymore. A better offer came along and I jumped on it.
good,"You will never move up in this company, management don't care about anything besides your numbers."
good,great company but management could be better. It is a fast pace environment with a real team work atmosphere it just get crowded with the workflow. 
good,When I first got hired everything was good then 2 years later the mess begin.
good,Long hour very competitive got to be be willing to work hard to make end I wish is wasn‚Äôt production pay rate it take a lot to be at 100 percent for the week
good,I would recommend US foods a few years ago but not now. The Only thing I like about us foods is the pay of course and my co workers. The management is ok I guess
good,Until they lay you off it is an ok place to work. Some jobs have stability but have a glass ceiling others you may move up and find yourself out of a job.
good,I had to carve out a new territory in a very rural area of NE Tennessee and SE KY. I would put 200 miles on my car on Thurs. I was constantly hunting for new business or trying to undercut the competition. It was difficult being one of the only women sales reps. I didn't feel taken seriously.
good,"Very fast paced, shooting from the hip most of the day. Very difficult as a supervisor working with very strong union. Driver fource cared more about how much money they make than servicing customer."
good,"I enjoy being employed at usfoods  however the management team is absolutely horrible at caring about the wellbeing of the hired help. Its very ""cut throat"" and if you are not the kind of person that will side with the managers thoughts and suggest a better way of completing a task, you will be shunned and belittled by your immediate coworkers,my manager is very good at manipulating the help to create a hostile work enviroment."
good,"You have to see for yourself as everyone experience is different. And, different time and different people so things might have changed. Not comment.."
good,"Only way to advance? Be a member of The Good Ol' Boys. Smoke, drink, take drugs or play sports with the bosses? You are definitely on the fast track to management!"
good,Very long work hours contribute to poor work life Balance. Productivity standards are challenging but obtainable. Poor cooperation between department. Pay and Benefits arevery compentative.
good,"Management tries to work you like a dog mean while they will try to pay you as little as possible by taking money from your check for every item you make a mistake on. You can go from making 25 dollars an hour to making 11 dollars an hour all because out of 2500 items you select, you miss one."
good,Well it a good company but there very strict on the time on the orders they don't wanna fix the time so it a good company but u have to work threw it breaks and lunch so u could hit the percentage
good,The supervisors pick favorites and if you are not a favorite you are treated bad. They did not offer any benefits and is so they were not clearly explained.
good,Money is great. All the OT you can handle.  But be prepaired to deal with a lot. Old equipment.  Horrible routing. Poor management. And a high turn over rate.   But overall I give them a C-. This job ain't got everyone. Its a 60 hour a week workout plan lol. Cases can weigh 100 pounds. And they come in dozens sometimes. Especially BBQ spots. Once again if money is your motivation it's the place to be. But it's rough on your body.
good,this company allow negativity to thrive throughout the company. They allow people to create lies to cover themselves and get rid of the ones that rumors are about. There is more talking and not enough working that is why the productivity is always behind.
good,A typical day would be servicing the customers by placing food orders. I have learned how to run reports. Management was bearable. Co-workers were just like family. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able to grow. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationship I build with my customers.
good,not a good environment overworked workers hardest job of company should have been paid more management is inconsiderate of personal problems spend all your life i that warehouse
good,"Overall, the people at USF Montgomery Division are good people. Corporate is undergoing a restructure and my future is uncertain."
good,10 key (Take) food orders from multi fast food restaraunts. take care customers needs and complaint resolutions. co workers good.
good,"I feel that overall the company is not a bad place to work ,"
good,"The management doesn't listen to its employees that are seeing the customer on a daily basis. They promote safety and a caring, positive ""yes"" attitude but the follow through and the way they treat you is with a ""no"" attitude. Some managers try and others just don't care. They coddle the night warehouse crew by begging them to come in on Sunday's and during major sporting events. They raffle off gaming systems and bribe the crew with a bonus for them to split, just for showing up. They can't seem to get simple things right, like getting the pickers to not put 200 pounds of flour on top of chips. I've been here 3 years and they have promised change. I have yet to see it, other than uniform changes."
good,"Wouldn't recommend to anyone, unless you're very thick-skinned, or don't mind being passed over for a chance to advance because you're not part of a clique. More I spoke up about the bullying I received, the higher on the s‚àöœÄt list I rose. Never told why I was fired, no ""progressive discipline""  prior to termination. Can't improve when you don't know you're doing wrong."
good,UsFood was an ok job but trying to balance out my everyday life that includes kids was hard to do . The turn over rate was at an all time high and the hours got longer and longer .
good,"work 7 days a week including holidays, vacations and weekends.  they tell you what you are doing wrong but do not tell you how to fix it.  There is no support system nor do you have anyway to find it on your own.  they want you at work at 7 AM and they do not want you going home until after 5 pm.  Never get a lunch because there is too much work to do.  It is not work where you will make more money it is work to keep your current clients happy.  No opportunity for growth.  The people that are there the longest get all of the new account opportunities"
good,"You work 2nd shift "
good,My experience here has been good and bad the good is you have a job the bad is you can worked extra hard and it all gets looked over..watch your money
good,"Don't expect much, they sunk alot of money into their hiring process. It will look great, You'll get hired then you will begin work, then you will hate it. For one Job titles (except supervisor) don't mean anything, and their payroll scheme for certain positions is dangerous (making co-workers prone to violence since you can easily make someone loose money, and risk serious workplace hazards for the sake of speed). You will have 4 different narcissists training you, each telling you to ignore what the last has shown you, co-workers barking obscenities of every kind, there are more supervisor positions than they actually need, and They can't make up their minds on what time you start day each day."
good,"If their standards were not as high then I would love every minute, but since their standards make you over work yourself daily I am looking for employment elsewhere."
good,Na the job was very intense with poor training.  Under paid an poor benefits the union at the location I was at did back you and you needed them no room for upgrade
good,"Good money but you are never home, very long hours.  Warehouse always loading your truck wrong/backwards.  Made delivery stops hard locating the supplies."
good,"Its great if you don‚Äôt have a family and your okay being treated lesser than. Not female friendly so you have to work twice as hard as the men to get the same respect. Union is pretty bad but not as bad as the management there so it‚Äôs needed. Kiss as much as managements butts as you can tolerate, if you don‚Äôt you will be targeted. The union keeps you from getting fired but the management knows their way around it. A lot of illegal activity happens there from hr, the sups, and president, it‚Äôs hard to ignore especially when it affects your money, but, just stay out of it and focus on making the best out of it."
good,"Nepotism at it's best. There are a lot of families that work within the company.  The training provided was not well suited for the job position.  When shadowing employees you were advised to forget everything that you were taught. Once on the floor it became evident why. There are so many ambiguities and gray areas.  Management is not involved with the learning process and not always willing to assist. Often times there were members of the team teaching management about the job functions.  I was initially excited about all of the talk about the corporate culture and company mission and values but saw very little of that in the day to day. For a company to have been in business as long as they have they were also very antiquated in the policies, some technologies, operations and procedures."
good,"Competitive compensation, plus an annual bonus based on both company and employee performance which usually turns out well. "
good,Grow or be fired. To many good old boy people! And no development.  Must do thing that will effect you morals to make numbers.  Not in the best interest of the customer
good,Usfoods was a job that is more essential for a single person. I does not provide a flexible or manageable time in witch you can schedule family time. Its a time consuming job that does not cater for family oriented person.
good,You are pressured to do long work days with questionable equipment. Management doesn't care about work/life balance. Coworkers would rather see you fail than be supportive.
good,"Micromanagement, Micromanagement, Micromanagement...No team building, No encouragement, No positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement. The Pay is good, but after a year it isn't enough to stay. You get 2 weeks vacation and don't advance to 3 weeks until year 5!!"
good,Management is great. Supervisors are bullies. An advantage is being able to work on my own. The downside is supervisors do not care about family life and use DOT hours to their advantage.
good,"Due to the centralization process they have undergone, there are few jobs left at the division level.  The workload left on those employees has left them with heavy workloads and long hours.  It may be better for those individuals that would like to relocate to the headquarters in Rosemont."
good,"USF is overall a great company.  The canadan ceo that was there was kind of terrible.  Most divisions are great however the Montgomery/ NWFL div is sick.  They have a clic of managers and if you are out of that clic, you are screwed."
good,"Extremely competitive"
good,"work experience all depended on the manager whom you report to, unfortunately there are a few managers who did not know the first thing about managing people. They are good with their work but could not manage people. Some think small and are not true leaders."
good,"If you don't want a life not the place for you. Very hard work, strenuous on the body long long shifts. Staff is usually short so makes for alot of work."
good,"There is no typical day at work.  This can be either good or bad in a sense where there is always a new and exciting product to learn about and sell, however there is always an issue that needs to be resolved. "
good,"Always busy, learning something new every day.  Supportive co-workers who were willing to work together.  I enjoyed my job at US Foods."
good,"I have been with the company for 3 years now. My routine daily work is very diverse and what I mean is there is always projects to complete in the local division and at the corporate level. This includes addressing networking issues, Laptop, OS, and management (assets).  I very grateful for many reasons to this company. I have learned from analog cross connections to asset management to network monitoring and management. Not much I can say about coworker since I am the only IT person managing an entire division but most coworkers (end users) are pleasant and easy going. The hardest part of the job is not having the ability to manage certain IT areas that are manage by corporate for example IP phone system. What I enjoy the most about working at Usfoods is the fact that you are given tremendous amount opportunity to learn many things within IT dept.; which again I am extremely grateful."
good,"do not know how much you make per hour. split wage between how many people were working and how many trucks unloaded, no set hours on a as need bassis"
good,The workplace is not organized and the routing of the routes is always off. There is a lot of time wasted during routes.The supervisors not good
good,Team oriented work place. drive epj around to designated locations and pick up product.
good,"- excess work load, little recognition, weak systems"
good,future is uncertain at location in Lakeland. departments were recently reevalutated and employees were let go and departments were downsized or eliminated in favor of centralized management out of state. customer service department very small and not managed well at the time.
good,I worked 60+ hours a week and was poorly compensated. The senior management team at this company was poor at best.
good,"Stressful, fast-paced, lack of job security. Position moved to Chicago, after we were required to train replacements."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the lack of value to employees, what i mean is the supervisors have absolutely no communication skills not to mention the night warehouse manager is a army vet with mental health issues. One day he is fine the next he will snap on you. For example if you walk up to him a say hey I've been looking for you he might reply what are you looking for me for im not your parent or something along those lines."
good,"The greatest and most outrageous example of NEPOTISM I have ever witness in my life!! When I first got there I immediately saw how a couple of guys literally getting whatever they wanted. When I saw my friend who had a newer truck get pulled out of it for another driver I couldn't understand why. But that's when I finally said something I was told to forget it because it was the Bossman NEPHEW who wanted the truck!! So they gave it to him.That was the night I found out that the bossman was the UNCLE!! And the other guys were the older brother, nephew, 2 brother-in-laws, and cousin!! I kid you not, it was the most incredible, most disgraceful, degrading example of NEPOTISM i've ever witness. And it still continues to this very day. At this writing, 10-27-2012."
good,I worked there nine years and my position was elimanted due to loss of company business.
good,"Must brown nose with upper management in order to get treated fairly. Keep your opinions to yourself. Do what you're told without question, even if it doesn't make sense. HR is for the company not the employee, be careful what you say to them!"
good,"It pays the Bill's, but many headache at the end of the day for the little money. Management is too many bosses, and not enough  Indians to do the job"
good,"Management is not willing to step in when we are understaffed and overworked. However, I do enjoy the work that I do. Looking to advance within the company, but they prefer to hire outside rather than within the company."
good,Us foods was a good company to work for until you get hurt on the job then they want to prove it's your fault and pick on you. Us foods will also make you a bunch of broken promises. Favoritism like no other.
good,i had 5 different supervisors over 10 years. In that time there were constant layoffs and job relocation. Many of the people i started with have also moved on to other companies.
good,"Lots of good people, poor implementation of new processes and time constraints. Failure to facilitate required inventory needs on a weekly basis causing ongoing customer issues."
good,"US Foods has a very difficult production standards, but if you're willing to work, they will take care of you. Good pay, tons of overtime and very long nights."
good,Some have heavy work load. Others do not. Management ask only certain people to do extra. Good pay but very stressful. Could be a great place to work if it were smooth.
good,"Extremely Stressful environment. They aren‚Äôt grateful. Racially charged environment . Would never recommend anyone to work in such an environment. "
good,"Good place to work if you can put up with lots of stress, and work independently of management, because they are not there when you need them, due to how busy they are with others."
good,"Super fast paced job. No work/life balance unless you kill yourself or you‚Äôve been there for years. Management only cares about the numbers, not the employees. Would only recommend for a 5 year plan. Get in, get the experience and get out."
good,Nothing is consistent working here at Us Foods.  You are just a number and micro managed.  Supervisors do not kbow what they are doing and will blame problems on you if you let them.
good,"They have a very strict policy on how fast you must run, and maintain that speed throughout your whole shift. If you cant run a 100% then you must run an 80 at least, but if you run an 80 one day you still need to have averaged a 100 for the whole week, meaning you need a day or two of running 105-110%. They wont put up with slack and excuses."
good,"Seemed to embrace newer technology at corporate level while field offices suffered due to use of dead technology, very short on staffing levels which caused many complains from full time staff."
good,"My overall experience with US FOODS was good. I would‚Äôve enjoyed it more if I had a different shift or hours and wasn‚Äôt thru a temp agency. I liked it overall, it was fast paced which made my shifts go by faster. Takes independence and quick learning."
good,Thought this would be a great company to work for. I was wrong. Alot of corporate initiatives. Alot of annual layoffs/restructuring. Most of the people are great to work with. Some of the Directors and above..not so much.
good,"this job is the reason my hips are messed up now. how about picking orders at a rate that keeps u dehydrated ,keeps u trying to beat a clock that cheats u out of time ."
good,Its basically a steady income  but extremely high  pace and physically demanding long days and no time for family injuries are common in this industry
good,"Don't really care for their employees"
good,"fast pace selecting using triple jack and headset. "
good,Work-life balance is horrible. Push employees to hard to fill company numbers which has resulted in a lot of injuries.Not to bad of a company to work for but to corporate integrated. Safety and employee personal health and well being is not considered.
good,Good work but the work life balance was terrible. Depend more on temps than training good employee's that last. Pay was good but overall isn't worth it unless you want to be at work all the time.
good,"workplace culture was driven only  by metrics and reports, very little positive motivation from management.  More concerned with managers bonuses vs staff or customers."
good,"You over worked, You can make good money but you have to live there at the place. The management team doesn't care about your needs they just want you to get the job done."
good,"Co-workers for the most part are friendly and helpful.  Very little training or coaching.  You are left to figure out how to get the results manager is looking for.  No opportunity for advancement or training for a future advancement opportunity.   In some areas, you must perform as instructed with exceptional results or you will loose your position.   US Foods has forgotten that the customer is who we work for and should build a supportive relationship with.  Shouldn't force change with customer without working with customer about a change."
good,never know when your job will end abruptly and for any reason.They tell you there is an open door policy but when you voice concerns nothing is done and you're on your way out.
good,"Good pay, but at the expense of a personal life. Long night hours, high turnover, poor management. No work/life balance and sometimes very heavy workload with not enough employees to carry the weight. Warehouse selectors skip breaks and/or lunch just in order to make incentives!"
good,"well it was an okay place to work. start off with meeting than we see the count for the day. they tell u if its gonna be a long day or not, over all decent place to work."
good,I can only speak to the TM position. They are cutting everyone's pay in July and going from a commission system to a salary of 70% of the last year over year with the opportunity to increase that with growth (customers and cases). However as an established rep with a thorough business book it is hard to grow much further when you are already full. When the IPO opened on the stockmarket change came fast. The moral when I left was the lowest I had ever seen. It was a great place to work but isn't nearly the same now.
good,"Too much concentration on CRM requirements which caused many sales reps to falsify entries to meet the required amount of entries. I use CRM to help manage my book of business and prospects however, the requirements put on the rep were counter productive which caused the rep to not use the CRM for what it was designed for but saw it as an annoying task."
good,"US Foods runs on a very small profit margin, as such, they're frequently performing RIF's - it's a sketchy place to be.  Often on egg-shells wondering if you'll be put on a Performance Improvement Program without any advance notice or opportunity to improve."
good,"The greatest part of the job was working with my peers, management change made working there unappreciated. Their outlook on dedication change. associates who have been with the company for 15 years or longer were no longer valued. They did not accept feedback or constructive criticism the attitude was it was their way with no conversation of the benefits. This was is not the same company it was 5 years ago.."
good,"It's the same as working every other food service company, long hours, bad loads. Pay is good, management is okay, don't have to see supervisors at, communication is poor or nonexistent."
good,"You are lifting boxes that weight from a few oz. to over 75 lbs constantly orders can last from 15 mins to 50 +mins. You don't have any set time you get off, it's go home when the work is done."
good,"Lots of hours will need to be committed to succeed in any position at this location. A lot of different things go on and are required to meet goals. There are good people there, but tons of challenges."
good,"Paid a base salary in the beginning and as I added accounts and generated commission income , the salary was clicked down until I was eventually on full commission."
good,"i spend a lot of time preparing for the day, getting up before 5:00am so i can be ready to hit the road by 7:30 after i reviewed my nightly downloads. as with any large company, i spent 2x as much time sending emails trying to get things accomplished, then what it should have taken. US foods has great cutlural beliefs, but they don't fully follow through with them. As with any large company, they only worry about the numbers but not customers. US Foods is trying to be super efficient, but are sacrifice the smaller customers because of it. spend alot of time on weekends to get ready for the following week"
good,"it is not policy but it is an ""us against them"" culture at this facility. i moved on because i just needed a new direction that i could focus on myself more than i was able to."
good,"The hardest part of the job, besides no pay increase in several years, is the uncertainty of the work schedule.You may think you only have to make one trip, but upon arriving in Lexington, find out you have to make two trips."
good,Positions created without direction or guidance for employees.  Expectations and work performance compared to other employees who had previous experience in the field. Training in the actual job being performed would be beneficial.
good,"Very stressful experience, although I did learn a lot. Got laid off after only 9 months there, the company was not very well run and I think they reorganized several times."
good,"I enjoyed my job, when they let me work. It was my very first job as a union worker. The environment and the culture of the job was very new and unexpected. I was held to a lot of contract and as well as holding the supervisors to contract. Protecting yourself and keeping your job. I spoke to an ex-supervisor, management was held to a quota of write ups. I had a total of 4 different management teams, until my injury. I learned that it wasn't a physical job but also a mentally stressful job. High demand of work hours. At times worked more than had time off. When work loads were high."
good,"The job was good exercise daily"
good,"Good business model, distracted by merger and acquisitions over past few years, trying to get their feet back on the ground.  My short time there reminded me of the commercial about the guy retiring, and not sure what company he was retiring from and thanking people by the floors they worked on. "
good,Human Resource and Operations do not work with hourly employees. They offer open door policy and that is false. The management team only looks out for themselves and not the employees.Every 2-3 years there is new management and new Human resource personnel. No stability whatsoever. Facility looks horrible inside and out and does not hold employees responsible to clean after themselves. This is a great company but is run by wrong people at certain divisions.
good,"Fine place to work, favoritism is shown in Just about every dept. new associates get more benefits than associates who have more experience and more seniority. People with 5+ years have to work nonstop, while people with less than a year get every weekend off."
good,It would benefit the company to have more streamlined processes and SOPs.  All operating divisions operate differently.
good,"This job is not easy at all. Work tons of hours and make a lotta money, but your home life suffers. You almost have to choose to either have a family or have this job for the first couple years you're there."
good,This isnt a bad company to work for IF you don't have a family. This is more of a single persons job. The pay is great. While working here they were going through management changes and from what I have been told they are going through it again. It was like working in a high school. There was so much drama and rumors. The job itself is very demanding. While I was there I was working 10-12 hour days 5-6 days a week. They pay is good though after working all of those long hours. Turn over rate is INSANE!!!
good,"The pay is good but you work very hard unloading a truck and delivering product upstairs/ downstairs, on your feet most of the day!! Management is terrible anymore, never was like that.. Not a bad place it's just heading in a direction that is driven by corporate greed and don't listen to the people that actually do the job"
good,"Heavy work load."
good,"Time to move back home to California"
good,"If you can deal with the food industry then go ahead and work for them. Was almost sold, no stability there. Poorly run with newer bosses."
good,"I was brought in 5 weeks before a major audit was to take place.  The company was going through a merger and there had not been a QA Supervisor there for 5 months.  It would have been hard enough to perform the job I had to do within the time allotted, but when I was tasked to bring the QA program up to snuff, find missing documentation (if it existed at all), create programs that should have already been in place AND spend 60% of my day away from doing this to perform tasks in a job I was NOT hired for (Production Supervisor), that made the position untenable for me."
good,responsible for tractor trailer and all safety duties to ensure safty proceedures are adheered to and all deliveries are made every day all over long island heavy lifting all day is the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part is going home  please do not contact only when i get this job then contact
good,US FOODS is an OK company. Great pay with some down side. Productive driven so you have to work at a fast pace. Management don't know what they are doing so the place is always a mess.Its hard to balance your life and work working at might and the V.P will tell you that work is more important than family. So if your a family person this may not be the job for you.
good,"The travel and being away from family. USFoods demands accountability and this job was tough, when family is my first priority."
good,"Not an easy job. its not made for you pass probation, only if they like you. Management has to like you , for it to be a good."
good,Pull orders all day and clean up.Learned alot about customers wants and dislikes. Mangement wasnt to helpful. Worked well with co-workers they helped me out alot. The hardest part of the job was being sent home alot because i was low in seniority. The freedom of working o my own.
good,Well i can say i got paid to workout home every day the pay is good
good,"Not to bad, compensation could be better for position held. You will be on your own for the most part, training is minimum. I was brought in 5 weeks before a major audit was to take place. The company was going through a merger and there had not been a QA Supervisor there for 5 months. It would have been hard enough to perform the job I had to do within the time allotted, but when I was tasked to bring the QA program up to snuff, find missing documentation (if it existed at all), create programs that should have already been in place AND spend 60% of my day away from doing this to perform tasks in a job I was NOT hired for (Production Supervisor), that made the position untenable for me."
good,Trabajo muy pero muy pesado se hace pero la gerencia tiene la culpa que los empleados m√°s viejos se crean m√°s que tu o tus supervisores no hay ninguna supervisi√≥n en cuanto a seguridad los pikiadores viejos te pasan por el lado a las millas con tal de ganarse 2 d√≥lares m√°s los empleados viejos te dan √≥rdenes y se creen tu supervisor la cual creo no tienen la m√°s m√≠nima importancia para mmi
good,"The money is decent , the work is hard and can be stressful at times. The equipment is not that great as far as trucks and trailers. Some favoritism as well."
good,"You will need a very strong work ethic to survive this environment.  Pay is very nice.  Job suited for a single person or have a very strong spouse.  Work/life balance is poor but bills will surely get paid.  Workaholics thrive nicely.  Good group of fellas in the warehouse. If you are not willing to work fast and hard for long hours, do not apply.   If you are willing, i recommend joining the team."
good,"Snaky management. Will stab you in the back and throw you in the ditch to die to make themselves look better. Always belittling their employees claiming to be""helping"". "
good,"I was hired when USFoods was still a private company and it was nothing short of wonderful. I loved the company so much that I even recommended friends and family to apply. However, once USFoods became a public company, all aspects of the company began to flounder. No longer was I excited to come to work. Changes in management were not successful moves and many instances of retaliation and verbal abuse from management were reported. These were huge factors in my decision to leavr."
good,us foods the tulsa yard had poorly maintained equipment. the oklahoma city yard wich is main yard in oklahoma showed less interest in the tulsa yard. they favored all the other terminals over tulsa. managment could have did a better job. they are a very disfunctional company
good,US Foods host many year round activities for employees and their famlies which is great for getting to know fellow employees in management positions or fellow employees in different departments.
good,"Full time hours always given and consisten job labor, very safe and clean work place. Always kept clean and  safety always enforced. Hours are good and consistent"
good,"The warehouse atmosphere is mostly freezers and shelf parishable foods."
good,The company was in transition and many of the managers were covering their own behinds instead of helping the sales representatives achieve their quotas.   Way too much change for any one t
good,I hope things have changed but when I was there you couldn't be the smartest person in the room and have an opinion and be a minority. How dare you challenge or question anything.
good,I worked out of a satallite location and didn't have much contact with management or other employees. We were left to fend for ourselves. No help from corprate in dealing with store managers.
good,"hard job but can be done with easily some danger to the job must be "
good,"They are a well established company, with great leadership at"
good,"place was good place to work and there was a lot of promotions."
good,"It was an absolute dream to work there, only downside as corperate comng in as awful, and they time you so wait for break for the bathroom, aside from this dream job"
good,"Very hard work,alot of hours but you will make money. management does play favorites to the guys that kiss butt,great starter job for the newer drivers."
good,No saben como escoger empleados que vengan a laborar y no ha perder el tiempo. No hay una buena organizaci√≥n ni buena comunicaci√≥n del √°rea administrativa con los empleados. Son muy poco profesional.
good,"Poor management, high turnover. Good money long hours and you work every holiday. Very cold or very hot no chance for advancement. You will have no life with family."
good,This company can provide a lot of opportunities and has room for growth. The company is currently experiencing a lot of change due to Continuous Improvement as they recently transitioned from a Private Sector to Public Company with additional financial requirements. This has proven to be positive in some ways but also challenging in others. Management (on all levels) has experienced some change and turnover has been felt in all aspects of the company.
good,Loved the people I work with but the sanitation department isn't taken seriously until something has been missed. You get discounts on some food. Only holidays you get off is Thanksgiving an Christmas.
good,"Is the worst supervison and management team ever"
good,"Long hours, with it being a production job and time is a big factor on pay, they aren't open to suggestions from lower level to help make things easier and more productive."
good,Corporate politics is a negative. Managers overseeing groups they are not familiar with or understand the position. Micromanaging can be very stressful. Pay raises are not good unless you are in management.
good,"always work to be done, long hours and its night shift no balance between work and home life management was ok when you would finish in your area (freezer) you have to go help other areas (dry,cooler) before leaving"
good,"Time standards for Warehouse workers."
good,The only job security at this company is in the sales department.  I love working at US Foods but they just do not have a loyalty to keeping good employees.
good,"Great innovated products (SCOOP)  But are forced to sell them to 25% of customers. most sales people buy it through a customer to get management off their backs. You use to be able to go out and sell, but the higher ups have you doing all this useless paperwork and bogging you down with mindless paperwork."
good,"Managers have their favorites.  If you disagree, even if done professionally, they will continue to ride your back.  The company is good and does have good people in it.  Night shift is not one to work on."
good,U.S was a really great place to work when I started and then it got bought out by an investment group and they did away with little perks that showed appreciation for the drivers.Now its all about micro-management.No small company atmosphere whatsoever like it used to be.Back breaking work!
good,"Communications sucks, and the turn-over rate is high. Whats to love? The extremely long hours of work that leave you drained at the end of the day? or the fact that no one seems to know how to do their job 100% correctly."
good,Very Competitive. You have to be able to give up everything to be able to advance in this company. Long hours LONG LONG LONG hours everyday. Be prepared to work hard
good,"The culture at US Foods, was unsafe. The equipment forklifts, powered pallet jacks and cherry picker were beyond warranty and obsolete. By no fault of the managers, they needed more training on being a leader. The hardest part of the was getting support to address and fix the safety concerns I saw. The most enjoyable part of the job was the location."
good,"work day was busy, I learned that in this industry you have to be productive and that the numbers are more important than a excellent employee. Managed my workload to my best of my ability. Workplace culture is mostly men. The hardest thing about my job was trying to keep up my quota for the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a full workout."
good,"Shifting company culture, priorities change daily with this position, competition is fierce and competitive.  Great benefits job requires work on sunday"
good,Very physical work. Pay did not compensate for the high amount of work. Routes were almost impossible to complete on time. Some benefit was free hotel room when on overnight trips.
good,"I work at a shuttle site for 9 years and i liked the job. It was the people that brought you down. The routing person would not listen to the drivers on where the stops should go to be more efficient. Nobody would actually listen to the drivers, yeah, they would hear what we had to say but go back to the main hub and we wouldn't see anything change. We ran 28' trailers and they would come up, 7 out of 10 times, with something dumped over or something broke open on the floor or the load not loaded right, which if you know how to throw cases is a big deal. Management under the transportation manager was a waste of time to talk to. Listening to the drivers is part of the business and it makes them feel important to a certain extent. Knowing your being listened to will make all the difference in the world."
good,"The company from a  Corporate standpoint has a progressive outlook and direction. The foundation and making of  a very productive organization is  in place, requires the support and input from all."
good,Not a good review as the company is reorganizing after recently going public. REALLY LOOKING TO SELL AND THEIR HAS BEEN SEVERWL PEPOLE MISPLACED.
good,I've been with the company for a long time. Its a decent place to work and overall they treat everyone fairly. The company is going through a number of changes after a failed merger with a larger rival. It has now gone public successfully and should continue to grow.
good,With the company recently going public most of the sales department is in a lengthy transition.  To show a solid bottom line to the investors the company revamped their sales model nationwide eliminating many positions.  In my opinion they are going backwards by alleviating many of the customer service aspects of the current model that helped make them successful.
good,"I typically got exactly the government workforce required hours off between shifts. You work at least 6 days a week and if you think you will get a permanent route you wont someone senior to you will take it as is union policy. Constantly people quitting so you are needed to pull longer shifts than you should and they find loopholes to get around the minimum driving time even with the fancy  computers in the trucks. You will get stuck hours from home due to poor directions, weather, and bad planning on part of the management. They do pay very well compared to other trucking companies I worked for but you will be busting your butt driving long hours and doing tons of physically stressful labor walking down dangerous flights of stairs with a dolly loaded with food and dealing with a few unpleasant restaurant managers.  not to mention driving your semi in crowded narrow city streets and trying to park in feet of snow (if you did colorado routes like I did). The senior workers that cant get fired look pretty happy though.. Being able to just say no to all the extra hours and not get fired due to their union contracts."
good,"Not the best job in the world, unless you like being tired all the time, hours from 6 pm to 5 am, other than that your basically doing the same thing every single day. They promote internal promotions but people have been there for 5-10 years doing the same thing they did when they started, Transfers are impossible, you're basically stuck here"
good,"Confirm cost of purchase orders, resolve invoice discrepancies, research root cause of invoice discrepancies. Daily Reports."
good,"Could be a great place to work if two men or woman went out and worked on delivering their products. Compensation was good as well, but as I stated if two persons worked together in the AM shift like they do overnight moral would be up and injuries would be less."
good,"Houston  Office Sucks  Horrible Management this job would be cool if they had better  Management and organization, you never know what time you come in have to call at 9pm every day to find out what time you come in, something its not up, playing the guessing game, and you never have the same route, unless you have been their for  years."
good,Nice company to work for but management and other areas need a lot of attention.
good,"First and foremost i will say that US Foods was supposed to be my last stop on the career path, unfortunately or fortunately it did not work out that way.  Management is a tightly knit group with most coming from 2 ""other"" large organizations, albeit at a lower level at their previous employers.  Central replenishment is a great idea and if you can make it work provides multiple competitive advantages however you need the right people to make something like this work.  There is alot of good people there and as with most organization, some not so good.  Be prepared to deal with alot of babysitting, backstabbing and the everyone ""out for themsleves mentality"", especially in replenishment."
good,"Most of company has been on a transformational journey for the past four years and finance has just begun."
good,"Sysco bought US and it is being absorbed. Great co-workers, good line of products, warehouse crew is awesome, drivers are awesome, inside sales people work very hard."
good,"Great national corporate platform, co-workers (buyers, customer service, contract, credit, drivers ) and customers I called on daily.  I loved my customer and visa versa.  My day always very busy 7am planning, covering outs, mis-picks, regular appointments, cultivating leads, regular orders, special orders, notifications to all departments (buyers, customer service, contract pricing, credit issues etc.) Will calls, some deliveries and new proposals.  At home after 5-7pm Entering review of day into LINC and schedule with alerts commitments made during the day.   Most enjoyable part of my day is the personal interactions with peers and friends(customers)   "
good,"I work the area where there are virtually all temps, but the permanent employees are okay, nothing major to say. I just feel that most of the projects they have us working on are longer that expected 60% of the time. So i don't understand why they don't make us permanent. From what i have heard it because the company does not want to spend the extra money on health insurance. Show what's really important, their bottom line!"
good,Good Company customer focused. WOrking to be the Best Food Company and making it easy for customers to buy and obtain products to support their business.
good,"they mistreat their employes."
good,learned how to work in different work environment hardest thing was jumping from dry dock to cooler dock and freezer dock in one day
good,"My hours are 5:30 pm until 3:00 am. This allows me virtually no time at will with my children, aged 14 and 3."
good,A typical day at work consists of cleaning the spills in the freezer. I have learned that I need to dress accordingly due to the freezer being -10 at times. Some of management is great to work for and others could care less about the environment that we work in. My co-workers are some of the best people to work with. The hardest part of the job is working in the freezer for extended periods of time.
good,I believe in an atmosphere of fairness and providing people with the tools they need to succeed.
good,"Friendly environment and overall good place to work with friendly co-workers, but very unclear communication in upper management as well as favoritism."
good,ran a route calling on restaraunts schools and hotels ect. managment was ok. Had alot of trouble getting the corporate office to ok orders for customers. New owners brought in existing people to cover thr territories we had. Enjoyed working on own
good,"was a good job I enjoyed, but if you don't make a certain percentage before 90 days you will lose your job. I think this is something you should know going in."
good,The majority was positive besides micromanagement and feeling left out at times. Big layovers that happened per season resulting in many vacant desks.
good,"An innovative food company that consistently struggled to deliver groceries on time  "
good,If you enjoy evening work and hard work then this job is perfect for you.  Benefits are fair with a retirement plan that is decent. Checks are weekly which is nice.
good,"work work work allay and nite, heavy lifting and long hours terrible trucks and trailers please be careful on working here it can get messy, i just did not get why we work so many hours"
good,"I worked at US Foods when Sysco was attempting to buy the company, so nothing was ""normal.""  While the leaders gave a good try to  building a culture of transparency and camaraderie, it was not enough to really succeed."
good,Not the best environment to work in. Uneven work load causing no work life balance. Travel required that didn‚Äôt make much business sense as it didn‚Äôt pertain to our division.
good,Long hours hard work not enough time in the day to accommodate your needs managers have horrible attitudes and not really helpful when it is needed...
good,"Too much politics. Every man for himself, in a throw everybody under the bus environment. Management being pulled every which way by an always changing corporate leadership"
good,Prepare to work 7 days per week and on vacations.  Very hard to get away. Way too diversified in the # and type of items you are required to sell.  Silly metrics involved at times to please some corporate person who has no idea what it‚Äôs actually like to be on the streets. If food is your passion and your a workaholic the money is good.  If not there are way less stressful ways to earn a living
good,"This is an excellent job if you enjoy working around other people who don't care about doing their job correctly. You are the last person to touch the product before it arrives at the customer location, and if the selectors and loaders don't have a good night...get ready to work! Dig, Dig, Dig! Pay is excellent. Upper-level management does not seem to have any concern for the betterment of this position."
good,Pay is good but it's hard work and long hours. Work/Life balance is not great.  Management could improve. Company has a high turn over rate for drivers.
good,"Very laid back but lack professional management. The majority of supervisors, managers are not educated. The financial manager has a degree. The other management need a whole lot of training when it comes every day Operations."
good,"Very physical, long hours, 40 men on a shift, management wasn‚Äôt very caring or understanding. But enjoyed meeting and establishing new friendships with guys that worked which made the job go good thru out the night!"
good,"everything is fast because they looking  for productivity , hard job but they pay good!"
good,"You will be well compensated but a lot is demanded of you.  You will often work nights, weekends, and holidays.  The leadership will say a work life balance is important, but their expectations say otherwise."
good,Good money.. you get paid off incentive bonuses but they always find a way to screw you with your bonus money.supervisors wont give you time back when they should . Example two selectors run into each other causing 20+ cases of product to fall on floor and you have to wait 5- 10 min for it to get cleared and lose those min when your order might gave you 25 min to complete so now you to rush and try to finish in 15 min or your incentive bonus take a major hit.. when all the supervisor has to do is add 5- 10 min back so you wouldn't have to break your back to keep up.. all while working 60 hrs a week sun- fri
good,A lot to handle with long hours and unsafe practices.. Fellow employees are good but the job can be frustrating and overwhelming... Pay along with goal times should be changed..
good,"Although I firmly believe in the mission USFoods is on, i also believe that culture is cultivated, not mandated. Unfortunately, the Area President is ultimately responsible for maintaining and growing the company culture within the specific geography. Some do this very well, while others (like the division for whom I worked) used fear and intimidation, ultimately driving away great and dedicated people, usually to the competition."
good,"current management is not honest with employees"
good,When I worked there the would try and only give you 8 hours 4 days a week!!! The warehouse was never on time. When you deliver they only give you 13 hr and it‚Äôs about a 18 hr run . So the next day you would get a call if you couldn‚Äôt do the job in 13 hr. If you took a break like you where supposed to mangers would ask why you wher running late. DOT makes you take 30 after 8 hr. But customers where always nice and would help where to put the stuff. Other companies want you to turn and burn. Us Foods wants you to put it up.
good,"Favorites get ahead.  Loves to re-org.  Changes direction a lot.  Analytically advanced and developing cool technology.  A lot depends on your manager - whether you can work remotely, or take classes."
good,"Order selecting to maintain rate in a complicating warehouse."
good,Everyone is driven to get the job done for the customer.   They strive to get the job done.  As quick as they can.   Strive to be second to none.   In the industry.
good,Depending on the area that you are a part of you will have no work/life balance as an operations manager.  The pressure is always on and the company is driving multiple initiatives at once.
good,"Kept pretty busy  fixing trucks and trailers. Day starts off fast and stays that way till you leave. Helps the day go by pretty quick. You get time off for regular leave , sick leave and personal time off which is a lot better than other companies."
good,No one has an office or personal space - catch as catch can. Garbage cans only in kitchen area. Very industrial environment. Impersonal atmosphere.  Vry little guidance
good,"threats, people constantly screwing the company, hanging out in the office or outside, not a team at all , smokers take way too many breaks, management plays favorites, it is a take take me me place and management does not care, if your not on board with how things are you are blacklisted!"
good,Long hours and lots of miles.  I learned to communicate with customers better.  I learned about electronic logs.  Management was poor because they didn't care about the drivers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being on the road.
good,"When I worked there, they were being acquired by Sysco, which 2 years later did not happen. Many people feared losing their jobs so they left before all that happened."
good,"long hours, dispatch works with you, Management changes and does not understand drivers.  Decent pay but benefits could be better.  Health insurance not the best."
good,"unethical poor management. Get the sale at any cost. One of the companies motto's is ""talk straight"" but they really don't want you to have your own opinion."
good,The pay was excellent the position as driver was good I got screwed around and was terminated which was a crock.My Transportation manager was a liar.Since I left this company is losing business and employees and they just lost one of their biggest accounts to Sysco Foods.
good,"Management gives minimal information projects. I obviously would ask questions, but they were not the right questions because when I would return my work, it would be an automatic ""this isn't right."" But also not teaching how to do it correctly. Upper management encourages the diminishing of curiosity."
good,I enjoyed working there. There were different projects to work on throughout my time there. Every day brought new challenges which made it interesting.
good,it was okay but i didnt see myself working there for a long time. its a far drive for me. it would take from and hour to a hour and a half of drive time.
good,The company is hard working but most metrics and company direction is not well thought-out. Company and management have a tendency to pivot processes. Although they are fair in allowing time to adjust. the concept or working and putting in the hours for something that was not well thought-out or tested for success is dishearting.
good,"Work a lot with the sales force locating product, creating quotes, handling issues with orders. Place orders.  Learned how to do quotes. Had to use many company programs to do my job.  At first the culture was great but as the years passed and changes kept occurring it just became stressful and no support to learn and advance.  Management not knowing all that the job entailed. Working with the sales team to service our customers."
good,it was an ok place to work.  there wasnt much time for family.. they expected a lot of your time and looked down upon you if you couldnt work extra hours.
good,"Management often seems clueless. There actually are some good people who work there, particularly development. Most of them hate it there. Lots of offshore activity. Quantity over quality. QA is lacking. The company has let some of there best people go, particularly contractors. Some contractors were forced to hire on and they hate it."
good,"Made labels"
good,Management.....was the main reason why I resigned. No support when it came to discipline associates. The Director and VP of Operations . Other than that I at times enjoyed working there.
good,"bid on routes annually, can be very stressful when going into unfamiliar areas of the county.  lack of sufficient equipment for all drivers, ie pallet jacks"
good,USR has a great staff of people who are self motivated. the con would be management needs to spend more time with th eworking class and management people not processes
good,"the job was challenging which I enjoy. the people were great co-workers. great people."
good,"Regrettably,  I had to turn over 33 active accounts that I brought from former employer, Roselli Foods, which I had cultivated for many years. This basically destroyed my route and had to completely start over in a seasonal territory."
good,Great job if they would compensate you more for the work you do. Feel like you work so hard and don't meet the expectations for getting the incentive pay. Need to rework the incentive and give more time for your orders to be pulled. Sometimes you work 12 hours pulling and your body gets tired and you don't get additional time after 8 hours. Only one break for 20 min and a 30 min lunch in 8 hours and needs to do 2 15 mon breaks to rest. Promised that it wasn't hard to get your incentive but bust my butt all day and struggle to even get close.
good,Giving credit where credit is due had I not had the experience of working at US Foods I would have never been able to land my current role as a manufacturer's rep.  US Foods evolved into a very unhappy culture as they transitioned to where they are at today.  I don't need to say as the industry knows that it is a very unhealthy place to work.  I appreciated the management and their style but their hands were tied from corporate directives.
good,"I enjoyed the benefits and pay. "
good,I loved the people that I worked with and I loved my job. The only down side is there is not a stable work environment there due to layoffs from the company.
good,"Good paing Teamster's Union job. Hard work, plenty of hours,good pay, but management is less than desirable. Heavy work can take a toll on your body. Many workers show signs of the hard labor."
good,"High volume workplace environment."
good,"Typical, huge corporate American company.  Many layers of bureaucracy, old-school mentality."
good,"My commute to work was difficult due to traffic."
good,"Always constant change."
good,"Worked here for over 19 years. They pay well so it is hard to leave. Management doesn't have a clue what happens in the warehouse. Corporate likes to dictate what products we need and we have to take them whether we need it or not. Warehouse is almost full but corporate doesn't care. Complete lack of discipline from employees since no one is ever written up. Morale is at an all time low, but management/corporate don't care."
good,"Divisions are not treated the same as the corporate office.  There is a lot of training that occurs and is offered on the corporate level.  At the Divisions, not so much.  US Foods focuses a lot on the improvement of the sales IT systems and not others.  Therefore, other areas have a lot of manual work that has to be done in order to make things work effectively.  This leads to an inefficient use of resources."
good,Work environment was good.  I did obtain all the skills I currently have.  Ultimately company did me no favors as my job was eliminated due to downsizing.
good,"Easy job, not rocket science. Management does not work with you. They will not adapt to current situations, would rather do what worked 20 years ago. Do your research before going here. It is a physically demanding job, keeps you in shape. Hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management who reject to change."
good,While a great company been through many buyouts and still in the process of being bought to be sold again for profits for that reason it is not the stable company it once was.  Your employment is in jeopardy with each new buyout.
good,"The work is ever changing which makes for some great days, however it's not always steady.  There are days where you need to look for more work just to keep your self busy.  This position has taught me a lot about how things work, and how things come together. Management is hit and miss.  Sometimes it's hard to read what exactly is going on and if they are listening to your concerns. The flexibility is great, however sometimes that is a curse too."
good,The opportunity to meet new people everyday and help each customer with their individual needs was more than exciting and worth coming to work everyday.
good,"good for making some fast money off of, fast pace apply only if you have experience in warehouse jobs, go off productivity"
good,"Food. Food People. Easy"
good,after 16 years of working for us foods  there just is no bright futer anymore so time to leave  and take my skills somw where else
good,"management is all over the place! You never know what time you will work they say 10 hours and they tell you, but you will be sleeping and they will call you changing your start time and route 10 minutes till you start!"
good,The position is hold is repetious and I would like something that is diverse.  The company as a whole is a good company to work for.
good,I love my work family.  I love helping others figure out the solution.  I have a lot of sales support calls and questions and I really try to figure out the problem and fix it as quickly as possible.  In my position I have been lucky to have mentors teach me.  I have been given opportunities to mentor other contract coordinators.  It is really high stress at times especially now that so many changes are taking place.
good,"A rewarding job, built relationships"
good,Difficult sales manager. Convincing customers to convert to new service provider after having long term relationship with competetors.
good,"fast work environment "
good,"Its an ok company. Very busy with the customers that call in and you call with issues or concerns that they may have pertaining to their food order they are placing for the day they will receive delivery. You do learn somethings but only from someone who knows what they are talking about. You can ask 10 people and no seems to know but one. Management is skeptical you just dont know what to expect, everything a secret. The hardest part of the job is when you get an unexpected recall on product and you have to stop what your are doing to call all customers affected. For the most part everyone gets along."
good,"Learn a lot about the town your delivering in, gain skills quite."
good,"Good insurance"
good,I worked here for nearly a year. The pay was great but no room for advancement. The hours were very long (14 hours sometimes). Benefits were really good also. Co-workers were friendly but also felt the same as I did. Worked all the time and left minimal time for family or friends.
good,U.S. Foods offered a stable fast paced work environment. Good training with helpful management and co-workers. The work was very physically demanding along with a variety of work environments to include very hot to very cold.
good,"When I worked in the warehouse, I loved my job and of the money. Although, being a single mother it was hard @ home and didnt spend alot of time with my children because of the hours I worked. Working in the office helped at home, but you always had reasons to keep looking over your shoulders even when you were doing your job. Getting ahead here depended on who you knew and not what you knew."
good,"The warehouse is typically driven by receiving and shipping in food distribution. There are many aspects of sanitation involved in all areas of warehouse cleanliness. The areas consist of dry,cooler and freezer. There are SOP's and GMP's in place that have guidelines."
good,Nothing is business as usual. This place is always changing.
good,"Typical day at work, extremely stressful, conference calls daily with high expectations to work after hours to complete daily tasks and attend customer meetings."
good,"I worked third-shift there doing environmental service work. I would clean different areas of the building vacuuming, mopping, sweeping, dusting etc. It was a lot of hard work that people there took advantage of. The company is a great place to work if you wanted to work driving a pallet-jack it was a lot of hard work but you was compensated well for that. Management there was good I would see employees who would always had the open policy address one of the managers there. The hardest part of the job was the hours and having to manage my family as well. I enjoyed meeting people and getting to know them."
good,"every day it was a challenge doing multiple jobs but one job title, and it taught me how to handle situations on my own if need be, the management was so un professional, and the co workers felt it, and thats what i believe led to our building shutting down soon."
good,My Co-workers  always helped me and I've learned about the job through them.
good,"Typical day -- computer work, email, working with the buyers/demand planners.  New centralized purchasing initiative has been challenging.  Typical day starts at 7am and finishes up at 5-6pm Mon-Fri.  Corporate environment ""with a twist"".  Cannot participate in all campus initiatives because we are service oriented and assist our divisions with their needs and demands.  Fast paced, 100-150 emails on a typical day.  Less than 100 is a ""quiet day"".  You must like meetings, computer work, emailing.....I take work home with me a lot.  "
good,"I feel the company could be a great place to work for but, the management team is very young and can't seem to separate personal situations from business. They expect you kiss up to get along and if you don't expect to picked on until you're either fired or resign."
good,Manual Labor job with a tough standard.  Union position with union benefits.
good,"Basic day at US Foods consists of Warehouse detailing, cleaning major areas of the building. I have learned a lot from my experience with Us Foods. I learned the importance of food temperatures and cross contamination. Also how to keep a building Audit Ready at all times. My Co-workers were great they help you with anything that you need help with and they also was there to teach me any extra things that I wanted to learn as per all other departments."
good,most of the management is unreliable and unexperienced. Nepotism runs rampant in upper management.
good,"A job that is ok, very hard work. Management could use some improvement but everyone does their job. The hardest part of the job is working long hours at night. My co-workers were hard working individuals who kept the job fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,"A typical day was hard fought Job but with a little team, anything was possible."
good,"With Sysco and Ben E Keith building huge state of the art facilities here in Lubbock and West Texas, the US Food warehouse was behind the 8 ball. It is small and can not stock all the products which Lubbock is now demanding. Therefore, we as a sales force would have to ""special order"" these things which caused the product to be higher. Sysco and Keith were able to provide these products at a cheaper price therefore, they would get new business and take business from US Foods with ease. Management was out of touch and blamed the sales people for not getting the business. This is NOT a reflection of US FOODS as a whole just the Lubbock location!"
good,those men at US foods were not very nice to me they were rude and often said cruel things because I couldn't do as much as them they ridiculed me and force me to quit they are not respectful of women especially if you can't do what they do no I am not going to lift 200 pounds worth of anything you shouldn't worry about what a woman does especially if you are a man they intimidated me everyday
good,"Great company,  great culture,  clean warehouse, they appreciate you just all it took was one or two bad managers to ruin the experience working there"
good,"Product was easy to access n deliveries were presold to perfection each customer knew what they were getting, the price was always to their benefit. Hardly had issues with delivery times."
good,Most people where easy to work with. It was very hard to get employees to show up for work each day so we always seem to be short on staff. We worked all holidays.
good,Productive.  My boss was great!  Fast-paced.  Communication from CEO could have been better.  Great company perks!  The company really tried to make it a pleasant work experience.
good,The work is difficult and the hours an be long.  You really need to have the right mindset to work here.  It is night shift so there isnt much work/life balance.  The base pay is great and the incentives can give you some extra money on top.
good,Just my opinion I can‚Äôt say no more than that .. A lot of favoritism on the job .If you‚Äôre not affiliated with them meaning management you get the SHAFT EVERYTIME.
good,"You have to invest in order to succeed.  The people here were amazing for the most part, however management seems to be comfy keeping the status quo, rather than accelerating growth."
good,I loved working there for a time.  I started in customer service and got the chance to move into a different position that I loved. I felt my opinion was valued and I was treated with respect.
good,"A whole lot of tunnel vision in the mangment and executive branches. You are a numer, a pawn, not really a person to Upper Managment. You can walk by a VP and, say hi, and not hear a sound afterwards. "
good,Order selection is a very hard job especially if you don‚Äôt know what your doing have to be very careful because there‚Äôs a lot of ways you can get hurt at this job
good,Learn high volume order selector skills and work with great people also room to move around in the company. They also have great benefits but there are long wor hours
good,US Foods was ok place to work but it is very fast pace very tedious at times early mornings late nights very little time to relax when get off and weekend but overall US Foods is good financially and as far as benefits I worked in Cincinnati Ohio Sharonville location
good,"My review about us foods is there will be tough days and there are some easy days ,mostly you will be working 9-12 hour shifts but every day at work your work ethic should not change. The 2 bad things about working there is job advancement and job/life balance."
good,"Management has no clue nor do they care what happens each day to a driver. They'll say do your best, so much it'll make you sick. The employees are awesome the pay is good the benefits are good just stay on top of them and watch your benefits close because you or your family may be dropped at anytime."
good,In my experience at US Foods management has been a very big issue. This causing a disastrous work place. I loved the physical work and pay but the management needs a re evaluation.
good,"This is an extremely physical and mentally exhausting job.  You don't know when you're working until 6:30pm the night before (at least at the Charleston, SC branch) and your start time could be anywhere between 2:00am and 6:30am.  I was not able to rest enough to perform this job well.  After a hard day, unloading 16,000 lbs or groceries, I felt I needed at least 6 hours of sleep.  Besides that being a negative factor, here are the other CONS: Half of their tractors were complete garbage, I was never given a computer to do my job, the other drivers were known for stealing equipment, and worst of all THE WAREHOUSE LOADED THE TRUCKS HORRIBLY.  It is well known that food service warehouses are normally horrible, but many veterans at that branch said it was the worst they had seen in years.  This job is only for physically fit workers that can run off of 3-4 hours of sleep regularly.  And like to work very hard to sort through a warehouse worker's negligence when it comes to the products on the truck.  If you can suffer through that, you can make $80,000 a year."
good,Work life balance is not accurate to company culture. There is a great deal of pressure placed on busy work and data rather than getting the job done. This used to be a people business and at this company it's become more of a technical/information gathering/entering roll.
good,"great place to work if your hired but as a temp you really don't get much benefits.  You do get major holidays off, which is a plus.managers are cool, not much to complain."
good,"It wasnt too bad, over time got worse,  like I said I dont have too much to say I worked in Wisconsin winter is slow summer is crazy busy, the job I did was very fast paced"
good,At the time I was there the main focus was to blend current systems and data with a possible future purchaser of the company. My focus was on that only.
good,"I really like this job but the management at night were bias on other employees. They are not fair.  I had grandmother who had a stroke and my manager was not going to let me off. Finally he did but then made me do a UA.  After that, he just looked for things to pin on me."
good,"Ability to work at my own pace and have my own companies that I am in charge of was nice."
good,"It's hard back breaking work but you make good money on the OT. You work too much OT some times. 14 + hour days. You work ""4 tens"" and are on call for the 5th day. Just plan on coming in on that day and working 12+ hours. They might even ask you to work on the 6th day. You will always have Sundays off. "
good,"Kind of a high-pressure atmosphere, time windows and a tight schedule. It‚Äôs a very physical job, a lot of lifting, bending.  up-and-down trailer ramps up and down stairs with handcart."
good,"Department I worked for was great but beyond that needs work, no transfer program for employees. Much of that was done on my own with no luck even upon moving out of state. Seems like they do not like to keep employees that have more experience and schooling in there trade."
good,Unchallenging. Need to relocate to promote. Overall an unexciting job. Team is not as aggressive with regard to process improvement as I would like to see.
good,"Daily meetings with team and supervisor. Enjoy all of my co workers. Company provided outings, like a company picnic with games and provide get gifts for winning games"
good,"Definitely changing the way food is sold to restaurants, etc.  Seems to be straying from good old fashioned sales though. More focus needed on allowing reps to earn based on the sales built thru relationships, not based on algorythims."
good,"This was a consistent if sometimes tedious job. The company itself has many different positions ranging from outside sales to data entry. Depending on which department you land in, it can be fun or boring."
good,The work hours were too long and the quota that needed to be met was nearly impossible. The job is a very physical job and safety should be a priority
good,"It's the food industry so that's what you get. Unstable Management, lots of changes new directions, Updating computer systems to tell them where you are who you are calling and what you will be doing next month."
good,"Since going public, the work atmosphere has been increasingly more hostile.  Micromanagement has taken the place of responsibility and continues to become a plan-o-gram community.  Trust seems to be less of a virtue."
good,"Upper Management doesn't really care about work/life balance.  They support he ones they like.  Once on their radar, hard to get off.  Not much training provided."
good,"You start your day at 3am without sleep, trailer is full of boxes to be delivered and unloaded by hand. Management's attitude is on a get out sale sale sale attitude. As a new driver you basically cover other drivers that call in, vacation etc. It is hard to locate customers on new routes every day and only makes your day longer. You get to your stop and you have to go through all the pallets to get your order done. You figure your truck should be organized for every stop just to quickly unload. By the end of every day you are looking at 12 13 14 hours to have your manager text you by 6 7pm to let you know if you are working the next day or not. Schedule is unpredictable.You feel like you have no outside life. Starting at $20hr with lots of overtime you do get a fat check though."
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with at US Foodservice, but the management at that time seemed to not be engaged with all facets of the business. Disorganization became more than aggravating, and eventually, and thankfully pushed me to accept other offers."
good,Never a dull day at US Foods.  You will work with inside and outside customers.  Most done via computer and some phone.  Lots to learn in the Food Service world as far as buying selling and service to account.
good,I do price confirmation and billing. Debit and Credit memos. Customer Service.There is no typical day in my company. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities.
good,Very large nationwide company.  Not as large as Sysco or as innovative.  The products we good and the computer system was easy to use.  But again its another large food company.
good,"Work/Life balance is pretty hard. There are always a lot of hours to be worked. Compensation for the work done is decent but not anything to brag about. The work environment is ok, but could definitely use some work. The benefits are great!"
good,"This job isn't for everyone, must work every day long hours (12 to 16 hours a day). Pay is good for the job preformed, good benefits and vacation time."
good,It's a long hour job and it's very physical work you never know where you are going. They send you to down town Baltimore and not know where any thing is
good,"Team Members need someone they can trust, believe in, and know that a fair view in given regardless of the situation, and that all avenues will be of utmost importance and considered in every decision that is made. "
good,"Big changes, mass layoffs in 2016. Failed merger 2015, went public 3/2016 caused many changes to executive management. Most in leadership positions have been with the company less than 1 year, so direction is unclear and somewhat scattered"
good,Enjoyed working there for my first 2 years. Then the whole workplace culture changed.  Very negative compared to what it had been.  Many employees lost their jobs due to downsizing.  Very stressful environment.  Poor management.
good,"Between a failed merger attempt and then an immediate IPO, the leadership of this company seems more interested in a pay day than being a good employer."
good,drive to a stop might not take you tell you to come back a later time mess your entire day up. or have to run a extra route. hardest and stressful part of job digging and finding what you need for each stop might be on a two different pallets.
good,Great Company to work for horrible management. Long nights and no many days off. This is was a order Selection job and typical hard work. hardest part of this particular job is working for management
good,"the first 11 years were very good most of the time ,but since the closing of our division and moving to a drop yard for port orange work days have gotten more difficult and longer ,total lack of management or communication has made it a hostile work environment which is why im seeking other employment"
good,"If you're very motivated and possess critical thinking skills, have strength and stamina then this is perfect for you. Tough to gain advancement and long work hours can make it tough. Ideal for young and single people!"
good,"No two days are the same. It is difficult having unorganized customers that do not order the correct items or not enough of the correct items. During the summer, you do not have any time off on the weekends. Always running around having to bail out customers."
good,"Company recently went public, lots of changes that long-time employees seem to not know how to deal with, large organization for what they do, many verticals and difficult to accomplish things outside of your own vertical."
good,Overall its a good company. And also give alot back to there employees and also alot of vacation time but management was very poor lack of leadership always where unfair to certain people
good,The company will pay you very well for hard work. The job is very physical and tough on your body. The benefits offered and high quality.
good,"US Foods has been a great company to work for many years. I worked with some very talented and hard working peers.  "
good,"Pros"
good,"This is a very clickish environment with little emphasis on quality of work. As long as you are willing to become the supervisor's pet, you will fit in."
good,you are using triple jacks working with voxware and on standards. Standards are tight and you must be accuarte as well pay attention to detail. Mistakes are a no-no as well. Best part was going home
good,"If you thrive in fast-paced environments and are eventually willing to move to Houston, this is the place for you. However, you MUST have thick skin to survive. Due to the current merger, US Foods has become a very cut-throat environment. As many employees are jumping ship, the work load across departments has significantly increased and is being thrown onto current employees with little or no time to prepare. Because of this, many are struggling to stay afloat, putting in 10+ hour days EVERYDAY and are being blamed for things left behind by previous employees. There's a LOT of finger pointing as opposed to collaboration with very little transparency into how other departments operate which is CRUCIAL. Many in management are simply looking to keep their spots until the merger is complete. So, there's very little focus on their subordinates and their overwhelming workload. "
good,"The production standard set by the Company and the Union is in no way pro-worker.  The pace is extremely intense, and that pace, coupled with the nature of the job, which is picking and stacking boxes (weighing up to ninety pounds) on a triple pallet jack to a FAST pace, is physically strenuous, to the point that most employees who have been there longer than five years have been out injured or had at least one surgery.  Looking at the history of the Local 120 Teamsters Union, it makes one wonder if there was a little back-room finagling put in place to have an accelerated production standard.  Beyond the bargaining agreement, the Union doesn't have any real representation on site.   Management is never really clear in it's communication of anything, everyone has a different story on most topics.  The pay is good, but you have to ask yourself seriously if permanently injuring yourself and living in the middle of the night, opposite the rest of the world, is really worth it."
good,"A typical day at work was spent monitoring your vendor accounts.  You would review their food orders to ensure their accuracy.  I also was responsible for tracking lost trucks and notifying the vendor with an ETA.  My coworkers were older people who were set in their ways.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining a positive attitude in a small environment with negative people.  U.S. Foods was a company who promoted a team environment, but at times not every employee executes that vision properly."
good,"Very fast paced,Work very hard,get the job done.Getting the food off the truck go down the ramp make sure,It's no damaged items on the pallets make sure all customers are satisfied with their order."
good,U.S. Food Service is a company that is driven to get the work done with limited mistakes as possible.  The benefits long-term are a plus and there is money to be made within the company which is a good thing overall.
good,"As much overtime as you want.."
good,"    My duties at U.S. Foodservice included delivering food product to various customers, while operating equipment in a safe, professional manner, and ensuring a productive relationship between the company and the customers on my route. Additionally, I assisted the transportation manager with administrative duties for approximately nine months. "
good,An employee who worked there longer than I had told a false truth about me. They did not question me or the several witnesses to the event. I was dismissed.
good,"Great opportunity to learn. Very nice and clean work environment. Overall friendly well established and experienced staff. The most challenging tasks often translated to the most enjoyable part of the job. Was once a very reputable company to work for, but job security is a real issue here, regardless of overall company profitability."
good,It is a good organization. Laid back and vetran employees.I can't really say much becausw what i consider good someone else might consider it bad. This organization has your tipical organzational issues.
good,Can be doable work with the proper equipment given. Lack of reasoning on delivery drivers well being getting the proper information needed to do certain stops. Very lack of equipment needed to perform the job much more easily. Great pay and lots of work to keep you making good money.
good,"The office volume is not loud which allows me to work effectively."
good,The standards are way too high in this company. Sometimes you‚Äôll have to run through breaks to make numbers. The pay is good but can be better. The triple pallet jacks are rough.
good,Has Latest Technology and Energetic Team. Undergoing acquisitions and there is some re organization happening because of this. Lacks long term IT vision and direction.
good,"Typical workloads 350 pieces on a light day 700+ on heavier days. Paid very well as the pay is not hourly but component. Get done early, you still made your $. Pay is bi weekly, normal check would be 2800-3k after taxes."
good,The work place is fast moving and being very knowledgeable is a plus. Its s friendly work environment and easy to reach other locations for assistance.
good,Not enough hours in a day for that job. The pay was great hours were to long. Management was okay they handled most situations accordingly. If you are single with no kids and willing to work perfect job for you
good,"So overall it‚Äôs a decent company to work for, management could use better people skills. But if you just keep your head down and work you‚Äôll be fine. If you‚Äôre working night be prepared because it is total chaos!!"
good,Good environment  good  place to work  good  equipment. Clean  environment..friendly  people. Good pay and benefits..must enjoy  the shift hrs.and days off
good,I was very happy at this job. I don't feel that a treated employees with time fairly.  Since going public they lost their family feel.  I did enjoy my time working there.
good,"never felt like i was able to complete my daily tasks. doing a job that is meant for 2-3 people. someone is always mad at you (sales, drivers and/or trans). Poor executive leadership...plenty of town halls but leaders won't greet you in the hallway."
good,the hardest part was Changing Management and Supervisors that came from other companies and did not adapt to the US foods way but. instead force their way on other employees
good,"I learned to use salesforce and about the purchasing and pricing of goods. The job allows you to travel , learn about new items that only us foods sells. Their are many people who have worked there many years and have gone up the ladder. The biggest challenge was having the issues at times with the la mirada sales team and management. I would recommend being a sales associate at this company."
good,It's a fun place to work. Most routes take me around 10 to 12 hours to work. They only issue I have with the place is they are bad about communication.  Warehouse is doing one thing transportation is on a different subject and no one seems to be in sync with each other. If you dont join the union the union drivers will try to run you off. But just wink at them and let them have a bad day because they cant ruin your life haha.
good,"Working for US Foods can be very rewarding, because you are will be generating a lot of data, etc.  However, the workload is very heavy and you will work many long days. US Foods pays market rates, but because of the time put in by salaried employees the pay feels too low."
good,"Working at US Foods is very busy and ever changing. As a Network Engineer, you will work 7 days a week. You will spend most your time in meetings all day with little time to do actual work. I found myself always having to work after hours."
good,"Typical day at work. start off with a meeting everyday, then you would go get your pallet jack. After getting your pallet jack you would go get your order and start your order. "
good,Good place to work management needs to realize we have a life to always a problem if you need time off to take care of personal life and issues but management has no problem taking off but overall good place to work transportation manager was amazing to work for
good,Ok job help take care of my family  learned about routes and time frame to deliver supplies  work good with Supervisor and customer service with great communication
good,The money is good but not good enough for what I had to put my body thru. The managers are puppets that don‚Äôt do anything but try and find a way to place blame on drivers. It‚Äôs all about who you know in there when it comes to getting a route for the day. You‚Äôre not suppose to be able to refuse a route and pick another one but it happens daily I‚Äôve had 2 routes taken from me in a 30 minute span bc senior drivers didn‚Äôt want to the route they were given so I got stuck with a difficult route tried to go to management but I was told they don‚Äôt do that here but clearly they do
good,"your performance is timed in order to hit ""your numbers"". this also affects your pay rate. its extremely hard to safely and properly do your job at that high of expectations. i dont reccomend this job to anybody in fear of somebody getting seriously injured or killed"
good,"I enjoyed working for US Foods for the most part. I enjoy the people. However, my biggest critique is that I feel in my department there was a lot of micro management going on. It felt like we were not trusted to do our jobs although we had proven ourselves over and over again. Additionally, there have been a lot of roles filled by outside people. the majority of the people that are hired are not from within the company and that is discouraging because it feels like they feel the current talent is not good enough."
good,"Company/benefits good.  Team member attitudes, not so much  (Un-willing to train new team members even when Manager insisted). After 2 years, still wasn't trained to do job to full potential."
good,"Overall, US Foods has been a good place to work. I bought my first house while working here. I left a better paying job to come here for quality of life and it was better quality of life. I was able to separate my home and work life."
good,Always moving around never stayed in spot. very physical as far as moving all the time. Picked and packed your own orders. schedule was a great fit for my routine day.
good,If you are self motivated this can be a good career.  It can be difficult to separate work and family time.  This can be a demanding career and one in which you are on call by customers every day.
good,"it was fast paced, in some areas its hot and some are very cold. you need to be physically fit to work at us foods, its a lot of heavy lifting and youre not aware of the end time"
good,"expectations were unrealistic"
good,worked at Alliant for 7 years then USF bought them stayed 1 more year. didnt think the transition process out very well. tried to operate out of 2 warehouses on 2 different systems. didnt have all of the items customers needed in 2nd warehouse.
good,"Very hard job. Delivery, heavy boxes downstairs/ upstairs. Moving heavy pallets without electric jack. Working 13/14 hours almost every day ( sometimes more). It's very hard to get your own route. In time you don't have one, company sending drivers every day to different areas. Some employees are treated better than others .For example. You can work 4 years in company, and somebody who works there for 2 years, have better stops, better truck, lift gate and better equipment, and you both delivery in same area. In company where seniority it's one of the rules...  You are like slave there, no private life when you work for them"
good,when I first started pay was good than declines.worked peace rate as a lumper they added more and more fees for us to work there.and the hours got longer and longer
good,"Garnering new business, taking orders, problem resolution, providing customer "
good,"Delivered food products to customers on route"
good,"Pretty indifferent to company. Department was restructured and eliminated from location. Just like all places, there were good times and not so good times."
good,"the pay was pretty good at the place being that it had a union in place"
good,Had a hard time adjusting to the established processes. They were not documented and very subjective.  The leadership was not united and oftentimes divided.
good,Great work schedule. Great training and continued training.  Great training pay. Management was good.  New and innovative products. Family was important to them.
good,You work 6 days a weeks so you get plenty of overtime and the paychecks are nice but u do work your butt off. It‚Äôs a young mans job bc you start 3am till about 4pm
good,It's a job that requires a substantial amount of physical and mental energy. It pays fair. The benefits are adequate. A teamwork mentality will be required in order to combat occasional stressful issues.
good,Great Industry position in that they are poised to solidify as a strong number 2 behind Sysco and some of the most talented people in their respective roles.
good,"Demanding culture"
good,"Management was horrible, but pay was pretty good. Conditions in the freezer are extreme and causes illness with going in and out of the cold and warmer outside"
good,A stressful job with decent pay. Management could be better and working conditions are cutthroat.  Good pay though but could have more paid sick days.
good,Great company and opportunity for advancement. Enjoyed helping customers with their restaurant needs. It can be demanding to keep up with sales requirements.
good,"‚Ä¢	Responsibilities include buying fresh, frozen and dry products to service the customers of US Foods.  "
good,US foods is the leading provider of foodservice sales in the US.  Located in Allentown PA this location services the mid Atlantic region.  Good location at crossroads of PA
good,The division culture was wonderful; all of the employees were friendly and I enjoyed working there; but the corporate culture had a disconnect with the division and did not foster appreciation with the employees and their career development. There was no avenue for career advancement.
good,"You treat it like it is your own business. I did find the margins that the sales reps got to be pretty low, however you did get nice discounts on food products."
good,its a great job and good hours and you can save a nice lump some of money i think i could have workded there longer but i had to relocate to a diffrent place to llive
good,"Good Place to Work, Many Opportunities to work a Variety of Positions. Friendly Co-workers.Good Benefits Including Health Insurance, Time Off, Retirement Benefits."
good,"Great place to make great benefits. Long work hours, you barely have a social life. In-house opportunities. Very hard for a woman to be in a position of power in this particular environment. You have to be built for it, honestly."
good,ok place to work - hetic schedule. very physical --long days --poor directions to stops good pay ..decent equipment ...management ok --five day work week
good,Order picker-Pick orders from sheets with no miss picks-Use forklift when necessary-Need to work well with others.  Get job done in a timely manner.  One of the old supervisors there was not treating workers fairly.
good,"it  is a very fast paced environment you are rated by how fast you move, there is lots of heavy lifting,but if you have a good strong back and can move very quickly the it  good money."
good,In a nutshell Corporate has made bad decisions that are detrimental to the well being of the Denver division.  They want to have everyone run the divisions the same but we are all different regions with different situations which corporate has never bothered to investigate before making these decisions.
good,The typical day are long. I Iearned how to stack and drive a pallet jack. Management is always around when u need them. The work place cultrue is ok.  The hardest part is keeping my production up. The most enjoyable part is when we had cookout and giveaways.
good,Don't have much to say. Some days were fun. Some days were not so good. Some people were ok. Some people I didn't care to work with. I enjoyed the safety trainings. I liked working outside
good,"Fast paced with plenty of work. Good co-workers. Flex time which makes a good work/family balance,. was able to improve on my Excel skills. I enjoyed the refreshments provided by the company."
good,"Been with the company 5 years, there‚Äôs a lot of change since going public. Don‚Äôt want to get too deep in it, but I used to love my job, it‚Äôs changed..."
good,A lot of body labor and 14 hour days. Management for the most part a good people. Drivers are friendly and very helpful if you ask. Pay is ok but you definitely work for it.
good,over the years it became robotic. Things became less personable and distant. the atmosphere became very political and less people driven. Motivation for many seemed to decline. Many cutbacks internally
good,Great company to work for but atvthe same time its has its pros and cons. To many favorites. Its no equal treatment at us foods.. And a very high turn over rate
good,typical day at us foods brought in alot of good and bad but once the pay changed it was hard to maintain and feel comfortable there and as time went on after i heard it got better and i would recommend for anybody.
good,The work day should be easy however the management makes it a difficult. I enjoy my coworkers but the managers do not communicate with each other or us very well. there is a bit f favoritism
good,hard working job. don't think you can come in there and be lazy. Long hours but good money. once you learn the job it gets a lil easier. Best thing is you get paid every week.
good,"My time there was fun; however, many things have changed.  They have not been able to keep a President in place for more then a few years.  Faces keep changing in all fields."
good,"After a great oreintation all down hill. starting with a low pay rate promise of increase that never happen.Equipment that never showed up, never knowing what the next day held for you. Not very happy."
good,"very stressful and very physical job. the hardest part of the job is you have to lift 50 100 pounds of products constantly. you are rated on quantity bases, not quality."
good,Hardest part of job was truck equipment and long hours.  Pay could have been better.  It seemed as though drivers were not getting paid for the time and mileage put in daily.
good,long hours and very minimal pay. No room to grow. exciting for a first time job. management give little direction. Pay scale is not very good at all. overall average job.
good,"I was a contractor for the company and I was used repeatedly as the scapegoat for management failures.  They would tell you to perform a task and if that ended up being a bad decision they do not hesitate to throw you under the bus.  This isn't endemic through all of management, it is more hit or miss.  It is just unfortunate that there are people in power who are allowed to do this at all."
good,Fast paced union job. Work is done on an engineered standard. If you do not make the standard you are disciplined up to termination. Union was made up of criminal types.
good,Enjoyed my coworkers and the helpfulness of everyone. We became like a brotherhood and will miss our comradely. Fairly easy to pick up overtime and other options with different shifts.
good,This driving job is very labor driven. The sales man are calling you constantly to get to their customer first and to go out of sequence which makes it a challenge since you are digging for product all th time. You can have 3 different sales reps. on your route which can become confusing to the driver not knowing the route.
good,Enjoyed working there - Union work environment. People and friendships created there. Still in touch with a few of them. Positive self motivated driving career.
good,"Good company to work for, lots of advancement opportunities. Pay and benefits are decent. Good environment and friendly employees. Work life balance can be challenging at times."
good,Union does an excellent job fighting for fair wages and good benefits. Unfair labor practices occur far too often. I personally was hit by another driver on the hiway and the company said I could have avoided the accident.
good,US Foods is a great company but some positions are more stressful than others.  My current position requires more than 40 hours per week including nights and weekends.
good,we star with speech of the manager and he talk about the good think and bad thigs of the day before and we star to work after 4 hours we have breaks and the company has nice cafeteria
good,"positive experience, great management team and colleagues.  Rosemont location close to everything.  Nice culture as well.  Collaborative environment, would work there again!"
good,"Since I started 5 years ago, the cultural beliefs have developed and progressed overtime and people seem to care more about implementing them in their daily work lives."
good,"Being a food service buyer is a thankless job, you never get it right.  You almost always have to much inventory for the warehouse to hold or you don't have enough inventory or what exactly the sales force wants when they want it."
good,"The day starts with fielding calls with delivery issues and continues into customer sales calls and meeting with customers."
good,Working at u.s foods takes a lot of hard work very hard work. It requires waking up early mornings and it also requires working late nights DOT rules are enforced.
good,"During the 80's and 90's was a good place to work, from what I have heard now, they have centralized may of their job functions and reduced their headcount at their distribution centers. A very low margin industry that needs to keep costs in line to help drive profits"
good,you work for what you want to earn. Love it. Sysco merger hindered that before FTC denied it. Work- life balance was perfect. You need to have the passion for customer service
good,fast paced    great co-workers  different challenge  everyday able to be home every night  good benefits  able to express concerns about routes and customer needs
good,"The job itself is good. The lack of communication between workers and management does make it a challenge. Pay and benefits are good. There is ample time off between scheduled days off, vacation and personal days."
good,"Opportunity to make good money on commission"
good,"This is a big company, but they still take care of their employees. They have a shop that is there 24 hrs. a day and they keep their equipment running well."
good,After twenty five years at this company I learned all aspects of Sales and Distribution.  Many companies were acquired which distracted the overall focus of the company.
good,"No two days are the same, highs and lows. Positive work environment. Learned a great deal about food distribution. Relaxed dress code. A team environment."
good,This was a great position in sales.  Daily runs to meet restaurant owners to supply foodservice needs. Many restaurants here in the Rio Grande Valley became great clients
good,I get to go to work everyday and oversee the claims for our company.  I make a difference with the employees of our company as well as am able to help make an impact on the overall fiduciary responsibility of the company.
good,Working with US Food was a pleasure. I was productive throughout the whole day. My hours were long but felt very short. Staff and management were pleasant at all times.
good,"Fast paced industry working in a fun environment with new product on a consistent basis.  Diverse account base, strong management team could have been better at coaching on a higher level"
good,"I do not want to review working for this company."
good,They closed the division I was in. It was eye opening.  It paid well.  It was freedom of route. I don't want to tell you more.  This is redundant.  Why are you making me do this?
good,I was the front desk receptionist.  I was also the personal assistant to the CEO receptionist.  I enjoyed working for this company and the work i did for them
good,"very busy place, friendly environment. Good place to work. Management need to take anger management class.Employee's are not always heard need management to listen sometimes."
good,"A typical day would include review of the daily metrics and delivery routes.  Meetings with other department heads to collaborate on projects and initiatives.  Budgeting and financial review.  Staff and one on one meetings with my staff to review metrics and progress on initiatives.  Meet with vendors to negotiate contract pricing for items like material handling and fleet equipment service."
good,In the 4 1/2 years I worked for US Foods I can honestly say that I was able to learn a variety of skills across several departments.  I was never held back in learning other aspects of departments that crossed over to procurement.  I seemed to always stay very busy.
good,"Not a good balance of life/work. Good compensation for getting out there and bringing in new customers, representing the company well, attending food shows, staying on the road M-F."
good,"Was a great company to work for until the last 4 years , they have downsized the company to death .  Laying off long term employees and changing the job titles to compensate for lowering the wages and then offer the job back to employee ."
good,"This is a duplication "
good,I know that I have a lot to learn each new position allows me to be exposed to new things and opportunities to learn from. It is my choice to see things as a new learning experience or something to be annoyed about.
good,"Was a great company prior to going public.   The pay and benefits are still good, but you are now just a number.   Their reorganization efforts have left a lot of great people with years of experience out in the cold."
good,Decent place to work an the pay is great over night job but the management is questionable at best great team of supervisors though.
good,its just an ok place to work. the VP there is a control freak. he runs the company and is a very unethical person and needs help
good,"I worked at US Foods"
good,"US Foods is a rapidly growing company with much potential. The management in the Operations Department is like a revolving door. The constant change in management causes disruption and a lack of accountability/structure. The team members are awesome and pull together to make it happen no matter what the work conditions are. I enjoyed the ""family"" like relaxed environment I was a part of."
good,I have worked at US Foods for over 6 years. When I first started the crew was very experienced and hard working. Originally we work at 6pm to around 1:30am - 2:30am which wasnt bad. Currently half the staff is new and the hours are around 50+ a week (6pm-4:30am). The pay and benefits will sound like this job is well worth it but the work is very strenuous and exhausting and the quota for the week will always be a concern to keep your job. Some people rules apply to and to others they just dont care about. I loved this job when they cared about their employees but now they simply dont. Everyday gets worse and worse. I see my wife for hours a week which isnt healthy. I am constantly depressed and tired. Its a okay job but this is a ship thats sinking quick and nobody cares.
good,Good co-workers and great experience; Company is going through significant change. Very fast paced and exciting industry
good,Good company that regionally has management issues. It is a union company that is good to have but bad also. The coworkers for the most part make it worthwhile to go.
good,Us Foods was a high energy level work place so i learned to balance my off duty time to insure i was well rested to complete the task at hand.
good,Good Benefits but not very personable. It is not a very family friendly company to work for. Other than that it isnt a bad place to work.
good,"The company is no longer in the Greenville area.  Learned a lot about the Foodservice business.  Purchasing department was given a 30 day notice that the department was relocating to Phoenix, AZ."
good,same as the first one on gutting hogs and trimmed pork loins allllll day long. very boring job did the same thing every day
good,My day at work begins with checking all trailers for returns pretrip tractor trailer fill out drivers inspection sheets . I gather all paper and checks and keys . Then I connect my trailers and do walk around to inspect for defect . Then proceed to destination safely following all rules and regulations of DOT. when I arriving at destination fuel equipment break down doubles and check in all returns and ect. Lastly I prepare my round trips for the day
good,"You usually work long hours on a typical day or night."
good,"Drove tractor trailer delivered food to customers, stayed physically fit, if i had any problems was able to go to management and it got delt with good. Worked with other coworkers which was all good and great to work with, hardest part of job was working in all weather conditions.  Most enjoyable part of job was working independently."
good,"This was a great Company, but leadership was playing games with booking income. In 2001 they were sued for Puffing the numbers. It would have been great if they stayed the course."
good,"Okay work environment, offering great benefits to cover for the family although the labor seems to have some issues with unresolved new enforcements"
good,"US Food Severn was a great place to work until about 2009 when two lay offs occurred putting over 30 drivers out of work. There was about 220 drivers at the time because of the work volume, that was hiven to other divisions and underbidded on accounts. There are about 80 drivers and the work is becoming minimal. There's a different transportation manager every 12-16 months who usually gets walked out due to ""not performing job duties"". The warehouse is 60% full of product and there was a memo put out about a ""tentative closing"" in turn  wanting the driver's and warehouse to take a $5-6 pay cut, pay their own benefits and 401K, and lose 3 days of personal time and this is a union facility. I don't see US Foods Severn surviving the next 2-5 years. The glory days are over."
good,"Company is a good place to work for, warehouse loading needs improvement. You get to meet a lot of good workers to work with."
good,"learned computer skills, managing of personnel as well as bid knowledge. built close relationships with several major universities."
good,"No work and life balance, great pay and benefits, challenges in management from Sysco merger, fun employees to work with."
good,"A very team oriented environment with experienced and driven staff. The work can get physically draining sometimes but a good and fair crew makes things easier. Top notch forklifts, computers and other tools."
good,This company has made several changes to it's structure. Changes continue to be made that will effect the future of the company. It was a very exciting company to work for.
good,demanding hours-usually 60 plus; management is ok-just demanding as well as a hands-off approach; most of the drivers are too beat up to enjoy life.
good,"Perhaps it is due to the merger, but the culture has became cut-throat and sales managers have become ""used car salesman"" like"
good,typical day of work begins at 5am ending about 8pm. I learned tobe very organized and always keep records. management could have been more supportive. co-workers don't communicate unless its a self inflicted outside of work. the hardest part of the job was those ridiculous unneccesary early morning meetings
good,Sales was a challenge but training was available. One-on-one made a difference in work progression. Very competitive in the food industry with surrounding vendors...(e.g. Sysco)
good,US Foods is a great place to work. Plenty of opportunity to advance and upper management REALLY care about who  you are and what you do. Some middle management on the other hand make their ambitions known and some but NOT all leave much to be desired.
good,"Very knowledgeable experienced lecturers, diverse culture, lots of opportunity to study.  Although we lived on an island, studied cooking for all parts of the world."
good,Fast and busy work enviroment with room for advancement if you apply yourself. If you are flexible with time there is plenty of OT for hourly associates.
good,"I'd give 4 stars, but the system won't let me."
good,‚Ä¢	Responsible for ensuring product availability through the timely delivery of inbound transportation loads to multiple warehouse locations to maintain a 99.5% or higher service level to our customers.
good,US foods as a whole is a great place to work but there is no training or advancement for new tech or truck systems
good,"Maintain all warehouse aisles.  Keeping free of all trash, wood, and shrink wrap, so workers can select in a safe environment.  Sweeping, mopping spills, breakage, and emptying trash bins.  Run Zamboni throughout the warehouse to keep the dust down."
good,"A typical day at work, extremely busy, fast past environment.  "
good,"It was a pleasant working experience. It was somehow friendly working environment, except for some issues that I did have."
good,Most if not all people you work with are friendly and like family. Be prepared to work long days and make changes in job responsibilities at the drop of a hat.
good,A job to help with college items. It was an experience of very hard work. I needed a job so you have to put things in prospective and keep striving for something better.
good,I love the fact that they look to promote within. If you are a good employee you will get promoted.
good,"Little supervision, but you can always count on your supervisor for support."
good,"The work environment is great. I had a great boss so it made my job easier. As long as I was opening accounts and making money, I wasn't bothered. The work life balance was far off. I was unable to enjoy the money I made."
good,"fun place to work but to many hours, management very supportive, high pressure environment"
good,Better eat your wheaties! Its a cool job but you are subject to injury mainly due to lack of sleep and/or poor lifting tech. Lot of heavy boxes from 1 to 100 lbs.
good,"The job is thankless, but not too difficult. It pays well for what you do. The management is poor; they care little about their people and are only interested in how many corporate buzzwords they can say in one sentence."
good,A very competative environment in which you can go from hero to zero very quickly.  Full commison sales that can produce huge paychecks.
good,good place to work.lots of hours if overtime your seeking ut utirur rirjjd dndjfnfhjj nd
good,Dedicated team environment! Driven to provide excellent service!
good,management don't do there job I lost my job be cause my manager did not do his job
good,"US Foods is (was) a great company to work and grow your career.  But now that US Foods has been acquired by Sysco, the future of US Foods jobs is very uncertain."
good,"I worked here for nearly 6 years. The first 3.5 - 4 years, I was extremely happy there. The management was easy to talk to and the company itself was great. We got company dinners and bonuses and the entire atmosphere was fun and laid back. This was until our division merged with another division, then it went downhill. Management changed and became very hard to deal with. Communication was horrible, there were too many employees and not enough managers to take care of it so when it was necessary to find a manager, they were very hard to find. The accountability started to slip and I became unhappy and found a new job. The warehouse guys and night shift guys I worked with were great. Everyone was funny and nice and I laughed every day durning the 6 years I was there. If management would have gotten better, I never would have left."
good,"I would love to find a career like I had at US. Foods. It provided me with great co-workers, it was a fun job. I enjoyed the hustle and bustle of trying to get my orders out in a safe and timely manner. My supervisors were great. They assisted me in every area possible. The work schedule was the best Sunday-Thursday 5:00 p.m. until all work was complete. The hardest part of the job was working in the freezer where it was extremely cold but as long as you were hustling you could warm up due to working hard. I learned how to be more self sufficient and to be more reliable."
good,"UsFoods is an excellent company to work for, however, if you wish to move any higher than sales, it is very difficult"
good,"Started the day very early which was nice, helped to avoid traffic and ensure return at a decent time."
good,A typical day would be sitting in my office going over orders for each school that ordered food from us.
good,"liked workin 4 days a week"
good,"You get ready with your voice pick and try to get a pallet rider real quick everything is based on seniority. if you don't get one you're stuck with the old ones. some of the other employees are rude but others are nice enough to help you out, management is pretty laid back. the hardest part of the job is the dry region. most enjoyable part is the paycheck."
good,Long shifts with very late information on when your shift will start the next work day. This info may be received at 7pm and they may have you start at 2am and work a 13 hour day.
good,"I enjoyed being apart of this company, great people, learned alot about efficiency..."
good,"Had a long day at work today however very productive. All deliveries were made on time with little to no problems."
good,"    A typical day at work: Sales calls "
good,Over all it was a descent job my reason for leaving was they lost some major accounts and had to cut staff
good,The purchasing department is full of a bunch of lazy people that do not care if they run out of a product. This in turn makes it so the sales force can not sell products.
good,"unloading trailers with mervyn's commodidities.Managers was kool and the enjoyable thing was you could watch tv,play basketball and other games on your breaks"
good,Good company to work for the pay and benefits are good but the management sucks
good,Fast pase and energetic environment. My co workers were great. No room for growth opportunity.
good,Entry Level College Graduate
good,Really good pay with an bonus program. Top pay is really good for this area
good,"I enjoyed working in Inventory Control. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. I did not enjoy working in the Credit Dept. My co-workers were unfriendly and would not even say hello, or good morning, or good night."
good,Every day was some what routine alot of work to but overall a nice work experience for me.
good,"At U.S. Foodservice, service level, safety, speed, and the ability to pay attention to detail was the key. A typical day at work consisted of driving a dual pallet jack down aisles and pulling and stacking groceries all while talking into a headset that gave you the proper amount of quantity needed for each item. You also had labels for every item that was recited via the headset, which helped to verify that the employee was choosing the right item and placing them on the correct pallets. After finishing a batch, you would drive onto the dock area, where you would seperate the pallets, wrap them tightly, then park them near the dock correct dock door to be loaded onto the proper trailer for delivery. You got paid based on your Service Level (Picking Correct Product), Speed (Production based incentives), and overall ability to maintain a certain pace due to the fact of working 6-12 hours shifts Sunday-Thursday. You were able to be yourself while working as long as you were safe, doing your job, and being respectful to your fellow co-workers and members of management. We were allowed to have radios at the dock doors so as you were coming in and out of aisles you were able to hear some of your favorite songs throughout the night, which kept you motivated and energized. It wasn't the easiest job due to the constant picking up and placing of products ranging from 1-100lbs on pallets throughout the night. Not to mention having to walk fast around the pallets while carrying shrink wrap to maintain a tight grip on your groceries as they were to be loaded onto their proper trailer."
good,"it a good place to work if you want to make good money with out going to college.you will work hard,its non stop moveing unless it break or lunch time.i learned to work for 10hr a night i learned alot when it comes working in a real warehouse.i experience being a selector an what come with being a selector.an i was glad to work the for the time i was there"
good,"I earned many bonuses for going over rate. I earned gift cards, hats and a jacket.   I got hurt at work 2 times.  I had to have surgery but they would not allow me to be on workmans comp. I had to come in an sit in the employee lounge for 3/4 of my shift in order to get paid.  Once I got hurt the second time I decided it was time to make a change."
good,The job at us foods was very physically demanding but at the same time kept you in pretty good shape.the hours were long and sometimes mandated to work overtime but the pay was good and you were compensated for it.
good,"Great company to work for. However, if you‚Äôre trying to move up, there is ample opportunity to do so. I think all opportunities lie within the Division. It‚Äôs pretty hard to move up within the Cash and Carry stores"
good,"They will work you to death unloading trucks. But once you get hurt and have to take works comp... Don't expect your job to be there when you get back!!!"
good,It‚Äôs A very good place to work. It is a union job that has great benefits.I would recommend working there if you are a hard worker self driven and in shape. It is a very physical job and a demanding job.
good,"people an work life at this location are cool people teach you a lot but when compensation an there incentive plan thats where the problem happens either you get paid or u get no extra pay as ""promised"" reason i left"
good,It has poor management but they have hard workers good benefits long hours equipment is poor need better maintenance and great deals on product make sure you put money to the side for it
good,It was and okay job. The days are pretty good working Monday-Friday. Management is not the best but you have to manage to do what you got to do. I didn‚Äôt like that you never know what time you get off.
good,I started work usually at 6:00 am finished up around 4.   The hardest part of the job was the way the trailer was loaded.  Somedays I spent more time digging for the product I needed.
good,A good company that forces you to choose family or a pay check.  Seniority has its privileges.  Good leadership and knowledgeable team.  Very customer oriented.
good,People are team players for project work and take accountability for their deliverables and timelines.
good,"All I can say is it's a great company to work for especially because the pay is weekly, but cover yourself because some of the management are very tricky & cut throat."
good,"Very fast paced, amazing organization and training.  The culture was very pleasant.  Very stressful deadlines.  Co-workers always willing to help.  Cannot advance unless you know someone.  Pay is a joke."
good,I enjoyed working with the people at US Foods.  I left for a better opportunity.  Later the position that I was originally hired for came open but I couldn't even get an interview.  I was very highly qualified but after months an email said they were moving on without a chance to interview.
good,very nice place to work. you can work at your own pace and you also have your own truck to work out of.co-workers friendly and easy to help on your 4 day work week
good,"If you don't mind breaking your back to make decent money, go for it. Even though I only worked about 38-42 hrs a week, I had to take naps every day just to stay fresh..Routing was a disaster. I think he would just get bored with consistency or forget how he routed the week prior."
good,"Bad management and no control in transportation, would be a better work environment with new management. The pay and employees are good and equipment ."
good,Usf was a sales driven company. Lots of pressure to penetrate accounts and always open new ones. Had support to help open new new accounts. Products were very good and workrd well for customers.
good,I choose not to complete this section since I believe in confidentiality and do not rate companies.  This is a good company and they all have their differences.
good,"If you can make it in this business, you can sell anything. The most enjoyable part of the job, is being able to work remotely. You must be a driven individual to work on your own successfully."
good,"It was a great place to work until US Foods and Sysco decided"
good,"Leadership is trying to compensate for noncompetitive salary/benefits with a ton of ""perks"" that cost little to nothing (i.e. work from home policy, training run by current employees, etc.). But at the end of the day, salaries are not competitive with other companies in the area."
good,It's long hours and very fast paced. But it's good money and not a long term career. The management not good. It's hard to get days off. It's not a team work company but they say it is.
good,US Foods had a little more of the corporate world with reports and meetings. It could change focus on service years of reps they wanted to company number of reps at anytime.
good,"Cons:  1)  Continuous turnover due to constant reorganizing and over-emphasis on process improvement changes for the sake of changes, not letting people do their normal responsibilities to their best ability.  2)  Management, particularly senior, are salespeople for the culture, and are more distant from subordinates, less about leading and providing direction.  3) Poor training from the start.  While they provide skill training opportunities outside your role, training for your role (from systems to corporate orientation) is skimpy at best."
good,you had to work the job at a 100% when selecting orders and nothing else there were no room for anything other way which proved to be to much for some
good,This is a company with very many unhappy employees and quick turn around. It has very many cliques and is best to keep to yourself and just focus on your work and go home!
good,"* a typical day at work - on Tandem and IBM 3270 systems, prepare, monitor, trouble shoot and escalation for all US food districts and their related jobs"
good,Quick pace job with long hours. Weekend are sometime required to work. Holidays working is a must. Pay is great with lots of perks for your hard work.
good,U.S. Foods is a good company to work for. One of the biggest benefits of working with U.S. foods is that free food and coffee are provided to all employees. Small tokens of appreciation make a huge difference.
good,"driving your route, making between 14--21 stops depending on which day it was. they did train me in house for my CDL-A. . "
good,Be careful working here. Your day consist of starting at 6am but you work until all freight is off the floor. This means you can work between 9-12 hours a day. You also don't get holidays off unless you use your own personal time. Thanksgiving day and Christmas day are the only holidays off. You also work a rotating schedule for Saturdays. This consist of 3 teams that have to work 4 consecutive Saturdays in a row.
good,You have a lot of training but there system in not very user friendly lots of turnover if you like to stay in a cubical all day and not talk to anyone then this is the place for you
good,"learned to work in different area of the warehouse dry , cooler, freezer, move freight with forklift, pallet jack, learned to receive product from outside carriers"
good,"Typical day was answering phones, assisting customers and fulfilling orders as needed, receptionist duties and assisting team members during your slow time."
good,I don't have much to say about this company. They start off great then when you are there for a while they start to treat you unfairly on you like you are a rookie selector at anything you do there
good,"get a case count normally around 60k, they tell you how many people showed up to work and how long it should take to get the night over with if everyone runs at a 100%. i learned a lot about how warehouses function and just how important it is to have everyone doing their job and how the bottom line can so easily be affected by the just a few things."
good,I learned a lot working for this company and I had some advancements where I developed my skills.  I worked in a sales position and a management position.
good,"Great paying job with good benefits. I have never NOT had a raise every year. If you are loyal, you will be shown grace, but also will be used more. Drivers work 4 days a week normally. The exceptions to that is if drivers are short. Home daily, no weekends. The 4 days you work will be anywhere from 11-16 hours with more 12 to 13hrs pr day generally. Exceed rules of DOT. (no hands free devices can be used)"
good,Great experience from my mentor and management. Nothing negative to be said about this company..............................
good,Typical day at work consisted of delivering merchandise to various places. Management was ok. Co-workers were alright. The hardest part of the job was having to run up and down the ramp. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid.
good,"not much more to include. Good products to sell, decent support system behind them. They just need to figure out the merger/buyout situation"
good,"The merger makes USF a difficult place to work. The managers try to do what they can to retain the employees, but they're in the same boat!"
good,drove around a pallet jack to build pallets lifting boxes anywhere from 2 to 95 pounds for between 8 and 14 hrs at a time the management was ok but I asked for more training and was ignored several times some people there were very nice and helpful some unpleasant the job was very physically demanding and best part of the job was pay but the work and home life balance are hard to maintain with the schedule
good,US Foods provided great compensation and benefits to their employees.
good,Typical day consists of driving and delivery of food.  Learned how to travel tri-state area.
good,"Outside sales to restaurants, Hospitals, Nursing Homes.  Responsible for growing new sales and maintaining accounts."
good,Company could be better if they listened to the employees to better the procedures.
good,"Headed up retail marketing for the foodservice distribution to retailers ."
good,This is a difficult job but it does pay well. It is physically and mentally challenging.
good,"Really enjoyed working there when Paul Savage was there. Great customers interactions, but major management issues within my division."
good,"A Houston food distributor. Not as competitive as shown. Many GPO's, but not any support. Working 6 days a week. More about food. Management is lacking. Co-workers are great. Nothing is hard about the job. I liked the tech support."
good,Selecting in the Freezer day usually starts five or five thirty. starts with you putting all your freezer gear to prepare you for one of your most chilliest night. That night is every night when you hop on your pallet jack and prepare for a nights worth of work. You and about nineteen others guys you will need just to help you make it  threw the night. Every one has to be on there job to get there assignment they select in a timely fashion as well correct. Fewer mistakes the better and most important safe. You see and learn routes different places shipments go that your going to be selecting or packing the truck or having something to do with. You will come by a task or to that may slow you up like a product not in they slot and your trying to get the job done in the time you usually get it done at. I just little thing that gets in the way from day to day. Beating the time is the best part of my day every day.
good,"I was hired to be a order selector, and did so for 3 and a half years. I learned how to use equipment such as; forklifts, high rise forklifts, order pickers. I enjoyed working as a team with my coworkers. The managment was lackluster and had a high turnover rate."
good,"Great upper management, willing to teach and propose ways to advance to next level."
good,"from early am til 6pm- you are in constant demand.calls,deliveries and placing orders.great oppurtunity to meet lots of good industry individuals."
good,"Overall, my position at this company was very interesting and gave me many opportunities to both utilize my existing skills and learn others. The co-workers and management were excellent to work with. Many days were spent not only managing calendars and meetings, but also arranging meeting rooms and office space for unexpected visitors, a common occurrence at a location near a major airport."
good,"fun place to work, very fast paced environment great pay, must be willing to pull the work load, they do a lot for there employees from free meals, parties"
good,It‚Äôs a great company to work for if you value great pay after a hard weeks work. The healthcare is almost unmatchable at any other company it‚Äôs amazing. Your work/life balance is where you sacrifice. I worked there almost 5 years I would recommend to anyone that needs a great paying job and lots of hours! Managers change frequently but most are wanting to work as a team.
good,Equipment is old and unreliable. High stress level and a lot of hard work and provides exercise. The hard work keeps you in shape.The compensation is good and the Union benefits are great. The Union is very helpful. Must use personal vehicle to cover residents in other cities and towns. Grand Junction for example but in the state of Colorado. Management needs more comunication.
good,Its a good place to work they're to hard on the new selectors. Please make them fill like they're part of the team. It would also be better if adjustments were made in the freezer.
good,fast-paced work place. easy to get lost in the work. support always available. management could be improved. work from home schedule available in this position but not flexible days you choose.
good,"The pay and benefits are great but the back pain, heavy lifting, excessive walking and rude customers can make your days hard. Theres not much room for advancement!"
good,The work environment has been transformed to an open work space which allows for more dialogue and collaboration.                                   e_
good,"If you have any physical problems this work pace will be difficult for you. lots of bending down, moving up and down ramps, and heavy lifting; they do warn you about it but not to the extent they make you work."
good,"Very fast paced environment, great training and very nice corporate office.  Management was difficult at times however you will learn quickly and you will be given good tools to use."
good,Gather all your equipment drive to your location deliver your goods. upper management is hit or miss depending on the delivery days or locations and load. The best part of the job is working by yourself 99% of the time and almost all of the customers have been great.
good,"I checked in local and out of town drivers. Logged in checks and money orders using Excel program. received and recorded damaged product, retrieved wooding pallets and cleaned out trailers for the next driver. restocked good product to be reused and threw out expired or damaged product. Reported inventory for replenishing purposes. Recorded and thing through out shift and prepared everything for the next shift"
good,"Most enjoyable, aspects of my work:"
good,"I liked working here, and probably would not have left if the storm back in 2014 didn't require workers to relocate to Memphis or Louisiana. At the time, I could not risk a relocation, as I had just accepted an associate pastor position at my church, and my mother became deathly ill. "
good,"It's not a bad job, but you have to be certain people to really advance in the corporation. You basically work all holidays except for Christmas, Thanksgiving and sometimes New Year's"
good,This was a fast paced job that required alot of hours but you can make alot of money. This job keeps you in shape and a great workout. Benefits were outstanding
good,The Sales Coordinators Manager was a new position driven by the company's deployment team. The program was driven by the metrics of a trial territory with this new role.
good,"it was ok just didnt have alot of time to spend with my family. had to get up at two or three oclock in the morning and when i did get off i had to go to sleep at 6 and right back at it again,"
good,"Though the foodservice distribution industry grows increasingly competitive by the day, US Foods continues to lead the industry with innovation and ongoing training and product development."
good,need to be able to multi-task and balance several areas of the warehouse with little assistance. Interact constantly with your employees to assure that the trucks are all loaded on time.
good,Laid back job. Nothing too hard just wrapping pallets all night. Management was awful and full of unprofessional people. Hiring is awful and not professional but overall its a nice paying job.
good,"Good company culture with pretty good benefits... competitive in nature but with ability to make bonuses and win prizes. Good people.   Management is good, and there is support for you if you work hard and bring a new idea to the table."
good,"They gave an opportunity even though I was new to the work field. It was a pretty decent job but slowly started to decrease. Work was always there even on slow days there was something to work on. They were willing to teach and train but only to a certain extent. It was more physical and ""learn as you go"" training but help was always provided. It wasn't the hardest job but an alright place to start."
good,"Customer service for National accounts.  A typical day includes checking for late trucks and notifying customers. Updatng customers  if any changes to delivery times.  Check CS email inbox and processing any requests.  Taking and checking orders tor stock outs and working with customer to see if subs are available.  Most national accounts are on locked down order guides. so similar subs may not be available and in this situation, notifying customer of outs to adjust orders if needed.  Responsible for assigned accounts and making sure orders are in before cut off time. which may require a follow up call to see if order is needed.  Checking my orders that are electronically submitted also checking for outs and available subs.  Working with Account Executives with our National accounts.  Working with transportation to get product to customers, either off day delivery or couriered to customer. Occasional interaction with procurement on product availability, attaching items to accounts.  Work with a staff of 6 reps to service our customers as a team member."
good,Worked there for 2 and a half years as a territory manager and loved it. The only reason I left was due to the possible sysco buyout and merger so there wasn't much job security at the time.
good,"Heavy lifting; not a place for someone who's ""afraid"" of hard work.  Your day starts early and ends late.  Supportive supervisor.  Most difficult part of the job was managing ""not so nice"" customers; however having good customer service skills smooths that out quickly."
good,"There is no stable environment. Company management always changing something including company vision, working environments, resources. In 11 years IT department moved 5-6 times to different locations, Each team is using its own software, there is no standards. They want us to do the advanced development on outdated hardware, operation systems and software. Since went public company already layed off 10% of employees and another 10% force reduction will be in December 2017. Last menagement directive is to move everyone from cubicals to the plain tables, sit next to each other to save space and feet more people on the floor. There is no privacy any more."
good,This is a great paying job. Their pay is for selecting is probably unlike any other out there but their expectations and requirements to hit those high quantities of money definitely wont come in easy. Its on tough job
good,"Company has a lot to offer and they are willing to promote from within. I enjoyed my time with them, however lots of things happened once the possible merger with Sysco began.  Since then they have lots of management issues and stop thinking of theirs employees and starting looking at the bottom line."
good,Its big on safety. Its a lot of work. I enjoy it. Good career job. management is great. They will work with you when possible. Ive learned a lot about problem solving. You are independent. If you like working alone its a great job for you. Can be frustrating depending on your character.
good,Typical order selector position. Only issue I had with this position was their weekly disciplinary process for mispicks and shorts. Very challenging to reach their time based production standards sometimes had to skip breaks. But overall good unionized company with great benefits.
good,"My day started at 6am, I worked in a freezer receiving and putting away product. My co-workers where easy going.The hardest part of this job was there was no advancement the job you had was the job you kept. The most enjoyable part was that the job had a day-in and day-out work load and it was a non-challenging job."
good,"order selector, stacker, fast paced. The hours did not work out for family reasons"
good,Over all it was an ok job.  But I think I can do better with the past military expierance.
good,Good management team. People very pleasant. Workers took pride in job they did.
good,"long shifts,different tempatures.Different areas in the warehouse.Bad managers,fun co-workers like a family,managment an being switch around on different shifts.Good family like co-workers"
good,"work never stops, learned something new everyday, fantastic co-workers. Working with customers was most enjoyable"
good,I enjoyed working for this company and I would go back. There could be some changes enforced when it comes to management and their lack of involvement. I did enjoy the co-worker I became team player with and the hard work they provided was a positive for me.
good,Great pay depends on your location travel can be extensive if you don‚Äôt like running this isn‚Äôt a job for you it very fast paced and high demanding but great incentives
good,"Union environment, Fast paced, Tons of pressure, Very stressful. Very busy. All the time. I‚Äôll put it to you like this, It‚Äôs a hostile environment in the sense that it‚Äôs a tropical island, Sand beaches, Beautiful views except that it‚Äôs hurricane season. Everyday."
good,It was a challenging place to work. The temperatures in the freezer were brutal. I enjoyed the fast pace and detail to perfection. My fellow workers were freindly and so was the management. I was there 15 years and had dedicated mt life to the company. Missing out on holidays and spe ial occasions.
good,"It‚Äôs not the most exciting job, but it helps paid the bills. The management needs to make some few changes and also bring more Blacks, Hispanics and others into the company. By doing that, I believe US Foods have a chance to be number one in the foods industry."
good,US FOODS was a great experience for me it was my time working inside a warehouse setting job the labor was kind of hard but once my body got used to it it was just fine
good,"As a driver at us food you can exspect to be paid very well but also you will be working for every penny. the schedule is very unpredictable and long hard hours,"
good,"I liked to job overall, it was just a lot of issues needed to be addressed that wasn't. They was good about recognizing good but downed the one whom wasn't as good in front of other employees"
good,"Great place for work hours and benefits. Management not the best for seeing through on issues.You start as extra and have to put your time in. Florida US foods has its team together and works with drivers, Denver not at all."
good,"I really wish that this type of job with the pay it offers is available where you can have more down time. The only thing that makes me consider another job is the work-life balance. You either chose to leave and find another job that may not pay you enough to accommodate cost of living or settle for this job and not be as happy. Other than that, I actually enjoy the work for the most part."
good,Us foods provides a good working environment with an emphasis on safety.  they also provide good vacation time and understanding for needing time off or to come in late due to family situations.
good,I enjoyed the benefits of the job but not the mundane routine. I prefer to be active all the time instead of sitting in a truck for 8+ hours a day. The shuttle position isn't for someone who doesn't enjoy routine days.
good,"When I worked at U.S Foods, I liked the job and the pay but, I felt managers had preference over certain workers and you had to earn your spot at that time. All in all, it was a good company to work for because it gave a lot of overtime and excellent benefits. If asked to work there again, I would."
good,"Day is usually crazy between phone calls and emails, but as long as you can keep organized it works out. Unfortunately, not everyone in the department worries about that and work falls into someone else's lap. Management is better than some other places I've worked, but communication is a problem between departments and when you're dealing with a customer who is screaming at you because the order was wrong again it's frustrating to have to wait until someone feels like helping with the issue."
good,US Foods & Comcast was staffed by manpower....I title fr this position was administrative assistant This job was amazing i corporate. Free lunches a lot benefits in the corporate office!
good,Good company to work for but going through lots of changes. First two years was great then I got new management which wasn't great.
good,"I enjoyed my job to the fullest.and wish i was still employed with them,i met so many different people in resturant and hospital delivery."
good,us foods was a good company at the time the management was lousy and the hours were long and hard but overall it was a good experience
good,"Company is well respected in the industry, has a highly performance culture. Company has an excellent culture that is found in all departments."
good,Great place to work. The people I have had the pleasure of working with are amazing. The hiring managers do a wonderful job of creating a positive atmosphere of hardworking people that fit the US Foods culture.
good,"Hard work always non stop witch was great for me learned how to really be a team player, the hardest part was working 14hr days."
good,work day around 10-12 Hours
good,"This was a great job for anyone with experience in the field. I personally picked it up pretty quick and it was easy to be motivated to work with a 22.90 starting pay. The only problems are the managers were often lazy and had forgotten the job can be very difficult and it was purely seniority based so the only way to move up the ladder is for people above you to retire, quit, or get fired. All three of those are rare occurrences."
good,US Foods was a very great and hard jobs long hours Worx tools tips agency with US Foods for a year long hours sometimes for 4 in the afternoon until about 7 in the morning depending on some nights depending on the flow of work some nights were slow so but all in all it was a great show nights were fast
good,I enjoyed working at US Foods. Everyone got along really well and I made friends for life. The job was not difficult and the hours weren‚Äôt bad. I would work here again.
good,Team members helped the new employees. As long as you dress properly for the varying temperatures there isn't really a problem. You learn to drive the jack pretty quickly
good,"Us. Foods was a great place to work for years.  The division President believed in his team, supported the employees and allowed us to grow with the company."
good,"Work place being an order selector was not the best.  Being in a warehouse all night with nobody to really talk to is not an ideal work situation.  On the there hand, this job is a secure job where you can be working full time and be making a solid amount of money."
good,Once I got hired I seen how screwed up the management was at the company and inorder to get anything done you had to go out your way to talk to someone over getting it done.
good,A good place to work if u like that type of work and plus good money. Get paid every two weeks. More than 40 hours a week. U can get direct deposit or a check.
good,Is great place to work in fort mill division need better management I like my job 13 year of hard work still would work for us foods defend division Columbia sc division
good,"Good people work there, just need management training or school. Great benefits, salary, overtime, they treat you good with food and candy desserts. Always open, food companies always open."
good,"This was a great experience , but I would like a more challenging position.  I have learned a great deal and would like to use this experience further."
good,It's a company filled with great people and talent.  It's unfortunate some of those people are losing their jobs to a company re-organization
good,"A typical day at work consists of going and grabbing trucks and trailers from the dock taking them over to the fuel island and checking everything on them and doing upkeep for them then parking them out in the yard."
good,very great place people friendly great place for you to build something up for your family the pay is great so are the benefits stay focused and you will go far in this company
good,"Pay was weekly and got paired good for the work done, hours are good you start early but can get done early. Good Trainee program and benefits are good with decent 401k"
good,"Fair, relaxed, and productive I would recommend this job for someone looking for long term position. You can learn a lot of skills that will be useful."
good,every division is different in hours and pay i worked 14 years for one of the ones in okc. i started at 9 an hour and after several different pay scales i went from 16 in 9 months then about 5 years later they changed again and i started making 25plus an hour.
good,"Opportunities to advance and learn new skills.  Opportunities for professional development and professional growth within the organization.  Clean, safe, and positive work environment."
good,Location and campus is great . Staff lead much to be desired not good for employees with family. Work/life balance is getting better but not quite there yet since going public.
good,"The current leaders lack experience. What once was an amazing place to work,  is not. They do not put safety first, when it comes to the drivers. Favoritism is part of the new culture."
good,"Typical Day... Hear Case Count, Fight for a jack that works and doesnt already belong to someone else. i learned how to stack like a pro regardless of what comes next. management sucked when i was there, it was always a matter of fighting for time(total time of ordered given) with them. the hardest part was trying to stay ahead on my rate. what i mean by that is; orders were easy you learn your enviornment and all so it just comes natural to finish before times up and continue the process, so if thats the case why was i always behind time and continously arguing to justify myself to prevent getting written up for rate. while others could literally chill for more than 30 mins and still make rate. simply for being cool with the supervisors who ""hook them up"" as they would say. the Most enjoyable part would be driving the triple jack while bumping music and picking alongside your homies who made it more exciting by competing with one another while making good money,"
good,Corporate culture was too politicized.  More concerned with programs and promotional strategies than basic customer service.
good,Selling new and innovative products to a diverse customer base.
good,Worked as a stocker. Enjoyed the customers and the environment. Did not enjoy the leadership that the store was under. False sense of advancement in the company.
good,"Started as a great place to work, Started as a driver and worked up the ladder to become a senior dispatcher. And was falsely accused "
good,At US Foods u start your day getting your equipment and filling out all pre shift forms. You then go to a start up meeting with your supervisor and co workers. This is the only time you have to interact with your supervisor and co workers. Leaving the start up meeting you get your first order and continue to work until the shift is over. You have to maintain 100% work performance base on their standards. If your under you have to work thru your breaks to make up time.
good,"Great benefits"
good,"I enjoyed working at US Foods as a Territory Manager and learned LOTS about the foodservice industry and Distribution.  I really enjoyed my coworkers - many of which came from other industries like me.  It is a well paid job but be prepared to work at least 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  You are expected to be on the road every day and you are expected to grow your business significantly every year."
good,stressful to place to work. management could be better and do better.Worse managementI done seen in years. they expect the most from every individual. the work is really hard and they don't give you enough time to do the work.
good,Wonderful place to work until the pending merge. Too many changes too fast came as a result. Reduction in force caused employee relations to be strained.
good,"US Foods is a good company to work for , but the management is horrible , especially in Customer Service. Constantly over worked and because of the pay , they feel the need to give you more work to where eventually you don‚Äôt get paid enough"
good,"Head chief had lack of knowledge of foods and ingredients, was no help at all and doesn‚Äôt take the job seriously. And also racist. Poor instructor and barely knew what was going on with so many missed days"
good,Absolutely no work/life balance. Work at least 6 days a week and late every night. management provides no assistance outside of main office area.
good,"You always needed to be working on opening new business and checking your email. You spend alot of time trying to collect money from customers and delivering will calls to help the customers out when there was a screw up. Great ""Center of the Plate"" training.program. Customer Service Representatives that handled the phones and the Will Call Guys were awesome! The hardest part of the day was when you had to really hustle get the orders keyed in before cutoff. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was cold calling new prospects and visiting with existing customers that really appreciated you for your hard work."
good,"I drive and call on restaurants and continue to develop strong relationships, and over time these customers become friends.  Those relationships are the most rewarding part of my job"
good,Working with DM to help them grow their sale and profit. Hiring the right people for the right job follow up with the training to keep the sales team focused on growing there sales and profit
good,You make good money only if you work overtime. Be prepared to work in unsafe conditions and unsafe loads because main objective is to get products out. They have a talk straight policy but if you do you will be chest ties discreetly for it. Also don‚Äôt look for higher ups to talk straight at lease in transportation in the Norwich branch.
good,The company is not the best to work for the quality of there work and performance is unethical  to respectful  management is very very disappointing doesn't care about what is going on
good,If you have a family an or kids us foods is not the place for that. We go in at 4pm and are not off until the work is complete. The hardest part of the job is working overnight
good,"Time is money working there. The faster you work the more you get paid, but it can take a toll on your body over time. Good start for people in their early 20s or saving up for school, etc. Not much career advancement unless you have some degree for dayshift position or plan to work in a warehouse for the rest of your life."
good,"Good company to work for. Not meant for everyone to be able to handle the fast pace. Productivity base pay, which was one of the great things about the job."
good,"You are required to work ridiculous hours and not compensated for it.  Your boss only works a few hours a week, while we work every holiday, weekends, etc."
good,Great place to work for those motivated for a well earned paycheck. When it comes to a balance of life with the things that matter...  This may not be the place for all.
good,The hours at US Foods are way pass regulation for the breaks given to you while working. That is the reason that your work /life balance is very poor here at Us Foods.
good,Fast paced work with great pay and benefits. Great team and safe working environment. Incentive based pay optional. Not much room for advancement and seniority based.
good,"Fast paced, stressful, great pay!"
good,"productive ,good place to work,learned how to work better as a team,work better in a fast pace work place,leaned to work with management,leaned to work on more one thing at one time,learned to be a leader"
good,Early start with long days of work benefits are great . management need a little bit of work. The hardest park was getting use to late nights and early mornings
good,"There are many changes the the position.  A typical day of work was working with Division and Regional Sales Managers.   The most enjoyable part of the job  with working with Sales and the customers to get the orders and food delivered as promised."
good,"Amazing company. Super competitive. Revolving door of upper management. Demanding, High pressure, Impractical LONG training compared to actual job. Don't get comfortable"
good,It's an OK place to work. Most of the staff is fair and positive for the most part. Percentages for selectors need to be reworked. Numerous time I have brought it up but nothing hasn't been done about it. Manpower is quite low. Turnover rate is ridiculous. The benefits and pay are positive. Currently looking for better work.
good,Enjoyed working here prior to being terminated because of a no call no show due to incarceration even though I notified my supervisor the night of my incarceration...all my acquired vacation and holiday pay was taken without even being discussed of the nature of my termination. I feel I was wrongfully terminated without even being given a chance.
good,"Typical work day is 2 am to when you get done"
good,"Good company to work for but my only issue was there was no upward mobility or career advancement, and im at the point where management is where I would like to be"
good,As a shuttle driver you get paid less then the route drivers and you don‚Äôt get as many hours. Pay checks are low but the benefits are awesome. If there‚Äôs a route driver position available I would jump on it they pay great(26$ per hr) and overtime after 40.
good,"Management is mostly supportive. Benefits need improving based on the size of the company . Corporate and divisions have different holiday benefits and should be the same across the company. Overall, a great place to learn new skills."
good,"Would  not  refer  anybody  to  apply    To many surveys  that do jot get answered  "
good,Overall a Good company. Their current leadership on the operations side needs attention. Lost great people because of them and did nothing to try to keep them.
good,"my job was mainly on the reach truck replenishing stock. I mainly worked alone which was fine with me, and it was normally a nice flow. management was great at communicating daily task and easy to talk to. hardest part of the job was when we had to push out a high volume of freight which was expected of us so I had no problem which it."
good,each day was new and I loved it. they have a great amount of back stabbing and wrong doing to their employees ... especially if you are not on the special team
good,"great place to work"
good,There a lot of sacrifice of time dealing with this job. You have to learn to move fast and work hard because if your performance is not up. You can be cut quick.
good,its hard work. its great pay and long hour. management is okay but don't know the job first hand. so its hard to get them to understand some situations that comes about.
good,you start time depends on the route. The routes are bid on every year. you bid by seniority. For the most part your route is always the same unless asked to fill in.
good,"Challenging work environment and very competitive. You are compensated well if you work hard. for the most part Management was pretty good, only a couple of bad apples were promoted towards the end."
good,"industry leader in technology, recently went public, cuts in commission and limited sales opportunity, changes in personnel, not great scores in recent employee survey with job satisfaction."
good,"A good work environment, but don't expect to get your dream home based on your work compensation.  Managers are great and actually have a heart.  Very unusual in the corporate environment."
good,"I enjoyed this job, they do have a mandatory overtime rule.  I would work with them if I was still able to work an overtime schedule.  I would also return if they didn't force overtime."
good,"An average day at work was routine. I was proficient in my job duties. I help trained new hire on how to pull orders, read pick sheets, and stack pallets with pulled orders."
good,If you are willing to work hard and under pressure this this is a good job to have. You will have a tight time frame to make your deliveries in. Late morning starts and early to late evening finish.
good,"My position is a very physically demanding job. Its competitive production based pay. The pay is good, and they supply inhouse cooked meal from time to time."
good,"good benefits, changes in company led to my position being moved to another location after 10 years"
good,"Hard work, but it pays well friendly co workers and some friendly customers. Pays the bills and helps me take care of my family more. Only bad thing is working in all kinds of weather; including rain, sleet, snow and blazing hot weather."
good,"As Territory Mgr it was my responsibility to meet with current customers, introduce new product and right orders.  Seek to gain new business by cold calls and referrals.  District Mgr was supportive but, support at corporate level was lacking."
good,Great company to work for until takeover by another company. Good products which help the environment but dangerous work environment for route salemen
good,I would call on new and existing customers to collect orders and demonstrate new products.  With new products we were able to keep menus fresh.  We also delivered our own products through an Express delivery system.
good,I really enjoy working with my customers.  I enjoy helping them with any problems that they may come across.  I have met some amazing people that have made work more fun.
good,I would just go in work along with the nice people that work there
good,"Receive inbound calls and place outbound calls to customers in order to provide information about products and services, to take orders, or to obtain details of complaints."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to come in and get a head set, grab my pallet, stretch and off to picking. "
good,I would call primarily on restaurant and education facilities needing my products.
good,"Excellent Benefits, long days and a good job for those who are organized and accountable. Many 6 day work weeks, but reasonable compensation for the top salespeople. Great incentives for top sales."
good,"The job itself is enjoyable, and flexible where you run your schedule, managing your own accounts."
good,"US is a very challenging job with many avenues of learning new things each and every day. The support of the customer service team, the procurement department and the IT department is incredible. My challenges are working with the credit department and having to depend on the customer having perfect credit to move forward with the accounts. The collection of 'past due' accounts is the hardest part; to be the 'bad guy' then have to still be the 'good guy to buy from' is the most challenging skill to master. I thoroughly enjoy the interaction with the customers, building relationships that could last a lifetime. The thrill of tackling their challenges and being able to be a part of their operations."
good,"Good company to work for. I worked independently, had my own office. My job was to ensure my clients received good customer satisfaction from our company. I made sure the customer was happy with our service. I was responsible for any new product they wanted on their menus or taken off of their menus. I made sure they received their product in a timely manner by working with the vendors. i made sure my many clients stayed with US Foodservice for many years."
good,"Successful and dynamic organization.  Energetic and passionate Leaders, growing organization, leading the business in value added services for its clients."
good,Us foods require you to start early mornings. Something that the body an mind probably want get us to. But over all it's a good job with pretty good benefits
good,How is the loader? position there how much they make every two weeks ? Is it easy how is the diagram map setup? How many trucks you have to load a night
good,As long as you work hard enough and long enough for production pay. Cold environment dress warm and learn fast it's a experience for some who like warehouse work.
good,i was with is foods 20 years.  promoted twice.  grew my skill set with coaching form my supervisors.  traveling was not as glamorous as you might think
good,"Great place to work. Very organized PMO office."
good,Had a great time. Hard work but well worth it. The people I worked with was great. Mangers helped out with us and training was spot on. I just wanted to learn more
good,The internship was great but the climate is very political. Rubbing elbows with the right people is a big part of this work culture. Only a small percentage of people at the corporate office are actual employees - the rest are contractors.
good,It's a great company to work for but the division I work for in particular has issues in the warehouse and needs a strong overhaul of how they do things.
good,"Working with restaurants and customers is a great way to get to know the community more and learn about great food. I wasn't hired directly through US Foods, but was rather a hired contractor who would work to give customers information and instruction about using their online tools."
good,"Learned a lot of great things about this type of business. Was able to save the company thousands of dollars and able to improve security and operations. This included better equipment, quality VHS equipment and savings through combining refrigeration compressors to shave electric units. Changing of lighting from high use bulbs to low led lights."
good,Was very high demand and physical. Staff was friendly and would help when needed. The quota was a little harsh. Opportunity for advancement if dedicated.
good,I don‚Äôt anything bad to say about US Foods it‚Äôs a great place to work but be prepared they will set you up to fail in a minute training is terrible well some trainers are terrible they know you‚Äôre not properly train but they are so quick to sent out by yourself the trucks are always loaded wrong I can go on and on but i want
good,I dont have much to say about the company. They were more then fair with all of their dealings with me. That interview was quite awhile ago. I can barely remember it to be honest.
good,Good smooth fast paced environment. The type of work aims more at youthful individuals who want to make good money. Management is great and co workers are also.
good,Work was fast paced and intense. Limited supervision. Have to be self motivated to keep up. Management was supportive but not very helpful once the load was out and you've already received it
good,"This was a temp job. Therefore, I am unable to sufficiently answer many of these questions. Please do not pay attention to how I respond here because I wasn't there very long."
good,"Good company, good benefits. Lower end of the pay scale for experienced professionals. Very junior middle management. As the saying goes, people leave bad managers."
good,US Foods is an excellent employer with focus on growth in the market through e-commerce and innovation. The leadership team believes in mentoring and cultivating talent from within.
good,"I enjoyed my time at US Foods. Then after being with the company for 7 years, upper management changed and our positions were eliminated and the position was relocated to Minnesota. If I wanted to keep my job I'd have to reapply and move to Minnesota."
good,This is a hard working fast pace job. It becomes a major part of your life. They want you to give them your blood and tears. They basically want your life.
good,It was a good job they just had poor management. they let the building shut down because we couldn't agree on a price for our new contract and they were trying to kick the union out so they shut the hole building down.
good,"good job, great benefits, cool staff, holidays are off n u get family time. management is rough around the edges and sometimes rude. but overall great place to work"
good,"Nice people, old technology, no DB2, mainframe can be slow at month end, slowing work down.  nice cubilces. management is pretty good.  most enjoyable part of the job was the people were nice"
good,always trying to improve which makes this a great company to work for.  ability to make a lot of money if you are good at cold calling and searching out good accounts.
good,They get paid Incentive depending on how good you are you can make a lot of money or less and I mean it could be a 10-20k difference from your other employees. They have freezer cooler and dry dept. Availability on where you will work varies depending on who is leaving or staying in their position. you get money deducted by mispicks and shorts. Also their is no definite time off it is based on how many cases is being picked and if your co workers will work hard or not.
good,"Fast paced work, was a typical day. "
good,"I typical day of work starts early with preparation.  The price of food changes everyday and every customer has different needs.  I went through 12 weeks of food training that was amazing.  It was micro managed, but I think that industry needs that because of the complexity of the job."
good,"This job is hard on your body and if you are not in good health this job would be tough. If you like hard work this job would be for you, but if you are looking for a easy day it would be all up to you."
good,My average day consisted of driving locally and semi-regional. The day consisted of 10-14 hours and was poorly managed by giving false dispatch times and bad routing. The workplace culture was fair. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours on a day to day basis and that got old fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was my pay and the great benefits that they had to offer.
good,"It was fun to learn about the business side of restaurants and foodservice, my coworkers were great, customers were loyal, my manager was available for questions and ride alongs"
good,"Overall good place, some supervisors play favorite's but what can you really do. Long hours but with good pay. Only bad part was they force you to go into another department once you finished all your pulls for the night and it slows down your overall time because your in an unfamiliar area."
good,Filled invoices by going through the warehouse via pallet jack. Learned order selecting. Management was strong and very knowledgeable as was the employees. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting but never seemed to stop me. The most enjoyable part was they allowed us to listen to headphones making the workday much easier and less mundane.
good,"""One thing I love about this company is we don't shy away from feedback. We tell people what they need to know to be the best version of themselves and I really appreciate that."""
good,Fast paced work environment. Typical part of day is spent on the phones and speaking with customers to help assist in issues related to product supply or routing.
good,The company is okay to work for management okay hours good work until done  ..... benefits was okay the hardest part was when people layed out then your all over the place there was no enjoyable part about the job you just came did your job went home there just not friendly people that work there....a typical day can be stressfull if you let it... all in all it was a job
good,"US Foods strives to keep kitchens cooking by helping customers inspire, attract, and optimize their business. This is done through an extensive product catalog and value added services."
good,"typical work day can be intense at times, you need to be able to work well under pressure and work in both a team environment as well as independently"
good,"Everyday was a new challenge, I would show up to work at least and hour early everyday and work from beginning of shift to the end each and everyday, I would say working at US Foods was some of the best days in my life while working there."
good,"Experience in creating sales reports, forecasting, tracking for sales support. Planning and implementation experience for marketing events such as local food and trade shows and available to travel to meet current and/or potential customers."
good,"Great work environment to work in, plenty of opportunity to advance you are provided the tools and knowledge  to be successful in completing daily task."
good,Job was good. Managerial staff was nice and knowledgeable.  Very relaxed environment.  Great learning experience for someone looking to get a career in this field
good,"good people, fun environment, professional atmosphere"
good,Worked as a food broker in partner with us foods. Great management and sales representatives to work with. Very organized company to be partnered with.
good,"Overall this is a good comany to work for. Culture, people, pay, benifits good.   However, can be stressfull at times due to always being short staff.  Senior Leaders and Managment  leadership is  poor Managers are very disengaged."
good,"Us foods is a great job because you get paid off your production, meaning that they use a percentage scale to pay you. The higher your percentage the more you get paid and vice versa."
good,I left in May of 2011. I know that the company made some deep cuts across the country in an effort to improve bottom line. The company has become more sanitized and less personable.
good,"US Foods was a great place to get a start on my sales career. Great people, great products and a fair place to work.  I wish that the merger new with Sysco was never announced."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is working with the people of this company!  Quite a few changes in the past year with the company going public.
good,Started in 2000 as a order selector and have been promoted thru out the operations department.  From warehouse supervisor to director of transportation.
good,Great place to work. Great benefits if hired Full time. You work hard for the money you make. Advancement possible in company.
good,"Always something new and different to experience.  Though some activities are the same daily, there is always something different about it to make you stay on your toes."
good,"Very professional employees that help customers have a better understanding of their individual business. Nice innovative, industry leading products that set them apart from the competition."
good,I wish i was still working for this company they laid me off because i was the last person hired and the new President needed to make cuts

good,very fun work atmosphere great staff great company great equipment to use to make sure your job is done safe and correct. benefits are great compensation is great.
good,"Day was spent on the road, working with accounts and prospecting new ones. Learned how to not take rejection personally, and that persistence often paid off. Worked with the best people in the industry, co-workers often helped each other out.  Management was very supportive; training was given often to help with job performance.  "
good,Had a lot of fun here especially as supervisor. Had a great relationship with all my drivers. Learned basic computer skills but excelled at Xata editing.
good,The company was changing the food industry by continously adding new food items to change the way restaurants sell their food.  Technology was also a big push within the company and for the customer.
good,This is a great job for physically fit person who doesn't mind getting up early. You have to check your load make sure safety requirements are met and have to be delivering good to customers in a timely and friendly manner.
good,I developed my own territory and developed relationship with key individuals. Learned to customize strategies for each customers. Management gave tools to serve my customers in an efficient way. My co-workers worked as a team to serve our customers in a professional manner. Products under special ordering such as equipment had a difficult processing structure.  I enjoyed consulting with customers and assist them in their success.
good,"Foodservice is a very simple business.....get the right products to the customers. As simple as it sounds there is an enormous amount of activity going on behind the scenes to make it all happen. Over time you learn what to watch out for but everyday is different and challenging. No matter how ""good"" you are you will always feel there is something else that needs to be done. The key is to work with a good team because it truly is a team effort."
good,I was a territory manager catering to independent restaurants. I enjoyed the interaction with the owner/operators. The independence that was afforded to me was enjoyable as I was free to plan my time to best take care of my clients.

good,"Responsible for sales, G.P. and growth of my ""Territory."" Responsible for A.R and collections for each customer account."
good,The work was hard for time to time but as long as you can work fast and productive you should be fine and just be able to stay up late
good,"Manage and maintained over 80 accounts equaling over $3.7 million annually"
good,This company was a good company at first but they changed the incentive program so much to try to keep people there and it made the company morale go down a ton.
good,Good company overall.  Good people but going through a tough time with merger.  Often very regional structure makes national initiatives tough to implement.
good,"I would go in and check inventories according to the computer system.  I placed all my orders by 10am.  I also checked through all the DQ products, checked shelf life and ordered accordingly"
good,"US Foods is a good company to work for. All company activities are focused around selling food and being the best food service company in the industry."
good,"I loved working here because there were many rewards to meeting productivity goals. I learned many new skills and was challenged to always do better.

good,"Day goes by quickly as there is so much detail required."
good,Briefings every day before the beginning of shift. I learned a new skill in the food distributing business such as pallet jack handling and order selecting. Nice and easy going work environment thanks to the polite employees. Often I had problems with prioritizing items to fit on to crates in which I carried on the forks of my jack.
good,US FOODS is a good place to work.. You have to be able to work in a fast paced environment.. Things move quick and taking care of a very diverse customer base is a must to succeed..

good,You'll work hard and have fun.  Real nice folks.  Professional.
good,"Hours are 8-5 with 2 to 3 ""after hours"" office work.  There is lots of variety to this job.

I enjoy building relationships with customers however, there are a lot of details to keep track of."

good,This was one of the best places to work when it comes to a set of standards and making sure they are followed. The management made sure that every employee was a happy employee and if you were not it was addressed immediately. The management is always thinking of the employees and try to do what is best for them.
good,This job paid very well and compensated their employees very well for the amount of work that is done. Very physical work.
good,I love working for Us Foods but I want to get back into the administrative field.
good,working 3rd shift is the hardest part
good,"It is very hard work, but worth it."
good,"Deliver food to different stores using a tractor. Pre and post trip inspection, paperwork."
good,"Hard Job to keep up with as very physical job, plus working in a freezer condition could slow you down, left to get into HVAC field and was good choice as income has increased."
good,"Overall, its a a good place to work. Benefits and compensation is better  than most place.  Work/ life balance is good but not many opportunities for advancement!"
good,There were a lot of fun training experiences allotted to both contractors and employees within the company.  This was a valuable team building benefit.
good,"Spent 23 years there. Started selecting orders ,night operations to day operations in the shipping and receiving office. Many other duties in between. Management had it's ups and downs through the years but mostly positive. Mostly great group of people."
good,"Paid by the piece count , stop, and mileage . Warehouse loads the trailer just to get it off the door. Pallets are mixed stops and placed out of order lots of times. Get all the stops off is all the management cares about. Early start times can mean get off early to have time with family but you will be TIRED! It‚Äôs an ok job."
good,If you dont mind working hard and alot of hours this is a good job. Pay is good with great benefits. I started in the warehouse as a order selector then moved up to night warehouse supervisor.

good,"Manage daily customer sales for l. Responsible for managing customer A/R, processing payments, new customer development , and Service. Utilizes vast background experience to contribute to growth by evaluating customer needs, trends,"
good,It is a lot of work and the pay is good but it is a rough job with a high turnover rate and there is a lot of manual labor and the other workers are rough around the edges but there is a great company culture.
good,There are plenty of positions available for many different backgrounds. Management is pretty good at responding to issues. I have many friends that I work with at this company and it a fairly tight community.
good,Typical work day in a warehouse working 5 days a week until finished  creating long long hours and your able to make quick raises in short periods of time
good,The company was great until they became public(stock holders) once that happen it all became very political. Politics took over sensibility... it was good if you were friends with higher ups
good,My old boss retired and I got a new boss and she was so micromanaging everything I that I do. The people are very friendly and management was very fair. I just didn't have any room for advancement.
good,"Selecting groceries in a warehouse environment while working production is challenging, but rewarding. The  pay is very competitive concerning warehousing"
good,It's truly a good job..I'm just a person who doesn't value money over family.be prepared to work long hard hours everyday.You want have days off so don't plan any trips around holidays since they go off years of experience.Overall it's a wonderful company but I just didn't see my self working there longtime.
good,I like working with US Foods.  I love customer service.  Finding it difficult to go fight through changes happening in the company both managerially and logistically.  Still a very good company.  Still working on a good team.  Optimistic things will turn around soon.
good,"U S Foods need better Management team, every busy place to work with no training. restructuring making it hard place to work. unable to transfer to other departments."
good,Has been a great company to work for years.  Corporate changes lately have not been for the best.  A lot of downsizing and changing commission brackets.  Lots of hours to invest to be successful.  Job  is always on.
good,"The people!!! I've met a lot of intelligent hardworking people that are always willing to teach and give a hand. I had no prior experience"
good,Tracked and traced large amounts of truck loads to ensure on time delivery.  Required a lot of computer and phone time.  I had to train and count on many people.
good,"Jobs like this are hard to come by with regard to compensation.  On the flip side this job will take a toll on your body.  Some of the slots you pick from are only a couple feet off the ground and you will have to crawl to pick something that may way 35-50 Lbs.  Other times the slot may be 5 feet off the ground and the only way possible to grab the item is to climb.  They preach safety, but under these circumstances it is only preached because you are not paid to be safe.  You are paid to be productive.  There is no way to do this job for years and not have back pain.  Nonetheless,  I know that some selectors make $70,000 per year.  I would say the average selector makes $45-50K.  Pretty much everyone is overworked and irritated.  Management seems to care and somehow seems like they are not doing enough."
good,I am not interested in reviewing this employer. No thank you. You can't handle the truth about this employer. They do not pay well or recognize valued employees.
good,Hard working always on time efficient with my work skills determined to get the job done and do everything by the book and with caution of nessacary...
good,"I really loved their technology platform, they had great benefits but the Utah area seems to be an old boys club... All in all I think it would be a great company to work if you had the right supervisor."
good,I start work anytime between 4 and 8 in the morning depending on what is going on that day.  The day can last from 10 to 15 hours Monday through Friday with an occasional Saturday.  I like the work and the people I work with.  I can say I have been extremely loyal to the company over many years and have enjoyed the fast pace work day helping customers and fellow workers.
good,"Addressed all queries of the employees; maintained records of employee‚Äôs attendance, active hour & performance Handled induction & training programmed "
good,"Good Workplace, Going through changes at the moment. They have a good leadership team that wants the best for its employees."
good,Excellent benefits. Reasonable scheduling. Additional training in some areas is greatly needed. Routing could stand improvement for delivery drivers. Good provision for uniforms and uniform items.
good,"Great management team, with a work week ranging from 30-35 hours. great benefits for employees and their families. they also give you chances to advance within their company"
good,"You start your day early morning Like 4am, and your day will be anywhere from 10 to 16 hours long. The pay is very good and the benefits are excellent."
good,"Very steady career, room for growth in certain divisions.Has an awesome benefit plan/work-life balance."
good,Good company to work for until outside HR took over and it was down hill from there.
good,"The typical day begins by directing the pending work flow to the coordinators within the department to ensure proper prioritization and completion of the work. Run a variety of reports to confirm pricing on special orders, finding items that went out with pricing below cost and taking corrective action. Checking and adjusting the commodity bank balances for the K12 programs. Researching and running reports to determine credits and debits that need to be done to resolve vendor disputes. Supporting outside sales via email or phone to assist in getting special pricing set up and much more depending on the issues that arise."
good,Love working at UF Foods.  Due to the economic downturn over the last three years it was very difficult to meet operational goals.  US Foods L.A. was one of the best preforming divisions on a national level but the over all performance of the company has been down over the last couple of years.   Resulting in the planned sale to Sysco Foods later this year.
good,Restaurant consultation and sales for restaurant & hospitality supply.
good,"Territory Manager charged with securing new business opportunities, and expanding sales distribution within existing businesses     and territories.

good,I worked mostly in the freeze which was my choice. I enjoyed working here and if it wasn't for my injury I would still be employed here. I am currently on worker's comp.
good,"Enjoyed Working there to provide for my family, some of the co-workers were teamed up to make the job fun but safe. When they use to award the valuable employees, I can say that my name was mentioned. There were times you fended for yourself because questions and answers was farfetched, sometimes management seemed to find other things to be entertained by. Opportunities were there but limited, it seemed to me of who you knew and associated with. The company overall is great, it became more fast pace due to improvement and change. But not by pursuing new ideas without being trained nor educated properly."
good,Team oriented with great coworkers however challenging environment due to too many diffferent systems in place. Each workday brought new challenges which made the time go by very quickly.
good,Building relationships along with prospecting new accounts
good,"I have worked in various fields, most with little or no experience going in but all with success. Managing and working along side others is my most enjoyable attibute of all my jobs, seeing and know what the goals are and reaching them."
good,onsite customer relations
good,Went well good company to work for. They treat people with respect. Always hand an open mind an really listen to there drivers when meetings were had they followed.
good,Good pay for selectors. Decent opportunities to advance. People are ok and managers are decent. Good if you just want to make money. Hard schedules and
good,"I loved my job until Us foods and Sysco attempted to merge. The ethics and morals changed. Once the values and morals changed  and the company realigned its divisions I felt it was "
good,There are many workers that have worked for the company for 5+ years.  I learned to manage time and important customer service skills.  The benefit package is nice (especially the vision).  The workplace culture is ok.  I was able to make friends that I will continue to keep in touch with.  The management changes every couple of years.
good,"Nice place to work, great coworkers. Many people that work there have worked there since they started in the work force and will retire from there. This makes it difficult to move upward when you are a new generation."
good,"PRO:You will make good money as a selector.  "
good,Good place to work just be ready for 12-14 hr shifts on-call monday through satirday is your new employee hard to balance work and home time good pay good benefits
good,You will work for every dollars very labor extensive with no breaks. You can cancel your gym membership for sure everyday is a work. The pay is great and benefits is great as well

good,"A typical day consists of pre and post trip inspection, hooking and unhooking trailers. Then making deliveries in a timely manner with you unloading truck and having good customer service"
good,"Very good Culture - leadership and managers strive to demonstrate and uphold corporate values."
good,"Good Company within the industry."
good,The job is pretty decent for the most part i really enjoyed everything but the cold areas i would have to work in bein forced due to low seniority.. other than that the job was ok
good,I like it over there and is really fun to have met people of such caliber over there. It was a nice experience I had with US FOOD and had really helped me a lot
good,I enjoyed doing my internship here. I felt like it set me up with a good foundation to move forward. It was a good place to get my first career experience.
good,"I‚Äôve worked at US for 1 year and 2 weeks.  Coming from FedEx Ground, and tanker companies,  it‚Äôs  the big leagues.  Especially my Monday and Thursday routes.  The veterans at my terminal pull rank and refuse to do those routes. But they have put in 15 and 20+ years.  So I understand.   Doesn‚Äôt make it any easier tho.  It‚Äôs a demanding job.   But my boss can be cool. Most days.    Dispatch treats me cool.  Most days.   It‚Äôs like this,  I‚Äôm home every night.  I‚Äôm off on the weekends.  I‚Äôm making $2.50 an hour more than I was when I started just 12 months ago.   I show up everyday and knock out the route.  That being said,  I‚Äôm 37.   How can I make it to 60 doing this kind of work?   I have co worker who will be 60 this year by the way...   he‚Äôs an alien I‚Äôm sure of it.   But bottom line.  Tough a** job.  Great driving skills are needed.  Customer service is not only needed but goes sooooo far week after week. Month after month. They‚Äôll grow to love u and become much more understanding. And FEED you. Which is never a bad thing.      Apply if u think u can handle.     It‚Äôs like this,  I‚Äôm good at a demanding job that is in demand.   That is job security.  ‚öúÔ∏è"
good,"I enjoyed my time working for US Foods CHEF'STORE. I had fair managers as well as good co-workers. Advancement was hard to come by as a stock clerk, and unfortunately I was not making enough each week to continue working here."
good,"Fast paced work, keeping busy decent pay for young or new family with benefits. No real chance of career advancement outside of warehouse work other than driving or lead or management position. Normal day was around 10 to o12 hours in dry, refrigerated or freezer section handling pallet jacks and lifting and placing all sizes and weights of boxes, cans, and food and restaurant related items. pallets get load on trailer by the loader after being staged on the dock by the selector and afterward delivered to the client."
good,"Fast paced, short on strategy.  Decentralized model continues to drive disconnect and inability to leverage company resources.  Heavy hierarchy slows decision making and makes change slow."
good,"I would advise anyone considering US Foods to be cautious and thorough in the interview process to ask as many smart questions as you can about the history of the role, the department, etc."
good,"Very fast paced, you have to be consistent with what you do. Co-workers are sometimes obnoxious but manageable. Employees get discounts on purchasing food there."
good,"Pays well, but you Will work for it. pressure to perform is high and if you dont pick 100 percent they will talk of getting rid of you...seniority means everything so if your the low guy on the totem pole you will get stuck working 6 days a week untill you get some people under you"
good,"I enjoyed the fact that I only worked a few minutes from home and that I could go home at lunch if I wanted to.  I learned many things while employed there such as switchboard, customer pickup, and how to track down equipment that had been leased to other businesses and never returned to us.  I also learned how to renew leases on our equipment.  Did I want to leave?  No.  But i am thankful for what i had learned while i was there."
good,"very nice and good client and i learn new things and work culture is also nice and nice team members they teach me and help me alot.,i learned a lot at starting of my carrer only"
good,"Love this company but I put 27000 miles on my car in 10 months with no reimbursement or mileage payout. Training was fun and thorough,  products are awesome."
good,"Good pay but you definitely work for your money.  Management does listen to your issues,  however,  nothing ever got done.  Job became easier when I just accepted the fact that I want going to get any assistance in solving the issue.  Awesome supervisors, but managers got let go left and right.  Got injured thanks to losing and my career got cut short.  Bitter sweet..."
good,Great company to work for. Good balance of remote work and meetings. Working with District Manager monthly helps to keep you focused. Wished that they has a better pay structure for Territory Managers.
good,"Good work place with the opportunity to grow. I supported 6 divisions in the South region. Management let us do our jobs with minimal guidance, only as needed. The work culture was very laid back."
good,Its hard work that you are compensated for nicely. Very strict on saftey and rules. Some days are great other days are bad. Just like anywhere you get a job there will b things that you dont like.
good,"Worked remote, able to perform necessary duties without pressure.  Job duties can change (added/deleted) on a weekly basis, some personal performance was based on other departments work"
good,I worked business to business selling food products and enjoyed the job greatly. I built a great relationship with the owners and chefs in my territory. With my background in business and food science I was able to build trust and sometimes offer my education skills to the customer which built a great trust with them. The best part of the job was working with the customer. My orders grew and stayed strong.
good,I enjoyed most of my time at US Foods.
good,Has a good job but it's very demanding and I think they really don't care about the drivers or their situation as far as weather. But they pay good money.
good,"The work can be hard and fast paced, but they pay very good wages for the work. I learned that working hard earned you the respect of your manager and peers."
good,Great people good pay but no advancement opportunities once you get a position it's very hard to get another one and the supervisors are not held accountable for anything
good,"weekly planning is a must."
good,"transparent company, great team players. difficult industry with many obstacles of your control from routing, mispicks, customer payments."
good,"after a very long career with usf i was brought back as a training supervisor. it was under false premise by the vp who has long gone."
good,"You really have to be on your toes. Fast paced job. Performance based. Faster and more productive you are, the more rewarding the job will be. Really emphasize safety here. They really crack down on it. If you can't keep up they will come down on you. Overall not a bad place to have a job at. Overnight hours can be stressful for those who have families or would like to do anything in there spare time. Sunday through Thursday. Friday evenings off and Saturdays into Sunday mornings."
good,"It is hard work, however you deliver to a wide range of people, and for the most part, the customers are kind and caring. This job is great if you are looking for overtime."
good,"I'm gratefully for the opportunity to work for USFOODS, learn a lot new things about selling process and much more, but I know they will be better in the near future."
good,I had a great role and time there nothing bad to say. I did what what my job required me to do and more for growth and advancement. needless to say everyone was willing to work with you and ensure the job was done.
good,Good benefits with good job security. Fun motivated employees to work with. Lots to learn. Opportunities to advance. Opportunities for overtime. Good management team.
good,I would clock in find my tug cart an get my list of trailers i would be loading an the doors they would be in once the first cart pulled up i usually spent the rest of my shift jumping door to door loading
good,"Worked for this company for almost 14 yrs. Very solid comapny, great culture but since we went public, too many initiatives to keep up with. I feel I have no time to actually sell anymore."
good,"I liked most everything about US Foods and even Sysco loved what we were innovating. Good pay - nice culture in the office, y direct boss was the problem. He has been removed but it was too late in my view as many good employees went other departments to get away from this manager. overall i would recommend US Foods as a steady place not much growth unless you know someone."
good,Great company to work for before they went public.   After that there were to many changes and not all for the best.  Great benefit package as far as Health Insurance.
good,"-building closed, only typing this because I can't advance without. -can't advance. good place to work before closing"
good,Good place to work sometimes could be stressful.   Need to have better pay and also incentives for running over a hundred percent.   Also get rid of the tagging the boxes.
good,FOOD PEOPLE EASY! I worked for US Foods for  majority of my career and it is an excellent place to work with great benefits for the employees. I recommend US Foods as a great place to work!
good,The philosophy for working with independent restaurants was great but an undue amount of pressure was placed on the Territory Managers to meet and exceed certain metrics.  Any failure to exceed the given metric was often used against you.
good,Calling on potential and current customers to grow you territory. You have great quality of life as you set your own schedule. Hardest part of the job is cold calling and competing with other distributors in a burnt market.
good,One of the leaders in the food service industry. They probably service one of your favorite restaurants. They might even provide service to a hotel that you stay on family vacations.
good,"Primary owner of Customer Relationship: "
good,"People you work with are awesome, can make unlimited amount of money can be made if you are willing to work for it. Only bad thing about it is long hours and very physical work."
good,"Very nice place to work for with employees getting together nicely. The sad part is when consolidation took place and everybody got misplaced, laid off, etc."
good,"My position was involved across all departments. Most of my work was JIT. While the graphic design side of my job was mostly a 'project' that could last a few days or weeks, the reporting side was 'as needed'. There were daily, weekly, and monthly reports and summaries ongoing. Hardest part of my job was deciding to leave.  I enjoyed everything about my job. I interacted with sales reps and customers. I enjoy serving and assisting."
good,This company is dedicated to building its employee's skills and education.  In doing so they often hire from with the company first. They have a centralized supply chain type approach to the industry and due to that some of the more executive positions are at or around the headquarters areas of Phoenix and Chicago.
good,"Daily functions include managing customer and US Foods corporate relations, management of customer LTO's, analyzing profitability, and achieving sales goals. "
good,"We would review the previous days shipments, and shortages and inventory any items that were Marked Out, Shorted on Delivery, or created a negative inventory. We also were required to complete a full cycle count inventory of every item each quarter,"
good,Working with this company was a slow life pace. The employees are very immature. I would recommend anyone looking to settle down into a warehouse career to consider working there.
good,"That job was a nice job because of people who worked there,we was like a family and everythink was good,i left that job because i come here in uk."
good,"Well organized company..."
good,A once great company is in full transition.  This was a great company to work for before the transition/transformation began.
good,"US Foods has been at the forefront of an ever evolving foodservice industry.  They continue to be the leading innovator in foodservice distribution through unique and exclusive food products and eCommerce solutions.  With a pending merger with our largest competitor, the future of US Foods is uncertain."
good,"A typical day at US Foods is hustling and getting the job done. Everyday is different, some days are extremely hard and others are just another hard day. Most of the co-workers are team players and help each other out. Most enjoyable part about this job is the pay."
good,Great opportunities to learn about various food commodities
good,working with the co-workers was great out on the dry side of warehouse
good,"Work begins at 6:30. A light stretch is to be expected during the start up meeting (you'll need it), you'll be briefed on the assignments of the night, changes to orders, aisles as well count for the evening. After getting a picking assignment you'll ride around on a riding jack to each aisle trying to quickly pick each item on your route. Stacking is important for you and the driver that will later unload what you have picked."
good,"Great process and structure"
good,"Company is not a big promoter for advancement. Made several attempts, on one instance didn't even get an interview."
good,"I am responsible for supervising and backing up General Accounting, Payroll, and Contracts.  I run multiple reports and some are now used across departments. This is the most satisfying part of the job and makes me feel accomplished.  I have learned the ins and outs of the food distribution business, customer pricing, customer rebates/allowances, working a P/L in detail, closing the books at month end, preparing a weekly forecast, annually/semi annually operating plan, and much more.  I continue to grow my excel knowledge each day by helping coworkers which is enjoyable.  Management is encouraging, respectful, and provides minimal supervision which is great."
good,"Scheduled and received numerous shipments daily.  Processed purchase orders, researched and filed them.  Management had a ""clique"" with some workers.  That made it hard sometimes because you had to do their work while they were off with the supervisor having lunch for 3 hours.  Loved meeting and talking to new drivers and dispatcher."
good,Good company to work for. However your ability to advance as far as you would like will most likely depend on your willingness to transfer to another division.
good,US foods was a great place to work.
good,"would have to investigate and resolve any and all pricing errors. The process to do this was very intense wtih several steps to perform and on an older computer system which made it extremely stressful. During this time I learned how to use excel, which I ejoyed very much. Management and co-workers were very good to work with. The hardest part of the job was to find the pricing error. The most injoyable part of the job was making the excel spreadsheet to calculate the rebates. It was always a concern that the company would be sold and your job would be in jepordy."
good,"I manage the design team, marketing initiatives, internal department initiatives, communications, website, sales tools, and help with over 60 divisions' marketing needs. The best part of my job is working next to skilled chefs to create innovative products and inspiring marketing tools to help our customers succeed in this tough economy. There's always something new to do, and there are tough timelines and the pipeline is always full!"
good,Restaurant industry is a fickle segment of the economy. Us foods has maintained a competitive edge against many of the other broadline food distributors.
good,Very tough business but one of the most honorable and technologically advanced companies from what I can see.
good,Operate certified machinery to move and stock incoming product
good,"I worked here as extra help in the summer. It was a great summer job for a college student. Even though I worked 65 -75 hours a week, I was paid well and treated fairly."
good,The environment at US Foods is generally good.  The company is working hard to further incorporate an environment of diversity and inclusion.  It can be very fast paced and busy.  We have a dress for your day policy that allows us to wear jeans daily unless we are meeting with customers or suppliers.  We also have a work from home policy.  When I am in the office I do spend a lot of time in meetings and delivering training.  We have developed the Replenishment Council where associates can submit continuous improvement ideas.  The council determines if the feasibility and business impact of the submission.  I am often called upon to create or update training materials and job aids then deliver training on the process changes.
good,"I enjoyed my time at US Foods and was able to learn some very important skills as they related to supply chain logistics."
good,I enjoy working there the money was excellent I was in there a whole lot of hours the benefits was great the managers we're okay except for one I don't know what else you all want me to tell you about the company I already did the good in the bag if that's not sufficient I'm sorry
good,"3:00 am start and a 4:30 pm end, must complete route in trailer. There will be challenges with equipment, weather and some demanding customers. I believe this is a younger mans job because of the vigorous labor involved. Driving the tractor trailer was the easiest part of job. US Foods is a great company to work for, I took on the challenge as my career is coming to an end, which I decided it was to physical for me."
good,long days and weeks. would work ten to fourteen hour days. five to six days a week. had unrealstic order picking times for the order picking. the money was good and co workers and managers were helpful and kind
good,US Foods is a big company that is truly corporate America.  It has good benefits and lots of room for advancement.  The work is hard and work/life balance is difficult.
good,"Your day depends on if the truck is loaded and routed correctly. if its not, then it will be a long day for you. You have to be mentally tough for a job  like this."
good,"Lot of opportunities, fast paced.  Most initiatives driven down from corporate.  Good place to work."
good,The pay was great and the people who I worked with was amazing.  The Job is very hands on fast pace and very very busy.  Most workers help you with learning the everyday routine. The bad part is that there are tooooo many bosses.  All in All it is a good place to make a good pay check
good,"I actually like this job. The work is fast paced. 3 out of 5 supervisors/managers are great. Money is wonderful. However, they really work you hard and expect way too much of you. This can be a very hard job. Especially for females. If you are up for a challenge this is the job for you. If you are lazy and want an easy job. This is not the place for you. Hard efficient work is well rewarded."
good,"I have been able to grow and develop with the company in my department.  There are some great leaders in the organization, and the focus on CI is improving things for the better."
good,"Significant personal autonomy. Good local management. Exceptional training program.  Vague salary/bonus guidelines: beginning salary is low for the amount of responsibility required, and the threshold for entering the bonus/incentive program is poorly defined and largely arbitrary. The requirement to be responsive to customer calls every day without exception is a significant consideration for anyone thinking about this line of work."
good,"select order and place on pallets then wrap them. simple just have to keep a steady pace. can work in hot, cool, or freezing conditions. hours can suck due to working late into the night but good pay"
good,Very good place to work alot of rules  as long as you followed the rules you are good..................................................... Great place to work work can be hard at times will keep you in shape.
good,"Great training programs. "
good,"Very tough work. You start at with a split week schedule & possibly working in an extreme colds environment, such as a freezer warehouse. When you seniority builds the jobs you are able to retain get easier physically."
good,"I loved working with the people in my department, we would come together and help each other when we needed to. I only left to persue School buisiness"
good,It's a fair place to work. Learned a lot while I was there. It's a great job for someone first time driving a truck. I would tell new drivers about my opportunity at Us Foods.
good,Its a decent and fast place to work at. Overall it was laid back and friendly coworkers. My time here was very fun and I learned a lot from this company.
good,"Management was pretty sound. Nonunion facility when I was there. Co-workers were pretty awesome for the most part minus a couple ""grumpy"" disrespectful few. Pay was average for the work at the time as well."
good,"Excellent benefits, HR programs, inclusive work atmosphere. Goals set and raises on a regular basis. Exciting and innovative company. Leader in the industry. Stock options available. 401K matching available."
good,"its ok to work here but don't believe what upper management say NOT management, management just repeat what there told to say."
good,At times lost track of the employee when they were pursuing the larger objective. Senior leadership seemed to forget about the satisfaction of the employees at times but then come back to earth.
good,"It is a place that you could start with at an early age,and have a successful career,and retire at an early age.You have be in good to excellent shape to make it at this company"
good,Very hard to keep up the fast pass and be accurate in pulling your orders.  You have to pull a 100% in order to get an increase in pay. That‚Äôs very hard to do when you are tired from 10 to 14 hours a day for six days straight.
good,As a computer operator my typical day was busy but I enjoyed the drivers and warehouse workers that I worked with. Everyone worked as a team and all were always willing to help.
good,The overall support the US Foods initially gives you is extensive. You start out in a 5 week training session and are under close supervision until they believe your ready for the sales position.
good,"started work very early in the morning but as long as I kept busy and moved I got home early afternoon. Nice boss, good coworkers. worked well with trying to get work off."
good,"The last year and a half as a deployment lead my position required extensive travel and training at various US Foods locations around the county. I was responsible for training and deploying a corporate initiative known as Cookbook, using predictive analytics to provide actionable intelligence to our sellers and sales management. For 17 years prior I managed a sales team primarily in the Northwest Ohio Market. US Foods has undergone many changes over the years I worked there. The company is evolving and streamlining all operations since going public in May 2016. This has caused a lot of good people to end up either relocating or move on in many departments that were reorganized. I chose the latter. The hardest part of the job for most in sales is managing the operational inefficiencies that exist primarily because of rapid changes and labor issues. Managing through the same issues year after year was the least favorable part of my career there. The most enjoyable was helping direct reports or others whom many became friends grow in their careers and manage through the processes. The culture depends on the location but most are very good cultures to work in. I would recommend a career at US Foods."
good,"Great job to help you stay in shape.Get to check out new places to eat.  Meet very nice people. Deliver all over ct. Ri. And ma. Some places are not that easy to deliver to. All in all, it was a great experience."
good,"Was a very good place to work. In sales you dictated your own salary based on the profit you generated."
good,"Overall had a great experience at US Foods.  In my role as a Category Manager Associate, I spent time launching products, collaborating with Product Developers, work on pricing, commodities, negotiating."
good,"This job I liked A LOT. The problem with US Foods is that it is poorly managed, and the new corporate structure does not have opportunities for vertical advancement. Lots of people job hop horizontally for varying degrees of pay increases. It is a good company to work for. Their benefits are okay, but the pay is not very competitive. But I still stand by that I liked doing the job a lot."
good,"Learned mostly abut data mining, operation management, and warehouse management. On busy days, I would help the customer service team communicate with truck drivers and customers waiting for their products."
good,The job was decent i had to drive 40min every day with 3 flights of stairs to get there plus as the only persons working caring for 3 kids the money wasnt enough for me but was still good money. besides that and the drive to work could have been great.
good,"My responsibilities included ensuring timely delivery of product. I learned Supply Chain Process and the many facets involved in each of the departments. Management overall was good, but inconsistent at times. Culture was one of hard work."
good,"Good place to work"
good,Need to be self motivated. Commission Pay so your effort generally determined your pay. You had support from managers and many opportunities for increasing product knowledge. Need to manage time and continuously look for new opportunities.
good,"it was really stressful being a order selector, sometimes you would have to work thru breaks and thru lunch just to make 100 percent in a week the minimum requirement"
good,"There was a lot of driving in the El Paso area and southern New Mexico area as well, my personal goal was to grow my territory on a daily weekly and monthly basis, and that was done through cold call, and meeting new people on a daily basis.  Help owners develop new menu ideas by introducing new products and services for their businesses.  Sometimes time and driving distances where the hardest part of the job."
good,Part of a good team.  Loved the people I worked with.  Sometimes stressfull due to operational issues.  Made it difficult to properly take care of customers.
good,"Typical day was fast paced, long and very tiresome. Management was very helpful with things like training and making sure the job went as smoothly as possible."
good,"As an Ops Coordinator, act as liaison between Human Resources and payroll.  Enjoy the diversity of the workplace.  Enjoy working and learning from the associates!"
good,"As a driver you start very early in the morning, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. usually, these are usually long and you have a lot of heavy packages to move up and down a ramp of your truck up and down stairs you have to drive a big truck in tight areas, it's hard work but it does pay off my biggest gripe is that the hours are not so great yes you have the weekends off, but I'm not much of a morning person and I do find myself working 70 hours a week at times so the weekends go by too fast."
good,"A typical day would usually be around 9-10 selection hours, operating a jack and properly selecting customer orders,sometimes in freezing temperatures. The most enjoyable part would be the coworkers. Very friendly environment"
good,Always thought this company would rise above the top FS Company Sysco. They were more competitive with pricing and seemed more willing to please their customers. GO the extra mile to keep a customer happy.
good,"The work is fun and the benefits are awesome but the management was stressful when the layoff season started. Other than that, the company is a great place to work."
good,Merchandise department was pleasant.  Everyone is really knowledgeable in their areas. Customer service comes first. Both internal and external. The goal is to get the job done and satisfy the customer.
good,"Fun place to work. Got lots of free food. Learned a lot about food."
good,"A typical day was 65 calls per day. Over Flow in work. 11 yrs with"
good,A typical day at work consists of the same thing everyday. The work environment is friendly and  very competitive at most times. Management isn't the best but their fair at all times.
good,"fair place to work, performance and numbers very important was required to out preform last year, year in year out. new and multiple initiatives required to be followed to the point you had trouble keeping up with what was being tracked that week"
good,"Great place work . Great culture "
good,"Generally speaking a very good place to work. Compensation leaves a bit to be desired, and depending on the job you're in, there is very little room to move up (or to another department)"
good,Great job. Pay is ok . benefits are good. A lot of overtime available. Lenient with call off. Flexible with personal time. Friendly environment. Lenient on break time
good,good place to work but very hard if you are not use to lifting product please wear a back brace because you do a lot of bending over and the product you are lifting is very heavy
good,Good company to work for if you are a self starter and are willing to put your carrier before everything. uncapped income is a bonus great rewards given
good,"New drivers are put on call.....they only guarantee 30 hours a week"
good,"a typical work day consited of 8 hours plus. i learned that working at this warehouse wasnt like working at other warehouses, they ran their ship a little bumpy but at the end of the day the worked got done. management there had their share jumping in and lending an helping hand when we were shorted handed. the hardest part of the job was the drive. i dont have a complaint. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to train new hires."
good,I really enjoyed the work. It was challenging and rewarding. Warehouse and transportation are a huge issue. Spent 25% of my time working to recover issues created by them.
good,Very comfortable place of work no big complaints. Daily work kept the same no out of the way events. Steady work environment professional workers clean environment.
good,If you consider yourself a hard worker then this will be a good company for you. Good pay but real physical work. A typical day at work getting up at 11pm go to the yard pu your load work for about 11hrs delivering food to restaurants. Best part getting pay every week.
good,Pretty good job to have. Good pay work hours wasn't that long . Management tho would turn a blind eye to certain selectors breaking company policy.
good,"Fast pace working  environment .. good money .. freezer ; cooler ; dry zones you worked in.. double jacks & triples , everyday overtime .. holiday pay"
good,the job was pretty decent i don't really have many complaints the hours were good and pay was decent as well i don't regret working at u.s foods not one bit.
good,"I started at 18.72 an hour, after 90 days raises and benefits which I thought was great. Starting shift was a four 10 hour shifts also a plus. Overall I would recommend"
good,Great place to work. Good new equipment. Management is good now used very bad. Loved to deal with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks.
good,"This company actually lives by their core beliefs, which is a positive change from previous companies I've worked for."
good,"Not a company who cares about employees, typically work day clock in and restart computer and begin to take orders you place you re check orders"
good,"Harmonious working environment with all departments working together to achieve common work goals."
good,"Territory management take special kind of people, and here is why.  Regardless of what is going on in your world, you are always going to  have to be the guy who you customer can count on. So if you have a bad call or something goes wrong, you have to pull up your big boys pants and move on the next one.  Because you never know that big opportunity that you been working for might just pay off."
good,Company is stable and has awesome benefits. Management sucks. COnsistancy from the ware house is a joke. one day your trailer is set up awesome and everything flows right off the truck the next your digging everything out theres no change in the delivery times. and they wonder why cant you finish. Its a bummer. think they'd be more organized.
good,"typical day started as getting dressed with freezer wear and pre pair to work in negative degree environment. proceed to grab electric pallet jack, load up RF UNIT and on the way to start first order, location of slot where product was stationed, load on pallet jack requested amount of products for food distribution. based upon how hard i worked the more cases i pulled the more the money, at times was requested to use cheery picker on selected nights if shortage of personal was also requested to use forklift. Had training in all machinery and certifications. Enjoyed the team work, love the physical aspect of the job. loved the cold environment, did not agree with some of the management ways of organization. But was a team player and did my job"
good,"They keep up with the current events, constantly looking to improve their Logistics Supply Chain."
good,"Fast paced environment. Hardest part of job was able to keep up with selection due to limited bodies on loading dock which were ones who loaded the trucks for designated routes. Management was tough. If you needed anything, they didn't help you do it. That was probably the worst part about working there."
good,"The day would start by making sure all file servers were accessible to all user's. Checking the overnight back-ups to see that they all completed successfully . "
good,Good overall company.  Room for advancement is there if you wish to go for it.  You will not have much of a home lif while you work here.
good,"I enjoyed working as a warehouse/ forklift operator. I had to dress in layers because of the freezer environment. I liked that we stayed busy because time went by fast,"
good,Overall the costumers where kind and friendly when we showed up to deliver their food and put it in the proper location.  To make the deliveries we where given well kept equipment to make the deliveries.  Also with each day they switched trucks around to gives us to know each truck.
good,"I'm at a desk all day helping sales reps with problems, concerns, finding product, truck, and eta's. I love the different challenges on a daily basis which I really enjoy. I learn something almost every day cause each day is never the same. I don't need very much guidance and my manager really appreciates that. I'm self motivated and eager to learn."
good,"I was responsible for a company van and handled beverage equipment for customers. I would rebuild and recondition coffee, juice and tea machines to be used in restaurants in the Columbia and surrounding areas."
good,"¬∑ Expert professional in business development"
good,"* Worked with 18 separate sales representatives through either direct contact via phone or emails."
good,"good place to work,have learned a lot about the food service"
good,"Many invaluable job skills were acquired from employment at US Foods.  The company grew incredibly both on a division and corporate level. US Foods has moved forward to be a leader in this industry. I mastered procurement, pricing, contracts, and various ways to communicate, obtain information, and assist brokers, vendors, customers, fellow employees, corporate executives, and division management. Coworkers were very pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was prioritizing the work load and ensuring deadlines were met. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with many individuals on a daily basis and meeting individual customer needs for accurate pricing."
good,"A typical day for a territory manager is anything but typical!  Most days start with your sales plan, but that can rapidly change. Being the main contact between company and customer, you are responsible for managing the relationship.  I have learned to be a great problem solver.  The most fulfilling aspect of the job is solving problems for my customers.  It could be anything from out of stocks, or late trucks to helping customers find ways to reduce food or operational cost.  This is a fast paced, very competitive career."
good,Fast paced physically demanding work environment. Pays well and management does what they can to reduce the stress of the job.
good,"Restaurant Equipment Knowledge, Processing Orders, Sales Info"
good,It has its good days and bad days. Depending on how many customers you get. Not enough employees and that adds a lot of stress to your day. Employees are good to work with and the customers are mostly pleasant people to be around. Management could use some help.
good,recently merged with sysco.  old management gone which is an improvement
good,"worked in many divisions , order processing data processing, accounting, good company"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of pulling orders in the cooler dept. of various products on electric pallet jack. I've alot about the food industry and what it means to be a team player.I had a situation where I felt as though management didn't take my concerns serious.I overall enjoyed my co-workers except the incident that resulted it my departure.The hardest part of the job wa the every changing attitudes of how some co-workers approached the job. The most enjoyable part was feeling like my performance was recognized, like what I contributed mattered."
good,Due to the obstacles we face everyday at US Foods.  We work together as a team.
good,I had a great time working here and I loved the vendors bringing in new food products.
good,"A good company with good benefits. 8-5 Day, good training, mgt, fellow employees, with a good picnic"
good,"A typical day show up 30 min early, Get all your paper work, do your pre-trip. Make 5 to 15 deliveries per day ( depending on your route )."
good,"I loved the company values and the work.  The benefits were pretty good with the exception of the medical.  Medical was very expensive.  I worked in Accounts Payable reconciling invoices with the receiving reports.  Some invoices could be over 500 lines long.  There was also a daily quota of invoices that each person was required to meet or exceed.  I loved the challenge of making the quota and without any errors.  The accounts payable reconciling branch was for those with intermediate accounting skills or higher."
good,One of the activities that i really enjoy participating in at this company is their team building outings and exercises. I have gotten to meet people from every department and made some good friends in that aspect. The company does hold their workers as a family unit and that encourages me to know that I have a large back up of people I work with on a daily basis.
good,"Not a lot of room to growth within the company, work begins early in the morning around 3:00 or 3:30a.m. 10 to 14 hrs days. The only issue I have is the lack of room for upward growth in various fields of work."
good,Cross functional training to understand the business encouraged. Good support and development of employees.
good,"Direct contact with OSHA, DOT,EPA,Homeland Security."
good,This Company thrives for excellence in its product as well as in their employees
good,Management support within Logistics Department.Flexibility to implement new ideas and processes.
good,Every day was a different kind of day...that's what I loved
good,"A typical day would involve me working over the manpower for each department. The three departments are the freezer, cooler, and dry selections areas. Then balance out the manpower so that all departments get done in a timely fashion all at once. I really enjoy working with my co-workers because I enjoy working with all different kinds of people and to also learn from them and as well as they can also learn things from me as well. I really enjoy giving feedback and getting in back as well. I also enjoy putting new ideas into place that an employee may come up with. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is trying to make everyone happy and have a good day no matter what. I really enjoy getting people motivated to get the job done as safely, accurately, and quickly done as possible. The most enjoyable part about my job is the people. I cannot stress enough how I enjoy working with people and to help them better themselves as they can help better me as well."
good,This is a great company they are under-staffed so you may put in a few extra hours than wanted. Pleanty of room for growth and the company loves to promote from within.
good,"Really enjoyed my job. Different personalities you get to talk to everyday. I was usually the only one in the office. I could sit and read a book, or when the drivers came in I completed paperwork or checked trucks in. Only time it was bad if there was an accident. Then you had to deal with more paperwork , worrying about drivers.they made the job more enjoyable, get to know them like your family. Had a lot of nice people to work with.Job was very easy.learned a lot on computers. My boss was O K most of the time."
good,"I would make 15 to 20 calls a day. I will normally visit most accounts and phone the others if needed. I worked with good team members who would help each other out. I learned time management and working smarter for best results. The hardest part of the job was making sure you were spending your time wisely. The management was good and there was little micromanagement. It was generally fun and I when I got home, I know I had worked a full day."
good,This place ran with great efficency but I wonder if there was a point in wich they would stop thinning out employees.
good,A hard-working environment. Surprised not having to require a physical to pass job standards but I recommend getting proper rest and exercise before each shift. Trainers and supervisors were ok at the location in Sharonville but were no nonsense to those who gave a low performance. Benefits are good. Some nights you are rewarded and fed meals.
good,its a good place to work great experience you really learn a lot about the different types of meats we eat. Feels good to  walk in a restaurant knowing you mad the food you about to eat
good,Was a good outfit to work with at the time and always had the opportunity to move up if qualified   The bad was at the time the manager tend not to value the workers
good,Good job good people to work around nice work environment. A regular day at work is about 50000 cases 8 to 10 to 12 hours a day. The day is getting over the cold working in the freezer.
good,"Very good company to work for. Healthy pay scale. Nice incentives but, conflicts with your personal life more so than other companies I've worked for."
good,"Learned a lot about food industry. How to work with red-lines for contract and food vendors."
good,"US Foods was a great company to work for when i started.  A lot of benefits and i enjoyed being able to leave to spend time with my family as i wished.  The past few months the culture has been changing to gather data by utilizing trackers.  This data is not see and given directly to the employee and as other employees, we see the Tracker not bein used for its purposes and only creating white noise. We ask for that information and with the tracker being in place for a couple of years, we still are told that they are unable to attain the correct information.  They speak of talk straight but I have been apart of round tables that do not have an end result.  Company is not focusing on their employees anymore, its more directed to Data pulls and Tracker.  Micro Management is a strong Supervisor trait which is causing its employees to make more mistakes and aren't happy going to work anymore."
good,Management here isn‚Äôt good and the importance of taking care of employees and making them feel appreciated is practically nonexistent. It‚Äôs very hot in the spring and summer months and very cold in the winter.
good,There are pros and cons.  A typical work day is hectic and a bit stressful.  Overall the company culture is good and you are rewarded for hard work.  The company is lacking in diversity and inclusion.
good,The pay is really good for the work needed to be done. The benefits aren't bad you get personal and sick days along with vacation after a year. The job itself is very physical and the work is pretty hard. Some places aren't easy to back into so you gotta use good judgement and common sense. I use google maps and a truckers gps and ask customer and fellow drivers how to get to the next stop.
good,Very hard work. I wish I would've started in my 20's. To hard of work starting out for an older person. Very fast paced and could do more to help the drivers .
good,"Great local management, corporate management needs to improve to truly make this a great place to work.  The local team has great passion for their customers and is financially doing a great job locally."
good,"Hard working, fast paced environment, not a good comrodery amongst employees. Great pay left at $19.25, mandatory overtime, work over night shift, forklift, wrap pallets, independently."
good,"This is a great place to work all around, the only issue I have is the power off disgruntled customers towards your pay/ job stability. Also even though there are cameras in every unit, they only record if they are triggered by something, therefore the only proof the driver has of being in compliance with the company policy/ the defuser."
good,"Great place too work for , lots of hour, send you for training.. great people, there all over ,second biggest food companie, give out raises an cost of living. Tool allowance.. two work boot a year.."
good,If I could still be there now I would I was cool with the guys I was working with I was getting hours and I had the weekends to my self and good pay with no problems
good,"It was a good company to work for ,But  things do get old. O have no more to say about this copmany.Its a good company poor supervisors. Everything else is ok"
good,"This job requires a lot of hard work, constant lifting, and expects perfect attendance. This is not a unreasonable request; however, the job is dependent upon the total effort of attending employees. So if some employees show up not wanting to work they get in the way and cause the production to be more difficult for others. You definitely need to be a person who shows up, but also have a good attitude wanting to work. Otherwise you are just in the way. The harder you work, the more money you make; so if you are slowing people down you are not only making base pay but others will be angry towards you cause you effect their money too. Also expect to be there for more than 10 to 12 hours daily."
good,"US Foods offers a lot to it's employees.  Stock options, 401K, Medical/Dental Insurance, Life Insurance.  The Spirit Committee plans events through out the year.  Department team outing once a year.  Work from home option once you learn your job function."
good,A typical day consisted of meeting with your current customers and bringing them ideas to help grow their business. Another big part of the job was cold calling on potential new customers to grow your own customer base. The workplace culture and management staff were always very professional and supportive. Helping all of my customers succeed was the most enjoyable part but collecting outstanding invoice monies from your customers could be quite frustrating at times.
good,"the job is great and great pay too,long hours ,drive all around new york and nj ,late hours ,pay goes up every 6 months 40k is great ,you could move up in the company with hard work and more hours ,the staff is great they are very help full to everybody very respect full"
good,"Us Foods you start out your day by checking your bin for a route . You get your route you get a truck you get your trailer number you hook up perform your pre trip etc. Grab your assigned equipment wich consist of 2 or more handtrucks then you go on about your day.  You are on your own from there .. your day will consist of multiple stops, steps, customer professionalism and maneuvering in tight areas. To be honest it is Hard work but the pay is rewarding you work long hours have long days but your home every single night like any place your work you have good and bad days that's it career advancement is good money good my thing was I was done throwing boxes done with unorganized trailers overall poor management in the warehouse ."
good,Good place to work for every man for himself seniority based learned a lot over 5 years heavy consistent lifting long hours depending on the time of year
good,"Some managers are great to work for/with, some are not good leaders. Not everyone is treated the same. The overall experience and working conditions are on the positive side of the spectrum."
good,This was a great place to work. I really enjoyed my time with this company! I would recommend people to work for this company. I learned great skills and leadership capabilities...
good,"Worked as a consultant in finance for stockyard and was hired permanently. I enjoyed my team a lot, as everyone worked together to obtain the common goal."
good,"US Foods is a fair and equal opportunity employer.  As with any job, just as at your own home there will be frustrations and irritations, as well as joy, laughter and happiness.  It was like that when I was employed at US Foods.  It is a really great place to be employed fuull& time, as well as the benefits provided.  Yearly on site health screenings and an overall caring for fellow employees when in need."
good,It‚Äôs a challenging job that requires a certain set of skills and tolerance. If you aren‚Äôt a people person you may not like this. You will also face challenges daily and must troubleshoot them as no one is around immediately to help you.
good,"The typical day is fast paced and very productive. "
good,"If it wasn't for a few larve volume accounts that either went out of business or could not pay there invoices, I'm sure i would still have been employeed there"
good,"Have not been here long enough to write a sold review. Hours were good and benefits were good. "
good,"Most advanced in the industry with strong support system but quality of life and some poor management leads to turnover.  Fast paced and sometimes unrealistic goals by corporate as they are set on a National level which does not always work for a local market.  Overall, recommend the company."
good,Much has changed since I have left. It would be unfair to comment. They have closed the location where I was working out long after I left the company and have changed management  and ownership several times.
good,I enjoyed working in a safe environment with excellent co-workers.  Management listened to what the employees had to say.  Communication could have been better.
good,"Rewarding, if impersonal place to work. Within six months of being hired as a contract worker, I was told there would be significant layoffs of the full-time workers. This was right after the company had gone public. They're watching the bottom-line these days, but there is no organic growth, only growth through acquisitions of smaller food companies."
good,"This is a good company to work for. Some supervisors are micro managers, others are not. I was ""let go"" because of this this. There has been major upper management changes since then, so I can not comment on the culture of the company as it is right now."
good,"Opportunity to learn about various aspects of the business, learned the needs of food distribution for large institutions to small mom and pop shops.  "
good,"Daily dealing with customers and sales people, coordinating backhauls and warehouse communication."
good,US Foods is not all that bad I just didn't like that all the sacks not together and the pizza boxes were in different isles and many more products....
good,"Great place to work.  Management what very knowledgeable of their business units.  Understandable and empathetic if you had normal family issues.  Benefits were great along with cost of living increases.  The hardest part of the job was the holiday season but, the company would always make working even harder worth it by rewarding employees for the extra efforts.  I moved from Accounting to Logistics and the transition was extremely smooth."
good,Arrive 30 minutes early change into work gear put had set on and look over bills for the night and begin selecting orders. Working for US has given me a chance to grow and learn more.
good,"If it wasn't for the shift that I was working, I would not be looking for something else. I have very little work/life balance on my shift, with no prospect to move to my desired shift any time soon. But the job itself is great, with great salary and benefits."
good,US Foods has been streamlining their workforce for the last few years. Replacing long term employees with younger employees that will reduce their payroll. They have become more interested in ebitda than employee retention.
good,"US Foods is great for recent college graduates who are just starting out.  For a single parent with a busy schedule, it proved challenging but was do-able."
good,"can set your schedule once you build up your territory.  Visit customers and prospects on weekly basis. stay up to date on technology, sales force and other apps available that make the job easier.  out of stocks and shorts make the job frustrating.  enjoy seeing and working with all types of customers"
good,"Good place to work good benefits, face place with a great overall culture. Everyone help each other, all department are connected. Pay is very good as well."
good,"USFoods is attempting to redefine the food distribution industry, really pressing ahead in the field of ordering and inventory technology.  Constant change in reporting structures, job descriptions and slight changes in missions,"
good,"consent bending,reaching, grabbing. An fast paced invironment. Requires pulling customers orders, selecting correct products, identifying numeric color coded rack selections"
good,hard working job. very physical and tense. some days you can work long hours and other are short hours. you have to get use to working in warm climate to freezing climates.
good,"Great team, corporate culture, compensation and benefits. Management was open to employee's professional development. Lot's of changes from mergers and acquisitions that cause workplace instability."
good,"customers were great."
good,"I have been an order selector in all depts. Operated reach trucks,cherry pickers and electric double pallet jacks great money but you have to work for it . so if you just want a place to collect a paycheck but not want to work for it then this isn't the job for you."
good,"great home time and benefits but not steady work"
good,"hardest part of this job was the physical demands of the job, great pay great benefits, typical work day is long routes, heavy case load and lots of customer service skills"
good,A typical work day includes unloading trailer and dealing with customers. I learn that you treat customers the way you want to be treated. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interacting with the customers.
good,"The length of employment was 1 year and was initially training intensive."
good,Good support from management.  Benefits are good.  The work place culture is positive and employees are motivated to excel.  Great opportunities for advancement.
good,"A creative place to use Food Service experience in selling food & non-food products to customers."
good,"This is a good company to work for.  Big enough to be able to make a good living and friendly enough in culture to have a feel of a smaller, private company.  Definitely would like to transfer if there's an opening."
good,"The US Foods culture is positive, many talented employees dedicated to servicing customers.  Many changes following the failed merger with Sysco."
good,A fast paced and ever evolving organization.  Dedicated to keeping up on the latest foods trends and servicing our customers.
good,This job is very physically demanding. The faster you work the more money. Pays well and it is a fun environment. The management is easy going at times. The nights are long.
good,"US Foods, while going through major re-organization is still a fair and decent company to work for.  They pay well, the work is hard but you learn a lot."
good,"promotes within company where possible.  Good vacation & benefits."
good,"A typical day: Is a fast pace atmosphere, where everyone works well with one another, we all have the same goal, putting customer's first."
good,"An average work day consisted of processing information for the out side sales force, including; researching new and existing products, submitting credit requests for product discrepancies, and providing logistics reports. On occasion you would be required to cover a sales route in which you would contact customers to place their orders for delivery."
good,"An average day begins with a smile and ends with exhaustion, you are not pushed beyond your limits you are just to the edge. The management and company  philosophy are always for the best of the customers and the company. Being that US Foods is on the cutting edge of the  food industry there is not very many days that they are closed."
good,Great place and great people! I wish I would of never left this job! I enjoyed the management style and I enjoyed the freedom to management with my own style.
good,"more training should be provided for non-sales employees."
good,"Very honest, but supportive management. Senior IT leadership very connected with all levels of the organization."
good,"I worked for USF for 10 years. I worked with some incredible people. They really cared about me! I loved my job until 2 new Managers were put into place who were completely incompetent for their positions. It was horrible to watch them destroy the moral and team we had built. 1 transfered, So if you are lucky enough to not be involved with that one guy. It is a solid good place to work."
good,"US Foods is well managed company with a lot of great ideas to move forward in the industry."
good,"-A typical work day includes loading trucks with product in a safe timely fashion. "
good,No complaints with this company the treatment and expectations for the employee's is not out of being achieved which helps keep morale in a positive perspective.
good,I enjoy a challenge and I did get it on a daily basis. My only issue was one Supervisor in particular... There is a lot of buddy systems there.
good,same as previous- hardest part- training and doing at the same time most enjoyable- co-workers willing to show you things to help you learn more
good,"Solid schedule fun, happy people to work with, company appreciates its associates, always room for learning. hardest part of job is minimal training and having to learn and do it at the same time. enjoyable part- co-workers willing to show what they know"
good,"I worked overnight, long hours of hard labor work. I learned what type of work ethic you need to succeed. The management was friendly and easy to learn from. Co-workers were also friendly and easy to work with. Hardest part was working fast enough during the long overnight hours. Most enjoyable part was working alongside great co-workers."
good,"A typical day each rep has a certain amount of accounts that they have to watch out for orders via email. Everyday is different where something presents itself that hasnt occurred before, so there's always something to learn. Management is sketchy, its a lot of miss communication. For the most part everyone in the department gets along. The hardest part of the job is making mass amounts of calls when a re-route has been done or around the holidays. The most enjoyable for me is when your up against a challenge with your customer and you handle it professionally and at the end the customer is satisfied"
good,"Good, smart, talented coworkers.  Fair HR Department, good pay and benefits."
good,I spent the bulk of my adult career with US Foods. I am very grateful for the opportunities that were presented to me and the invaluable relationships and work ethic that I was part of my every day.
good,US Foods has been a wonderful experience for me. I have had the opportunity to grow and flourish in a positive atmosphere focused on success. It is with great regret that I am leaving the company but there are no available opening in the area in which I am relocating.
good,Job is not for the faint at heart. A work hard play hard environment.
good,"Enjoyed working 13 yrs at this company."
good,"I have enjoyed working at US. Foods. The culture of the company is fantastic, and the management team is very supportive."
good,Great company benefits and work life.  Was my own boss If you made sales you were left alone.  If you did not you were not left alone. My boss was a good man.  I hated to leave but was offered double the money to go somewhere else whis I would have stayed.
good,"Every day is a different day.  I touch every single aspect of the business.  Can spend all day in front of the computer preparing reports, analyzing income and expenses, or spend time on the warehouse floor addressing product issues, or speding time with sales reps out on customer calls.  I have had a terrific career with US Foods and appreciate everything my co-workers and supervisors have done for me over my career.  I am consistently trying to become better and make my department better.  Over the course of my career I have helped automate most reporting and am profecient with Excel.  The hardest part of my job is not knowing what big obstacle I will have to tackle next, but I will also say that is extremely enjoyable too as I am not doing the same repetitive tasks every day.  To have the interaction with all departments, and help drive better results, and make jobs easier is something I enjoy.  One of my favorite sayings is ""Work smarter not harder.""  If you can think it through first, come up with a plan of attack, and are able to reduce time on specific tasks, it just opens more time to work on other tasks not getting completed in a timely manner."
good,"Install and perform repairs to hardware, software, and peripheral equipment. Oversee the daily performance of computer systems. Set up equipment for employee use, perform or ensure proper installation of cabling, operating systems, and appropriate software. Maintain record of daily date communication transactions, problems and remedial action taken, and installation activities. Read technical manuals, confer with users, and conduct computer diagnostics to investigate and resolve problems and provide technical assistance and support. Very challenging environment, upbeat, but very professional."

good,Love working for the company but my postion is relocated to up north and would love to be able to stay in florida due to kids and their schools.
good,Really enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers I helped in their daily business. The management team was very helpful in guiding the sales team to acquire new business while still helping ensure the current customers were well taken care of.  The work day was very flexible but you were always on the move.  It was hard to completely detach yourself from the job for an entire day--even on a Saturday or Sunday.  In the end just too attached to your laptop everyday.
good,US Foods is a great company.  They provide good benefits and excellent salaries.  A typical day is loading truck and making sure that all items are   present.  There were times when other drives had to assist with my deliveries because I had so many.  The day goes by rather quickly and you get to me nice people on your route.

good,According to Chanel Desir this is the best place to work if you like to cheaf  The manager is will let you know when you have to take a P test and they will give you a second but you should carry P with you at all times so you can just go in and take the test they won't pull your hair or do saliva  coming from the biggest blazer and Tampa this is the best job

good,"I enjoyed working there. Most of the staff is nice, sometimes 12 hour shift are a bit uncomfortable. Mostly good management. Mostly helpful co-workers. Maybe a bit of problems with OT"
good,I enjoyed the job and the environment. The managers and supervisors worked with me at my own pace to learn what to do. It was stressful at times due to my stacking and what not to stack on and what to stack on. Also in order to get a pay raise you would have to complete the assignment as quick as you can without any error rates.
good,"No Comment, at this moment thank you.great place for growing in the company and I have been working with them for a year and it was great to be part of the team."
good,"Work day would consist of a fast pace environment, very little room for error. The hardest part of the job was not knowing your end time! However the environment was up beat and made the job relaxing and easy to accomplish."
good,The company became more focused on selling itself than the normal operating procedures.  The company was fun an innovative but lost some of its focus.
good,Productive place to work a typical day was hard work I lean a great deal of knowlege in that feild of business management was fair work culture was good
good,"Overall, US Foods was a great company to work for. Like all places you have your good and bad things of course. Our division was like a big family and if our location wouldn‚Äôt have closed to merge with 2 other locations, I feel like I would still be with the company today."

good,The last six months were very busy with transitioning into the US Foods system.  Since going live it was challenging do to product not shipping correctly.  So in the end it was stressful but fun.  I enjoyed all the people I worked with and was able to work in a different position due to a co worker being injured.  So I experienced the will call and the shipping and receiving end of the business.
good,I really enjoyed working at US FOODs. Met a lot of good people and even learned a new job in transportation. My last job there was in transportation where I would send out all the trucks that were scheduled to go out that day.
good,Job enough for everyone so like for you hard work on ours good pay a rather work for US foods then Sysco  US foods takes care of their employees Sysco doesn‚Äôt
good,I liked working with the management team and learning about the food service industry. This industry has its challenges and recruiting qualified employees was the most difficult part of the position.

good,"""We Help You Make It"" is their logo. USF is an exceptional company, one which is growing, and a well established organization. Many long term veterans stay with the company because of the culture, the pay, the productive work that serves the community. In a couple years this location has withstood many changes, many roles have been created, many people have come and gone. This is not necessarily a bad thing; they are working out the kinks as they have been made public recently. Faith is strong, teamwork is exceptional, commodore is balanced, benefits and pay are good, and they are generous with providing team events such a BBQ's, games, incentives, holiday offerings, and prizes. The Seacoast, NH is a great area to live & work. A job is what you make it."
good,"US Foods has allowed me to relocated across 5 markets, 3 areas, and the Corporate office to gain experience and growth.  US Foods is a transformative company that understands the mission needs to be,""We help our customers make it."""

good,good paying job but very hard work long hours some nights working upwards of 13 to 14 hours you will have no life working here but your pay checks will show
good,If one person got off paced it would cause slow down of productivity. Really taught me how keeping pace on a job is important.  Sometime others did not show up on time.  Get plenty of hours- overtime.
good,Great Company. Always on the  cutting edge of technology. Very competitve which in turn creates results. Benefits were fair and reasonable. Soory to have been laid off due to them (almost being bought by Sysco).
good,"Overall the company was a good place to work.  Fast paced touching current and prospect customers everyday of the week.  Constant need to open new business became very stressful and was always in the back of my mind.  Company objectives at times were overwhelming and unreasonable, not that they didn't care about the customer, but it wasn't a priority."
good,Great place to make some good money but work hours are long and questionable and you can miss alot of family activities if you have one! Otherwise great place to work.

It requires you to work all day in prospecting your business and into the night with computer work and planning your next day. This is not a 9 to 5 job. The quality of life can be difficult do to the amount of hours needed to be successful.

Grading  fresh product, checking  quality, some inventory functions, monitored fresh fish program. responded to customer, associate, management emails and concerns.  The culture for the most part was friendly and productive. The most enjoyable aspect was that i was the first person in this position and  I was able to help get the ball rolling on getting good controls in the daily functions around the facility.

I enjoyed the flexible schedule, the ability to advance and the ability to speak freely.

We utilized many technologies to monitor our business and use that for decision making to grow the accounts. The management was professional and fair and there were lots of training and development opportunities. The hardest part of the job was managing unhappy customers when their truck came much later than expected and they were not able to have the food they needed for their meal service. The best part of the job was seeing my Territory Managers grow and meet their goals as a result of my coaching-that was very rewarding for me!"

good,"Good place to work, they care about their employee's. The only issue I had was the schedule.  Being a Shuttle Driver, I was working at night and was cutting into my time with my family."
good,It could pay a lot better the profits are there to pay their employees better.  Overall is a very good company And look out for other people. I will be giving it a few more years
good,"Its a job, I would consider for the people who are single or have the time to put in 12 hour days. Definitely a workplace that has its perks. Its the warehouse out of all in the U.S. that has to pull in out the most volume. Some occasions may settled on a day for gift cards to most productive team members."
good,"the hardest part about the job was talking to a computer, the whole day. And lifting heavy objects at at a fast pace. Your on a time limit, you have to keep a 100%"
good,Great job to work for young men. Keeps you in shape.  Very competitive place to work at. I lot of incentives. Lot of money to make at the copmany and bonus.  Can be hard on the body and dont get much sleep
good,"Best job I have ever had. Great family like atomosphere with good pay. The days are fast paced with plenty to do and learn on a daily basis. Stay busy but not over whelmed. The day never drags along, its time to go home before you even realize it. Management for the most part is fair and helpful, but there is the occasional excessive red tape to get things done. Overall I really enjoy being a part of the company where I never just feel like another number but a real person who is appreciated."
good,"I  enjoyed working there, very fast paced job. Some supervisors need to be schooled on how to treat employees and stressful situations. When really busy fellow employees would help you. Had some good managers overall. Not a big turnover on clerks and office personnel."
good,Being a customer service rep is somewhat stressful itself because so many factors come into play with food delivery. When you work with the right people it can be less stressful and even fun at times.
good,"Best paying job I ever had!  The pay is based on how hard you worked,  The team was beyond amazing and I got along great with coworkers  and supervisors."
good,I enjoyed working with management and colleagues. I also enjoyed the autonomy I was given to work with the heads of the outside branches and as a liaison with outside counsel.
good,"Spend half the day on the warehouse floor researching product counts/physical inventory and/or any discrepancies. The other half would be spend in the office assisting in data entry and data updates. "
good,"USFoods, being a nationwide large distributor, brought competitive energy to the industry.  Being in an accounting capacity brought a continued variety of communication and experiences throughout the entire office and external entities."
good,USF is in a tough spot because there is a major driver shortage.  Let alone trying to find drivers who are willing to work physically the way this industry demands.  They try their best though.  Good salary and benefits and a management team that seems to really care about their teams.
good,Good company just was in the wrong location could not transfer closer to my home good pay good days off good supervisor good co workers good tractors and trailers
good,Be patient look carefully at your order sheets before placing them on pallet please double check all items before items r placed on pallet let your supervisor know if you r short of any products.and please load trucks according to stops.
good,Forklift operator for 10+ years and coming into work was good. The workplace was productive and it was fun meeting friends and we would get work done.
good,"I have a great experience in my position.  I feel that my manager is supportive and they care about us as people, professionally and personally. We have great company values, however, outside of my department is where the company values do not seem to carry through.  I would recommend this company, but I would advise the applicant to interview the interviewers just as hard."
good,Gave me the opportunity to grow through the years.  Good benefits and 401k match. Very good culture within the company. Ability to learn all facets of the industry.  Fast pace work environment.
good,Job was difficult at times. In a food service certain customers are very demanding require hot rush deliveries-stressful. Inventory balance a challenge
good,"It‚Äôs never a dull moment, the whole warehouse is filled with hard working men. It‚Äôs a fast past and dangerous environment. Safety is always first. The best part is the whole entire warehouse is ran by this little old lady. It got to be over 150 male employees, and she works just as hard as the men. Cleaning driving forklift grabbing the nearest piece of wood.."
good,Great culture at this company.  I have been blessed to experience different roles and learn more about Contracting and the Food Distribution business.
good,productive and great workplace .good steady work. friendly environment with option to move up within the company. willingness to train you in various departments
good,"My day always started early say 4:30- 530 pickup paperwork check that the load was secured and refer temp was correct, bring hand truck and or pallet jack for unloading."
good,"a little hard job but competitive payment for the work.Management is"
good,"Been working for 7+ years at us foods on nights, yeah it's hard labor but the job and benefits are way better than any other place I've been to. When I first started out it was double jacks they have triple jacks now, they have a standard you have to fulfill each week. They have you hired on a 90 day probation period before they legitimately keep you in their warehouse. The standard isn't that easy at first, but if you have determination you will make it. The supervisors don't give you that much role to role contact I agree with that, but the warehouse is always insanely busy. The facility is union good pay great benefits. Overtime is a must also."
good,I have enjoyed working at US Foods. The people are polite and professional. I was able to apply my work experience and my education to the duties I was assigned. My co-workers are very enjoyable to work with.
good,"Good job with great pay and benefits, the other workers can be A bit impatient with new hires at times but are otherwise nice and helpful. Performance is measured in percentages."
good,for the most part good people to work with. the Union can be a hassle to deal with since the contract is very vague and subject to interpretation. management just wants to get the job done while the union finds ways to prevent it.
good,"Nice place to work at; uncertainty of job security. Good products, shipped products in a timely manner; product costs were competitive and was allowed samples for my clients."
good,"Hit the road by 7am take care of all current clients while prospecting others. "
good,"The hardest part of the job: keeping pace with the sales growth"
good,US food is great company to work because i learn a lot working here. The environment is process to learn this company have a lot work to continue working here but i looking something in my career for my family and me. I would be continue working here but i will like a chance in my life
good,I have learned the skills that make a good buyer. I have been encouraged to learn as many different aspects of the buyer position in order to advance. I have watched the management team change for the better.
good,"Good company, good structure. Lots of bonus potential for a go getter."
good,"I manage a team of 10 sales associates we call on exsisting accounts and prospect for new business. US Foods has a great culture with a sense of family within the organization. Hardest part if my position is relying on transportation to deliver our goods and services in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part is coaching our sales team for success,"
good,It's an above average company that provides many benefits to their workers but has the usual middle management problems.
good,"Typical day was answering in coming calls, taking food & supply orders from customers and sales staff. Complete assistance with whatever needed. I learned product knowledge and professional problem solving, and multi-tasking.Management was very professional, and compassionate .Co-workers were extremely wonderful. Hardest part of job was at times, trying to compensate for uncontrollable , late trucks, or product shortage. Most enjoyable was working closely with customers, sales staff, and co-workers."
good,Nice balance balance between work & personal life with some flexibility. Compensation is very good when you perform. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the relationships that I have built as a direct result of relationship selling.
good,"I come to work at 11:30 pm, sort out with drivers need to be released  and print out all the drivers route sheets with assigned doors for departure. Management is pretty good with handling a busy night, most times if I need help they would take the time to assist me. The hardest part of this job is having to deal with damaged goods and making sure that we had replacement of the same product for the driver. The most enjoyable part of this job is hearing about the drivers daily commute making their rounds to customers."
good,Good place to work. I'vebeen working for US Foodservice for five years and I enjoyed it. I wish I could work here longer.
good,Job is definitely productive and have many areas of advancement or selections of job titles to consider. Management from my experience were very easy to talk to and even hangout with outside of work. Now the long work nights are the major pain but its always nice to have overtime; just not all the time!!! The jobs perks and employees made the job enjoyable! loved this job.
good,"Hard work, but you are compensated fairly. Incentive system so, the harder you work, the more money you make. Get paid sick, personal, and vacation days. Very good job if you are a night owl."
good,"I am the Division Traing Manager. My expertise in foodservice is extensive. I interact with our salepeople and our customers every day. We have a lot of change here, and I adapt well to whatevernew technique or protocol becomes my responsibility. I have experience setting up training programs for foodservice, and would like to continue. My job has been eliminated, and shifted to a regional position, or I would be unlikely to want to leave."
good,Great co-workers who know how to work hard and balance life at the same time.
good,It's a good company over all but you have to be at the company for a few years before you able to get a full ime job there.But other then that it's a good job in a good company to work for.
good,"This is a really great company to work for. People are real nice and the management are very attentive. However, the company is open every day but 3 (Christmas Day, Thanksgiving Day, New Years Day). Though, sometimes you will be asked to work on those days. Each job in the company is very stressful as they expect the work of 3 people with the staff of 1."
good,"A typical day: Up at the crack of dawn, review my daily goals and hit the street running. Take care of my current customers and their needs, show them new and exiting products and recipes that can help profitize them a bit more. When my customers were all set for the day I would cold call to build my business and create new accounts and contacts. Management: My Management team was very supportive and would assist in any way I needed them to. Co-workers: I was in good standing with all co-workers being on the road most of the day in sales we would mostly only see each other at sales meetings or from time to time we would cross paths at the office. Price fighting with other competitors in the field.Over coming that fight through product knowledge and cuttings of product when the customer saw the value in what I was showing them."
good,You never have the same day at work. Learned many new tools and knowledge to improve my career. Managment staff are fair and understanding always willing to train and provide proper work atmosphere.
good,"fast paced,mostly involved several tasks on any given day.learned many aspects of maintanence field.Most enjoyed working with a variety of outsourced contacts and rewarded by my abitity to mulitask under sometimes adverse situations."
good,Good place to work or have a career. Diverse. Exceptional and fair pay. Benefits are great. Great home time. Free uniforms. Millions of company discounts.
good,Great management but can be strict at times. Hard work considering the long hours and work load. The pay is great and the hard work pays off in the long run.

Good benefits decent pay. Depending on the job it may be the hardest work you‚Äôve ever done in your life but you end up thriving on it."
good,"US Foods was a great place to work. The only concern I ever had was when they centralized their accounting to a different state, and I thought I was going to be out of a job.  I ended up not having to worry, the VP of Ops hired me to work in the other end of the building as an Operations Analyst, and gave me some great work experience.  The hours were long on that side of the building, but the people were great, and the overtime pay was nice.  It was like having a second family at work, just a very large family! I got the chance to work more directly with warehouse workers and the drivers, and sit in on a few meetings with the union reps, including working out a new CBA."
good,"Great employee relations, management is far and cares and takes time to get to know everyone."
good,"Great company to work for. Hard work as a deliver driver. Have to be in shape and work rain, sleet or snow. Good manager and straight forward. what you see is what you get."
good,"In my time working at U.S foods, i gained a lot of experience i might not have learned any where else. The work environment is a great place to work. The management was great and very helpful, the coworkers where very fun and helpful as well."
good,"Management provided tools necessary to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was testing and tasting food. I learned a lot from my boss in finance, she was great at teaching."
good,Management is great to get along with but there training is terrible. Job is strict on seniority so best belive you get crappu everything. Pay is great top at $28 in e months working 4/10s. Kiss kiss your Friday and Sundays off for the next 5 yrs. Schedules mmm okay. Fast paced very fast paced . no time given. Run. With no breaks.... Or fold. Orders are hand given so expect an ugly fat stack.
good,"It is typical to work a 10 hour day. Most of the customers where friendly and accommodating. Sales men that were responsible for acquiring and maintaining commercial customers were available and easy to get along with. The atmosphere was driver friendly and there was an enjoyable atmosphere. The benefits, 401k and stock options were great."
good,"US Foods is very professional when it comes to taking care of their employees, but like any other warehouse jobs is very fast paced and busy workplace. US Food is one of the biggest if not the biggest distributions food company's in United Stated, so you can imagine what is like. Even though is a hard duty job, I would recommend anyone to work for US Foods, if looking for a warehouse job. The paying is good in any states."
good,"Great place to work and would recommend as full time employment. Great pay and benefits, great payed time off.bene there for ten years but wanting to relocate"
good,"Good paying company , not a company you can retire from as a routedriver. Management positions are usually filled from the outside. Benefits are great and depending on the division you are at there are usually family events every year."
good,"A typical day at work started at 2am and got home around 6pm."
good,US Foods offers good learning opportunities for their employees and I was very happy with the pace of my career advancement there.  The management can sometimes feel a little divided but overall the communication is very good.
good,"Consistent leader in department. Expressed my desire to move up in company. Had a half-hearted interview with district manager, but afterwards realized that people are chosen based on personal criteria, as opposed to performance and work history"
good,Us Foods is a great company to work for. They are always willing to help you become successful in whatever you set your mind too. I am very thankful for the management team here. They definitely team up to help others out.

good,Great place to work. Always felt supported in projects. Great teamwork. Inclusive environment. Great people. Positive feedback on work and effort. Sense of pride...
good,"The best part about my time with this company was never having a dull moment. There was always something to be done. Many times feeling as though the work day has barely started, but it is already ending."
good,The company tires its best to be transparent and the workplace has a relaxed culture.  Everyone gets along from the warehouse to the front office.  You get to know your co-workers in a friendly relaxed environment.  Plus management knows your name (both good and bad).
good,A typical Day there would be nice  but its just so cold in there  its very big cold and has alot of room  people taking orders all over the place  you smell some of the best food too.
good,There is always room for Advancement here. Moved up quickly and by far the best compensation and Benefits of any place i worked at. If you work for them you will be taken care of.
good,"I called on independent restaurant owners  and helped them"
good,"Overall good place to work , good benificts  ,nice people , nice Shop, had all the parts and tools you needed , office people were friendly and helpful,"
good,"A typical day was 9-12 hours of work. depending on the department I was a part of at the time, I would do a number of different tasks. From the beginning position to the position I was in when I left, I worked almost every part of the Operations side of the business. I moved to Sales once mastering all that I could in Operations. This is when it became obvious to me that Sales was a good fit for me and I found great success in it as well. Among other, smaller awards, I won the Business Excellence Award the final two years I was in Sales. "
good,"Excellent management and leadership,  Benefits the best in todays economy.  Clear opportunity for promotion and advancement"
good,"besides the 20degree setting outside i went to work in a freezer warehouse everyday."
good,The best in Food is not just a saying but a way of life in this company.
good,"Everybody worked as a team. You could always depend on each other when help was needed. We could laugh and still get our jobs done. The hardest part of m job was working in a warehouse that stayed 32 degrees all day. I was a receiver of frozen product. Enjoyed the work, something different every day."
good,"I started in 1989 pulling cases at night. After 5 years, I moved to the day shift. I had a very good time working there. Money was good, benefits were good. Vendors would come in and cook the whole company lunch (100 people) for the ones that were there. Just a good environment."
good,"This company I really liked. I looked forward to going to work. We always had something going on, be it a BBQ or vendors would come in to cook for us. The work was hard, the food service business is hard but we worked as a team and did just fine. I was there along time."
good,I recommend US Food Service to anyone who applies.  The job had different circumstances everyday and was challenging all the time.
good,Selecting client's orders to be shipped out in the morning.
good,"I worked for this company for almost three years and I haven't seen any company that pays that well, great benefits, they take care of you. When it comes to be punctual they take that seriously. No Union for such a great company, you get fired you better be sure you're not coming back. Great management, always on point."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job and had a wonderful boss who took the time to mentor me and teach me things to better my ability to perform my job. I gained many lifelong friends at this company and really enjoyed my time there. I always received recognition for my accomplishments and felt I was an important part of an organization.
good,"Being paid off production,so the harder you work the more money you make. When you're working hard time does fly pretty quick and that was the best part of my day."
good,The work was between fast and slow some time but the people there was enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was working in the cooler and freezer were it was extremely cold.
good,"During my nearly one year at US Foods, I had the opportunity to work with very professional co-workers who respected my position and I theirs. "
good,"Well, a typical day at work would start with a floor meeting to figure out what department you would be going to. Shortly after that you would go pick up your equipment for the day. Then get right to starting orders because everything is base off time to make rate. I learned a lot while working at US Foods! One thing being to never give up and move on to the next thing. One mistake could effect your entire day if you let it, so keep it moving and stay motived."
good,"National foodservice distributor having a focus on quality.  Distributing to every facet of foodservice from small independent operations to large multi-managed corporations.  The work environment is professional, but not rigid."
good,"very similar to most food food service distribution companies. Days start early and end late often times working 70 hours per week and very physical but, compensation was reflective of the hours worked."
good,Great people in leadership to help you grow your career and gain knowledge about the Food Service Industry. The work environment is nice and enjoyable.
good,"You were kept on your toes frequently. You never stopped learning. To cross train was the easiest I have ever seen. Everyone was treated as a equal. The interaction with the sales reps,distributers and cutomers would alway expand your knowledge. My saying when I worked there was if I didn't learn something new when I left I didn't go to work. It was the only job I had that took a very lengthy time to learn. It was so worth the time"
good,"I love working for US Foods. The management team has helped develop my skills, and allowed me to grow in a healthy work environment. I thoroughly enjoy working with the team in my division. I highly recommend US Foods Charlotte as a place of employment."
good,"Cleaned restrooms, offices, hallways, stairs. The hardest part about this job the long drive to and from work. I enjoyed working with my co workers. Management was ok."
good,Plenty of opportunities for advancement. Management wants you to succeed. True open door policies.
good,A typical day is to select all your orders correctly and get them shipped out on time so customers can recieve their orders as expected.I learn how to pack items and different ways how to stack items. Management and co-workers were hard workers and good people to work with. The hardest part of the job was to make sure not to mess any product ordered. 
good,Very fast paced I learned that if i can do this i can do anything. Working alot of overtime it was a pleasure working with my coworkers
good,A typical work day would be all work employes would get together stretch before our work shift and laugh and tell jokes it was a great atmosphere that went throughout the work day. Ive learned a lot of work ethnic and it taught me to be self motivated and work hard to reach my goals.
good,The thing I like about this job was the fast moving pace that you had to uphold when working with people that was there to work hard for what they want good hard working people who I got close in friendly with and became like a family .Those are thing's you look for when working with people you have the same value to make money and as much as you can .
good,My experience with US Food was great this is a good place to work for the pay is great and it‚Äôs a Union job with great benefits. I‚Äôve told friends about US Food and I would go back if I had the chance.
good,It was a good stand up and active duty job. We had to use a system to select the right product. Once we finish a order we go to the office box to grab another order to. You would repeat these steps until the end of your shift
good,"Great job, it paid very well. I had to leave due to relocation. Management was very helpful and was always there to answer questions if needed. I would definitely recommend this job."
good,"No opportunity for carrier advancement, no training, and poor management plans."
good,It was a good place to work 4 days and pay was decent got good vacation time and home every night. Other than that management and routing good of used an overhaul
good,most of the shifts were long and physically demanding but that was all forgotten when you got your check. they work you but pay you even more. anyone looking for consistent work and great pay should consider them
good,I liked working here. Great experience environment and co workers I've worked with . My Boss was very good at training me and making sure I stayed on top of my work
good,"The job consisted of driving through a warehouse on a triple pallet jack and stacking specific orders on each pallet within a limited amount of time. I learned how to stack orders of product fast and properly, which is harder than it sounds because the product had to stay on it's pallet until the entire order was completed. Every order is between 180 and 350 cases, so each pallet could stack up to 10 feet tall by the end of each order. I learned how to safely drive a pallet jack and manage my time efficiently to make my quota each night."
good,In this job is a learnig process every day was a challenge. Every single day we don't know how much work or order we are going to have and my job was determine how many people need to get those order on the time frame the same day.  Very excited job and the relation with the coworker was great..  Great  place to work and grown
good,"I spent  many years of my life with US Foods, you will work many many hours as a TM, if you want to be successful.  You will enjoy a great company that is behind you all the way.  "
good,"I just don't make enough money there no pay raise no benefits for me at all, and I just want to be appreciated for my work I do that's all.and they make sure that the people get there food on time.i like working there but I haven't gotten an raise yet"
good,It was a cool job but not so cool . When the supervisor are not doing their job right. So it‚Äôs become confusing with employees . When workers not workin like other.
good,"Challenging and gratifying. Lots of giving for training new areas and must travel more than I wanted. not so understanding managers to new staff,"
good,My dream job until my boss became ill and passed away.  Brought management from another division and instantly became a toxic work environment.  Was fired 1 week to the day my boss passed away. Traumatic experience
good,"Overall this is a great company. Wake up and check emails, work on any immediate issues, leave and visit first guest around 8:30 try to get home by 4:30 to review orders, after dinner, work on any pricing for prospects, Planning, Prioritizing, Preparing and Pursuing takes a lot of work and energy I learned a whole lot with all the training provided at general sales meetings and district sales meetings (although I think they could reduce the amount of them) Management for the most part was great. I think the hardest part of the job was trying to maintain your weekly time schedule without having to meet a truck due to mis-picks and shorts. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving my customers and knowing their needs were met."
good,"Flexible and Rewarding all wrapped up together. Consisted of Cold Calling, A/R Collections, Opening and Maintaining Growth with ALL Accounts. Building Strong Relationships. Learned a Ton about the industry front of house to back of house. Hardest part was trying to gain New Business and meet Unattainable Company Goals and Expectations. Most Enjoyable was Cultivating Relationships and Building on that which became like Friends and Family to help them be successful....."
good,unbalance day after day never know what you will doing til the last hour of working day for the next day
good,overall decent workplace. Im currently looking to transfer to st. louis.
good,"I thought US Foods a great company to work for, however, the salary opportunities werelimited. People were very nice and great work ethics. Great team environment."
good,They have a wonderful bonus program that is offered to all full time employees. It is a fast pace work environment that offers you the chance to go out of state if you wish.
good,US Foods as a whole was not a bad company to work for. The benefits were compatible with industry standards. I applied for and got another position within the company but the manager turned out to be horrible. So I left the company.
good,They don't care about the shuttle drivers. You don't mean s____ to the company.  You gonna work long hour for less pay. Your pay per week WILL go up & down
good,I trained and coached the sales team on selling new and old products using unique selling techniques to improve sales and goals.
good,Can be doable work with the proper equipment given. Lack of reasoning on delivery drivers well being getting the proper information needed to do certain stops. Very lack of equipment needed to perform the job much more easily. Great pay and lots of work to keep you making good money.
good,My time at US Foods was excellent. They have changed over the years i understand. The Training was excellent the coworkers for the most part tried to help each other.
good,"A productive work place fast pace and also felt more meaningful, Customer base job and everyone was aware of there job duties mangenment was understanding and very helpful"
good,well I don‚Äôt pass my probation I did a mistake I got a accident on my week 6 but I feel this company help a lot co-workers good actitud management are helpful and very friendly
good,I loved it here.. Great place to get your life in order career wise. The wages are very competitive within the industry as well. Only reason I'm looking for a new position is because my family and relocated.
good,US Foods have great safe facuilty. I was trained for at two weeks before they allowed me to select products on my own. And to motivate us they would pay us according to how well stacked and accurate our order.
good,"Ability to deliver quality work on tight deadlines, with strong organization and priority setting skills.Guiding financial decisions by establishing, monitoring, and enforcing policies and procedures."
good,"To strict on certain policies like with the dive cam, true it is a great tool and needed,but to a certain extent its abused and adds a layer of stress to a job that is already a demanding one. Still a great company and well worth the effort."
good,"USFoods is a very clean and modern factory. Has coffee and water/gatorade for their drivers. It's a well paying job with benefits, but the hours are too much for me personally. It depends on what you want out of a job. The people who work for USFoods are great people, friendly and helpful. If you can work 12-16 hours a day 6 days a week, this is the job for you. It's challenging, fast paced, but pays well."
good,You will never know the future but if you plan correctly you will be in a better position to attack what ever problems come your way. Creative problem solving and being thorough is a must.
good,This job is very demanding and hard work. It is union. The only reason i wouldleave it's because of it being second shift. It is unionso to get on first shift you must be there a few years. My family and i decided it would be best if i could get a first shift job elsewhere that It would be best for us
good,"linking customers to pricing/ off invoice allowances.  AC code cleanup, helped with standard business processes, and trained co workers on systems such as Tandem and MDM that are used daily"
good,"I started there at 280 lbs in four months I was down to 230lbs. I was fast paced. you have to learn on the fly. You have to get used to working in different climates ie: freezer, cooler, dry."
good,"Great job , great people you'll learn alot about yourself. hard work but it pays off in the end. you'll stay in shape working here. friendly people that care."
good,I enjoy working in US Foods because I have good VPs and I learnt a lot from them. The reason I have to leave is because my visa requires me to work within an E-verified company. My division is not because CT doesn't require its companies have to go through E-verify.
good,Inventory control interests me because I just naturally organize and keep track of things. This particular job I knew and understood my responsibilities and completed them very well. Working with every department in one way or another gave me a wide overview of the daily activity of the business.

I learned alot from this company, the company sent me to many different states for training to help me better myself as a supervisor an educate me more on the future of the company. Thru this company I have became a certfied forklift and pallet jack operator and trainer.My co-workers were like family to me an they still are. We worked together as a team, that's the only way we could meet our deadline. The hardest part of the job is the attendance, when you have alot of call outs that makes the night longer an that put our trucks in jeopardy not leaving on time or not reaching the shuttle points on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was my people, I supervised 25 selectors an 4 forklift operators an we was just one big family in our department. Being able to help them succeed an meet there weekly production numbers was something that I enjoyed. Able to solve problems an if I didn't have the answer I will direct it to someone who would have an answer."
good,"A typical day at work was challenge not really knowing where you where going or cases til you got there. What I learned the different ways of other driver work.

good,"It usually begins at 5 p.m. Sunday-Thursday.  You come in grab your assigned equipment, grab your labels to get started and wait for warm up.  The you are authorized to go the fun really starts.  It's a mad dash to get to the first isle that the system generated routes tell you to go to and retrieve the appropriate amount of product from that location.  You continue this until all the labels are done for the night.  It is a definite workout."
good,..................................great experience with job and coworkers I had great pay the Kobe was very easy and I like the free food and money !!

good,Always changing. Some things I agree with; others I don't.  Production based atmosphere.  Safety is of top importance along with looking at production numbers on an individual basis.   Loved my manager because he understood all aspects of the job and showed true compassion for his employees while yet still abiding by company policy
good,I worked 5 years at US Foods.  During that time the company was changing rapidly into a progressive new ideas and unique food products company in order  to serve its customer base. US offers a good opportunity for career advancement. The benefits are excellent as well as the support and frequent contests to accelerate sales increases. Hard work and persistence will pay off for a rewarding career in food service.
good,"Get to work from home every other week."

good,Awesome work environment. Challenging environment with enthusiastic associates. I love the daily challenges and rewarding work environment. Technology and consultative team based selling is the competitive advantage.

good,"Food service is a tough industry,but a rewarding job to have. Just know that the balance between work and your personal will not be there. Trailers are loading to get the most cases out that they can,some days are easier than others,and some days makes you want to quit....very do-able job though."
good,US foods is a great place to work. They pay a good salary and have other employee incentives. Also include a safe work environment for all employees. Also include incentives for accuracy and quality.

good,"It was like familey. I enjoyed going to work. We had a lot of pot lucks.I enjoyed working with customers. I answered the phones starting 800am untill5pm.Learned alot about computers,how to take orders transfer calls to corect offices. The hardest part was when the falcility closed."
good,Life at US Foods is really pretty good compared to most jobs.  The challenges are the current economy and trying to get your customers to break bad habits; getting their food from someone other than me.  With rising food cost and operation cost the number of independent restaurants are becoming less and less each month.
good,"nice culture...very good company to gain exposure"
good,Prepare to be on call all hours. Great benefits. Good People.
good,"Nice company to work for. It does get boring being its the food industry, and the only thing that is exciting is that you get to eat a lot of new things before the restaurants get the ideas. Pay is ok. We do a lot and don't get compensated for the ""lot"" that we do. But who am i to complain right?"
good,"A company and seems to care about employees, and still make a profit. Enjoyed working there, and wish I had never left."
good,"If you enjoy a regular routine, this is a good job for you. I drive the same route daily with a couple of backhauls weekly (which pays extra) Job is gravy IMO. Pay is good as well.

good,Worked there for 5yrs was the first local gig and for the most part started off as shuttle driver and up graded to routes and the pay was great plenty of hrs and OT.. made a mistake in transferring to a division that pays by component and not Hrly... I'd still be there but that's life your learn..
good,If I could do it all over again I would I would change how I left the company I really liked working for them and I think I was a good asset to the company unfortunately the company didn't think so even though I never had anything else on my record other than the drive Cam which they wanted me to go to point A to point B without using My phone for a GPS
good,"fast-paced "
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to advance into a promotion. I was treated appropriately by bosses and other employees. "
good,I enjoyed it you got 5 minutes paid stretching everyday! 4 breaks throughout the night one 30 and up to 4 15 minute breaks lunch isn‚Äôt paid bud all the other breaks are!
good,I liked working at US Foods through TW services. I always liked fast paced work that challenges me to do better. My only complaint was that management switched me around to different shifts. But I liked working here overall.
good,"Good place to work. Not long hours but if you don't live nearby the drive can be far. Team I work with is great, all around a good place to be employed with."

good,Posted all batches that came in from the bank. Applied payments all day long. I learned new data and food industry. The manager we had was the best. Not crazy of the work environment because I don't like call center environment but made great friends there. The hardest part of the job was working in a call center environment which was loud. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a great boss and very nice co-workers.
good,Made safety my biggest priority and with that I got to get the customers their items safely and made sure that they were satisfied. Great fast pace job
good,"I loved working at US Foods and loved the group of guys that I worked with on a daily basis. I was very well paid for what I did, but the hours can be very long and inconsistent."

good,Worked in the field and could work from home if need be! Great bunch of fellow employees! This was an exciting job and I was able to grow my knowledge of food from some of the areas greatest chefs!!
good,THe job at US Foods was different every day. Some days would start very early heading to see customers before dawn and others were spent in the office.  I learned how to manage myself.  The workplace culture was very supportive focusing on training and development.  The hardest part of the job is that you are never really off the clock.  In 11 years I only had one vacation that I didnt have to do any work. On the posative side is the flexability.  You can work from anywhere.
good,A good place to work although very physical heavy delivery work. In season work days are very long and start very early in the morning. The pay is great but you sure work for it.

good,US Foods is currently instituting an aggressive new Sales Coverage Model throughout the company to transform into a Great American Company.

Coaching customers into profitability is extremely gratifying as is the growth of my portfolio with their increased sales.
good,Best job I ever had. Over all good place to work. Union jobs very awesome.

good,"I enjoy working here. Everyone I worked with was helpful and happy to teach."
good,This is not a bad job to work I enjoy working there it was just the supervisor did not believe me on things I told him and wanted to suspend me. The pay is very fair and great one of the best company I ever worked for not only that the hours was ok it‚Äôs just you get the job for Sunday-Thursday not Sunday-Friday with one day off mean Saturday ur only day to sleep and spend with family.

good,The Ogden location in the Salt Lake City division is by far the best place to work hands down.  The great thing about this place is that the pay is worth the work that you put in. This job challenges you and strengthens you to work harder and strive for more. It builds your character development and work ethic. This company is great if you are looking to establish yourself and your family. The compensation plans are amazing and beneficial. There is room for advancement and next level progression to move up in the company and do bigger and better. This is a good company to call home and start a career at. It is a launching point. Yes the work is labor intensive and the hours can be long but the pay is worth it. This company values their employees and the hard work that they put in.
good,Good company can make a lot of money co workers are fun but Management is horrible. They only care for you to bring there products out to there accounts to them your a number simple but overall you just got to get your work done to get home early.

Throughout the day I am taking phone calls, emails, and instant messages from my sales representatives and fellow co-workers.  Assisting with adding items to orders, placing and cancelling orders, looking up product information and receiving dates, and setting up special order request. I have learned to manage my time and complete my tasks for the day by having small requests pop up throughout the day.  The management here is amazing.  They allow me the time I need for appointments and my children's school functions.  My co-workers are easy going and we all get along well.  The hardest part of my job is having to tell a customer that a product was not received in time, when they were relying on it to be in on time for function they were having.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that it does not feel like work.  I am constantly smiling and if I have any type of questions, I can turn to anyone in the building and they would all be happy to help out as much as they possibly could."

good,"My time spent at U.S. Foods, Inc. had many challenges (including time management) It was a union shop and most employees generally looked out for each other's well being. From being hired as an order selector (selecting products for our customers to be loaded onto trucks for delivery) to working as a Forklift operator or Loader, the job can have many areas of stress. One such area is: Time management; we each had to ensure that we minimize our errors and have each task done on time. The goal is always 95-100%. There were times (especially on Friday nights) where we would have a meal together to create a social and morale boosting environment. There was always a major emphasis on safety and training to keep our skills intact. The communication at the start up meeting also kept us informed as to the goals for the day and week. (Also, if we as a team met our quotas) Each Supervisor had particular responsibilities that kept the whole warehouse managed. The hardest part of the job was to make the standard (95-100%) in your area of expertise. The most enjoyable part was when we would have time off and food catered from some of our vendors. Being on time was crucial. (After 4 tardies or no call no shows you were subject to termination, etc.) If you did your job and stayed focused, there would be a minimal chance of conflict with the Supervisor(s)."
