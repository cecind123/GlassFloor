bad,"This company left a bad mark on me, I wouldn't advise my worst enemy to work there. The training is rushed and they just throw you out there on the phones and expect you to be perfect right away. Won't tell you what you're doing wrong until you make the mistake. I just have to say, if you like mess, this is the place to work."
bad,"I did not have proper training for my Customer Service role. The class new hire class was mixed with other departments with employees who were already employed. So as you can imagine, the trainer and the other employees would get off task a lot and spend a lot of time clowning around. One time they even had a discussion about their thoughts on the the trans community, and it was nothing nice. When someone came to observe the trainer, that was when everyone was on their best behavior.  It was like high school all over again. The trainer sped through the PowerPoints and never recapped. At one point, she admitted that she was not happy with her position and it showed. She had a tendency to overshare like that a lot. And as a new employee, that was not the impression I was expecting from a trainer at any job. She justified not doing her job properly by saying that we will learn everything on the floor anyway. Also, I was never fairly compensated working as a Bilingual Spanish Customer Service Representative. I had passed the bilingual test required and I was taking Spanish calls. However,  my manager never properly submitted the request to have the differential added to my paycheck. Despite of how many times I asked about it, nothing was ever done about. And to this day, I have not seen a cent of that money I was entitled to. The one good thing they had set up was a help line for CSR agents, however the managers would declined escalations frequently which they are not allowed to do. But they never got in trouble for it as all the managers there are friends,  and it was something"
bad,My Department was like working in h&ll . no teamwork and if you ask for help you are treated like an idiot and future projects or chances of promotion or taken away from you.  I've seen other departments however going thru the opposite.  happy employees manager actually treats them like people and not animals.
bad,"I felt beat down at this company.  mgrs sit with the team and literally eagle eye everything going on.  If you are on the phone, what is on your computer screen? etc etc.  If you leave your desk to use the restroom expect to be asked where you have been?  and told to log back into the phone system you have been away from your desk.  You are assigned hours to work each week.  You will be expected to work weekends.  Several times throughout the day you are reminded as a team of your personal numbers, your teams numbers and the company as a whole's numbers.  No autonomy to use your own selling style, you are told to literally read from the script given to you and do not deviate."
bad,"In experience management  Loans never closed on time.  Cut throat mentality  "
bad,"there nothing to talk about working for this place period manager are not treat employee fair, does not matter how hard you work, manager rather give award to a person who did not deserve the award, just sad place to work"
bad,Mr Cooper is not a good place to work.  The company is ran like a sweat shop.  They don't care about their employees and as a result the morale is very low
bad,Never working there again...I wouldn't reccommend it if it was the last job on earth. I hate MrCooper . I hate MrCooper. I hate MrCooper. I absolutely hate MrCooper.
bad,"There were rodents ... the ppl were always fighting ... the workers off task, walking around mingling. But I give the center a B for effort. Six months after I left, I was still in the top 10 agents. Not bad uh? It was a mess but I had them metrics on 'lock' lol"
bad,Worked there 6 years it was horrible!  Wouldn’t recommend  anyone to work here!!  Management is the worse!!  A lot of people have left because of this even management & upper management!!
bad,"Poor work culture, they have people in the same role with 20k pay differences, employees are not appreciated or respected. Do your research before working here."
bad,"I don't think they no what that is some do and some don't.  They have to much misunderstand out there and also favoritism.  "
bad,Truly this is the worse company I have worked for!!! Greenlight Loans was a family oriented company and once Nationstar took over things have been going downhill ever since. Upper management says one thing and does another (For example: telling us that our pay wouldn't change than a month later cut our pay). Agents submit loans any kind of way and push them over to the processors than if the loan is cancelled it goes against the processors because your monthly goal is based off of what you start the month with. This company is just a mess and alot of people are just completely stressed.
bad,"Very unhappy about the way in which I was laid off .  Worked a portfolio and after putting in a lot of hard work, files were able to be taken by others who rave credit for the work you’ve put in."
bad,"when I worked here it was called Nationstar. Nationstar was managed very poorly, it treated its employees like kids where no bathroom breaks were aloud unless your manager was informed. they tried to make up for taking your breaks by buying pizza and cheap sandwiches during peak hrs. they outsource most of their jobs to India and let almost 1000 people off."
bad,"If you are one that is just content with getting a check; this is the place for you. My team lead trained my manager but never got promoted. I miss the relationships that I developed there, but I do not miss the headache that Mr. Cooper gave me on a regular basis"
bad,This place was my 1st mortgage job. Loved it to start but mgmt like always ruined that. When you have a mgr that is trying to get into bed with all the girls and had a prego gf at the time.. People that were hired to run the place was totally picked by their friends!! Not a clue how to run it... Other than into the ground!! Despise this place and as always the ones that needed to get fired never did.Shocker. Place sucks and was a nightmare
bad,Okay place to work but need better pay. Many co workers very unhappy. Too much favoritism. Some Managers loud and rude. Your information not secure. No keys for desks.
bad,"If you are a contractor you are excluded from certain ""MrCooper"" incentives like getting paid for leads. adherence bonuses and certain ""MrCooper"" celebrations.... Don't get sick on the job, get permission to leave to see what's wrong and before you can respond to your superiors on what happened ( all in the same day) you are let go.... I never worked for a unorthodox company in my life..... I have more but just know its certainly not a place where you are treated fairly........"
bad,"Management would decide last minute that all staff must work the weekend to meet the quota for production.  If an employee refused to work during the weekend, they were demoted."
bad,I worked at Nationstar for 9 months as a Manager and was laid off for no apparent reason. Nationstar has ruined my life. I will never work for Nationstar or any company that is supported by them.
bad,"Poor Job Work/Life Balance, Compensation/Benefits, Job Security/Advancement, Management and Job Culture... I had the best working family there, but management is very incompetent and struggles with favoritism and not merit based."
bad,"Nothing ever changed and management always lied about everything. Managers knew nothing about the system or what they were doing, which made for a hard day week year. I would never recommend anyone to work at NSM."
bad,"The class of people people were all Ghetto and always fighting with each other the work was sloppy and the management didi not care"
bad,management die not replance outgoing staf  fNeeded to work one Saturday monthly  Management was never on the same page w/ answers to customer questions
bad,"poor local management, senior management also out of touch with local teams. lack of problem resolution for branch offices when needed. made for extremely hostile work environment"
bad,"Nationstar mortgage was a very stressful job. The work environment tense all the time. The management at Nationstar wasn't very professional, the company received a few complaints on account transitions."
bad,The environment was very cutthroat and did not support growth. Always looking over your shoulder. Never felt secure in your standing. Management was not professional.
bad,"Based on my personal experience, I will not recommend anyone to work there. Management does not have fair treatment. This is a sweat shop and management wants you to get loans approved by all means."
bad,I waa excited at first to work here but found out they have Horrible communication in the chandler office. Don't waste your time with this company. Very unprofessional!
bad,"As a former employee do not work there, it is the worst company, there is not enough training, changes of schedule often and they let you know on friday to start on monday any new schedules, they do not care about your life and if schedule works for youor not, there are important changes in mortgage all the time and they call training a 3 hour computer training, managers are "" never there"" to help , if you ask questions the answer will be ""we talked about this in training"" or ""it is common sense"", this company sucks , look for work somewhere else."
bad,"Management was horrible. You had to be a favorite to advance within the company. The company moral was terrible. Also, there was no employee appreciation given to the employees"
bad,"Come work here if you are not looking for a work life balance and work major OT. You can make good money, but it comes at a price."
bad,mgr screws people on your team. has a kid on the way. drug charges from cali. poorly run unprofessional environment to be in or around. loved it when I got there but found out why the reviews were so bad. problems happen.. deal with it or find a new job is there approach .
bad,"Rate this company"
bad,"Awful senior management.  The type that schedule time on their calendar to shake hands and play PR, not talk S**t about everyone behind closed doors.  Senior management does not even buy into their own rebranding."
bad,"Worked there for 6 months with promise to get promoted by my manager and saw other people get it who didn't deserve it. Have been with NSM longer and do better job and still get passed over. Pick and choose who gets what work schedule. Schedule changes all the time with no notice. Managers are rude and do not help you, if you can even find one. AVP are at each others throats and even though they say they will do the right thing they do not. Treated like number. Company terminated the HR manager who was the only one that cared about you. Company and managers retaliate. Worst place ever to work."
bad,Expectation of working 60+ hours per week without paying overtime or other forms of compensation.  Limited insight into overall company IT strategy.
bad,Management does not care about employees with families.  You are expected to work 12+ hours a day plus your weekends.  Best part of working there was the free food 4 days a week.  Their managers are going to get them sued for hostile work environment.
bad,lack of knowledge. The management is horrible. No one take responsibility. No training was provided for employess. The pay isn't very lucrative
bad,Nationstar does not like to pay there employees what they are worth.. There is very little career advancement unless you know someone hire up
bad,"THey told me that i would get my taxes taken out but they didnt take them out and i had to pay the IRS. I wasnt too happy about that. I lilke a lot of variety in my jobs or careers. So, I enjoyed working there the people werre friendly in front of you but then they stabbed you in the back. A certain manager didnt like me so she did everything to sabotage my position and i was eventually laid off."
bad,Just not a very good company to work for Management does not know what to do and they are having you do things that you have no clue how to do.
bad,"Top notch training and support staff."
bad,"Very unorganized.  The ""Dirty Birds"" get promoted.  Not a great place to work at all...but if you need a job go there until you find something else."
bad,"Great place to work for, great benefits. great training program, great place for advancement. Management is great. Management opportunities"
bad,"Management is lacking, not positive. The Pay is okay, but the stress of the job is not worth staying there for a long period of time."
bad,"What can I say, the business practices did not adapt with the changing market and their management style reflected so."
bad,No room for growth/ No bonuses/ Hours changes every 2 months
bad,"This work place don't care for there employees, benefit are bad, managers don't know much, and not willing to help with escalations. They just sit around, and laugh all day.. The place is just not a good place to work."
bad,"Every month a new schedule comes out.  Not only are you having to work one 12-9 shift but depending on how well your ""TEAM""  does determines what schedule your team gets.  The best ranked team gets the best schedule.  So your schedule in a week could go 6-3, 5-2, 12-9, 10-7, and then 8-5.  This new schedule comes after a two month schedule of working straight mornings.  "
bad,There is no fairness. The only way you get promoted is if you know someone. The raises are an insult for the work expected of you and there is no morale within the department. The employees are not heard and all recognition and compensation goes to managment who does nothing!
bad,The co-workers are nice. There is a lot to do. Typical days are very busy and require a great deal of attention.
bad,"This company is the worse I have ever worked for moved from Lewisville to Irving. There is no structure, everyone does what they want. There is no training offered, half the employees lied to get hired which is why everything is so hectic. They have changed the bonus structure over five times. Your peers are promoted to manager with no managerial skills, they curse and use filthy language towards one another on the floor. The managers yell and scream at you, their HR is the worse I have ever experience. Payroll sucks, managers never give you a print out on what you're being paid for, which is why it's so much confusion when you finally get your check. They do not care about the customers at all everyone avoids ccommunication with them, even escalated issues with managers. They do what ever they cab to get loans closed even if info is wrong or forged. They do not pay the customers escrows. A lot of Managers, loan officers, processors, closers, and UW's, link up and pay one another to get loans closed faster. (Mainly loan officers doing the paying). Growth in the company is based off of who you know in the company. They are ruining out of money, loosing business, closing multiple centers."
bad,its literally the worst company I've ever worked for. the management had no clue how to operate the company.
bad,I enjoy working at Champion Mortgage because of the interaction with my co workers. We are an awesome team working for the same goal to provide exceptional customer service
bad,"A typical day at work was focusing on a pipeline of 30 to 60 loans, I learned the steps of processing working on Harp loans, FHA, FHA streamline and VA loans. I loved my management also the VP.  My co workers were great we all worked as a team to hitt our monthly goal.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to get a loan closed due to a borrower not provided the neccessary documentation that was needed.  I loved closing loan and making borrowers happy."
bad,Okay place to work. Its a Good ole boy type. If you pretty or attractive you can move in the company. but if you give hard work it will be overlooked.
bad,VERY easy job but will not value you at all. No raise whatsoever and the managers only give you any attention if you suck up to them
bad,"A lot of consistency in these reviews....sounds a lot like Bank of America.  Unorganized, poor pay, no advancement, rotten upper management.  Screw that!"
bad,"Zero work life balance, employees are treated like trash, Sr Mgt (Espcially HR) don't have a clue about reality. A total ""Yes Sir"" environment, all Male Sr HR Staff, Fake Mgt Friends, ""Special"" treatment for favorites, only motivation is to exit the building ASAP at the end of the day. Compensation is a joke unless you are in the ""C"" suite. Talk about excessive Executive pay. No Reward for performance. Would rather clean up road dung then work for NSM (especially in HR). BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Worst place ever to work. Management is horrible. Its like a constant experiment where they try new things every other week and do not seem to have a clue what they are doing.
bad,Threatening and intimidating. My manager helped me but SVP is an egomanic. Stay clear.
bad,Not great place to work for people of color . It a company that I would have never worked for if I had to pick an mortgage service company there at the bottom of the list. Lack of management skills and workplace culture is at a all time low
bad,"The management was TERRIBLE and unprofessional!!! I can go on and on about my bad experience. I'm so grateful that I got away from that company... I'm now happy, traveling the world and get paid GOOD!!!"
bad,"Micromanagement style call center environment. Low loan amounts equate to below average pay, and their pricing is really high. A large portion of my leads required a PE to clear QM fails. This means spending time requesting Pricing Exceptions to see if you can pitch a deal, or vice versa, pitching a deal you don't yet know you can offer"
bad,It was the worst ever company that I've ever worked for.  One example is that I attempted to report internal fraud and it was dismissed.  The company computer system was often broken and antiquated.  Customers were at the closing table and their were no funds available for days.
bad,The company focuses more on not getting sued and customer than their employees. They say they care about advancing careers but play favoritism to the selected.
bad,"Changes consistently and no one knew what was going on. Very poor management and operation. No one held to any standards and its based on who you know. If you were in good with upper management which is very rare, you didn't have anything to worry about. Mangers could not assist you because upper management does not allow them to make decisions. No point of having managers if they cannot manage."
bad,"Xome and Nationstar scream that there is equal opportunity ""family friendly company"". There isn't equal opportunity and they don't care about your family or you. All is run in a very good old boys rumor filled fashion. I had loyalty to this company for a while but was quickly reminded that men are the only ones that will succeed and the pretty barbie females that they deem fit to humanize them. "
bad,"Horrible place to work at, management is nonproductive all day on their phone playing games, and whenever you ask for help they do not offer to help you they just say ""we talked about this in training"" which by the way is on the phone and nothing is learned. Managers says "" we are here to help "" but they are not. It is a pitiful excuse of a company. Stressful to the extreme because again if you need help they are either not at their desk, or they do not want to help or straight up don't know anything. Horrible stressful environment."
bad,They require their underwriters to work under pressure requiring too many file to work on at a time. They expect perfection while forcing underwriters to work under ridiculous time frames.
bad,Typical day is get there 15 minutes early and first one there. open all of my systems up and clock in and go available. I deal with people who are 60 days plus behind on their house payments. The place is so unorganized and have no idea what's going on. The left hand can't talk to the right hand. They tell you from day one to get ready for change but won't change processes that are useless and waste time when the company could actually help and to at least pay better then they do. They need to take care of their employees so in turn their employees will take care of the customer. They haven't learned nor will they ever.
bad,"There is a lot of micro managing, last minute work schedule changes or they will give you your work schedule the week of. They are very unprofessional, zero work/life balance and do not respect any of your obligations outside from work like family, children, a second job or if you are in school."
bad,This company was not a good company to work for. Our loan officers worked 75 to 110 hours per week with management cracking the whip on us everyday. We were not allowed to clock in for more than 40 hours per week. Nationstar Mortgage will soon be only a servicing company and will no longer originate new loans.
bad,"Management needs huge improvements as far as how employees are managed.  They are still operating as if they were still a small company which has changed drastically in years.  They are in no way competitive with the rest of the market in terms of salary.  Typically, they target desperate graduates who just need some sort of job hence the ridiculously high turnover rates.  In my one year, about 40 people have quit in a 75 person department.  Overall, the workers themselves make the environment tolerable.  I may be speaking for my department only."
bad,"Great for people who like to be suckups. Horrible systems. Horrible management. Disregard for illnesses,they expect you to take calls wheb your sick and cant talk. Would not recommend this to my worst enemy."
bad,"Management would daily remind employees that they were just a number and that if you had a negative opinion about how they treated you they would write you up. The environment was overall toxic and managers would yell at employees or address employee issues on the floor. I would not recommend this company as they just don't care about their employees or developing a culture conducive to a productive, satisfying, and supportive work environment."
bad,"Overall not a great place to work. Management is a joke, we a constant problem with bed bugs in the building. NaSTY.... HR tries to hide this problem."
bad,The company gives off the persona that they value their employees but it's fair from that.  The lack of training and having employees that are knowledgeable in the role that the have definitely shows.
bad,"Just be careful, to each their own, more of a younger generation environment, people talking, back stabbing and lying. Management is untrustworthy and not an organized company. Most work is done overseas, no stability"
bad,Mr. Cooper was a great place to work for until. I got laid off it was very unprofessional. But overall fellow employees are great to work with had fun
bad,"Managers all hire their friends and family as opposed to promoting from within. You will make a decent wage but when it gets busy management expects you to live there."
bad,"I would not recommend Mr. Cooper to anyone as a company. I invested a lot of handwork, time and pride in my work with this company and there was no appreciation shown and no acknowledgement. Management was run very poorly and very cut-throat. I saw many terrible actions taken against people and a lot of morally wrong and disrespectful pathways set for employees to fail from the start. I wish the company all of the best however hopefully with change to better benefit the employees that work so hard for them daily."
bad,"Mr. Cooper, is a great organization to work for to gain experience in different sectors of the company, but very limited in career opportunities and pay. Overall, Mr. Cooper was a mediocre when compared to other organizations with their pay and benefits. I would also say the most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible scheduling, we were able to leave early on Fridays and that excited me about having extra time off away from work."
bad,"They hire ghetto people to work there; and, those people only care about recreating the high school experience. They barely work, they only work the bare minimum and if you outshine them, they turn against the hard working people so their lazy way of life and making friends is not interrupted. The managers like having those people flatter them and take a blind eye to what is realy going on, becuase they are also stuck in high school popularity than working for this company."
bad,"This place is bleeding out. If you're here, jump ship. If you're thinking about coming here.. DON'T. It's quite honestly, the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"Poor Management, Bad IT infrastructure,  Very low employee morale,   my boss was promoted to AVP,  after I left and then laid off.  All but 2 team members out of 20, left within 6 months of me leaving. I can't believe I actually lasted 6 months before they let me go.  I wouldn't recommend working here ever! "
bad,"In all honesty the company is not horrible however private label is a complete joke. By far the most unprofessional environment I have experienced in a very long time. After reading most reviews unfortunately the work culture and environment is exactly that. Managers are unprofessional and job security is almost nonexistent depending on who your manager is. They plot against you with a smile. They don't invest in employee development. Training has recently improved however due to the job description often changing its almost irrelevant. You will find yourself learning as you go. Communication between employees is incredibly poor. But I will say.... I think they try. Perhaps the private label should really consider focusing on management and who they are selecting to lead this department and development this ""culture"" they speak of during training and the interview process. "
bad,"Compensation/Benefits are good, learned not to trust, hardest part of job was............????............most enjoyable...buffalo management team & co-workers!"
bad,"Management is horrible here, no knowledge and  all about politics and spread sheets, they ask the same questions about the same loan 3-4 times a day instead of reading notes or emails. They are useless in escalations. Loan officers and processors and underwriters are not on the same page with the goal to close and fund loans. Loan officers promise borrowers to sell loans and borrowers easily become irrate and upset when a loan is not able close because what was initially promised isn't what is final disclosed. Underwriters constantly add conditions at final and reject off nationstar overlays. Turn overs are plenty. Training is great until u start working on the floor and nothing you learn is applied to the job.  The struggle is real."
bad,I really don't have much to say about this company... they are ok it just depends on what you are looking for... read other comments their opinion might be a little more in-depth
bad,"I wish I've never accepted their job offer. Management only look out for their own bottom line and job security, lack of integrity to everyone else. I can't wait to get out..."
bad,"This Company is NOT Job/Work Life/Balance Friendly, if management is having a bad day, so will you. System is constantly down."
bad,"Working for a large company where CEO's and President's and such have no idea what is going on in the company. They could never work a day in Customer Service persons shoes or anywhere else in the company for that matter They are only worried about the profit margin, the next dollar, and next years bonuses"
bad,"Typical 8 hour day.  Learned office politics and unfair business practices.  Company provided embellishments only.  Management are not eductated and or savy enough to run a nursey school, let alone an office.   Hardest part of job was overlooking the inexperience, lack of education, cut throat mentality,in running the day to day operation. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the laughs we encountered watching the so called management run the new zoo revue."
bad,I complained about lack of compliance for processing foreclosure/bankruptcy timelines. They are not honest. Only cared about how fast they could push accounts thru the pipeline. I was expected to cover for other team workers who refused to work or were just lazy. The lazy co-worker got all the credit and I got let go because I complained. The management there is bad. Everyone there is just a warm body to do the work. I had measly raises for the workload required. I ended up working 2 jobs because my co-worker was too lazy and too dumb to do the job they originally took from me.
bad,This was a great start off in the industry type job. Quickly promoted thru the company but the higher you get the more problems there are with the departments and management. Workers are great. Compensations not up to par. You do have to work in most areas 2 late nites a week up to 8 or 9pm and Month end is the worst during the end of the year b/c you have to work on those days if the end of the month is sunday or new years you have to work. Upper management is inclinded to believe lies that are told by managers over the workers. I was personally targeted and when it got to upper management the manager at the time lied to upper management and they believed the manager. The proof i had accumulated in archives that the manager was untruthful mysteriously disappeared one nite(via the manager removing it from my system so they wouldnt be found out)...Steer clear if your looking for a career job...Starting out its do able.
bad,Mr Cooper does seem to want to do the right thing and makes an effort to try to improve the culture within the company.  It is unfortunate that this division is being closed and that over 300 people will lose their jobs come March 2020.
bad,"Work pace out numbers reps taking calls.  Lunch breaks were often reduce without 24 hour notice to accommodate high call volume.  Fun stuff in the break room like a foosball table, unfortunately with breaks strictly monitored and your adherence to a ever chaining schedule paramount to your bonus, there is not time to enjoy the little perks.  No one smiles at this place!"
bad,"Mr Cooper is fast pace environment and is driven by numbers. There's always a lot of changes, some good and some bad. There are always new procedures taken place everyday so they send out a PNP with all the changes."
bad,high stress high production environment. it is all about production. you are just a worker there. i did not feel safe or any loyalty. however they pay very well if you produce.
bad,"Typical call center, average of 70 calls a day. The calls are overwhelming, management is not helpful. Policies and procedures are elementary there is no backing no guidelines and the customers think the reps are a joke in reality they are. The hardest part of the job is doing a job you are not properly trained on in a moments notice. Lunch schedules change in a moments notice. Management is the worse I've ever experienced. they do not care about the customers as they claim the bottom line is sales push products and services down customer's throat"
bad,Work environment was always stressful. Worked there twice in my career and will not return as a loan originator. Company tries to make it more bearable  but stress is ever present.
bad,"Company management not engaged with business aspect. Little to no support to a new employee. Details, process and procedures not in place and not explained."
bad,management in in chandler think they are running shop like a mom-pop store rules are they go things change my the hour management has selective memory
bad,"This was a exciting environment, the people enjoyed working together and also willing to help each other. The downside of the company call center, depressing phone calls of people loosing their homes and at times unable to help."
bad,"I do not recommend working here. Procurement leadership is lacking, no procurement platform in place and turn over is extremely high. I do not recommend this company or procurement dept."
bad,I worked for this company for 6 months. I have no other comments  or reviews about this company.
bad,I enjoyed talking with homeowners regarding loan mod reviews/process.  Learned bankruptcy laws. hardest part of the job was keeping up with the people who manipulated the system to score high on the ranking report and not get written up for it or terminated.  most enjoyable were team members who actually took the time to explain new process or procedures.
bad,"I was taught that if you don't have anything nice to say, then your comments should be kept to yourself....Sorry'"
bad,"St. Louis site displayed very poor management skills, the work place was extremely hostile.  Management displayed race discrimination & favoritism. They targeted many African Americans by setting unrealistic monthly goals which led to termination.....many people were wrongfully terminated by the VP of Direct Operations and AVP of Direct Operations.  Employees were set up to fail in their production.  HR was made aware of these issues excessively and did nothing to correct or address the employees concerns.  These events ultimately led the site to lay off over 113 employees under Direct Operations as of February 11, 2014."
bad,"A typical work day was very stressful... we told to lie to customers when we were unsure of their questions. I did learn a lot about the mortgage industry and about debt collection practices."
bad,This job was very unorganized and if you needed help you had to walk around to find help sometimes from strangers.
bad,Management is horrible. You get more credit playing ping pong and decorating the birthday board than the work you accomplish.  Different rules apply for different people within same department.
bad,"Management is trash. My last manager lacked the capacity to lead a mule which was completely acceptable by the AVP as well as the SVP. "
bad,Over worked. Will have you to work on the weekends at the last minute. And don’t want to pay you over time. Managers are not experience. And not helpful at all. Will lay you off for no reason at all.
bad,I would not recommend working for Mr. Cooper if you want to advance your career. In my time with Mr. Cooper there has been at least 2 layoffs per year.
bad,"The stress one can handle is directly correlated to the amount of income one may earn. You will earn a lot of money at Mr. Cooper, however, you will loose any work/life balance you may already have. You are expendable at Mr. Cooper; Top Producer or among the average any one is on the chopping block."
bad,If you don't want a life or to ever see your family then this is the job for you. I wouldn't recommend that my worst enemy worked here. Yes! It's that bad
bad,I thought coming into this company would be better than what it was. They did not appreciate the employees and all their hard work. The environment was stressful. Would make you not want to go to work the next day.
bad,"they hired me without experience an promised to train me then laid me off along with 100 other processor 8 months later, hate that I quit a great job for this sorry company"
bad,"Job guidelines are constantly changing. Management is inexperienced to handle their job and deal with daily issues. Work systems are constantly down. employees are over stressed. the work environment is very negative.,"
bad,I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone the management is unfair in promoting they require too much of you and dont want to compensate you for it. they really dont promote older people in the company only young ones
bad,"The St. Louis site was literally thrown together with inexperience managers.  Upper management at site was racist and biased.  Operations department was shut down after one and a half of running. I would not recommend this company to anyone.  You may have better look with the corporate office located in Dallas/Irving TX.  However, HR is very selective with the issues the address and are biased as well."
bad,Poor management- Horribly ran EPMO department. Lack of knowledge and experience. Poor cultural environment to work in. Lack of tools and knowledge transfer. Incompetent co-workers. A very un-cohesive  environment to work in. Very unprofessional management.
bad,NationStar Mortgage wasn't up front with their customers.
bad,Stay away from this place! They will hire you as a dedicated loan representative and pay you 15.38 an hour. The Foreclosure prevention specialist make 40k and up. The chandler office doesn't know what there doing.
bad,"My typical day at work is ensuring the team is able to maintain their workload and working quickly to resolve any challenges. In this position I've learned how to foster a friendly work environment, balance the workload reports and make solid decisions when issues arise."
bad,"No job security or loyalty.   You need to be friends with management to stay.  Great benefits and 401k is the best thing going there.  The building is a dump.  The people are clicky.  Some of management is too young with no people skills or a heart.      Absolutely no loyalty,  no motivation to go the extra mile because it will never be noticed."
bad,"I liked most of the people there.  Everyone was pretty nice.  I see 2 main issues - "
bad,"Management doesn't have a clue.  Too many layers of management, who don't understand the marketplace.  Most have never worked in real estate and don't understand the market from the consumer perspective.  Employees are not placed in positions based on their past experience and no thought is given to leveraging strengths of employees.  Could be a successful company  if new/better management team was brought in.  Not a horrible place to work, but it's doubtful this company will be around for the long term."
bad,Everybody in management needs training favoritism no room for advancement unless your a favorite vp avp are not for employees only about business violates employees privacy
bad,"Mr. Cooper is very unethical per their practices with their employees as well as their customers. They would demean their own conduct of communications when their customers are under distress, would layout promises for disaster customers they would not keep and place their employees in a disastrous position with no support."
bad,"Yes a typical workday. Learned nothing trained myself. Poor Management. Work Place Culture ok. Hardest Part of the job, Irate Loan Officers. Job was easy."
bad,"The only part of the job that is rewarding is getting buyers in their home.  The company has poor ratings on yelp and JD Power because they overwork, underpay their employees. The employees cannot provide the service level that the customers deserve."
bad,Nationstar Mortgage is not the best place to work. I did not enjoy my time while working at the company. The politics there are insane.
bad,I would not reccomend no one to work for Mr Cooper. The Management was not friendly nor helpful.  The company is ran very unprofessionally from the beginning of training to the call center floor. The bonus scale in customer service needs to be better especially when employees are doing their job and meeting all goals. The starting pay needs to be much higher considering the amount of work..
bad,"If you work at the satellite sites you have no value. Corporate will terminate great people based on rumors to avoid dealing with any potential negative surveys. Lunches are shortened for employees consistently, and performance raises are lowered when the standard changes prior to the evaluation. "
bad,"I worked with a great number of wonderful people. However the company is changing from being a people company to a professional atmosphere. The result has been questionable firings, and a complete loss of character. If you are not at the corporate office you have no value. They will fire an employee at a remote site without hesitation while employees at the corporate office are protected regardless of skill or effort."
bad,Treated employees horrible. Very micro managed. Did not care about the employees.  Did not listen to the employees suggestions. Would never work there again.
bad,"Rates and fees are much higher than competitors. Processing is hit or miss, and when I say miss I mean completely miss. Rates are getting higher. Management is very helpful in the beginning then they change. Phones don't ring consistently. Leads are bad. The health insurance is ridiculously high."
bad,"Absolute worst working experience of my life."
bad,"Culture"
bad,"Management promises things that never happen, are unrealistically positive, consistently and constantly regurgitate information regarding policies and procedures from higher-ups that changes almost daily. Dull work environment. You are trapped in a sea of cubicles. The customers hate you for the most part."
bad,"What a poorly run company, problem was not the fault of the managers in STL but what direction came out of Texas."
bad,Every day I worked there it felt like my manager was always out to get me; waiting for me to slip up and call me out. This job is beyond stressful no matter who's team you end up on. Many people will get away with doing nothing as favorites and its sh***y. Also you will hardly see your family.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is the more you do, the more you will get punished. You will work over 50 hours just to meet the production, and even then, you will not get compensated enough and will cheat you because if you meet or exceed production for the month, they will increase the goal next month. If you are a lazy person, this is the job for you because the bonus structure works in favor of the laziest of people."
bad,Most of the managers I worked with were very unprofessional and lacked the knowledge needed to do their jobs adequately.  Promotions are given based only on who you know instead of what you know.
bad,"Management shows favorites and lets others know it in how they treat non-favored employees. Favored employees get away with no shows, being extremely rude to customers, real estate agents, and attorneys, with no consequences. Management is also very heavy handed in the micromanaging their employees and does not encourage self-sufficient workers or encourage problem solving. Employees are very unhappy and the environment is very negative with no recognition of good work. Terrible place!"
bad,"Typical sweat shop financial instituition, managers are young and inexpereinced, one of the most greedy companies ever. Stay away, I never saw so much turnover, half the people i started with are gone after 5 months."
bad,"I personally think this would be a good workplace, however they are based more on entrapping customers, and force employees to harass customers by calling 4 and 5 times a day.  The company offers incentives, but will raise the stakes so that the employees don’t qualify. They have tons of hidden secrets, and if they don’t like you, they will terminate you for no reason at all.  No place to build a career."
bad,"•Configure and test virtual desktop environments"
bad,"I worked at Nationstar Mortgage for 4 years. It is very hard to post out of your current department. Based on needs, favortism, and if the manager likes you. My reasoning for leaving was Professional Jealousy."
bad,"Working for the Nationstar is a very stressful place, and be prepared to work 60 to 70 hours a week to keep up with the requirements that are placed on you."
bad,A typical day at work would be answering and taking calls on mortgages that were either in foreclosure status or worked out some type of repayment plans to get loan currt. I learned that some people can't help the issues that come up in everyday life that may lead them to fall behind or get delinquent. I am a people person and get along with all my peers and the hardest part of the job is to have to turn down people that aren't eligible for help. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist those are able to be assisted.
bad,"Customer service answering customers questions about their mortgages, escrow, taxes and insurance, take payments. Answering questions about ARM loans and how they work. Working with a great bunch of team mates and managers."
bad,"Extremely high turnover rates. Quick to Hire and Quick to fire. The interview process is a bit rushed and thrown together.  You interview in a room with roughly 25-30 other possible candidates.  Very inpersonable. There is no structured training which is very important because you are held accountable for your mistakes even though you are not properly trained.My training literally consisted of reading a manual for one week that contained instructions on their old process. I then was ordered to shadow with an employee who was unsure of the process and then I was thrown to the wolves.  My manager was inexperienced in the knowledge of their systems and processes.  She repeatedly re-invented the flow of my team duties without full knowledge and understanding.  Management at Nationstar were extremely unprofessional,  dressed to casual and lacked knowledge.  The VP encouraged feedback but your immediate supervisor would condemn  you from asking questions.  The building at the Irving  office was extremely unsanitary and dirty."
bad,As a contractor the company was great. Management was good working hours were great.  Culture was good.
bad,if u need a steady paycheck its fine but dont waste your life here there is no growth or opportunity for advancement . you will be kept at a certain level. Mr. Cooper does not properly prepare or train its employees and will often shove or throw you into positions that you are not prepared for or warned about. Management is a joke and is a popularity contest. Nothing is organized and things often slip the the cracks
bad,Poorly ran. Senior leadership does not follow the values of the company but wants to write you up when they feel you don t follow the values. Will make you work on some company “observed” holidays. Texas sites are treated as the golden children as the Arizona site is treated poorly and unfairly and does not receive the same benefits. Company is more worried about becoming a one stop shops than training their employees properly.
bad,"too many demands to do more work when not enough staff to do the assignments already in the system"
bad,"Management does not consider the people who works hard, who is here all time, who come in the weekends. They prefer people who like to get into the manager  to get a position."
bad,"Management can just about say anything they want to you and retaliate against you and nothing is done.  You have to move to another department, then you are a marked person."
bad,"cut throat to the T. incredibly unforgiving place to work if you are in the foreclosure area."
bad,Horrible environment with a call center smile and dial type of atmosphere. Managers micromanage your every move and will make you stay super late to accomplish their goals
bad,The people are nice to work for but the work load is very stressful. The company wants to keep growing but do not have enough employees to cover the growth in the work load. No room to grow in the company.
bad,"At Nationstar, there was a sales versus processing/underwriting relationship creating a lot of friction and frustration between both groups. Internal back-office was sloppy and poorly managed causing a lot of good business partners to stop delivering repeat business."
bad,Below average benefits and pay is to be expected.  Management is clearly disengaged with employees.  Focus is on Senior Management bonuses.
bad,Extremely overworked and underpaid. Very stressfull environment
bad,"This is a. Horrible place to work If You are not a BROWN NOSER!!! MANAGEMENT IS CONFUSED AS HELL... No direction,growing an failing at the same time......No clue, most of foreclose management is clueless!"
bad,They do not pay very well and most of the company's culture has grown out of the call center mentality. Opportunities for advancement greatly depend on which department you are in. They promise easy transfers between departments but that isn't the reality.
bad,Demanding job with little or no work life balance Often have to work 60+ hours a week including Sunday . Team leaders often putting you on verbal/ written for not exceeding your monthly goal.
bad,Mr. Cooper pays well and has decent benefits but the loan officers are very rude and overly demanding. The leadership at the time worked very well with each other but also required you to work large amounts of overtime which did not leave you with a good balance for work and life.
bad,"LOOK ELSEWHERE! This place is not a good place for career advancement. Job security is always a large concern here. Layoffs every other month, and they layoff by the hundreds! Senior management is skilled in scare tactics. We were encouraged by direct supervision not to engage with senior management."
bad,"The place is a great starter job to acquire experience for the rest of your career' but don,t stay here long. Benefits are not the best, but ate passable with many incentive credits."
bad,"This job was awesome at one point, Most of the floor managers are still pretty great. When management changed they hired a bunch of lazy managers that refused to take supervisor calls. People were lying on the phone and never getting punished, so if you had to set everything straight you got a mouth full. Management treated everyone terrible. People could be heard talking loudly about how terrible everything was becoming while AVPs had their door open."
bad,"Call center environment, higher management rarely speak to lower level employees, required to be on the phone entire time you are on the clock, managers monitor every minute"
bad,high level of pressure to reach production goals - constantly changing production goals set -  usually nothing was ever put into in writing and changes came by word of mouth
bad,"Strict, not open to change, does not help with promotion but says they encourage you to apply to other departments. VPs and higher ups treat you like a number to their JD power scores. They do not listen to the Voice of their employees. Shift hours are not flexible."
bad,"End of year reviews mean nothing...the key is being friends with upper management, if you can do that you are golden...company keeps saying they want to be a people company, but random layoffs and a continuing culture of no one taking responsibility for their actions is making it an uphill battle."
bad,Give it a poor rating for this reason.  Direct Management very good but VP's and Up questionable.  Didn't feel like upper Management gave you the support you needed.  Workplace turnover was high.
bad,N/A  There is nothing more I wish to share about this company.  The management was not good.  The morale was not good.  It was the worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,"I started as a temp customer service employee and received sufficient training to perform my job. However, you are looked down upon by the female trainer and/ or supervisor if you know more about mortgage than they expect you to. I called off one day for something that I could not help, my son had to go to the E.R and I brought in the paperwork the next day. Although they told me that it wasn't a problem, they let me go a week later. And I had never been late or called off prior to this. Since I had been there, I watched them treat temp employees like numbers instead of people."
bad,"Company is all numbers driven with no personal touch towards its customer or employees. "
bad,"Nationstar is reaching out to the community in different ways.  Habitat for Humanity, toy drives, and food drives are just a few ways that Nationstar gives back."
bad,I did not like Nationstar as a company or the culture of the company. This company makes a lot of promises that they seldom keep. Nationstar is an okay place to get the foundation needed for recent or fresh college grads; reason being because it helps you reflect on a lot of things good or bad about your employer and their values.
bad,Company is going through rough patches at this point and its hard to tell where the chips will fall.
bad,Morale is at an all time low. No one takes accountability nor responsibility for their work. Upper Management always gives you the run around.
bad,High Volume of calls from people who were in default of their reverse mortgages. High turnover of temps. Low hourly wages with no benefits. Impersonal criticism of work by managers to call center employees received via email.
bad,"Due to their high turnover, my manager changed shortly after  I arrived and issues ensued. Training was horrible absent or flawed. If you have to except a job there, keep resume and job leads current.   Also, it appears they do an annual purge each fall."
bad,The company talks a GOOD game but they're LIARS and the information they conveyed prior to taking over our company was ALL LIES.The ENTIRE culture is FRAUDULENT.
bad,Instead of hiring more people they shove whole positions on to people with no money compensation. So they become over work till they cant handle it. When they had enough they take some of their workload and do it all over again. Seen it happen all the time and it happens every where within the company.
bad,"This company destroys work life balance, in that there's an ever present creep into your personal life.  It starts with using your phone for logging in.  If you use your phone for work they can search it at any time, but you have to use your phone for work. Then you can just install the company chat apps right onto your phone so you can stay connected in meetings.  Then the notices will pop up on your phone at home.  Then you're working from home.  Getting paid for working at home?  Nope."
bad,"Work culture was upbeat, great opportunity to learn and grow. Management was good, typical workflow kept employees busy. Most enjoyable parts were learning and co-workers"
bad,Very favorited management. They are very contradictory. They state one thing but do not allow everyone to abide by that. Very unorganized. Would not recommend
bad,Unhelpful unit managers.  My manager made a mistake and I wasn't paid for 3 weeks.  Payroll refused to correct the issue by submitting an off schedule check to me.
bad,"The company is good if you are looking to stick to one job for a long time. Most people stick around because of the good benefits but it's not amazing. Some parts of the office are worn down, dingy, and sad to look at."
bad,"Poor management with too many Chiefs and not enough Indians."
bad,I was laid off. A VP with 19 years at the company and they discarded me like a criminal. I worked until about 11:00 the night before and got told the following morning. They claim to be a people company but I didn't get offered a new position (even as a veteran of the Armed Forces). I only got one week of pay per year I worked there as severance. They claim to offer competitive benefits but I didn't learn until after the fact that my wife's company has much better insurance for a lot less. They are not the people company they claim to be.
bad,Nationstar Mortgage became Mr. Cooper.  They outsourced to Manila and upper management was not very helpful.  The building was half empty because of such a high turn over rate.
bad,The company started off as ideal but is now a stressful environment due to change in management. I feel as though where the company is now there's no progression.
bad,Job security can't be counted.  You feel like you can be laid off anytime.  Not much else to mention about the company.  People you work with are very helpful and kind.  But that's just about the only positive thing about this place.
bad,"Company values growth, but not work.  Associates are not properly trained to work on files, systems are antiquated and do not include all of the information for teams to be able to communicate with their customers.  Quite a few CFPB Violations in terms of how they review customers for loan modifications.  Representatives that do not call their associates back are rewarded.  Escalations to assist customers are almost always ignored by management in other offices.  Closed our office due to ""costs""  but obviously the company did not realize that we were most likely ensuring that they would not have to pay cfpb fines in the future for how error filled their loan servicing is."
bad,Great place to work if you are a top performer. If you are middle of the pack or below then you get treated like a second class citizen. The layoffs came every month beginning in December 2016 and has continued each month since. Unstable atmosphere. But they feed you frequently!
bad,"What started out as a great opportunity quickly spiraled into a nightmare.  When I was first hired on, I was told only some weekends may be required, on some holidays may need to be worked on, but I was also sold that this job would offer me so much flexibility and it most definitely did not do that in the long run."
bad,"I'm sorry but my experience with this company was not the best.  Management changed so many times it effected my opportunity for promotions and growth."
bad,"At this company if your not a butt kisser, or part of the buddy group they treat you any kind of way. The money is good but they make it where they friends got the easy accounts. Just not a great place to work."
bad,"You are taking calls all day without any time to prepare yourself in the morning. You are allowed two 15 minute breaks and if a call you're on goes through your break time, you're not allowed to break due to messing up your adherence. Nationstar hired temporary employees who were informed that we would go permanent only to let us go due to ""budget"" issues. I would not recommend working here as the turnover is very high and training for the position is not long enough or consistent. Stay away. Find a place that actually values their employees."
bad,"This does not apply to me as I'm a contractor and not a permanent employee.  I don't get insurance, benefits, vacation, medical, dental, or vision."
bad,"Same routine, although the job is easy the system we use are very generic and manual.. I can't contribute any learning from the job however I feel like with my experience I've contribute to the job since I was one of the first 4 to start, so I was able to add with experience and learning from other jobs in the past., Co-workers make it fun and we work together well to get the job done, Managers and AVP's are very immature and as far as managing I have yet to witness such job functions from managers, The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication and trust.. The most enjoyable part of the is the that everyone on the team co-workers pull their weight."
bad,"You would come in and be on the phones for 1.5 - 2.00 hrs. before a break, then you get a 15 minute break. You would then be on the phone for another 2.00 -2.5 hrs. before lunch which was an hour. The afternoon was the same as the morning. "
bad,Poor management structure; politics; very minimal work life balance. The culture is very laid back throughout the firm; jeans everyday
bad,There was not much coaching for development and advancement. They would sometimes only give you 24 hour notice of a schedule change.
bad,The work is overwhelming for each person.  Expected amount of work too meet deadlines are impossible.  A lot of work done at home online also.
bad,"Was hired in advised company was growing, but not even a year later being advised they where closing our office.  Not very professional."
bad,"You are often required to do the work load of other departments without the training needed to do so. Even though your own work load suffers management expects you to continue to do your work load even though there is not sufficient time. Concerns expressed about these situations are not taken serious and managers aren’t concerned about the why you have fallen behind in your work load only that you have. Poor management is something you will also find there, but not all are bad. Overall the company will leave you feeling over worked and under appreciated and frustrated by management."
bad,I worked for Mr. Cooper for 4+ years. It was either quit or get terminated over something that could have easily been a coaching. The HR lady makes her own rules up. The best part of the job was the people you worked with and some of the managers.
bad,"I’ve never seen a HR department so power hungry and lazy. They outsource everything and then never get anyone hired."
bad,"currently the working environment is not fair, lack of work. I wish not to go into details at the current time due to being a current employee. will update once i have found another job"
bad,It all start good cmod department needs more organizations and management needs training vp and avp are not for the employees only about business never meet CEO
bad,You're just a number here and thats all they care about is the numbers.  Company has been sold and business has slowed down alot.  High fallout of loans in the pipeline.
bad,Long hours and outrageous goals. When layoff season comes around management setup who they no longer want on their team to either coach them out or layoff them off. Its more so who you know or kiss up to rather than your performance. The current management team are liars and have no moral standards. They pay well and if you can get past the BS just might be the place for you.
bad,Management and HR did not know anything. Very poor company to work for. Customer service department is treated the worse. If you worked in corporate America prior to Mr. cooper you will not like it.
bad,"This was not an enjoyable experience. Big promises of what the job and company culture will be like, yet management never practiced what they preached."
bad,Poor management structure.  Call center environment and mentality.  Manager no willing to accept responsibility and correct issues with employees regarding payroll and HR issues.
bad,"The group I worked for was all H1B. If you were not from their country, or if you tried to change anything  (even with encouragement from management) you are going to meet a lot of resistance."
bad,"Champion mortgage was taken over by Key Bank in Ohio. Key Bank laid off all the champion mortgage staff and replaced with outsourced staff in Cleveland, Ohio."
bad,The team I worked with made the work interesting and fun. The managers were great to work. The work focused transitioning from waterfall to agile scrum.
bad,Company lacks growth unless you are friends. Promotions are not provided based on work. Teams don't promote team work very individual and competitive atmosphere.
bad,Disconnect between upper management and loan officers. Typically days are 10+ hours due to above average work related responsibilities. Compensation leaves a lot to be desired.
bad,"No character, bad management, managers promoted past what they are capable of, don't care about people or relationships. Ship a lot of jobs overseas, underpay for jobs they do keep in America. Bad environment to spend a lot of time in."
bad,"This company does not support employee ideas and does not provide any job security, advancement, or growth. If an employee does not work for the corporate location in Texas, he or she is not valued."
bad,"HR had their favorites, managers had their favorites. No one was held accountable for their poor performance. Then when branch closed only those buddies were chosen/helped with securing employment with the company or within field."
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians! The hardest part was the old files that we had in our pipeline. When they changed owners or higher ups it went to heck in a hand basket. I heard that they have changed and are much better.
bad,This place is unorganized. No room for advancement. Just a crazy work environment. I would not recommend this job to my friends.
bad,"I generally enjoy the people and activities outside of my department. The work is mundane and so easy, a high-schooler could do it. The pay is dependent on your closeness with the boss instead of your actual work ethic."
bad,Too many times I had to take work home to confirm or fix data that was done  by poor performers on my team. I also had to come in at 7.00 for implementations and the other people on the team who were supposed to be there also showed up much later with no negative consequences.
bad,"answered phone calls, and made outbound calls to collect debt, training was great, but terrible pay."
bad,"My co-workers make this job bearable, I work with wonderful people. However; Management is horrendous, and HR is a joke, I had one AVP call a co-work a “dumb uneducated b***h” in front of the whole team and HR really did nothing when we reported it. He’s still an AVP in that department. It is a steady paycheck if that’s all you are looking for, hold out for better if you can."
bad,"Inexperienced management to keep up with the rapid growth.  Company is laying off in less than 2 years of hiring over 5,000 employees"
bad,This company is very unstable in my eyes is why they are shutting our office in Jan 2014.They open to many offices with in a year time. There is not many opportunity for advancement  but they make a lot of latter moves. The management is not the best when it comes to escalated issues being resolved. I have learn that your are never fully compensated when meeting goals. They only give you a percentage of your actually bonus earned.
bad,"I would say that the company culture varies by department, but even that is a lie. Certain employees are allowed to wear jeans daily, while the next row over may have to wear something more ""corporate."" Company laid off a huge department, and promised there would be ""so many"" positions open that they could keep the majority of us, but there were not."
bad,"If you want just a job with a little bit of play money, then this is for you"
bad,"Unless you are really enthusiastic about the mortgage industry its just another job that barely pays enough to cover the cost of living, unless maybe you are a supervisor or above.  There are career advancement opportunities but you have to know somebody and not everyone is very friendly or outgoing in the first place. Overall its pretty easy and not that stressful as long as you're not struggling with your daily duties."
bad,My role at Mr.Cooper was customer service. It was day in and day madness the actual work environment was not bad but the expectations for a rep in outrageous. None of the customers that I spoke to thought highly of the company. All you hear all day is complaining or sadness about paying a mortgage taxes and insurance. It made feel bad for people  and even uneasy about trying to purchase    of you own home.your own
bad,It's a great place to learn though management is more into favorites rather than looking at a application for management.  Will also state upcoming raises but will wait for more than a year to give out
bad,I would still be there now had they not changed their mind on my working remote. I was told they don't allow remote workers.However there are many Mr. Cooper employees that do.
bad,"No too much races, yourbonus are taken from you easily, with any excuse and you can work hardand they always take them andsaid you always are doing thing incorrect even if you were thenumber one seller, its amazing!"
bad,Work days go by fast due to workload.  Work culture is not secure due to constant layoffs.  At least 4 to 5 times per year.  Many positions are project based with lots of contract workers
bad,"The work culture is less than desirable.  Management is cut throat, training is really a joke. Lots, and Lots of favoritism...good ole boy/girl system"
bad,Flexible work hours however there was no balance between work and life.  Everyday was a constant battle against other departments due to who was right or who was right
bad,"A typical day at work can be confusing to say the least since communication is not poor. What happened yesterday may not be acceptable today since instructions change change frequently with no rhyme or reason being given to employees. As a person who has run his own business I do understand that change is necessary to make process and business better, but there should be clear direction and time given to make the change work."
bad,"Upper Management does not like change and shoots down things which will make your job easier even it it takes just a few more minutes.  You plan out your day according to your job task and what the priority is and manager comes and changes just to have your AVP come back telling you that what you already knew should be worked first.  Management does not understand the workflow and the length of time it takes due certain job tasks.   "
bad,"Though it isn't written, it is required that you work a minimum of 10 hours a day. There isn't any room for growth nor is the company stable."
bad,"•	Originated Conventional Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Loans, HARP loans, VA loans and FHA loans."
bad,NSM was the pivotal place to work from 2011 to 2013. Some of the managers were okay to work with. Lots of favoritism and skewed numbers makes it an intolerable work environment.
bad,"The work, and the work environment was generally favorable, unfortunately, a great deal of the company's processes are being, or have already been, outsourced."
bad,"Nationstar, there was nothing that I enjoyed about Nationstar, blind sided with a layoff."
bad,"In my one year of working here, I have changed jobs and job responsibilities three times.  My latest position has not been able to function properly since it began in May.  One of the managers working for the company exclaimed that the to do his job properly he must ""do the exact opposite of all the management experience he'd gained over seven years.""  Every single co-worker of mine felt that the job changed duties every day and were under paid for the amount of work given to each employee.  At one point, I was left to work a 62 hour week, taking over the positions of my coworker and manager who were out of town, during the middle of one of the largest projects to date.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the vague job responsibilities and expectations of upper management.  Frequently I felt that too many people were trying to fix a problem that they knew little to nothing about.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my second job responsibilities as manager of the file room, in which i kept track of incoming and outgoing mail to the department and helped to organize the file room."
bad,"NationStar is a very high pace company that can be very overwhelming depending upon your department.  Very hard working company, but no work life balance within this company."
bad,"A typical day at work is very busy, phone calls, instant messaging, reviewing documents, setting up closings, talking to insurance companies, responding to emails, and talking to customers. The hardest part of the job would be multi-tasking in between 9-12 different loans at a time. But would need different documents from each loan/file you work on.  The most enjoyable part about the job is that its never the same. You are always learning different things everyday and talking to different people."
bad,"I wouldn't be surprised if this company goes down like the Titantic within 8 months.  New leadership announcements regularly which seems scary.  Bonuses, if you're lucky to get one are usually paid out some time in March.  I'm waiting to see who sticks around after that.  This company is playing chess while most of the employees are playing checkers."
bad,This company offered a good salary but management and people skills are terrible.  The company does not make employees feel secure and it does not have an inclusive atmosphere. It is not a good place for minorities and management is horrible.
bad,"I really appreciate Mr. Cooper for giving me the opportunity to have gainful employment. The culture seems great from the outside looking in. I would say that it is definitely a big adjustment for those that are used to the late 90's and early 2000's job culture. Opportunity is there if they know you are they have an opportunity to like you. Once they deem you as an outsider they will treat you with the worst kind of disrespect. They will make you not just understand that you work for them on a daily basis but that you belong to them. I would describe the culture as ruled by fear and intimidation. They should post a sign that says ""Enter at your own risk'."
bad,"If you are lookin for a long term career in an ever changing environment this may be for you. But a lot of people there are not happy, and most of them are managers. Managers get chosen, and they usually don't apply. Once they begin the positions, they realize there is no real pay increase and they treat the job as such. The mangers who are very willing to help you are usually not qualified and got the job through nepotism or some kind of social relationship with a higher up. The ones who are capable were usually forced and don't want to be there. It's a job and a check but I would bet against being happy working here long term."
bad,There is opportunity to make lots of money here as there is with any loan officer position. Be prepared to make 100+ cold calls a day with very high pressure to close loans.
bad,"Not much for room for advancement, although the lead you on to believe so. Also,they DO NOT compensate competitively. Relaxed work environment for the most part."
bad,"Departments do not work together as a team. Management changes daily . The company would do best to have everyone with the same goal to work as a team,"
bad,"Company really invests a lot in regards to employee training.  There is a ton of potential to make good money here, but you are expected to work 60+ hours per week."
bad,"Nationstar is in the process of changing its brand and culture.  The old way of doing business is cut throat and very much about the bottom line.  The new approach is customer focused and supports employees. Unfortunately there are many areas of the company that are not willing to change the culture.  When finances get tough, Nationstar is quick to lay people off."
bad,No internal CEO and zero communication from parent company.  Ineffective internal senior management.  Hiring is extremely racist (must be same as hiring manager).  Advancement only offered to friends of management.
bad,Benefits are SKY HIGH even for someone single with no kids!!!!! Then there is no way of cancelling them you are just stuck. They already don't pay much unless you come in as a temp who get started off making more than the perm reps and then they are allowed to negotiate their pay. But you don't make much and you have high benefits so you do the math. Schedules are ok but pretty much whatever you agree to when you come in is what you will pretty much have for most if not ALL of your time here. They will tell you a bunch of things about the shift bids but I have been here several months now and from what I am told they really don't exist. The best chance you have a switching shifts is switching schedules with someone else. Good luck with that!! Calls are ok but due to the lack of staff sometimes a workday can be very overwhelming.
bad,My day started with logging into my phone and taking calls. Customer were rude and you had to accept it all day. There was no such thing as make the customer accountable for there actions it felt as if we had to do whatever to keep them. There was no appreciation from management for the hard work only ways we could do better. If I wanted to take off it had to be approved and thousand other question needed to follow up with it. No advancement at all
bad,"This company was very good at hiring new people in the middle of the housing crisis in 2009. They were very good at bringing on new people with little to no experience and getting them trained within a month. However, the pay was very low and the managers were very big micromanagers, logging your every moment."
bad,"Fast paced environment with little concern for doing things the right way.  Management is more concerned with getting things done quickly.  Poor leadership and lack of planning is pervasive throughout the organization."
bad,This was one of the most unorganized and unstructured places I ever worked at. There was no formal training and when we were trained it was done incorrectly. The process changed every other day. They have old and outdated systems. The managers who were in place did not know what they were doing. Their HR department did not handle issues that were brought to them professionally. It was extreme micro managing going on. The laid everyone off after only a year of setting up the office in our city. The people from the other sites did not respect our site and treated us like we didn't know what we were doing. I would not recommend working for Nationstar Mortgage. Working here makes me appreciate Citi and makes me want to run back there!!!!
bad,"Typical day would be going into work, drinking coffee. Not whole lot of work except some people. Learned a lot within past few years, but not enough to get around in the job market. Repetitive tasks everyday. Fairly new management with little experience. This company grew so fast within past few years, therefore lots of people were hired to accomplished multiple tasks. However, salary is fairly low for all these people and they increase individual's salary every year around 2%, below standard inflation rate. Favoritism and politics are all around the workplace. If you are really good with management you can get promotions really fast, they usually don't judge you based on what you do and what can you do, but instead who you know, and how well you know them!"
bad,"Degrading;If your production for the day,week,month are below expectation you are reminded constantly in a unprofessional (at times way)..Disrespectful; time is not yours any more..The expectation is you work 50 to 60 hours a week AND Saturdays..Micromanaged;U constantly will hear g""Get off AUX (meaning get back on calls)..You will get emails every 50 min"
bad,"At the time I was working there (2009-2011), Nationstar had not yet adopted its most recent changes. Work-life balance was non-existent and it was a stressful environment."
bad,"Peers are great to work with. Although your pay may be comparable to the industry, the leadership displayed has been poor and very little guidance when it comes to next steps in one's career. There are no updated policy and procedures which makes it challenging to excel at the job. Regular feedback from management is an area of concern."
bad,"Good job for entry level college student. Overall subpar experience working there. Decent pay, little training, unrealistic expectations."
bad,"•	Originated Conventional Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Loans, HARP loans, VA loans and FHA loans."
bad,"As a entry level job this is a great opportunity to learn and develop skills to further career opportunities. Working hours can be very intense, but the job scope provides in depth knowledge and positive experience."
bad,Fast paced growth at start then reduction in force to send jobs overseas.  I loved working for the company in the beginning and worked for a 2 great senior executives.  Due to the constant changes in management there was a clear lack of direction in our area specifically.  This in no way infers what entire company core strengths and values are.  I enjoyed working here and made great advancement both personally and professionally.
bad,No direction from upper management and no job stability - This is not a company I would suggest become a part of if your desire is longer term.
bad,"This company is going to implode if they don't solve their upper management issues.  They can't make up their minds, want all IT projects completed yesterday, and don't listen to those beneath them.  Projects come up, you write up the documentation, then they get canceled.  Happened 5 times over the last year."
bad,"A typical day is straight inbound calls from our customer service or other outsourced lead retrievals of atleast 20+ calls a day maybe more. The training was great and always available. However, We were not given the best opportunity to close these access of these high volume of loans we had thru our operations side. I started 2 years ago and still had loans in my pipleline from when I began and on no part of me not working my loans for some reason there was a black hole type of processing going on. That made my job even harder and more frustrating to see all the new business I have acquired and unsure of how many I could actually fund. I love the benefits. We just recently found out that this office in Houston is closing. So that is why I am seeking employment elsewhere."
bad,"I never hated a job more than this one. As a Loan Counselor, you start calling borrowers on the 2nd of the month if they did not make their mortgage payment on the 1st. You often get talked to any kind of way and cursed out. I could totally understand calling people if they have not paid and it's the 15th. Then there is no OT if you want it and when you don't want it, you are forced to work it. Especially if it's a holiday. They use holidays as an excuse to make you work a 6 day work wk. So anytime there is a holiday, you WILL be working that Sat. Nationstar takes advantage of desperate college grads looking for work. I am currently looking for another job."
bad,"This is a god company for those looking to boost their resume out of college. It is a stable company and your job security is well set. Beyond these two points there is not much that one can view as positive. Working in the Modification department managers lack knowledge and often do not know what is happening with their teams. The pay scale is horrible when compared to the standard in the industry. You will be advanced but often it is called lateral moves and small if no pay raise is included but you will get more work. The upper management constantly micromanages and takes away things such as shorter lunches when they do not get numbers they want to see. The systems are always going down but you are still expected to meet your numbers daily. The best advise is to work here, get some experience, and move on to better things."
bad,"I just didn't care to work for this type of corporate like environment. It was mind numbing working there. The work itself was challenging, none the less had to be finished, which I never shied away from, but the unrealistic working hours and how people treated each other there made it easy for me to leave."
bad,It was an overall alight learning experience. Learned a few things regarding compliance in the Mortgage industry by developing a loan processing system.
bad,"Busy,Stressfull if you are not organized.I learned a lot how to deal stressful customer and how to help them to avoid foreclosure.Management is fine in Loss Mitigation you on your own.I like the culture friendly the most I love working with my team .Need to be really good in every phone call for the SURVEY QUALITY MONITORING.I always get my incentive monthly."
bad,"besides the mediocre pay, they will talk for days on how much they care about internal employee relations but the second you bring up any issues with any other department you become the bad guy. i would not recommend this employer to anybody. Management is a joke. its their way or the highways, even if they have no idea what they are doing. they will work you to the bone and not even recognize you but make a mistake and they are all over you."
bad,"To me the place is good for recent college grads that are looking for the opportunity to work in a variety of different of fields fresh out of school. They do provide heath care benefits and a hourly wage to take care of minimum basic needs. "
bad,"It's okay the AVP is rude & is on a huge power trip!!! They have plenty of overtime, but Month End we stay til Midnight at the lastest but I don't like it when they shave overtime from that."
bad,"As a loan counselor Nationstar your productivity is judged by the amount of payments you get when you first start. They want you to get 20 payments a day. The hard part is your pretty much calling the same people each day which makes it hard. Also, a fun fact is that Nationstar requires you to be in the ""Loan Counselor"" role for a year before you can move to another department. There are exceptions to this rule,but they also make rules up as they go along. If you get moved up from dealing with accounts due for the current month you will be dealing with accounts due for 2 payments. You would think they would give you a pay raise, but that is not true. If you go in as a Loan Counselor you will only be given a raise after your first full year. The benefit of moving up to dealing with accounts due for two payments is the fact that a you can get a bonus if your group ""moves enough money."" Also, in the lateral move from what is known as the pre's department to the 30 day department you will be given knew goals. In the 30 day department you will no longer have to get payments, set people up on repayment plans, and get people to sale their homes. It also sounds easy, but Nationstar makes it hard because of the ineffectiveness of the dialing system they use. If Nationstar feels that your doing good in that ""30 day"" department then they laterally move you to the pre-foreclosure department. The reason I viewed this move as lateral as well is because again you do not get a raise, but your expected to deal with people due for 3-103 payments. In that department you are expected to come up"
bad,"The managers only care about numbers, was tricked into it being a call center position. Duties on your job is very unclear, expect you to be a robot and answer call after call, watches your every move."
bad,The company culture had a lot of turnover at the top management level every couple years.  The systems were outdated and/or relied on Excel based manual reports.
bad,I would not recommend anybody too go get a job here at Mr. cooper even thou I worked there for 2 years. it was the most stressful 2 years of my life due too management and supervisors having favorites and just the job area was not healthy at all
bad,Company environment is unstable with ever-changing management and culture.  Not a good long term place to work.  I have not worked there recently so perhaps some of this has improved.
bad,location closed-I would have stayed-no choice.Manager was very nice-constant calls-very face paced.nice co workers-pay was very good/overtime available
bad,"I was under the impression that I was a loan counselor like they told me in my interview to find out I am actually a collections agent. being on the phone with back to back calls was exhausting to the point I would have a migraine almost everyday but they did treat their employees very nicely. we always had some kind of competition, prizes, giveaways and functions for the staff possibly to combat the horrible job. if you don't mind getting cussed out by annoyed homeowners who are in danger of losing their homes then this is for you since you will be nicely compensated"
bad,"Supervisor have favorites, everything unorganized everyday you will  feel like  you are walking on egg shells Job is not guaranteed. Too much for less pay you will not be treated fairly"
bad,"I enjoyed my time here overall. The accounting process was unorganized but, it was a great experience. Handled different spreadsheets and people were willing to help."
bad,"Daily going into work checking my emails and priorities on what needs to get done and submit it first."
bad,Handle escalations from borrowers everyday. Worked with different departments to handle situations.
bad,the managers had a open door policy. Even if they didn't always tell the truth or the whole story.
bad,"Was a good opportunity for the brief period while rates were low and the HARP program was beneficial."
bad,"Mortgage collections/customer service environment,"
bad,"They enticed many experienced knowledgeable mortgage professionals into leaving the postitions they had by calling and increasing the salary offering, etc.   They trained, then suddenly closed down in approximately 1 year.   Many of us were devastated as we left positions that had been secure, but low paying."
bad,Every day is a challenge in a good way. Busy days assisting customers and working with vendors. I enjoy the fast paced work and the problem solving.
bad,Nice company to work for. its relaxed. I would refer people there. when I was temp my manager made me permeant and the pay increase was nice...ok company
bad,I was very please to work for the company. It the environment was very professional. Every day was filled with excitement.
bad,I don’t think they promote within faiirly. I  like the environment people seem to be nice and management  is a little on the stand-off-ish side but I think it’s getting better.
bad,"I love working here, unfortunately after 9 months of taking over our location, they advised us they are going to close our location. "
good,"Not a good company! Do not work here unless you want to get sucked into working in mortgage forever! The management they hire are often clueless and blame the employees when something goes wrong, although they are not trained properly"
good,"My review at Nationstar has been a journey for me spending 10 years with the company.  Some care and some don't. I was taught to always do the right thing,  Integrity is what I have always believed in and I don't know if the view is the same looking in or out. I learned being a manager is caring about your team and what they have to look forward to their day coming in.  The hardest part is laying them off.  The most enjoyable is when you have a relationship with your team. It makes them want to work for you and enjoy coming to work with a smile on their face."
good,"No room for advancement. "
good,Proper training on job function is needed. It was sad that most departments didn't know how to handle escalations. Many customer complained that they were transferred so many times to different departments before that one person took the time to help or they just gave up. Training on escalated situations is needed.
good,"Not quite what I was expecting, given my customer service and work history. "
good,NationStar Mortgage is a nice place to work. This company is growing and offers plenty of opportunities within the company.
good,"Management doesn t know anything. There is no advancement in this company, no raises either. Numbers are more important than employees. This company treats its employees like kids: time to go to lunch, breaks, etc."
good,"Mr. Copper recently acquired Pacific Union Financial. Pacific Union is still running the Non Delegated department. You will be required to work a strenuous and unrealistic turn-time and be reprimanded if you cannot do it in 8 hours (no OT). You will be subjected to being required to approve loans that do not meet guidelines one month, then the next month you will be required to be the strictest you can possibly be. But don’t think you’re off the hook for when you were told to approve that loan (or five) you wanted to decline but couldn’t because management has final say... when it comes back as uninsurable, like you knew it would, management will not stand behind you (their) decision. Management will side with QA/QC even if you provide guidelines that support your decision. Instead of firing you, they will try to get you to quit (less loans to work so it’s impossible to meet daily goals, putting you through second level reviews with peers, ie. just different UW styles, and if the other UW views something different than you, they are automatically correct without further review (and it’s no fun being that UW either when you find out you may have had a part in someone being fired). If you don’t quit after being subjected to this, they will use the low numbers and “failing” reviews as their justification to terminate you and will then dispute your unemployment benefit claim (don’t worry, most states will still side with the employee, it’s just additional frustration caused by the employer). The bonus structure is a joke; it changes at least every three months. If you’re earning"
good,"This was a very stressful job with mandatory overtime everyday including weekend. Vacation were often denied due to volume."
good,I will not rate this company.  You will need to research and ask questions that pertain to your needs and what isimportant to you. It is not necessary for my experience to be your experience.
good,"For the few months that I was at Nationstar, there was constant turnover in IT and in the business.  There was constant disagreement at the management level and very little room for collaborative work to be done."
good,"Great friendships were built, management is not willing to work with coworkers needs.  They are by the book and don't care if it isn't in their best interest to keep employees happy.  "
good,"Processing is not as hard as they make it . The underwriters and funders are inexperienced and management does not have your back. Very, very stressful and not worth the pay."
good,"I exceed daily goals, and am good at my job. I enjoy my co-workers and managers very much. I enjoy my job, but feel the compensation is extremely low."
good,"I was trained to be a Research Resolution Analyst. My work duties consisted of the following tasks daily:•	Performed mortgage default analysis to determine appropriate communication to distressed borrowers."
good,"They are very unorganized and there is no security. Too many redundancies in their procedures, management is not willing to admit company shortcomings in PR"
good,"Other employees that did not have a disability could work from home, granted permission by the manager. But, not me. I had a different course of action to complete before she allowed me the same accommodation. "
good,From the moment I get to my desk it is constant intense focus on the pipeline. I  hit the ground running full speed first thing and do not stop until an hour after your shift is over for the day. I never leave for lunch and always eat alone at my desk.
good,If you want to work for a place that has already established a buddy system then this is the place for you. If not then I suggest you look somewhere else.
good,NationStar Mortgage has been helpful in gaining more knowledge of the mortgage industry. I have had the opportunity to grow in this industry and become even more aware of mortgage lending especially regarding mortgage processing. I have good co-workers around me who are helpful and are very knowledge about the industyr. However working as a phone representative for a very unorganized and very under staffed company has made it a very tiring and extremely stressful work environment. Also upper management is very disorganized and gives bad communication when it comes to process changes and reasoning for changes. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the organization in itself and seeing how they treat they're employees as if they are disposable and interchangable. However working with my fellow co-workers makes the job a little easier to deal with.
good,"Just wasn't what i thought it would be at all! The hours were bad, some of the managers were not helpful at all and not enough money for what they wanted you to do."
good,Our country recently experienced a difficult time regarding the mortgage industry. I worked with current and former home owners with severe financial situations to help resolve the issue. My goal was to minimize the company's loss as well as resolving any future potential issues for the customer. Helping the customers in this difficult situation can be rewarding once the issue is resolved. There was a good mixture of team work and individual work included in this environment. My co-workers worked to help each other although it is a competitive environment. The success of the company came first.
good,"Nationstar is a very large company that has grown extensively in the past year. Daily, I would take inbound and outbound calls to help people that are dealing with hardships from losing a loved one such as a spouse and illnesses that have prevented them to be current on their mortgages. "
good,Good starting mortage environment. Provided the tools necessary to learn the industry.
good,HR are like car salesman. They will tell you whatever to get you out of their face-but never address your issue and forget about resolution. SVP and EVP are really nice but the VP/AVP are very condescending and really don't respect others.
good,"*Please Note* I worked here prior to the official re-branding to ""Mr. Cooper,"" so my experience is dated and may not be accurate of the current company climate. Many of the following criticisms may have been improved upon since my time there, so please take that into consideration."
good,The company is a great company To be apart of overall. How there is a lot of favoritism and things are not equal across the board in management. The company has a lot of employee perks that are beneficial.
good,Too many layoffs. Not enough training for proper advancement. Very little feedback on productivity and accuracy.  Ability to work from home was awesome.
good,You feel just like a number. A lot of back and forth with underwriting.  No one seems to be on the same page. You have a new responsibility added everyday and sometime\me not enough time for customers.
good,Working for NationStar felt like working a job and it did not have family environment that I look for in a company. I felt like I was just taking up a seat at a job.
good,over all a good place to work. Depends om department and manager. Need to invest in better training. The company has good benefits and discounts provided to employees. The HUD claims department in cut throat and stressfu.
good,"Ok place to work in general, management is VERY inconsistent so you might get the chill manager who lets you do whatever as long as you do your work, the other half of your time you get a horrible micro manager who threatens to write you up or fire you for petty things. Most entry level jobs are directly talking to customers then you can quickly move up to behind the scenes computer work. It is very repetitive an unchallenging for the most part and you will get bored fast unless you seek out additional stuff to do. the pay on the servicing side is on the lower end and doesn't go up very fast."
good,The salary and bonus structure is awesome but not worth the stress from the company. Home and work life balance is awful as they do not consider your off time being used for yourself or your family.
good,The advance meant there is non-existent.  When I was there it was ok but a lot was happening in other departments that I thought wasn't fair and I couldn't believe it.
good,"Based on the face-paced environment, worked long hours to keep projects on track. Management changed focus frequently based on upper management decisions on company direction."
good,Its a ok job to work at just hard to move around depending on who you are. Very hard to move around within company. I love my hours no weekends. I just want to be able to move around within company.
good,"Nation Star has potential to be a great company with great opportunities for the employees but they need a makeover starting with the head. Very chaotic from the systems to who's doing what the company is very chaotic no stability. Not trustworthy, no integrity all talk of wanting to be a good customer service related company that's all talk.  They don't even treat their employees right yet alone their customers! I was very disappointed with Nation Star!  Over-promise and under-deliver!"
good,It's just a job. Management lacks knowledge and are careless about their customers. I feel that unless you know someone on top you can't really move up in the company.
good,"As team lead- I complete most of the reporting for my department including daily reports sent to the team and other departments along with Executive branch showing weekly/daily results. Create a monthly ranking report for my department, support manager in approving plans and goals. Work with customers to discuss options available, follow up when required. "
good,The constant reorganization of the company never gave me a sense of belonging to a stable company who put employess first.
good,The Change in middle  and upper Management has lead to a decrease overall Morale.  Often I will try to Enforce the Auditing  Guidelines that have been put in Place and then it will be Waived or overwritten once it gets to a Manager. This has lead to a Unmotivated  culture at the company.  They are the same people that made the our channel the most productive its ever been and they're productiveness is being wasted Because of the incompetence and overall lack of interest on the part of the   Management.
good,I listen to recorded calls to audit for compliance and customer treatment opportunities and complete side by sides with the agents to help improve their efficiencies.
good,"Could benefit from hiring more qualified people instead of laying off people that invested so many years in the company, and continue to improve on training."
good,Nothing to say.  I've worked for this company for a little over a year and there isn't much of a chance for advancement.
good,"Nationstar is a good company. I took the job when was promised a management position after I started but there is no room for advancement and anytime there is, they hire from the outside. My direct management is great to work with and understands that I am a very hard worker and will always give it my all, therefore she supports and backs my decisions on projects and decisions."
good,While promoting themselves as a friendly company they appear so on the surface but free company swag does not balance out the true attitude of metrics and money being more important than doing the job right.
good,"The managers have favorites even if you're a top performer and no one knows you, you get no recognition. They talk a very good game but never show their agents they're appreciated. And when they do so something it's for show and tell just to take pics. They short you on bonuses. They lie about the pay. When change happens agents are informed at the very last minute."
good,"Mr. Cooper is a good place to get started if you are new to IT or changing to a new role in IT. The pay is decent and the benefits are good just don't plan on sticking around for more than a few years. You'll probably get hands on with a lot of different technologies since they tend to change technologies before the previous one was properly or completely configured and there are usually more tools than staff to manage them. The company advances faster than it can handle, IT is largely understaffed, and there are frequent RIFs."
good,"Limited opportunities for advancement and limited cross-training. If they would make changes based on employee surveys, they would have alot more happy employees."
good,"Mr. Cooper has a very relaxed work environment but the challenges I experienced was trying to advance within the company. For instance, I applied for positions that I know that I was well qualified candidate and did not review an interview. It was quite disappointing to receive a generic e-mail that was sent to anyone who applied for positions within the company. Overall, my experience was fair, but it was extremely difficult to try to advance within the organization when I  knew I was well qualified for the positions."
good,It’s a place to start but not a place to say it’s a finally career end . I would love for them to promote more off skills not based on liked . It’s chill but the pay is just ok.
good,Overall a good place to work.  Like anywhere else there will be good days and bad days.  Strong teams.  Good people. Employment there is what you make of it.
good,"Once top management left, the place went downhill fast. The company was running well as it was  but started going south"
good,"Typical mortgage company in terms of being production driven, however this company's management team has a way of leading their employees with fear. Daily you will feel like you are about to be fired. You will make a lot of money here, however you will never feel accomplished unless you are the top 5% of the company. The rest of the employees are replaceable  and they will tell you someone else is waiting to take your spot daily. They will tell you to trust their leadership, but you will quickly find out you can only trust yourself. Good luck to anyone who wants to pursue this company."
good,"Favoritism. Management issues..a lot of individuals in management that should not be (high school mentality), some great teamwork within your immediate team (pro)A lot of people that are frequently reported to HR, but nothing is done. There is also an abundance of unprofessionalism."
good,"There are some perks like ping pong, and sometimes you even get time to enjoy them."
good,The pay doesn’t match the work. It is highly stressful and lacks trained management.  The moral of the employees is very low and management has no clue of how to solve it.
good,Operation leaders is pushed hard to keep the numbers high each month..of course it then is passed down the pipeline to the employees. Staff pay the price having to work long stressful hours ..worrying about goals and objectives they have to meet. …
good,"...more people should be working rather than playing ping pong, its encouraged that you participate in these activities......but.....I think they struggle to understand there is a time and a place for it."
good,"Good company to start your career if you are looking at being in mortgage. the culture is behind , upper management varies many managers and up do not have an understanding of what most of there employees do on a day to day basis. If you know people they will lift you up if you do not it can be hard to move around."
good,Need stronger management who provide information in regards to changes in advance and more clearly to allow individuals to prepare and provide the tools require to succeed.
good,"If you enjoy being on the phones constantly you will enjoy working here, the company is moving towards customer service as all new accounts come in current as opposed to delinquent"
good,Frustrating that all internal departments are only accessible via sharepoint website with no responses. Expectations not met. I would not recommend to anyone that is not looking for a customer service job.
good,Stable position and flexibility.  Would like to see more opportunity for growth and focus on development.  Overall decent place to be.
good,"A typical day on the job consisted of answering phone calls handling payments over the phone. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry due to the extensive training on all things mortgage related. Management was goo for the most part but it seemed as though there was no room to grow beyond the first rung of management. The hardest part of the job was not being able to think and make real change. it was standard protocol over and over. I crave a challenge, mentally. The most enjoyable part of the job wold definitely be the customer actually being satisfied at the end of the conversation knowing that i successfully helped them."
good,"I learned extensively about mortgages and how they work. A couple months later I became escrow certified. A typical day consists of a 9 hour shift and the customer service floor is broken into teams with a manager and a team lead. The hardest part of the job was dealing with stubborn customers, but the most enjoyable part was interacting and learning new concepts of mortgage with coworkers."
good,"The work environment is starting to change as they have been listening to the employees more and updating different things throughout the offices. They have repainted the office to make it more inviting. They gave us ping pong and foosball tables. "
good,"I task  all of the work to my team in the morning. Then I process the Change of address request for each account. As the payoff team lead, I request property preservation fees for the necessary accounts. Then I generate the payoffs with the appropriate accounts with the property preservation fees that are available. Then I proceed with third party authorizations ,adding contacts to the accounts,"
good,"Job work/life balance. The demands are unattainable"
good,"Our company is quite large, and constantly growing - to give insight on the entirety of the company would be an impossible task."
good,"Pay structure is lower than average, turnover is high due to management changing frequently. Hours are long and weekends are required."
good,"I answered anywhere from 15 to approximately 60 calls a day to provide customer service to the customers who called, such as answering questions about their mortgage, accepting mortgage payments. I learned a lot about mortgages. Management was very low but were helpful when you could get their attention. Co workers were very fun to work with. Hardest part of the job is if you did not know an answer that a customer needed and were unable to find someone with the answer. Most enjoyable part was the bonuses and competitions to make our day at work fun."
good,Different position with the same company so the previous review stands. I exceeded my daily goals with ease. Enjoyed my co-workers and managers. Just felt I deserved higher compensation.
good,"A typical day included making outbound calls to our clients regarding payment plans, loan education, foreclosure process and loan modification. When working for this company I understand the amount of pressure in paying your mortgage. We were required to get 20 promise to pay arrangement per day. This included making outbound calls starting on the 2nd of every month. We would call customers within their grace period to collect their monthly mortgage and even future arrangements. Most customer did not like that because we called more than 3 times to day even when the customer account were current. The hardest part of the job was running out of options for people about to go through foreclosure process. The lack of communication between the company and customer when applying for loan modification is terrible. Most of the time customers would lose their homes due to lack of documents received to alter their payment arrangement. The customer point of contact regarding issues was the account resolutions who was not train in this field. The environment and co-workers were moderate to ok. The company did give out awards to top performers but the overall general outlook of the company was not for me. I resigned and started working at Philidor Rx Services."
good,"I worked for this company for 7 years before being laid off. The company is going downhill, and going through more large layoffs.  Not sure of the future."
good,NSM has undergone so much growth in the past couple of years that the infrastructure and culture has not been able to keep up. They are an extreemly manual organization.
good,This is a great place for new graduate seeking some experience but not for the long term. The pay is considerably lower than other companies.
good,Job titles and duties change frequently without a notice. I have learned about the complete process of mortgage side as well as bankruptcy side.
good,"Everyone is willing to assist with your journey through the mortgage industry, regardless of your career path. I have developed many skills sets and knowledge that will last a lifetime. Management could be more visible within the company, however if you have any issues most managers will take the time out to listen."
good,The hardest part of the job is that goals were set so high that were hard to obtain.  Great people to work with.
good,"•Consistently underwriting several FNMA, FHLMC, VA, FHA, House Key and USDA loans per day while ensuring compliance with appropriate company and secondary market investor standards. "
good,Over worked and underpaid staff. The office has been closing several of its offices and laying off employees.
good,"Working in a environment where management is clueless about the job they are given to manage. I worked four months there reviewing critical documents and when asking for help they couldn't even provide me the right answers. However, those managers are still there, still clueless about the job. Selectively keeping those who  remain there who had terrible attendance records because they played favoritism among the employees. The pay was not equal when doing the same job, even with more years of experience in the industry. The integrity went out the window for so-called go to persons when they offered bonus to review critical documents such as government loans and conventional loans. I have never seen quantity over quality been so tarnished."
good,"As the company continues to grow in the mortgage industry, there is opportunities to learn how to service various types on mortgages. Thes is great for expandind your knowledge base. However, opportunities to advance in your career is limited due to the company tends to hire executive management from the outside versus promoting within the organization."
good,"Customer Relations Department is a legal sweatshop. No work life balance,  managers are great but upper management wants you to make chicken salad out of chicken spit. This would be an amazing place to work if they'd hire enough staff. But instead they remain understaffed and demand more from employees."
good,"Mr. Cooper's culture and company goals are currently in flux.  They are going through a ""major corporate restructuring"", as they described it, and several reductions in force are taking place."
good,"The place is ok to work at. I've been in collections since I've been hired and the morale has been up and down. Most of my managers were young and didn't know how to handle sturn employees that spoke their mind, in a professional manner. Half of the time the VPs or AVPs won't even speak to you as you pass them in the halls. I could go on, but I'm not."
good,I've worked for Mr. Cooper for nearly 5 years. It's a great company culture wise and benefits. Compensation is not the best but competitive. One of the biggest issues is management. One it's hard to move up in the company even after receiving awards and recognized by your peers. Some managers in the company can handle situations inappropriately. I've have seen countless time managers have disputes with other workers on the floor. Great company bad management that have not captured the vision in the direction the company wants to go.
good,"Departments did not work well to reach a common goal. Underwriting and funding was mainly unapproachable. Only a few individual underwriters and funders worked with processors. AVPs for a specific department should come from the same department or they should be willing to observe, learn and be flexible with the department’s process and needs. The expected monitored and timed phone calls to clients have gone to extreme lengths. The dual month ends for the department vs management’s month end created a stressful and negative environment."
good,Mr. Cooper gave me the opportunity to start a career and grow within the company.  Mr. Cooper does not have a great work life balance.  Since I now have kids I need a job that has a great work life balance.
good,"Currently my job performance is rated based on how many defaulting loans which has been saved from foreclosure through a modification, I have completed daily. The expected goal is 40, which I have been diligently working on and therefore not much time is left for other activities."
good,"Would be the same as RICOH after all our area was contracted out to RICOH so I worked with the same people. It was fun and very productive the co-workers, supervisors and managers were great to work for and with. We were a family and not just employees"
good,Workplace culture appears to be aimed at millennial job market. Coworkers lack professionalism that I hav experienced in other work environments. Poor communication between supervisors and employees.
good,"A great company to work for. Nationstar has undergone tremendous growth over the past decade. Very competent CEO. Good corporate culture--managers & coworkers are generally friendly. They work hard, but play hard as well."
good,Nationstar can be a wonderful company to work for pending what team you are on. Managers can be very difficult at times especially if your personality does not gel well not work performance but personalities. Managers will write a great yearly review on how you will be prepared for career advancement but no additional training or guidance will be given. Year after year you will find yourself in the same position unless you apply out. Many managers simply move from team to team instead of promoting within. It would seem you would have to be hired in as a manager in order to be promoted.
good,"Building in Irving was redone to include ping pong, etc. Work-life balance in originations did not allow for ping pong time. Long hours but good pay. In the end was laid off"
good,"The overall work environment was good.  Mgmt encouraged team building activities."
good,They don't have any work. the business model doesn't work and they don't put money into advertising. Advancement won't happen even though they say it will. Must know somebody in management to get a good position.
good,"in my short time working there,  I saw co-workers and lots of management leave.  This provided lots of talk within the workers of a negative work environment."
good,"I had a great supervisor, but management seemed to be two faced. Like most places it was who you know not how you performed to get promoted."
good,Nation star is a cool place to work if you are graduating from college looking for a good start. Like most companies these days it is hard to move up unless you know someone or will take a lateral move.
good,"the pay is good and staff is professional, if you like call centers this is the place for you. very greatful for the opportunity to learn new customer service skills."
good,Nationstar is really a great company to work for. They have all the perks that Google would have the only issue is you are constant worrying if you are going to have a job or if your position is going offshore.
good,"no comment. I was not given the opportunity to work there long enough to offer much feedback.  Hired with no experience, i was given moderate training to do the job. most of my knowledge came from hands on."
good,"Its a good training for employees who are not yet too experienced in the collection business. "
good,"Established good working relationships with the office I worked in, however, I left to make more money and to ensure I could get licensing. The management did not support that growth so I had to leave."
good,They are trying to become more work/life balance oriented but it is taking time due to the changes in the mortgage world. Some downsizing currently going on so you don't know if one day it will be you. Relaxed environment most days though
good,"Job is a good job. Basic executive management. I feel that the company is definitely up and growing, but until they renew management at the top, old habits will likely hinder its growth in the long run."
good,"Nationstar was a fun place to work, but the pay is not competitive. Nearly every job change was considered a ""lateral move."" The advancement was also not there. It was discouraging to see people get hired from the outside instead of Nationstar taking the time to develop talent from within."
good,"The company has the utter most ends of the spectrum when comes to people and management styles.  The current team I work for is wonderful but, I have real bad ones and some of them are still around.  Upper/Middle management has had a lot of turn over causing mixed messages to be sent down the chain.  The executive levels are pushing for change but, so far, the culture change they want has happened yet.  Unfortunately, it does not appear to be close either.  I am optimistic that over time it will make but, it will take the upper/middle management level to become better, more stable, and then create and provide a clear direction for the company to the lower levels. "
good,ive learned a lot working at the company. ive had the opportunity to meet a lot of new people.  not much more to say because everyone is entitled to there own opinion.
good,Nationstar Mortgage is great at compensation valued experience. They recognize the competitive market when it comes to pay.
good,"On the daily basis I would review accounts, follow up with clients, and help clients who are struggling. Review clients financials, taxes and advise clients what needs to be done. "
good,The place is now very stressful.  i learned many aspects of mortgage servicing.  I moved to management and the stress was unbearable.  The company is very reactive and not proactive.
good,"It should be true that the harder you work, the more you're acknowledged & compensated.  However, this is not the issue here.  While you work 60+ hours a week, you'll probably make less than the person next to you that works 35 hours max.  It's bias: politics, favoritism, etc.  Management will not let move on career wise, if it's not beneficial for them.  However, job security, at least on the servicing side, seems solid."
good,"My management let us handle out work. Management was thourough in their communication efforts. It was effective and distributed often. My Management was flexible with my time, which was great. I enjoyed working at Nationstar Mortgage."
good,"*Responsible for taking inbound and outbound calls for active and inactive bankruptcy customers"
good,"Typically work 100+ accounts, answer 50+ calls per day. Process 10+ loan modification loans. Create daily performance dashboards. Improved productivity sending daily reports to my peers and managers."
good,Not a stable company to work for. Everyday something is changing. layoffs happen regularly
good,I was a part of the retail lending division and Nationstar sold to Stonegate Mortgage.
good,"Positive - Decent pay and you'll get a great deal of experience"
good,"Typical was atypical."
good,"Nationstar can be a good company to work for, however, just like any other company is has it's downfalls. I was given the chance to learn a lot about the mortgage industry, which I am very thankful for. However, management is not very good there. Over the course of 4 years I had 1 good manager. It's a good company to start at, but wouldn't stay there long term."
good,"A typical day at work would include arriving to work at approximately 5am and begin with inventory checklist of all items sold or in stock. After I would walk the store to refit fixtures with updated styles and promotions. Once the store opens at 10am, I begin to greet customers and help them find the items they are looking for. My last hour and a half I would work the cash register, collecting money and assist customers in their returns."
good,Company as a whole is working on becoming a great company. They just aren't there right now
good,A typical day at work consist of processing loand and assiting the submission team with uploading and submitting docs.
good,"The company treats its customers well, but the culture is not one of long term career development."
good,Nationstar Mortgage LLC is a good place to start working if you are fresh out of college looking for your 1st job at an entry level position. It's a very competitive enviornment and requires a fast pace to keep up.
good,Some positions allow you to work from home. Also if you are not in a department that you enjoy then coming to work can be a pain. Unless you are in management payment is not competitive.
good,I've enjoyed working for the company and they've been good to me. However I'm concerned about potential career growth in the company since some poor business leadership decisions lead to annual lay offs in the fourth quarter.
good,The process of going from the training environment to production floor was simple. But there a few flaws as in the way we are brought to the floor could be easier.
good,This job has a lot of favoritism. no flexible schedule. a lot of disrespect. its like high school. the job was fun assisting people with their mortgage loan.
good,I loved working for Mr. Cooper just hate that I didn't get no type of notification on my lay off and neither do they allow you to be transferred to a different department that you have already applied for. You basically have to know someone that works there to get on or come through contractor. After being laid off I have applied for numerous positions that I know I am well qualified for and no interview are anything just straight rejection. But the way I got on was through someone that knew someone so that's why I know I want get a call back unless I know someone.
good,I left to the pressure to hit certain numbers without the correct guidance and layoffs on the rise. Constantly on the phone and is a true customer service position.
good,"Experience gained at Mr.Cooper cannot be taught in school.  The importance of soft skills.  It taught me the importance of professionalism, honesty, and integrity in a serious business environment.  It also allowed me to learn new programs, platforms, and systems."
good,This is a great place to get experience in mortgage with a great culture that is constantly changing.  There are free lunches during high demand production times.
good,This is a decent company to work for. A lot of opportunity to move a round and learn new job functions. Management changes happen frequently in multiple departments.
good,"This is a great job experience to learn what it is like to work in a call center.  They do provide 3 weeks of training, which is great, but there is so much to learn and I felt like I was just thrown out there to learn, kind of like sink or swim.  "
good,"Systems are old and don't talk to each other.  Data is difficult to obtain.  Controls are lacking making it hard to trust information.  Company grew, but infrastructure was bad."
good,"There are clearly set policies regarding making Nationstar a people's company, but a lot of Snr IT Managers especially tend to practice otherwise. There is no fair way of truly evaluating contribution by team members to ensure career paths and aspirations can be realized by lower  level employees. A lot of favoritism when it comes advancement due to what looks like nepotism, and certainly difficult to factually confirm; seems to be a prevailing opinion across the board."
good,"Initially when I first started working at Nationstar the salary was great, they had lots of room for advancement, and lots of overtime was available. As my time at Nationstar progressed i noticed the turnover rate started to increase, overtime was limited, and any room for advancement was a lateral move. I actually made more than my manager because he started his position 2 years after i started, so yea. However I will say the environment became a little bit more relaxed after they had a company name change and all. It's a great place to work for any entry level position into the mortgage industry."
good,"Managers need to undergo more training in order to gain the trust of their employees and provide a stable workplace for all. Mangers view employees more on a personal basis instead of professional. VP shows horrible leadership, uses foul language towards employees in staff meeting, very unprofessional!"
good,Nationstar was OK to work for. Paid OK and benefits. The work load was not difficult. The managers could be absent or didn't care about their departments. My last manager was good though. Very knowledgable and engaged.
good,Initially Nationstar was a great place but new players that were brought in changed the culture to one of distrust and lack of recognition.  Pay was competitive.
good,It is difficult to count on anything or believe what management tells employees..  Inner management\department fighting gives the feeling of instability.
good,"Nice place to work but no job security. Typical work day goes by very fast because you are very busy with a lot on your plate.  The hardest part of my job was keeping up with all of the work.  Good hours, great Manager."
good,Nationstar is not a bad company a relax work environment lots of  fun  but no growth in departments no opportunity to move around and explore other areas
good,"This is your typical 8 hour job, management changes very often, giving little time for employee growth. "
good,Its ok to start off but for what you do you will be severely under paid. It's best to work there a year or so and then transfer what ever skills you have gained to another employer.
good,"Heavy workload, high expectations. Management runs around in circles. Lots of individuals in management who are poorly trained. Company has a bad name in the mortgage industry as far as places t work. BOA, Chase, Nationstar, Ocwen, Caliber and Greentree all recycle employees."
good,"Commission based sales with a competitive atmosphere. If leads are few and far between you will struggle to pay bills. 10 hours or more a day on the phone with borrowers. Nationstar does not have competitive pricing and it is difficult to sell benefits when, realistically, there are better options available."
good,Interesting work and talented people spread across many locations and offering a vast array of products and services.  Owned by parent company Nationstar.
good,"As a whole ISGN was a good place to work. The people were friendly, the job was challenging and the compensation was decent.  The management was the only downfall. The company was top heavy and very ""clicky"""
good,Call center environment I learned about home mortgages. My co-workers were great people to work with.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with escrow. What I liked most was  I was always learning something new.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and co-workers. The company has the potential to be a great place to work but fails to execute in some key areas to retain and reward talent.
good,Throughout the day I learn something new about our databases and the different systems that our representative use. My co-workers are full of life and they make the work environment enjoyable. The company has recently implemented a morale team and they provide different activities to boost our departments morale. I thought this was a great idea and the activities really do help with morale and helping upper management bond and engage with their employees.
good,"Nation Star Mortgage opened up in the Saint Louis, MO market paying more than the area lenders with better benefits and compensation. The CEO and management were constantly stating that the company was there to stay. The company left after one year."
good,Appreciated the opportunity to perfect my overall knowledge of the mortgage industry with this company. Great group of co-workers with positive contributions to the team.
good,Very High stress work environment with no work life balance
good,"In my current job I oversee the process of assisting distressed homeowners in surrendering their properties back to the bank to avoid foreclosure. I interact with customers over the phone and through email to manage accounts all across the U.S. Seeing as these people are upset about losing their homes, much of that frustration leads to very emotional and difficult conversations."
good,"Mortgage Company that works at 6am on Sundays - Not Family Oriented"
good,"I liked how they tried to make the culture and fun productive work environment.  Unfortunately, there were too many negative nancys and unproductive people."
good,"Competitive workplace and friendly environment; However, not a great place to ""move-up"" in and improve yourself. I would never go back."
good,"I love the work environment as an outbound loan officer at Nationstar Mortgage.  I have an amazing manager and a fantastic team.  My team and manager are like family to me.  They are very supportive and encouraging.  Nationstar has offered some really good products that not many other lenders can offer, which has given Nationstar an edge amongst our competitors.  I love working at Nationstar and with the people I work with everyday.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the fact that Nationstar is in some major financial troubles and the job security is not as secure as it once was before.  They just laid off 25% of our loan officers and there is a chance they may lay off more."
good,"This company promotes quickly, if you perform well. Unfortunately, there's no job security. Our jobs are being sent offshore and offices in other states have already closed. The pays decent. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with great co-workers and management."
good,"Although I believe one's improvement is up to one's determination, I also believe such improvement would come easier if the environment were conducive for it. There was a lot to learn at Nationstar. The management was more reactive than proactive. This mentality saw many of my co-workers - bright employees - leave for greener pastures. Having to deal with long hours and prolonged month-ends, the toll on one's physical and mental strength gradually became too much to handle. This stress could have been better dealt with by matching such demands with commensurate compensation, financial or physical."
good,"	Manage pipeline between 35-40 files per month."
good,The people I work with are very nice and care about helping customers find solutions to bring their account current.
good,"The policies here are outdated, you can wear jeans on Friday but can't wear tennis shoes, but it takes you 6 minutes to hike from your car to your seat. The parking situation is very SAD. Arrive at least 35-40 mins early if you wear heels Ladies. You will only get 5 sick days which is okay for singles but if you have kids expect to have days with no pay if you and your kids have known medical problems. Need to upgrade their systems."
good,Residential Mortgage Investor Reconciliations.  Growing environment because of purchases of sub-prime loans from major banks.
good,NSM is a decent company that is family-life balance friendly and gives post graduates a great chance to experience the corporate world.
good,"Management has their favorites, and new assignments with possibilities for growth are given accordingly"
good,Nationstar is going through a time of growth and transition.
good,"Growing servicer with opportunities to advance, but if you want to get paid scale compared to others in the industry, you'll have to leave and go elsewhere. Extremely cheap company that refuses to spend money on anything."
good,Training was informative and well received by all staff.  The job description did not meet the tasks from day to day.  Overall a great experience.  If that is the position you are looking for.
good,"The people made the job a more pleasant experience, the job wasn't hard. Lay offs a huge problem within the mortgage indusrty and that's the biggest problem."
good,"Mr. Copper is a good way to get started back up on your feet. As far as long term  it's iffy due to once you start making high bonuses they look at that, and the next head sweep they do. You will be apart of it"
good,"Learned a lot, fast paced, great training. Horrible hours and a difficult processing department. Easy to climb the ladder but have to put in the hours."
good,Learned quite a bit with regard to mortgage loss draft.  Would return to the company if offered more pay and remote.  The immediate supervisor was awesome.
good,"Mr. Cooper was originally Greenlight Loans and when purchased by Nationstar Mortgage, LLC dba was changed,"
good,"Fun, relaxed environment on the team that I was on. Team functions all the time such as exercising as a group, eating together for certain celebrations, play games."
good,The started early. Learn something new from the job and the customers. My manager was always there.to help no matter what. The cutler was ok. The job was hard when the customer was so very upset. When I was able to help the customer understand what was going on
good,"Mr. Cooper overall has very nice benefits. The problem with the company is how they treat salaried employees. The managers have no problem with a salaried employee working 10 plus hours of overtime each and every week instead of hiring additional staff. This was not a temporary problem, it went on for well over a year."
good,Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table. Company is working towards re branding and becoming more of a people company. Lack of communication makes for a difficult workplace
good,"I worked on  the private label side , training was obsolete, management was horrible it was like being in high school. I have never seen so many adult cliques. No one was willing to help unless you went to higher mgmt , which didn’t matter because they were apart of the cliques as well. Our class Requested more training they put our class back with the same person that trained us in th first place , what sense did that make!?!"
good,So I can't honestly rate this company. I aspire to work here as I feel I can bring honesty and professionalism to the work place. I would like the opportunity to contribute at a high level and a recognized expert.
good,Role was to develop project specifics based on guidelines.  Worked with various teams to ensure necessary information was obtained in order to finalize project meeting deadlines required.
good,"Was ok working there when it was green light loans."
good,"Enjoyed my co workers and enjoyed educating customers on their reverse mortgage, but the training is awful. Basically there is none and not everyone does things the same so its difficult from the customers perspective."
good,"When I worked at this company, management was a glass ceiling and there was so much process, no one worked together. Department relationships were rare."
good,It is a very fast pace moving company but unorganized.   Communication is key.  management is improving but still needs work. Customer oriented culture.  Getting projects moving is difficult.  the people I work with are the best
good,A good place to work that allows career advancements within the company. They strive on new ideas to enhance customer experience and contentious portfolio growth.
good,"Typical day is working in a fast paced environment. Learned many new skills. Workplace is a fun, exciting environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help users."
good,"Good place to work, however Buffalo Office was closed abruptly one year after the office was acquired. Would work there again but would need to relocate which cannot do at this time."
good,"That an amazing place with good people. Always willing to learn and help> Nothing is hard when you are working with a team work."
good,I was hired with 12 other people that all started the same day I started.  My department had no one to report to directly so we had no one to instruct us as to what to do.  We were trained by employees via phone on our own computers by employees from another office.    
good,"The challenge was knowing I was assisting people who were in dire need of financial assistance to handle bills, house amendment's or final expenses of lost loved ones."
good,I don't know why this is asking me for this information. I do not have the time to try and recall my day to day at this job. It was a stepping off point.
good,I worked at this company for a few years.  While there I learned a lot of various skills that I have been able to use throughout the years.  There was growth within the company.
good,You must be able to meet deadlines and work efficiently. The customer is your first priority. making sure that everything is correct before submitting any file is key to success.
good,"Working there is fine, but it's a stressful call center environment. It's very busy."
good,"My time there, the benefits were affordable even with including a dependent.  Various company events.  Not a fan of the call-center job atmosphere as breaks tend to be cancelled or lunch shortened due to call volume."
good,This company make promise but do not hold there promise.  The pay good with monthly bonus to management and underwriting staff.  Some Manager are placed within the wrong department
good,"Good company to start a career.  Learned technical skills such as Excel, SQL, Access. And, developed soft skills such as building relationships, communication, and the importance of reliability."
good,The workplace was balanced but the closing manager at the time was not experienced in closing and was not able to prepare the closing team with the materials needed to meet goal.
good,"It's your typical Mortgage company. Production is key. Human Resources is no where to be found, and advancement is slow, and favor based. A lot of good people in the wrong seat. But overall a good company."
good,After a company rebranding. There were numerous layoffs and no plan on replenishing staffing. Causing more workload ................................................................
good,nothing bad to say about the company.  i left because i moved to another state and could not take the job with me.  would recommend it to someone else considering  it.
good,I saw people written up and let go very quickly.  It seemed like a sink or swim environment because so much pressure was on making goals there didn't seem like much of a team environment to work together and help one another.
good,Great pay for performance but it is never enough for management. No matter how many hours you put in they always want more. They do not seem to care about family time.
good,"Worked with the company for twelve years.  My area was moved around under different organizations and leaders within the company.  By far, the most inept were the servicing executives.  SVP over non performing was over his head and did not have a clue about other business units under his supervision.  His decisions were made on a reactive basis to lower cost per loan and reducing expenses without insight of long term consequences of customer service values and headline risk to the company."
good,"The people are tremendous, the work culture is amazing. The work hours are very long, and would even require weekend work at times. Also, things move at a very slow pace."
good,I enjoyed learning about chapter 13 bankruptcy as well as how the mortgage world works. While working there I learned many things that would be beneficial for me down the line once I become a home owner.
good,"Many nice team mates and leaders. The experience was valuable and educating.  Little training at the leader level.  The hardest part of the job is learning ""the ropes""."
good,"Working through a portfolio of accounts."
good,underpaid but relatively laid back department.  management one step above me is terrible but hasn't always been. I would recommend them as a good place to start after college.
good,"100% refinances of portfolio.  Interest rates increased and company had 3 lay offs in 90 days.  This is not a stable place to work.  The pay and the bonus is very good and benefits are excellent.  Again, the job stability is poor."
good,Management was young and inexperienced. Difficult to move up within the company and salary was low. Management was not clear with instruction and little rewards were given.
good,"Company is going through large transition and there is a disconnect between Management, Employees and departments. Funding loans for borrowers is not a priority, the emphasis is more on internal policy and procedure.  "
good,"The company is trying to revamp the corporate culture as well as the company image to the public, but I was laid off so it will be interesting to see how it turns out."
good,Work for Nationstar overall is pretty good. Peers are friendly and your space is private  I would recommend that they have more concerns about there employees. I recommend a better short term company because they take 5 weeks to pay and they give you the run around
good,A typical work day for me is 7-4. Nationstar is a fast placed work environment. The company is trying to change its culture to more of a positive atmosphere. Trying to get all the management onboard is probably the biggest issue they have.
good,Good. ethical company. Need more in training.  Fast Past if you have question ask your peers.  Working are good. It is time to report you must be there on time.  Call center environment.
good,I have already gave a review. Anyone can be a manager in this place. The morale is ok. Cowrokers are awesome. I have learned a lot a bout SQL
good,"Fun working environment with no opportunity for growth. could do better in recruiting and office activities and also manger interaction."
good,Nice company to work for if interested in mortgage however mangement shows a lot of favoritism and job has no structure. They switch up rules without structure.
good,"This was a nice introduction to office life. The job is very self-directed, and due to the size, there are many options for advancement. Management is easy to communicate with (middle and lower-management at least), and most department supervisors are competent leaders."
good,"I have learned how to network with executives. Great interaction with co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not being able to move up in the company. When you are too good at what you do, management will not want to lose you as an employee in that current position."
good,"The job was high stress and a constant grind taking hundreds of calls per day.  You were glued to your phone, only able to leave your desk for 15 minutes at a time unless you were at lunch. Still, having no experience in the industry I made an extraordinary income (over $100 K). Others made considerable more as they were experienced.  The people I worked with made the environment fun!  You were always able to get help from your team mates."
good,Provides for a flexible work environment but does not staff correctly to support high profile initiatives. Overworks high performing employees and does not compensate them well according to competition.
good,If you do not mind working the overtime then you should have no issue with working here. There is tons of overtime! There is plenty of opportunity for growth within this company.
good,"I like to work in a team, but I am also comfortable working on my own. Furthermore I am a good communicator, accurate, goal oriented and positive."
good,Nationstar Mortgage is difficult in maintaining work life balance.  Constantly changing priorities and inconsistant management styles on joint initatives
good,haven't worked for them since they came back after the crash. They  were a direct seller of mortgage loans. Company closed when the mortgage industry fell.
good,My regular day at work I comein send a Qc report out to all the claims assignments agents. I open up my email check for all emails that are sent to me after my day ends and before I come in the morning.
good,Great Place to work great benefits room for advancement for a hard working person. Great hours and environment and management staff.
good,"On a typical day, I receive new adhoc reports or projects to manage and remediate.  I validate field mapping on fields that are used in sql queries to make sure the output is accurate.    "
good,"Management shows favoritism as if you are not a part of the circle, you more than likely will not advance. Work / life balance is good."
good,It's an OK place to work. The facility is very nasty! Other than that I really like the people I work with. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help.
good,"High manager turnover, with stringent requirements of work time and meeting goals/deadlines. Specific learning opportunities and lateral advancement available."
good,"Nationstar was a good experience, but could have been a little more organized and professional. Qualified individuals were overlooked due to friendship based promotions."
good,"Nationstar had the ability to be a top notch organization with just minor changes in their management approach.  However, their lack of desire to make those changes led to a culture of mediocrity.  Management didn't really seemed to care about a positive work environment or even if quality work was produced, therefore few others did either."
good,"An okay place to work, my coworkers were great, The company is no longer in Seattle. The work was easy but no proper training provided."
good,Good place to work where it's team oriented with great co-workers and managers to be able to help you obtain your goals. Working at the convention center is a great experience as well.
good,it has been a while since I worked at nationstar. Things may be different now but when I worked there they valued their employees.
good,Nationstar has a habit of focusing on their sales before focusing on their infrastructure. Acquisitions were hectic because the systems were not updated adequately to handle the amount of new data being loaded.
good,"Stressful job that is often thankless. Wages are below industry standards, but benefits are fair. Recently company has participated in layoffs, closed branches, and moved jobs offshore."
good,Good starting point to learn some skills. Management was inexperienced but hard working.
good,"Work to negotiate mortgage terms for the homeowner that will prevent foreclosure. The new terms are typically obtained through loan modification, short sale negotiation, refinance negotiation, deed in lieu, short payoffs, and forbearance’s to cure the default."
good,Mortgage and property preservation company. The potential is good if they direct the company well.
good,Company had its own agenda from the corporate locale. Closings were missed and cancelled due to issues on the inside. HARP borrowers were left hanging for months without contact due to the massive amount of loans bought for servicing. Too many to handle.
good,"Days are quick. Learned about collections, modifications, different investors, & Processing"
good,"But with the jobs shifting to India, the once great place to work, has severely deteriorated. Massive layoffs constantly and promotion of managers who have no business being managers. No social skills or ability to relate to their employees. Low pay for the job done."
good,"Easy place to work, good place to start up out of college. Good people to work with. Lots of opportunity."
good,"My current work schedule is from 7:30pm to 4pm Monday to Friday."
good,Nationstar gives recent graduates opportunities to learn the mortgage industry. Is a good starter job.
good,"A typical day at Nationstar consist of coaching, training and producing high quality underwrites. My role as a manager is to empower my underwriters to make decisions. I am there to interpret policies and procedures. I try and build a cultural of learning, team interaction and enjoyable day at work. My co-workers are committed to quality and being ""Great"" underwriters. I enjoy learning and getting involved in files to understand this picture around a person's credit, collateral and income. The hardest part of my job is making sure I give correct guidance."
good,I was good at the begining but things became very different after one year
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you helped someone better their financial situation.
good,"a typical day at work is busy and demanding, but can also be rewarding, knowing that you helped someone keep their home."
good,I learned alot about processing. need to work on how to comunicate with employees
good,"I had a profile of loans that I collected docs for and got prepared for underwriting and closing.  We worked all loans and had a QC department with strict regulations and guidelines.  I enjoyed my co-workers, as most day we were all we had to rely on for help.  Management was not always available and they were always changing the team leaders and managers.  Otherwise, I enjoyed the company and culture."
good,"A learning process; it is a team effort to get the job done, but a great company to get experience."
good,Loved my job and all the people on my team!!! I miss them all ;(
good,"Its a job not much room for growth, compensation was just enough to get by."
good,most enjoyable part is helping homeowners to save their home.
good,This employer was great on many levels.  Here I learned the fundamentals of the Mortgage Servicing Industry.  Technical skills were met by on the job training to say the least.
good,Great place to work.  Could have done a better job screening employees before hiring.
good,Nationstar Mortgage is a great place to excel within your career.
good,"Work day included high inbound call volume, managing a large pipeline and assisting customers with modifications, forbearance plans, short sales and deed in lieu propgrams. Had a great management team and fun, hard working co-workers. The hardest part of the job was managing the pipeline due to call volume. I enjoyed being able to help people with work out options."
good,Great if you wish to work in a call center environment. Room for advancement with minimal additional compensation. Enjoyable co-workers and effective upper management.
good,I currently work remote with Nationstar Mortgage and have recently been deployed into their Direct Lending department.
good,"It was not really well managed. Need alot of improvment.•	Maintained activities on all accounts and collected daily data in all delinquent accounts. "
good,The role allows for interaction with clients regulary at events and travel.
good,NSM combined HARP with Same Servicer Streamline mortgage to offer qualified loans unavailable anywhere else.  The immense popularity caused backlogs and delays.  Average close time was 3-4 months but some customers were still waiting at 13 months.  Processing was a mess because they were understaffed.  If customer had a 2nd lien add 7 months to processing.  Upper management (regional +) was a mess when rates dropped because we were swamped and compliants were everywhere.
good,"average job of employment , the productivity and fun is all about what you make of it..."
good,"Ok place to work until we got notice that the company was closing. Enjoyed the ppl I worked with, great ppl."
good,During my short time at nationstar I have been able to get more experience in the mortgage industry especially in dealing with irated customers.
good,Very supportive management staff. Co worker were very friendly. Hardest part of the job was using multi windows to perform job duties.
good,"The pay is average or less than average, The company is not on the same page with team work. Much push back from upper management."
good,"It is a young environment, everybody has an degree. Most mangers are cool. Good for new college graduates for experience"
good,Very professional environment that promotes meeting deadlines and quotas.
good,nothing wonderful...just a job. not easy to advance...you have to know someone. lots of jobs are going over seas....raises are minimal....and yearly.
good,"A normal workday in Document Execution is working 10 affidavits a day. Documents vary in difficulty but overall it's a welcomed challenge."
good,Nationstar was a stepping stone in my career. Nationstar allowed  me to learn many functions in the mortgage industry.
good,Laid off everyone in the company except a small number of people in the Texas Office
good,"Nationstar Mortgage is a good strong company, the Pay and benefits are great. My co workers are great which is a huge plus."
good,A typical day consist of talking to delinquent account holders coming up with solutions to help them stay in their homes. I have learned a very important life lesson of being patient and calm. Management consistently changes and rotates. Co-workers are mostly young and very diverse creating an upbeat and competitive environment. The hardest part of the job would be hearing how the families are about to lose their homes. The most enjoyable part of the job would be have the solution for help families stay in their homes.
good,Allows college grads to build strong work foundations for future careers.
good,-Collections is difficult
good,"Customer service is great to work in. But loss mitigation is very stressful and demanding>very difficult to reach goals if the customers cant pay, so you face a lot of foreclosures"
good,"I love the management style of my leadership. They were very laid back and knowledgeable, both were very helpful.  A typical day was very busy and fun at the same time."
good,A typical day is pretty busy.. from emails to phones and meetings.  The atmosphere was always live and upbeat.  Great place to start your career if you are a young adult.
good,"•	Addressed questions about insurance, taxes, and mortgages"
good,"Company offers professional opportunity and advancement options.  It is a growing entity, which is a positive for opportunity. "
good,"*busy days "
good,"My experience with this Company is mostly great, although my last year or so was dreadful, new upper management that was supposedly coming in to boost morale and  numbers unintentionally destroyed the trust of the group. Lack of respect between levels of management was evident. But my good outweighed my bad, just wish my total experience was good."
good,"there are several divisions within the company.  Has multiple pay schedules and bonuses.  worked in new business, refinance division and damage prevention."
good,Poorly managed  to many bosses not enough workers. Lots of meetings about what needs to be done but no one ever takes it to the next step. Limited availability  for movement  at our location.
good,"A typical day at work consist of me doing my daily task and other task if asked to do so. Here, we go by 3 core responses, and that is the 3 C's, which is Challenger, Cheerleader, and Champion. I learned that it takes a team effort to get the job done and succeed. "
good,"It is a call center so you are dealing with all types of customers. If you do not like call centers this is not the job for you. Other than that they are a great company to work for and have a cafeteria to purchase breakfast, lunch and dinner"
good,Thank you for the opportunity to make comments on my work with Nationstar Mortgage. My severance package refrains me from providing negative feedback on this employment experience.  I made some good friends and had some good experiences at NSM.  I continued to expand my leadership and business knowledge especially in the Originations business channel which I had only minimal exposure to previously.
good,"I have been with the company for almost 5 years now. They are going through some changes, which I hope will be for the better. Management is working on their communication skills, which is greatly needed. If you want to move up you definitely need to know the right people and be part of their inside clique. Otherwise you will overlooked no matter how great others tell you you are."
good,"Overall Nationstar is improving the work life balance. Although the shifting work schedules make it extremely difficult.  "
good,"Relax work place, management is concern about the personal growth of its employees. The company is growing at a fast rate and that can be worry some if the right people are not running things."
good,"Answer inbound calls, get on the dialer and make outbound calls, try to get borrowers approve for a modifications or a short sale. Process applications to make sure borrower have a complete packet."
good,not even management knew what was going on to let their  favorite pets they kept know what was going on
good,Easy place to work. Lacking organization and qualified management often resulting in miscommunication or no communication at all.
good,NSM has a growing portfolio but with that come a lot of system issues. They are very understanding but rarely allow you to move to  different position.
good,"No two days are the same with new challenges and goals to be completed daily.  Management is supportive and positive and co-workers are always willing to lend a hand and share information."
good,Great company with excellent people and excellent policies.
good,"Overall if you need a place were you can go in and bury yourself in so much work that will never get done you will feel at home."
good,• Identify learning and development opportunities through job analysis and regular consultation with business leaders.
good,It's a decent place to start working. The dept I am currently in is fairly new so it needed a lot of organization and is improving as time goes by. A lot of changes which I like because it keeps me busy. Not a long term work place. There are a lot of recent college graduates so its kind of like high school all over.
good,"PRO: Workplace culture is excellent with great people at Mr. Cooper. Lots of folks with great skills and knowledge!  "
good,"Work hard and it really pays off. Compensation is very fair and meets expectations; equal to other large mortgage corporations. There is room for growth or movement within the company but it can be difficult to attain. Stress levels get pretty high. Overall, not a bad place to be employed."
good,Led the Seterus data transfer from IBM Cloud to Mr. Cooper data centers. All data was transferred to S3 Cloud Object Storage. Coordinated with Krakow team for this data transfer.
good,I worked at Mr. Cooper for one year. I really liked the job culture and all of the managers. The application and interview process is pretty easy. They are very organized. The job culture is great too.
good,"The company is a good company to work for, it has good benefits an work environment. I would recommend the company as it has good advancement and opportunities."
good,Started out ok but had major layoffs in December 2018. many good loan officers leaving to other companies. management under a lot of pressure and it trickles down to the floor. not good lead qualify
good,"Good place to work and fair pay, but unstable as far as job security. Environment is friendly and quiet. only a few meetings a week(all to long). I would of stayed if not laid off."
good,"This company has a really great culture and the people that work there make it all the more better. This was my first job out of college. Really taught me the goods, the bads, and the in betweens about life in corporate America."
good,"Its a normal 10-6 job with chill culture.Learning curve is not that great and can be career affecting.The management will try solving issues but will take lot of time which will demoralize the employee."
good,"They were doing their best to change the workplace environment.They did do a lot of events for their employees, however, the management team needed to get involved more to understand the process from start to finish."
good,"Typical day: Non stop on the go "
good,"A handful of smart employees does most of the work. Poor culture. Company grew too fast! Trying to improve culture, but still has a long way to go. Compensation is good, but most people are still not happy."
good,The company is good for building experience in the mortgage servicing industry. They like hiring recent graduates regardless of degree focus and offer ample opportunities for training in order to help with knowledge base which can be used in furthering your career ambitions.
good,"I enjoy my job and level of opportunities, the flexibility and  moral from my manager"
good,My work day starts off with me returning all missed calls from the previous day.  Following up with management regarding my pipeline and which files will be closing.  The hardest part of my job is the long hours throughout the week that I work.  The most enjoyable is the wonderful work environment and the rewards for closing multiple loans.
good,A typical day is to come in and dig right into your portfolio and start finding loans that are eligble to be processed and start making calls to borrowers to receive necessary documents.  The most enjoyable part of processing is to hear the satisfaction from the borrowers that you have helped.
good,"average, it is good to be with good and very knowledgeable staff at Nation Star. Love the people I work with."
good,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing your emails, pipeline, prioritizing the work load for the day.  Working with customers, loan officers and vendors to process and close the loan."
good,"Once the company became public, a big shift in culture was developing."
good,Excellent pay and company benefits. Working here I learned alot and this was a great learning experience.
good,"Nationstar is a good company, growing rapidly and offering great opportunities if one is willing to take them."
good,"Consistent rotary dial mortgage collections, job is typically focused on collections and incentives by that. If you deal well with people cussing and hanging up, it may be good for you. Yet, it may be better now that the housing industry has changed. Most people had lived in their homes for months without paying, and the assignment was to collect payment, attempt to modify, or  send them to foreclosure. Leave your morales at home."
good,I enjoyed the team I was assigned to work on we all worked very hard .
good,"-extensive background in training, management, and project management"
good,Sr. Level management was efficient in regards to competitive pricing and the extension of opportunities to borrowers.  The opportunities to grow with the company were plentiful.
good,"Fun - Culture of this company is outstanding. Lots of social events and sports leagues. Upper Management takes workplace rapport seriously."
good,You are unable to advance or move on to other departments as a manager. Managers are not compensated how they should be we should. The industry pays more than what Nationstar does
good,"Good place to work as a starter or entry level job. You will get the opportunity to learn new skills if you asset yourself."
good,Typical work day would be talking to customers helping them understand the mortgage industry and how it impacts them. The culture is great as everyone is easy to work with.
good,"A typical day at work was always busy and never a dull moment. Since my department was production driven, managers would really have to work for their money. Team was great, management was great, and money was great!"
good,Very nice and productive work environment. Challenging work. easy to interact with peer. cooperative management. Helping team members to achieve their goal. Nice work benefit.
good,Decent Company. Not a long term career company. Company is getting more organized.  Management is ok. There is opportunity to grow. Company often times has the right foot not knowing what the left foot is doing and systems used are antiquated.
good,"Nationstar Mortgage LLC, is a good company to work for, for a person that does not have a family to provide for and that are not looking for growth or advancement within the company."
good,"Growing..opportunities. "
good,Good company but will let you go if you don't performed.    The S.V.P seem very detached from the employees he lead.   Our V.P had an open door policy and very personable.   It was good while it lasted but when it come to closing down shop they are too cut throat.
good,"Mr. Cooper/Nationstar Mortgage has been a great experience. I have been working here basically since I graduated from college. This company helped me grow up and mature. I am better with decision making and know how to keep my personal life separated from work. The culture is fun and amazing. For the most part, it is pretty laid back. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help everyone. Though, when I can't help people it is for the business needs."
good,"great place, and nice staff members, the breaks and lunches were really nice and balanced. I also got along with many people at the job and they were really caring and helpful people."
good,Training was given. You did sit side by side with another employee and listened to the type of calls that you would encounter in an effort to help delinquent mortgagor's save their home.
good,good culture but management needs more experience in order to make better decisions.  Still in growing pains and some processes are not well defined and has caused attrition
good,You basically go in to work and get straight on the phones and start calling borrowers for eight hours. Its really not as bad as it sounds very positive place to work at with a great atmosphere.
good,"2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. "
good,Good culture all around at the jobsite but the phone work is very redundant and boring
good,growing company with room for opportunity. i worked with fun and good people. they encouraged activities for employees to get involved in etc.
good,Good place to work and learn. Team building based fast pace and very accommodating too employees.
good,Worked in Foreclosure and was very busy working in several different states.   We had many different state requirements that had to be met before taking the property to foreclosure sale.
good,"I was a senior loan processor and also a SME (subject matter expert), the most enjoyable part was the family-friendly environment. I did relocate with the company which was a great experience."
good,It was an awesome place to work. They have tried to revamp the corporate culture inside the office and succeeded for the most part. I personally loved everyone I worked with and was determined to not let them fail.
good,typical day is 8:00 to 5:00. Management is awesome. Training is normally done on one on one basis. Friendly atmosphere. growth opportunities eventually come the longer you stay with the company.
good,I really enjoyed the work environment and  how hard-working employees were acknowledged and rewarded for going the extra mile. Mr. Cooper is a great company to work for.
good,"The pay is great, benefits are great, not much learned from company, poorly managed. would not recommend, but again it was worth the pay to deal with all the problems"
good,but some of the management played favorites. people with less time hired in were promoted quickly over some that had been there a longer time and had more experience
good,"Mr. Cooper is a good place to work. There are things that tend to be frustrating, same as any other company. Management is good and very supportive. I enjoy Mr Cooper, and my overall experience has been wonderful, there are however limitations to pay increases."
good,If it’s your first job out of college it is a great opportunity. Learn as much as possible and leave there is way more money out there that they are not willing to give.
good,"Good place to work. no additional comments"
good,"A typical day starts at 6:30 a.m.  I review emails and address any possible issues. I the meet with mortgage professionals whose pipeline I manage.  I review any problem issues with them and assist them with questions or problems they may have.  I then generally check in with my manager who identifies any pertinent issues or problem areas I need to address."
good,"good incentives, games and more..."
good,"It was a good place to work, I was a remote underwriter (loved being remote), management I answered to was great. If I needed a question answered, a person was always available."
good,Loved the fast pace production atmosphere. My peers were great. There were a ton of opportunities to input process flows in the business.
good,"Fun place to work but not much opportunity for advancement. The money was not great and the salary is below industry standards. If you need a job ASAP or going to night school, this job is for you."
good,Fun company to work for. This was the start of my career in the banking industry. I learned a lot in regards to the mortgage loan service while working a NationStar.
good,"Worked for the company for a short time. Good company to work for, good work schedule. Good work environment and management is always willing to listen"
good,It is a good place if not needing a high income. They pay over minimum wage but not enough to support a family. There were some practices that were unethical by some employees that did slip by.
good,typical day at work would be mild in stress trying to help everyone achieve their targets. Everyone was friendly at Mr. Cooper's from coworkers to management.
good,Good place to work at. Always busy with phone calls and special projects. Not to difficult to move up in the company. Company took care of there employees with prizes and weekly goals to met on the weekly and monthly basis. Management are well train to coach the employees to succeed.
good,"It is a grind. It is long hours. "
good,"Learning curve is good, always management motivate everyone to learn because they dont have any new projects to make u busy. ;)"
good,None i do not have a specific review for this company or the work i did. The compensation was very good until they layed off 120 people. It has been a problem for me and my three kids.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Mr. Cooper.  I learned a lot about the mortgage servicing industry and from the people on my team.  The company had a diverse work culture, good work-life balance but my whole team was cut in a RIF on May 1."
good,"Job is Accountant in title. There are no accounting task included in the job - reconciling, posting journal entries, month-end close, etc.... Just pulling foreclosed loan balances and reviewing against insurance claims."
good,"Good people with in the company. Fun place to work if only the pay was a little better. You will process about 5 to 6 loans completely on a daily average, reviewing a total of bout 25 loans within the pipeline."
good,The workplace was very fast paced.  They company does try to treat the employees like family and create a balanced work environment.  The company consistently recognized the achieving employees.
good,"I worked at Nationstar Mortgage full-time (More than a year)"
good,New hires typically work collections or customer service. Pretty easy to move within the company. Usually management is decent but there are some managers that are completely incompetent. Company strives to hold events for employee appreciation.
good,i enjoyed my experience working with nationstar take their time to teach you the ropes also offers fulltime work. Some of the staff can work on being a little more kind to others.
good,Worked long hours but management team always there to assist in anyway.  Training always available upon request.  Good vacation and benefits
good,I worked as a customer service agent.  My job was to take in coming calls to customers with questions regarding their mortgage accounts.  I would process payments and answer questions such as their payoff amounts and escrow. Management is one my must enjoyable part of the job teaching others and helping my co-workers understand their job.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to cross train on a new job I wanted to learn.
good,Xome provides several company sponsored events. These events allow you to meet and discuss potential growths of the company and its various departments.
good,"Great manager, always helped as best he could. Getting goals met and helping customers always made the day fly by. Great team work always striving for the best."
good,"Great place to work at. The atmosphere, culture and your coworkers make it enjoyable. No one is a stranger there.  Always brings a smile to people"

good,"The work environment at Nationstar is great along with senior management who hear our voices. Also, I love the passion they have for their employees."
good,I stay busy all day. I have learn to prioritize my work and do what I can. Since we are short staff I have been doing two peoples jobs. I enjoy the people I work with but at times I feel like is to much work.
good,I stay busy all day. Sometimes is to much work so organization and prioritizing is a most. We are short staff and at times I feel like I am doing two peoples jobs. Over all my coworkers are fun to be and that is what makes it not be as bad.
good,"Make outbound calls to those delinquent, receive inbound calls to assist those who have questions/concerns about accounts"
good,"Typical day is normal..."
good,"Typical day of work was spent checking emails, returning customer calls, processing mortgage loans, working with underwriters, closers and funders to make sure loans were completed in timely manner. "
good,Typical day at work was the processing and closing of HARP loans.  I enjoyed the ability to help people keep their homes with a payment they could afford.  It was one of the most rewarding positions I ever had.
good,"I worked about 55 hours a week there, the work days were filled with making and receiving calls, as well as, answering emails and working through all the computer systems. The management and staff there were agreeable.The hardest part of the job came when interest rates went way up so that it was hard to refinance. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers safe a lot of money on refinances."
good,"Good work experience, learned a lot about the mortgage industry. Enjoyed my peers,"
good,"•Handling Fannie Mae Mortgage Loan Accounts"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of completing a collection call lists between the hours of 8:30am-11:00am. The call lists contained anywhere from 100-150 accounts daily. We were required to take loan applications over the phone as well as set arrangements on accounts for customers who had difficulty making payments on their accounts. I learned how to manage accounts, how to accurately pull and read a credit report and how to resolve customer issues meanwhile making the customer feel confident in my ability to resolve their issues. I worked for the company for about a year and a half and during that time, I had 4 different managers. I will say that I had the best work environment with the last manager I worked with. The hardest part of the job was collections. It is difficult to get a person to comply with the contracts they've signed as far as making on time monthly payments, which then affected our deliquency reports at the end of the month. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting,interacting, helping, and building relationships with the customers. It felt good to be able to relieve a little of their stress due to whatever financial difficulty they were experiencing"
good,"Fun, fast paced, energetic group."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Learning a lot of experience in the mortgage field particulary pertaining to Underwriting and Processing.
good,"Good company to work with and make a career with. Tons of potential to move up within the company. A typical work day consisted of taking in-bound phone calls all day, taking applications of potential borrowers for refinances."
good,"Production environment with expansion and growth from 1,500 employees in 2011 to over 7,000 employees in 2013 through assets and acquisition. Proven successfull strategy in mortgage servicing and corporate leadership. As growth levels, the environment will transition from reactive to a planning and strategic alliance from a employee growth and opportunity perspective."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, good work environment. Company likes to hire recent college grads.  "
good,Everyone very helpful.  They need to be more environmentally conscious - LOTS of paper - need to work towards going paperless.  Most management were helpful and supportive.  Provided information when requested.
good,Depending on what department you work with in Nationstar you might not like it. My department works weekends when it is month end this includes Sunday's.
good,"I am a foreclosure prevention specialist. A typical day involves making about 100-125 calls, inbound and outbound, to delinquent borrowers to attempt to obtain a workout instead of foreclosure. The majority of the employees are in the mid to late 20's. It is a fun atmosphere, but the job can be a bit monotonous at times. It is nice to help people out, but being cursed at for doing your job can be a bit upsetting. It is not a difficult job for the amount of money and bonuses paid."
good,"Nationstar Mortgage is a national mortgage lender and servicer. We originate mortgages directly to consumers through our call center located in Lewisville, TX, as well as through our Wholesale Lending and Distributed Retail Channels."
good,The most important part of my job here was the customer service skills I showed and gained while working here. Some customers were very hard to deal with but the number one goal was helping these individuals out and stopping foreclosures on their homes.
good,"Pros: Free online development classes, flexible schedule depending on the department, and 401K match. Cons: The insurance is high and they are restructuring. The diversity groups provide employees with an opportunity to network and interact with employees from a variety of departments."
good,"Learned a lot"
good,"Overall experience working for MrCooper was positive. Medical benefits package could be better, but 401K match, PTO, discounts and corporate employee appreciation events were great!  Leadership at times could be mute to needs of employees, but with culture shift being promoted, it was slowly improving.  Advancement opportunities were slim in certain departments and failed leaders who were working hard towards upward mobility in the company.  Hopefully, these would be improved upon, which will continue to make MrCooper one of the better servicers to work for."
good,"It's a decent place to work and the culture is usually positive, however there is too many constant changes. Usually it's going one direction and all of a sudden it decides to make a sharp left into another direction. They have an overall goal but it feels like they're not entirely sure about the smaller goals that lie underneath. Overall it's not a bad company to work for."
good,"Although I left NS voluntarily, it was for the mere fact of working closer to home with the opportunity to become remote. NS is where I received my underwriter training and am grateful for that.  At times the employee became non existent compared to the work volume.  At times it was difficult to take time off. Overall was a good company to work for"
good,I’ve worked with the company for over 3 years and they have improved so much since I started years ago. The changes are for the good of the company and for the employees.
good,This company shows a lot of favoritism. They tend to tweek the scorecards for a few people they like who perform below standards to make it look as if they are meeting requirements.
good,"overall - good place to work. Typical day make 50-100 calls -collect on past due mortgage loans. "
good,"Very challenging "
good,"A typical day at Assurant is a fun filled day. With working with the Nationstar project it gave me the opportunity to really help customers with major issues they were having in the loss draft department. I learned existing half of the mortgage business when a disaster happens. In the work place i have meet co-workers on the phones for over 5 years due to their choice. The hardest part of the job is telling someone they will have to wait to get the funds to rebuild their home. The enjoyable part to me, is helping each customer with their issues and showing them that there is still hope and people that care."
good,"Terrific company and one of the few out there that will invest serious time and money into the training of their staff. "
good,"Great company except for when I received ""Outstanding"" on my yearly review I only received a 2.5% raise.  Everyone works at least 50+ hours a week and more and more people are leaving due to the poor raises, the work load and the poor benefits which places a greater strain on the rest of us.  Looking to find another company that treats employees like people.  Management is great but upper echelon management does not understand that if you want to keep great people, you need to ensure you have a big enough work staff and give them decent raises, benefits and a well-balanced work/life."
good,"First time in mortgage and learned a lot. Management is willing to help and develop reps and motivates growth! I come in do my job and go home, no micro managing but if assistance is needed it is provided."
good,"I currently work here. My peers are great to work with and I've developed close friendships with many of them. Even my immediate managers are a fun group of people. They're as laid back as they're allowed to be, but the problem is that upper management cracks whips too much and too often. Micromanagement never makes for a happy employee, but here at Nationstar, micromanagement is rampant. There is always something the upper management is in an uproar about, and it is always sudden, never gradual. Upper management is very reactionary, and it makes the job of a floor level representative very stressful."
good,"The technology part was great, training was mostly on the job , that I consider in this case was good. Not very much opportunities for advancement"
good,"great place nice people, you get to learn about the bussiness"
good,I feel I've been processing for years and is very good a my job.  I feel management feels the same but is holding me back from being promoted to another position.
good,they could have stopped giving out free plates & plastic ware to keep their employees.  teams were spread apart with lack of communication
good,"Not enough hours in the day to complete what you want, lots of work. Co-workers are friendly."
good,Good place to work at. I have learned allot since I have been working here. Management is great and support employees and great team environment.
good,"That is it simply, Nationstar is good for someone with a recent college degree. That is it."
good,Typical day:  processing loans.  I learned to have patience.  My manager was very supportive.  My co-workers were great.  The hardest part of the job was having nothing to do.  The most enjoyable of the job were my co-workers.
good,Nationstar is a good company to work for if you have the patience to deal with angry customers at all times of the day.
good,•Process and save data to the AS/400 system nightly
good,Work is silo-ed so you don't get a good feel of the company's operations as a whole. You face the similar challenges day in and day out which is good for learning your job.
good,"The Company as a whole had a number of opportunities for advancement, and in most cases I would say they were given to deserving employees, but if you do not fit a certain mold, even with qualifying credentials, you would be overlooked. However they have not created the opportunity where you can actually earn that potential by doing necessary training and testing to earn certifications that will allow you to move up on your own Strength."
good,Open minded company with support of a work/life balance that can be imperative to employees lives. Consistent company communication around internal and external progress.
good,"Their culture is changing more and will continue to get better. It's tough to get promoted, but the coworkers make the job better. Hardest part of the job would be cutoffs and month ends. Most enjoyable part would be the team builder events and after work hours events."
good,Had major layoffs in December right before Christmas. Micro managing like crazy. Few sales managers even got demoted. Benefits are excellent. My peers are fun and got to hang out with them outside of work
good,"I have enjoyed working for Mr.Cooper/Nationstar Mortgage, but the department I'm in does not have room for growth at this time.  If I had to do it again, I would jump at the opportunity, but I'm ready for the next level and they have no where for me to go at this time.."
good,"1.) Good Benefits "
good,I worked there for about 2 years and overall i had a great experience there. Management was great and coworkers were great. Each team felt very much like a family with monthly potlucks. They had alot of great things about them.
good,I started as my first corporate job and had a good experience.  I was given good training and tools for advancement.  I was laid off with the mortgage market crash.
good,"Mr. Cooper is a good place to work. They care about their employees and offer many incentives. There is ongoing training but limited information in regards to the work. The training just gives you the basic information and then you are expected to take the calls. For example trained in Escrow, which is very in dept, although you still have no idea how to help the customer. Since the training did not prepare you for the actual situation. There are people to help when you are able to get the help."
good,"Good personal experience. It always helps when you have a good manager. Work needs to be aligned with the dept goals and company goals. Feedbacks do come, but would prefer little more frequency."
good,I am not certain how the current environment is now as they were in the process of changing to higher loan number requirements for bonus and less time allowed for processing.  It was always a very fast paced workplace but as their requirements changed there seemed to be a bigger change in relationships between Underwriting and Processing.  It caused a lot of strain between these two groups and the managers had different ways of dealing with it.  I think they need a better way of communicating between the two groups.
good,Mr. Cooper was very a good place to work.  There were opportunities to grow and advance your career.  Culture allowed for a decent work/life balance..
good,Great management team and opportunity to grow. The training is very thorough. The culture is overall a laid back environment. You are running your own business so you have to be motivated to come in and work the necessary hours.  Make sure youkeep life balance.
good,I should have NEVER left this place. The grass is always greener on the other side. I haven’t been satisfied or stable in any position since I left this company to work for a competitive company. I only saw dollar signs when I left to go somewhere else. I’ve learned my lesson. Great company. The health insurance benefits are high & too many people gossiping about others are probably the worst about this company.
good,I learned a lot and worked with great people. I had some awesome managers.The pay was good and they care about their employees. Many days we worked late but were provided lunch and/or dinner. It was a team/family atmosphere.
good,"Laid back atmosphere, Game areas available. Everyone is nice and willing to answer any questions you might have. VP's are always trying to stay involved and listen to your concerns."
good,It's a good environment and there is opportunity but that lessens the higher you advance.  You can gain a lot of experience here but sometimes that is better leveraged elsewhere
good,"The culture and overall feeling at Nationstar is that it is not one the large mortgage companies that are stuck in their ways and arent afraid of challenging common practices. This of course has its advantages and drawbacks but was a great experience. I appreciate the experienced individuals and diversity on campus. It was a rare thing and seen in both the headquarters and in call center locations."
good,Good people to work with at the elma location friendly atmosphere and nice area would love to keep working there however for economic reasons Nationstar is closing the Elma Site
good,"Great entry level and starting pay / benefits. Company was rapidly growing while I was there. Rapid chancell for advancement ifnmanage,entry liked you."
good,Getting to assist individuals with escalated mortgage situations was very fufilling.The culture was very diverse and enjoyable to work along other individuals with the same intentions on helping others
good,I enjoyed my journey and  working experience here at natoinstar. There's a lot of perks and the family culture is so special . The mamagment team is amazing.
good,There are multiple offices which causes issues within departments. The company continues to work towards creating a better workplace.
good,"Good work culture, allows remote working for unavoidable situation, flexible working hours, having very competent team of technical architects"
good,It is a siloed company through new acquisition.  Senior leadership needs to invest in education of employees.  A commitment needs to be made to the review process as well
good,"I worked in the Processing pool at first. I was requested to work on Special Projects. I was requested to correct Subordination Agreements and get them sent to county offices. I would be their Notary when needed. I then went to Document Analyst to find mistakes in any recording issues. I had a lot of chances to learn about different phases a mortgage goes through in the process of time. "
good,"Good company to work for; busy, but easy going, fun to work environment, lots of perks, company events, everyone is friendly and willing to assist."
good,I get along very well with my co-workers. Getting the numbers management sets.  I am very busy which makes my day go by faster.
good,I work as a foreclosure specialist at a mortgage company. I assist law firms with the process of residential foreclosure while trying to manage a timeline of events set in place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It can be difficult to balance and manage the tasks of the day based on a specific timeframe.
good,"My daily routine consisted on placing outbound calls an receiving inbound calls from customers, real estate agents, and attorneys, in order to find a resolution to keep customers from losing their homes to foreclosure. I assisted other agents with questions they may have regarding their positions and how to help them become proficient in their jobs as well.  I worked well with the management teams, and would often be given additional tasks to assist. My management team and co workers would use me as their ""go to"" person in difficult situations, and knew that I would take the time to find a resolution. the hardest part of my job, was knowing that there were certain situations, where our customers could not be helped, due to their situation, the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that others counted out me to be able to help them achieve their goals, and also knowing that I was respected by management and a good source of information when others weren't sure. My management team allowed me to assist with other projects and pilot programs to provide feed back on new services. I felt that my potential was acknowledged and overall loved the staff that I worked with."
good,Great place to gain mortgage experience! Soak up as much knowledge as you can and this is a great spring board for a career in the mortgage industry
good,"Great Place to Work. Good Compensation. Short Work Cycle."
good,Expect pains of moving from small shop to large shop. Overall good place to work: good people looking to move in the right direction.
good,"But probably not the best place to stay long term, they typically will not pay you market value for your experience. The typically employee there will stay get experience and then leave to seek advancement and a market rate salary."
good,Little advancement opportunities. Nice place to get your feet wet.
good,"Company takes employee satisfaction very seriously. From a management perspectiv it can be difficult to get work done due to the constant celebrating or planning the next event."
good,"Great entry position for beginner MLO. They will pas for test, you get 2 tries and paid to study. Call center environment so you are tied to the desk, but it helps practice MLO discipline"
good,"Enjoy working with fellows, flexible working hours and fun place to work. Room to enhance your skills. Supervisor are cooperative and caring. Health coverage is good and 401k plan is excellent."
good,"Mr  Cooper was a good job dealing with mortgages can be difficult tasks to say the least, but mr. cooper gives you all the tools to succeed. I learned a lot working there"
good,I did not like the way they take the reverse mortgage homes from the elderly foke the are sick or in the hospital without them knowing whats going on that was heart wrenching .
good,The environment is really fun. The company is great about setting up events to make the environment fun and friendly. The management is very approachable and truly wants to help you succeed. Their is a lot of change and growth taking place lately and it's led to some disorganization and the need for a lot of flexibility and patience of the employees.
good,"This company isn't bad to work for, good pay, enjoyable coworkers, and full benefits. However, if you are wanting to work your way up to a senior position you would need to relocate."
good,"Mr Cooper was a great place to work especially sinse I started I didnt have mortgage experience. The problem was the training and management, Even though on my team it was relayed to us that we were team orianted but this was untrue as everything revolved around what you did you for the team, and pretty cutthroat in the amt of loans you would process compared to submitting but Im guessing this is the industry. Unless you know someone its very difficult to move up and alot of my coworkers were pretty unprofessional. I did like the fact that you were given a job and if you did it you wouldnt be bothered much. You got to pick your schedule and overtime was available. The benifits were great. I would recommend this place for mortgage experience."
good,"I'm an early bird, so again there early get a lot done before othere arrive to work.   Would help train a new person, would answer questions for co-workers if they needed help.  Work enviroment quiet.  Most enjoyable, the pitch - ins.  (Just because)."
good,"There are different avenues within the company if you are willing to work hard. The work-life balance is also not too bad, with flexibility on how you get your hours."
good,"Mr. Cooper is a fun and active place to work on the surface, but the employee engagement initiatives seem to take precedence over actual work. My desire is to work with individuals that want to be at work every day and want to improve themselves. It's apparent that the majority of the individual contributors, and even some of the management level employees, are simply there to collect a paycheck. The company could be so much more than it is now but there is a lack of accountability."
good,"The managers try and keep the work place fun. Fast passed, none stop phone time, lake of help when needed, no manager wants to take a sup call if needed and all will tell you they cant take it. Angry customers all the time."
good,Great Place to learn the business - Training could be more often. The pay is more than you will get anywhere else. You will also do more than you have to at other places. You will essentially junior underwrite the file before submission.
good,"The work is laid back with high expectations in your production. great employee and good manager. we have so many team lunch and activities per month. In addition, upper management tend to rent the whole 6 flags for us for a day not to mention the top golf as well."
good,It continues to be a productive and relax workplace as the company grows. The mostable enjoyable part of the job is learning new processes and systems.
good,"You are given every opportunity to produce, and you must produce. Who wants to go into work and not make money though, right? Call-center environment with a laxed dress code which is really nice. Your individual manager will determine your work experience with this company. They all have their own way of getting stuff done, so if that doesn't line up with your personal style, you could run into some issues."
good,Nationstar is a great place to get some experience as Nationstar promotes an autonomous way to reach everyone's potential. They have plenty of opportunities to get experience and will train you as well.
good,"I have a brief tenure with NSM, they bought my prior company and we are closing the facility in August. the work atmosphere was great as was the salary but I did not have enough time there for a full comprehensive review/opinion"
good,Excellent company for entry level mortgage positions. Chance for rapid advancement and career growth. Very large company with vastly larger operations than original footprint. Many changes and organization rearrangements offer both stress and opportunity. Great working culture.
good,liked learning something new in mortgage but was laid off and could not find work for a long time. flexible hours and make up time
good,The job taught how to deal with different people and how to adapt to different issues.  The company is always trying to improve itself by training its representatives monthly.
good,Nationstar is a great entry level job to help one build an understanding of a corporate environment.  Once you grow into management establishing bonds with other departments and people is essential to keep moving up.
good,"The processing department Is very cut throat and all about production, which is understandable. If you are not production.  If you do not produce you will be gone. As far as the 6 week training they teach you about the system but not how to actually how to process, which you really have to pick up in OJT with minimal assistance."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty fast paced. Responsible for making approx100 calls per day, incoming and outgoing calls. Collecting payments, making payment arrangement, and accounts resolution. I learn so much each day from co-workers and customers all the time. The management is great. They are always there to help. The hardest part of the job is that there may be times you're not able to make a first call resolution. Most enjoyable part is meeting customer needs."
good,"This company also has great benefits and pay. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Nationstar.  They had a good work environment where everyone was respected and you could discuss differences openly.  The focus was on teamwork and getting the job done, which we did."
good,Great company to be apart of it's very difficult to get in the company because the mostly hire people they know or that they worked with at a previous company.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, but the nature of the job is stressful. Upper management is detached from the lower level workers. Other departments do not handle their responsibility properly. People are poorly promoted from within and should be trained more and evaluated by their talent for the job not their time with the company. Some team leaders are great people and try really hard to make you comfortable and work efficiently."
good,I would work with borrowers on the phone to avoid foreclosure. I worked out plans to help a borrower determine the best decision to avoid foreclosure. I also start the liquidation process if that was best for our borrower.
good,"Management very supportive. Good company to work for. Some weekend work during the end of month, Co-workers were helpful."
good,"Nationstar is a great place to work. Leadership at Nationstar understands the technology issues and are addressing it. The company has a huge servicing portfolio, upwards of 450 billion, which aids the mortgage professionals in doing a lot of refinance business."
good,Nationstar is an up and coming company with wonderful opportunity for advancement
good,"This is a true call center.  Leads and customer calls are sent into the department based on number of staffed mortgage professionals to cover calls and assist clients.   "
good,Saving the Company money by contacting accounts and negotiating deals with clients for non performing loans.
good,"review emails, check in docs, approved Hud-1, release docs to escrow, fund loans, answer phone calls, send conditions to escrow, follow up on final hud-1 review and approved."
good,I enjoy my job and love the environment and people. Management is really laid-back and family-like. My co-workers are like family.
good,"Nationstar hired me right when I graduate from college. That is one of their biggest focal points when hiring someone to work for them. I am part of the referral team of the Foreclosure department. We are the final step of the referral process before the loan goes into the foreclosure timeline. What I do is review what the associates in India does ad make sure they are not making any critical errors on their processes. The work environment is good; the management team always do something once a month for the floor to let everyone take a break from work for an hour or so, the coworkers are all friendly, and the company loves to hire from within. The pay is not glamorous but the benefits package is good. It's a solid job if you're a recent grad and need a job."
good,"The job pays well and the job security (while I was there for 1.5 years) was great.  It's a fairly easy job, but it gets redundant fast. If you are someone who constantly wants a challenge and learn new things you will become tired of this job in 12 months, but with that being said it isn't too stressful or difficult of a job and pays an upwards of 32k a year with 401k, medical/dental insurance plans."
good,"Very good place to work, an expanding company with lots of opportunities. I have learnt new systems. My co-workers are an easy fun group to work with."
good,"Nice people, good place for growth, free lunches at times but then you get a short lunch."
good,"I actually worked for Xome the sister company, but they have the same goals and ethics. all together a great place of employment. benefits, a family friendly."
good,The best part of working here was the people they assembled. We were a very diverse group and we had a lot of fun! Truly loved everyone in our department.
good,"This company has a great culture, good work life balance, and solid managers. Employees are typically treated well and not just a number on the payroll."
good,"The company is good. Better if you work in marketing/brand- not to be confused with marketing originations. Remote flexibility, relaxed atmosphere. Hard - a lot of work sometimes, but you absolutely have support and can tell upper levels when it’s too much or things are unrealistic. Marketing/brand specific. The rest of the company seems kind of standard for the industry"
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, in my years with the company I learned a lot from additional departments and was able to use that knowledge in my position. Manager did not micromanage team which allowed us the opportunity to focus on our work. Did not receive regular feedback from manager as I was meeting and exceeding goals."
good,A typical work day for me sometimes is a light day and sometimes can be challenging because my work load isn't the same from day to day.  I work very closely with management with my day to day job duties.  The hardest part of my job is having to figure new tasks that are given instead of being trained.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my co workers and my manager and just knowing how to do my job very well.  My manager doesn't micro manage and she's very flexible when it comes to situations.
good,"Mr. Cooper is a relaxed environment but hard work and dedication is required for success. Mr. Cooper stands by their core values of ""being a challengers of convention, champions for our customers, and cheerleaders for our team"". It is a fair place to work and asks that you give your best in return."
good,This was a very tough job but an amazing learning experience. I was able to advance in the company very quickly and learned a lot about. It was collects and foreclosure protection so it was sometimes a hard call.
good,"Always trying to improve employee satisfaction, the company rules are easy to understand. flexible with employees with hours when needed (i.e. doctor appointments)."
good,Salary isn't the best in comparison to other companies. Not a bad place to work. They show a lot of appreciation to their employees. I just wish they were more competitive with their pay.
good,"Work is laid back. I learned the back end work of Escrow, mortgage documents and managing an offshore vendor. Friendly environment. Difficult for promotion unless you have a good relationship with the department leaders."
good,"The culture is fantastic. Company goes to great lengths to connect & interact with the employees. Lots of helpful, friendly people that seem to truly believe in Teamwork. The Management is constantly working to improve processes, relationships and workflow. The environment is Bright, cheerful, and positive!"
good,"MR Cooper a great company to work for, Great managers that not only care for you while at work but also away from work..very understanding just a great place to work."
good,This is a great place to work my experience was top notch and I got to spend time at the Dallas office and the Phoenix office also I would recommend them
good,"My Job  was challenging and rewarding at the same time. I researched missing and misapplication of mortgage payments. A typical day would be research and find. The hardest part of the job was handing over work to another department and waiting to finalize the research. The most enjoyable part of my job was my manager,  and co-workers that made the job the best!!!!!"
good,The customer service position is smooth. Not much demand and help is available when needed. The environment is relaxed and they provide food often so that is a bonus
good,"Nationstar provided great training, benefits and a great work environment.  I was educated in escrow servicing and call enter skills. A typical day was high-paced yet fun.  We were encouraged to socialize with co-workers outside the work place."
good,Great workplace and environment. Great pay and incentives. Management is somewhat hands off and the company provides excellent training. PTO days are also included upon employment.
good,I like it except that i had to leave my home to stay in Dallas for almost a year which at the end didn't make any economic sense. At a point it became too stressful managing 2 homes and i had to quit.
good,"Nationstar Mortgage "
good,"they would have lunch parties or group lunches. bonuses for sales. weekends off. 401k, health benefits. vacation for sales goals. you get to help people in need (subprime lender)"
good,A typical day at work would be to either assist a borrower with their reverse mortgage or assist with the borrowers family if the borrower was deceased.
good,I've had great experiences with all of the companies I have worked for... It's been unfortunate that throughout the years layoffs have occurred that causes a change in where I've worked.  nothing but love in all of my companies I've worked for.
good,"It's very fun workplace, the people you work with is actually what keeps you coming to work. I have worked this company for 13 years and so therefore I like working for the company because they care about their employees, however here in Customer Service it's very hard to move into new position."
good,I enjoyed working here. I worked for good management. The work was compensatory for the pay. It is a good place to work. I would work there again.
good,Nationstar has completed several changes over the last twelve month to rebrand themselves in the mortgage industry.  They have retrained the employees to insure the rebranding is successful.  This company is definitely a good place to work for and the people are amazing.
good,In order to get your work done in a timely manner you will have to work a lot of overtime at times of the time it's unlimited the compensation is good. The only thing is lack of communication from upper management kind a like the blind leading the blind overall it's a decent company to work for. Keep in mind the mortgage Industry is up-and-down at times
good,"The company was a great company to work with, very good benefits and compensation.  The work culture was very good and did not allow much time to work on own accounts.  The management was very strict but very supportive.  Overall I would love to still be working for the company"
good,It is a young-cultured place and many friendships can be built there. The co-workers are excellent and knowledgeable of their assignments. The most challenging aspect of the job is learning to keep up with the fast-paced environment such as covering multiple accounts with many demanding characteristics to each account.
good,"Position was a relatively new position with little policies and procedures in place,  so was a great opportunity for growth and creativity."
good,Job is a great place to begin career out of school. interactive staff and good place overall to grow and develop career in specific area.
good,I worked payment processing; posting payments to account and reviewing account status. This was a temp assignment I floated from department to department. The positions I held while there were from foreclosure/ bankruptcy review to data entry. The environment was wonderful. Management and co-workers were always willing to help. The hardest part was this was not a permanent position which meant no benefits.
good,"Good experience for a fresh graduate who wants to get their feet with financials, but requires a lot of customer service and patience. Scheduled hours can make home/work life balance a bit difficult because sometimes you do have to work late and on weekends."
good,"As a Fee Manager, I'm constantly partnering with Vendor Management, Legal, and Compliance so that fees are aligned correctly.  Quarterly, I audit closed loans to ensure that fees that were quoted correctly.  I also keep up with ALLregs and Doc Magic updates."
good,"Very busy."
good,"Job Security"
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. Management was very helpful, and respectable to their employees. The work environment was very pleasant and drama free."
good,I have learned much about the mortgage profession at Aurora/Nationstar. Enough to know that I enjoy my job and I like what I do
good,"Good company to work for. They do not micromanage, they allow you to just come in and do your job.  The employees are very helpful."
good,Learning something new everyday. Busy all the time makes day advance quickly.
good,Nationstar Mortgage was an excellent work place to gain knowledge and skills for an entry level employee. I learned many things while on the job with Nationstar. I had a great group of co-workers and enjoyed the team environment and company culture.
good,"competitive workplace, friendly atmosphere. learned how to manage people and provide constructive feedback."
good,I was an Fannie Mae Account Manager responsible for 40 million dollars worth of accounts
good,"Good work environment, they like to have fun but stay on top of work at the same time. Just do the job they ask you to do and everything will go smoothly."
good,12pm to 9pm fast pace and rewarded for your efforts and professional astomphere.
good,"A typical day at Nationstar invovles coming in and assessing the work load for the day. We would process delinquant loans for modificaiton options, or liquidation options according to investor guidelines. I also worked within the Bankruptcy department, so we had to work with our list of local attornies to ensure that the bankruptcy courts were updated to any actions performed by Nationstar."
good,"I did not interview for Mr. Cooper is we were part of a boy out fith Fannie Mae. Mr Cooper decided to close the Beaverton, Oregon office on March 18,2020"
good,"Is a good company to work for and I would recommend it to anyone. They are good people to work alongside, stives to make a comfortable work environment of which I appreciate."
good,"Was nationstar then was bought by mr cooper, very diverse culture and awesome place to work, was there 9 yrs .Loved the team work and the environment/"
good,Good company. Talented coworkers. Room for advancement. Smart management. Fair compensation. Some latitude to execute on ideas. Nice office workspace.
good,"While the pay isn't the best around, for someone that has been working here for 11 years, I can say that the perks and work flexibility certainly outweigh the cons in pay."
good,"Great atmosphere, good people to work with. Stressful at time, but learned a lot about the Industry and helping Homeowners to stay in their Home. Very diverse culture. Hardest part is not being help a Homeowner keep their Home or get a resolution."

good,"Great environment to work in, casual and friendly.  The only reason why I am seeking new employment is because the mortgage industry is really slow.  However, they do everything they can to drive in business.  My only con about the actual company is that they micromanage.  However, some of that is to be expected."

good,"Working for Nationstar has been an great experience builder. I have been able to acquire the experience needed to move to more challenger and yet beneficial job opportunities . The pay is poor compared to other companies. However, the experience you gain allows you to apply for higher salaries outside the company. If you are a graduating college student and want to get corporate experience, Nationstar would be the place. It has a relative low turnover rate. only a few lay offs in my five years experience here. Stable company. I have been able to get promoted to different positions by simply networking, and inquiring to learn a new position.

I help train new associates and assisted senior management daily with requests.

Learned how to originate loans from FHLMC same servicer and FNMA refi plus to FHA and VA loans. Excellent place to learn and gain experience. Management is typically fair and will try to work with Mortgage Professionals to get customer issues resolved. Coworkers are very helpful and bring collective experiences to aid in helping you. The job can sometimes be very daunting when it comes to meeting your goals for locking loans and submitting them, while trying to deal with third party vendors and processors that have been inundated with accounts that contain title issues. The job however can be very satisfying when you get a bonus that reflects your hard work and when you get to help a customer save big money on their mortgage."

good,"I like working at Nationstar and the people I work with. However, I am looking to obtain a loan processing position with more pay."
good,"My typical day at work consists of assisting customers over the phone with inbound and outbound manual dialed calls. I have a group of accounts that I am specifically assigned to - to assist in preventing foreclosure on their homes whether it be their primary residence or an investment property. I conduct verbal financial interviews with people over the phone to determine their best options whether it to be reinstatement, repayment plan, modifications, short sales, or deed in lieus. I have learned a tremendous amount within the mortgage industry and I see both sides from homeowner perspective and the business perspective. Management is great most of the time but they are rarely around when the agents have issues or questions. That makes it difficult to get questions and concerns answered right away with the customers who are on the phones. My co-workers and my team are great! They help out with questions and problems that I come across and they are enjoyable to work for. The hardest part of my job is when I am helping a customer who has no options available to offer due to their current financial situation. They want to stay in their homes but their current financial situations don't allow them to do so and it is hard for me to tell them that there is nothing that I can do for them. The most enjoyable part about my job is the opportunity that I have been given to help customers who are in need to save their homes. I am a homeowner as well as my customers and I can relate with them on how much my home means to me. It is important to me to provide the best service to my borrowers"

good,"Thoroughly enjoyed being a part of a company that was able to assist customers in their overall financial well-being through refinancing their homes. "
good,Taking inbound calls for mortgage and escrow. Great my mangers. Pay could have been better. Fun environment.Company trips each year in november. Bonus.
good,"It's a company trying to improve, however their senior mngt does not care for anyone below them as long as they  are paid well themselves. Pay difference btwn a manager and an V.P is $100k."
good,I loved my team and manager but I was employed at a time when my position was needed for 60 plus hours a week.   I Judy needed better work life balance.
good,"Negotiate and identify workout options based on financial packages, credit reports, appraisals, hardships information and investor/client guidelines."
good,A day at Nationstar is very fast paced.  There is never down time at the office.  I really enjoy working for everyone that I work for along with their teams.

good,"I've learned a lot at Nationstar, it's a friendly environment with an improving culture. The pay isn't great but the job security is good. I wish there would be more cohesiveness as far as the role executives play because it causes a trickle down a effect to their employees but management is good overall. I've had a nice experience so far."
good,"The team is great and always have lot of fun at workplace."
good,"A nice place to work for. The atmosphere is great and good co-workers that care about the company and the services that we provide for customers. The greatest part of job is giving the borrower, a sense that we giving them options of coming their home."
good,"The company and management were great.  Most processors needed to go away.  They tried to get rid of the floaters and troubled ones (and believe me, there were a lot).  The hardest part of the job was the constant bickering between employees who were productive month after month and being frowned upon for this by those who tried to just skate by. The goals were the same for everyone."
good,"Nationstar has grown tremendously in the last three years, but has managed to keep the charm of working in a smaller company. Extremely friendly and cohesive people to work with, the knowledge base is amazingly huge."
good,Learned how to manage my day with reviewing different portfolios and specific accounts. Managers were great and extremely intuitive as to help your day run smoothly. Co-Workers were very friendly as well. Hardest part of the job was how monotonous the work was. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment

good,"I enjoyed my time at Nationstar Mortgage, the hours were fair and I could easily keep work life and home life separate. My co-workers were all peers of similar age, education and interests and we got along very well. I learned how the mortgage industry works and how to handle a mortgage as well as budgeting. Typically I would spend eight hours a day speaking with clients and helping them resolve any outstanding mortgage or debt-related issues or processing payments. I enjoyed helping a client lower their payment or get caught up from being behind, but the hardest part was realizing when there wasn't anything a borrower could do to save their home."
good,Environment surrounded with positive attitude individuals that care both about the company and the customers.
good,"The culture is good, and the leadership was awesome.  They are built on performance.  My job was about taking customer service calls and transforming them into refinance opportunities.  The pay structure was awesome, I just did not like the call center sales portion of the job.  It made me uncomfortable to take a payment call and try to pitch and sell someone on a new mortgage, all in an hour call, to someone who did not want or was not thinking about it.  The process seems rushed, as a mortgage is usually the highest and most important debt one has.  I feel like the process should be more personal and should be done over a longer period of time, rather than trying to push the whole process in one call.  I understand why, because if you let someone off the phone and think about it, most of the time they will back out."
good,You can easily advance to different position within the company. They cross train and have tuition reimbursement. The CEO  actually did a side by side with several of the customer service reps.
good,A performance based environment that rewards you for production.  A typical workday requires converting mortgage related calls into applications. Managing mortgage pipeline is essential.
good,Life at Nationstar was fun and also competitive. The culture is amazing. There is never a day where you are not learning something new about the mortgage industry.
good,"1. Been working on changing their culture, but depending on management it's the lack communication. "
good,Very relaxed and everyone works well with each other. Management is very approachable and will listen to what you have to say. The environment is laid back there are no micro managers as long as you do what your suppose to.
good,"Nationstar had a bad reputation when I started in 2015> This year its taking a different direction for the good. There is more structure in management, more professional and after 6 months you can apply to a different position!. Nationstar has great activities every year for just their employees, for example in October 2015, they rented out the entire Six Flags Park and was only open to Nationstar employees and can bring friends/family! They also participate in Habitat for Humanity, March for Babies, Thanksigving donations, Back to School ect. It can get very stressful at time, but that's most corporate office settings. You can wear Jeans (Casual Wear) Monday- Friday!!!"
good,Work with customers on understanding there mortgages. Co workers were very friendly and mangement was very understanding. The hardest part of the job is hearing a customer crying cause they are losing there home. The enjoyable part was surrounding and being aknowledge for the work you have done.
good,"Nationstar is a good place to work at once leaving college. The compensation is decent and they give you benefits and investment opportunities after 30 days. It's a good, positive environment to work in."

good,"The many years spent working for Key Bank/Champion mortgage were the most memorable. "
good,"I work in the Customer Relations Department and we address complaints submitted by borrowers to the CFPB, State, AG,and other Regulatory Agencies. Natiionstar is aquiring loans at an alarming rate so the complaints increas rapidly. This has led to the expansion of the department which also includes advancement opportunies. I've successfully moved up the food chain in less than one year."
good,"My current work environment is pretty relaxed.  I enjoy the type of work I do (borrower's gross and net income based on taxes and pay stubs).  I am not sure I want endless advancement which seems to be the only motivating goal. My co-workers are all polite, professional, and on the young side.  The hardest part of my job is interacting with upper management.  Upper management does not seem to have any patience or attention for their employees and treats us like like work horses.  Lower management acts as a buffer and is more personable and understanding."
good,"This is a great company to work for. The managers are very helpful, but also expect you to complete your work on a daily basis. On a day to day basis I file claims. This requires extensive research on variable types of loans. I have learned how to stay organized and always come into work with a great attitude and willing to be flexible. The hardest part of this job for me was learning the terminology for a mortgage company as well as the usage of specific computer programs."
good,Great work environment and excellent room for growth.Great work environment.
good,"where your immediate leads and managers have your back, I was constantly harassed by super management, and HR. "
good,The typical work day would be taking over 100* calls a day with 30 minute lunches. The hours of operation aren't as good as they should be. The pay is very good.
good,"Very busy company great teams. Poor management and team leaders, confusing because they contradicted themselves all the time, therefore you never knew who too believe."
good,A Growing Company that with the right leadership can become one ofthe top mortgage companies in the country and the world.
good,Mr. Cooper is trying hard to be a great place to work and provide good customer service. They provide free coffee all day and for most of the company they give the day after Thanksgiving off.
good,I knew the order of each task and worked quickly to get priority item done first.  I learned about reverse mortgage and and I enjoyed making friends at breaks and lunch times.
good,Clock in on time say good morning to everyone check what i have for work and start right away.  I loved working here great atmosphere and everyone that surrounded me positive attitude.

good,I enjoyed my time with Nationstar Mortgage. I was disappointed when they told us that the office in Buffalo would be closing and our jobs were going back to Dallas.
good,"Nationstar mortgage has a lot of opportunities, however I feel that they are very unorganized and lose a lot of good workers because they refuse to pay more."

At nationstar I work diligently and consistently at treating my customers with the highest level of respect and dignity while coming up with solutions to bring defaulted accounts current. Representatives at Nationstar are accountable for the understanding the business and the products in order to provide the best solutions to the customers. Management is very hands on making sure the representatives have the materials needed to advance and be successful within the company.

good,"Fast paced, worked with MS suite"
good,Typical Day at work would start at 7:00 am and I would be done when the work was done. Learned that attention to detail was vital for this job due to me assigning closing loans for the company. The co-workers were very supportive but also knew that the company was interested in results. Hardest part of the job is avoiding making the one mistake that would catch up at the end of closing. Most enjoyable part is putting a family in a house.

Uploading newly received documents into appropriate accounts, making out bound calls to collect new documents after clearing conditions accordingly. learned the entire process of loan processing and the importants of the calls that were needed, and how to check credit. Micro Managed and very high turn over rate with no room for error and made all the employees not to fun to be around most the time because of numbers more so end of month which I know understand."
good,Good company to work for. The environment is diverse and well balanced.
good,"I will let you be the judge of the company if hired by them, I don't have anything negative that i would prefer to share at this current time. My review of this company would only be my opinion."
good,I enjoyed my time here. I learned a lot. I do have some regrets having left. Senior management needs some work but overall it is not bad place to be. Pay is not market rate and could use work to stay competitive.
good,Not a lot of structure within the company. Pay and Benefits were good. Poor training and not extensive. Corporate changed their mind daily. Needs more stucture.
good,Worked processing mortgage loans by verifying that all mandatory documents are present and entering them in the system that is shared with nationwide attorneys so that they can start the bankruptcy/foreclosure process.
good,"I really enjoyed my working experience with my customers and peers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the systems in place that made my working a experience a very productive day.  Management was very respectful and did not look down on our co-workers, instead they were very helpful when assistance was needed.  The hardest part of the job was that there was no overtime approved."
good,NS Mtg was very busy at time. New products will come out that you had to learn. The managers was ok. The co-worker was nice. The hardest part of the job was went the system would crash and put you behind on your work. The enjoyable part of the jobs was having a job to go to.

I have learned alot at Nationstar. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. The most difficult part would be the amount of work.

good,"This company had a great pay scale however it appears this industry has a tendency to have change overs frequently and not many are allowed to move upward, however still believe this is a great company."
good,"I was at Mr. Cooper (formally Nationstar) for 5 years and was treated well with great teammates.  The only downside was every year there were layoffs.  If you can produce and be productive you can keep your job but if there is any fat to cut budget wise every year you might be out of a job.  I saw this from the entry level all the way up to VP so no one was safe from budget layoffs.  I was lucky enough to have five years there but in that time I received a total of just over a dollar raise from my original pay.  This I found when I was laid off was totally unacceptable given the cost of living increases yearly and the amount of pressure to perform.  The benefits make up for this somewhat but in the end they give you just enough to be productive while holding back any pay increases.  Also, the opportunity for advancement is very limited due to these budget cuts and the openings come along maybe once every year or so and unless they tell you about it they do not encourage you to move departments or move up the corporate ladder."
good,NSM was a great Company to work with. They truly cared about their employees. I was there building out the Wholesale division and it grew beyond what we thought. Worked long hours and tried to staff  as fast as possible.  Grew too big too quick. Management was great and knew how to lead Teams. NSM was there for me during breast cancer and helped me through the worst part of my life. Great Company! Should have stayed.

On the phone for eight hours answering questions regarding length of loan and the lowest interest rate they were able to get.

Everything here changes for the better and it's great to have a small feel to the company, where it doesn't feel like you're just a number.
