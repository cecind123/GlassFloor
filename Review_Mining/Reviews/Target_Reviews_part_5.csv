My co-workers were very helpful with any questions that I had about the job. Hardest part of the job was keeping all the employees' names straight. The part I loved most was interacting with all my co-workers."

good,Great environment for learning new things. Learned a lot of different aspects of teamwork.
good,"A typical day at work will always start off at a fast pace. This is so that we can push all the merchandise onto the shelves by our set goal time which is usually an hour or so before opening.

Each day brings new changes, some more challenging than others, and requires leaders to be resilient and adaptable - capable of making intelligent decisions quickly and responsibly, while also considering the impact to the business and the team as a whole. "
good,"A typical day at work for target was stocking the shelves over night when items ran low. I would tag the items, make sure things were cleaned, and I made sure everything was done in a thoughtful organized fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. I loved to help them with the things they could not find."
good,I loved working at the casino because it was fun and you get to meet many interesting people such as celebrities.

good,very fun place to work there is a lot of different people to meet and get to know
good,I enjoyed working at my store. My store manager and his team were excellent at developing lower level team members and supporting their advancement. I was promoted twice in the three years I worked there and would have been a fourth time if I had not relocated and left the company.
good,Working at Target is a great experience. All my team members have been pleasant. They have helped me since day one. With my school situations my managers have been very understanding and have supported me through everything. The best part of working at Target is that everyday I meet someone new. I get to interact with people from different walks of life and it is always fascinating. The hardest thing I have to deal with is sometimes I can't always give the guest what they want.
good,"it was a 9 to 5 "
good,"There is always a great excitement to come to work every schedule I have with Target because I feel the warm welcome form the management side and a good camaraderie among the staff at Target."
good,"What I enjoyed most about Target was working with my co-workers and many of the Team Leads. They made sure that the work place was enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was when management did not stick to the store policies when it came with dealing with the customers. I have learned much about customer service, and the best thing was to make a person's day better."
good,"Target holds a strong relationship with their employees, making sure that all are working in a safe and friendly setting. A typical day for me is checking in with my supervisor on the work load for the night. each night there is an designated work area in the store for instance while working in dry food we have label strips that are to be replaced with the current ones after that is complete we remove all merchandise from the shelves, rearrange anything that needs movement then restock the merchandise."
good,Pretty good enviroment and fun place to work.  I enjoy going and talking and joking with my co workers alot.  It is important to me for good work enviroment.
good,You have to work for every penny that you earn its a non stop work zone unless your on break. There's a team leader supervising every work station to make sure everything is up to part and running the smooth. The coworkers are friendly but don't do to much talking because everybody is in their own zone trying meet their numbers. The hardest part of the job was depal which consist of fast moving unloading carts and placing boxes on belt so work doesn't get backed up. The enjoyable part of the job was unloading trucks alone which you can work at your own pace not to fast and not to slow.
good,"Just good people and a great environment. Of course there are some jerks, but the employees are friendly and will make your day pass along great."
good,"Working in the stockroom was considerably different than working on the salesfloor, but the same basic principles apply - fast, fun, and friendly.  Be those three things and you can be successful with the company.  I learned the most working for Target than any other job in retail, which was everything from good customer service practices, replenishment, stockroom management, shipping and receiving, food handling, planograms, price change, pro-active store security, and taking inventory by physical count.  Mostly friendly managers.  Mostly friendly co-workers.  Hours as backroom (a stockroom worker) were sometimes tough.  Everything else was highly enjoyable."
good,"such an awesome place to work in "
good,"Working in Guest Services has its ups and downs, but the reason I've stayed with Target for so long is because I love the job and the people I work with. Typically, I process returns, adjust prices and resolve problems to ensure a positive guest experience. For the most part, I enjoy my job and how it offers a variety of challenges and opportunities to grow. The least enjoyable part of any guest service job is encountering rude or demeaning guests either in person or on the phone. This does not happen often, and it is something that usually can be handled with the help of upper management. You can not take things personally because guests may be angry, but they are not angry at you. Overall, it is an enjoyable job, especially because the people you work with make the job fun and you develop strong interpersonal skills that help you deal with anything."
good,"stock/receiving/handling packages\"

good,"My typical day at work. Keep in mind that this was the Christmas Season, well that almost tell you that there was always vigilance and a chaos I learned that I could be a valuable member of a team and smile this time of year. Even so, other checkers would help each other. At first not knowing anyone quickly became a family set atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was probably waiting for the supervisor when the customer was impatient when there was a line. If there was a price discrepancy that needed to be resolved. The people were by far the best part of the job. Mostly happy genuinely nice and caring customers. I hardly had any trouble. If I did it was only when the cards had been hacked and the customers were concerned."
good,"Early Days starting at 3:30am and ending as late as 1:30pm. 3-6 days a week and always busy.  Unloading trucks, Stocking, Back Stocking, Zoning, Etc."
good,"I loved every day at Target. The whole atmosphere is fun, outgoing, friendly and helpful."
good,"Everyday is typically the same with the occasional busy periods. There are huddles where managers take time to ask team members about vibe moments, and also to let us know the goals for the day, and also upcoming goodies being given in the break room."
good,Target promotes a hardworking and caring atmosphere. They encourage teamwork. the hardest part is sales the Reds card however all team members share each others tricks to help saves the guest their five percent.

good,"A typical day at work is just to satisfy customers. What I learned was how to interact with customers and how to approach them and to help them with what they needed. The hardest part of the job was having to leave due to relocation of my living situation. I really enjoyed working at Target because it was an easy environment to enjoy what I did. The co-workers I worked with were excellent people and helped me when I first started. Overall, an excellent place to work at."
good,I love working for Target. Anytime I have ever had an issue they have worked close with me to get the problem resolved. They genuinely care about the team members. A typical day for me is going in and working hard getting all the merchandise pushed to the floor and then backstocked into its proper location.
good,"the environment is good, co workers look to help where they can and ensure 100% efficiency each day.  Hardest part has to be when two or more managers are giving out tasks and not communicating to see  that the individual can not complete all the tasks.  I enjoy all the perks of interacting with people and helping them when they need it."
good,1 and a half years with Target was a jet setter to my professional career. I got to learn alot from the teams in India & USA. My teams in Bangalore & Minneapolis were always motivating and supportive of me and my work.
good,"Learned a lot"
good,When the day began in the morning it pretty slow there really is no costumers that comes in its just mostly returns that have to b put back. Afternoons is when all the traffic comes in and more items from guess are being brought back. Team members will help you if you are over loaded with costumers and need an extra hand.
good,"Target is a place of diversity, there is many different type of personality's  that you interact with on a daily basis. Some of them are nice and some not so nice, I love this part of the job because I was able to talk everyone and sometimes say something to change someone else's day. I learned that anything can happen in type of environment, the computer system can shut down, the customers can start fighting or air condition can just stop working on a very hot day. But that is where we come in as a team to make things better for each and every customer."

good,"Fun place to work, staff was great, but i was a student there and they could not offer me a position."
good,Working at target was fun and work  at the same time. I loved learning new things about the company. It was difficult at first when I started but once the training process was over and I worked a regular 8 hour shift Everything was great. As I sales associates greeted customers as they entered the store stocked up the shelves when it was time and checkout the customers as they were ready to checkout. We had a wonderful staff behind us and management as well. The hardest part was closing time when it was time to go we had to clean the entire the store the floors and bathroom. But threw it all was a wonderful experience.
good,"On a typical day you go in, and you clearly know what your duties are and what is expected of you. Management is helpful with questions and flexible with schedules and will work with any difficulties you have. Your team works with you do divide up work and can be the most enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult part could be physically keeping up with the work load. Sometimes the work can be physically strenuous."

Management was great and the co-workers were family oriented and worked together as one, which allowed us all to be a fantastic team. The hardest part of my job was not knowing a certain location or part of the store that I did not work in. My most enjoyable part of the job was being around all of my co-workers and being able to assist the guest with all of their shopping needs, questions, and etc."
good,"I'm comfortable at Target, been with the company for five years. I love learning new things. With Target I have been able to learn most of the different departments. Therefore I'm able to pick up extra hours when I need them, as well as become an asset to the company"

Once I begin working, it takes me a couple of minutes to snap into it, but once those couple of minutes are up, I am back to being what I am; a great customer service provider.

good,"putting up clothes"

good,"Its an Awesome Company to work for, All Managers and Co-workers are super supportive."

Occasionally I would be asked to supervise the frontlanes ; give change to other cashiers, and help with price checks.

I push all merchandise out onto the sales floor. I help with guests questions and go for backup at the front end if needed. Management likes to know how we are doing in the task list and we'll ask us to help out in other areas if needed. My co-workers are fun and friendly.

Fun Friday's usually consist of a game we play either with teams or single and that group or person usually wins a prize or free Starbucks or whatever the prize is that week but we change it. The hours are manageable, the staff or management is superb and as long as you work hard you can advance there. The Target discount is always a highlight to those who shop.

good,"This job was seasonal through the Christmas holiday. The hours were 2 am to 11 am usually. The only uncertainty is that the store was on a day to day delivery schedule. So basically, one would be called to show up that evening if an unscheduled truck should arrive."
good,"I love the company and everything they stand for. Managers are willing to train you, the staff is friendly, and they will do anything they to help you out. The only downfall for the company is the rate they pay their employees. It fits for a kid in school that doesn't have responsibilities. As an adult, you will need more than this to live"

good,"Working at Target is funner than I thought it would be. Its fast paced and you have so much opportunity to branch out and utilize different skills. As with any job, you get what you put into it; so if you make yourself available to help out if different areas, you become a well rounded, knowledgeable employee.

good,I had a great time with the fast paced work experience and great people I was surrounded by at Target Pharmacy. I basically filled prescriptions all day and helped restock the shelves. I learned how to input patient information in the computer and how to organize a pharmacy. The hardest part about the job was the computer system we had to use but it was easy after you figured it out. I really loved all the people I worked with.
good,A typical day includes collaboration and project management.

good,"Working at Super Target was a job to remember and convince people to apply. You can expect to multi-task be very busy and assist when available. I've learned multiple things working at Target it taught me how important it is to be committed to a team (even though i've completed my task that does not mean i'm done its fine to help others) and how the employees not only represent the location we work at but the whole target team.(dressing,customer service, greeting and presentation of sales floor). I've always worked with dedicated people with positive vibes. If your looking for a fast paced fun retail and grocery job target is the right fit the only thing that was difficult to me was learning the backrooms when i had to get merchandise for guest but overall it was nice. i loved the hours most the supervisor the interaction with guest & the enjoyment of being occupied."
good,"A typical day at target is unloading a tractor trailer of product and then stocking the product on the shelves. I learned how to read labels, communicate better, use a scan gun, backstocking and receiving. I get along with all my co-workers we are always laughing and working hard. The hardest part of my job is waking up at 3am to go to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and having a good time while we work together."
good,"Enjoyed working at Target. The only reason I left was because of low pay and minimal chance for advancement. Though my position was in back office area, there was opportunity for customer service skills. Managers were respectful and communicative. Hardest part of job was learning their payroll system."
good,"Target is a good place to work, they have great starting pay and benefits. The pay increases are very generous, and you are paid weekly. However, there isn't room for advancement with them if you do not have a degree."
good,For me I start with opening my department early in the morning. Taking inventory to establish what I will need to complete for the day.
good,"Worked as the security supervisor, maintaining safety for all the employees and customers."
good,Start off doing flow and take boxes to the pallets and then take them out to break boxes and start to stock and speed up your work. Enjoyed working with Co-worker.

good,Great morning and night staff when I was on the clock. From this job in particular i received valuable customer service skills in which I applied each and every day. The management team varied from a daily basis but all did their jobs correctly and with confidence that helped us as a team. Co-workers were just as friendly and as well as the newly hired. Most difficult aspect of the job were the constant flow of the customers and the seasons. Although the most difficult it gave the team the experience in which we could efficiently handle the many more situations to come. The enjoyment for me came from the praise and trust I had received from the team and my team leaders. From that it provided the drive to come to work and know that I in fact was helping others and as well as myself.
good,"I basically come to work doing the same routine but setting out different style of clothing. I learned that retail can be really fun but some time really hectic(busy). It's more to just zoning/folding clothes. Met a lot of great supervisor and co-workers during the process. I enjoy working with my co worker, I enjoy my merchandising position. The hardest part about work would be NOTHING because I am a quick and hard worker, i learn to adapt to things quickly."
good,"I love Target! The only reason I left is due to low pay and no benefits. Other than that, you get a discount on merchandise, and the customers make working there a delight. Target has contest to where you can win nice things. I won a 32"" color tv once for just offering customers the Target credit card. The management team always comes around and thanks you for doing a great job. When I worked there it was a very pleasant work experience."
good,"Retail is not for everyone. The toughest part of the job is the physical part of the job. The best part is running into and helping that one really nice person during your shift. Management tries to be fair to everyone but as with any company not everyone will be happy with every decision. My location has great team members, we work together as a team and help each other."

Management, while not the most interesting people, made sure things ran smoothly and were always fair to their employees."
good,"We always had a ping pong table in the break food and food of the time. I love all their benefits, its makes it worth working really hard during the day and long nights."
good,"I've tried for many years to work for this company an when they finally got through to me an called in for an interview I was more more pleased, an the tears of joy did not come until that day they called and said come dressed in uniform for orientation your hired. An I loved working for target. I was sad and heartbroken when my employment was terminated on Nov.19,2010. I've tried numerous timed yo get back with the company but my brake hasn't been successful yet"
good,"Typical dock work, either working a conveyor line or pulling pallets out of trailers. Straightforward, but physically demanding. Very strict policy on sick days and being on time."

good,Good job great people..good benefits also..the pay is great and you get flex up time majority of the time if needed..target also gives you 20 percent off items from local store and online purchases
good,"When you work for this company, you become apart of a very big team/family. And their goal is to provide the best experience for everyone. They want people to remember that great time they went to target. To achieve that they need people that feel the same."
good,Typical day included walking for 8 hours straight with pretty much no sitting unless you're on break. was super fun to walk around the store and memorize where everything was and to help out customers.
good,A typical day of work is just folding clothes and filling the floor from the racks of clothes in the back. The hardest part of the job is trying to finish  a time consuming task before you leave. The most. enjoyable part of the job is that most of the employees are college students so you get to make some friends.
good,"fun atmosphere, team members really help you fit in. The whole team is awesome at helping guest with any thing they may need. Always giving recognition."

good,"My time there (up to day) has been great."
good,"Most days I do the job I was hired to do which is fulfilling online orders and packing and shipping them. Some days I learn different departments, which is great because I love learning new things. Management is great, and I truly love the people I work with."
good,"A typical night at work was pretty easy, I would get there and grab a scanning device and go to the back of the store and grab the boxes that were part of my department. I worked in domestic so I would bring those boxes out to the sales floor and stock them where they needed to go. Anything extra or that couldn’t fit I would put back in the back of the store. Anything that needed to be filled, I would go to the back and see what was missing."
good,All stores are different. There is always something new going on at the store. Friendly happy staff. Always something new to learn. Friendly customers
good,"I worked at Target in 2016 so a lot has changed. When I worked there I felt included, seen, and appreciated. I was able to work a lot and work very hard. It was great. I loved my managers and my coworkers."
good,Due to many managers coming in and out of the store location. There has been a drastic change to the work environment that was once offered to me. My high expectations for Target slowly changed over time.
good,"The people i worked with were very nice and the company treats it's employees very good as well.Target was one of the best companies i worked for. In the time that i was there, my supervisors worked with me when i had some family emergencies I had to attend too."

good,"A normal day at work consists of a lot of guest interaction, you ever need help there's always management there to help out. Hardest part is having to work with a place where there are people who can be difficult to deal with."
good,I learned a lot with the food and beverages. The Produce and Dairy department especially. A very typical day at work is to make sure the product is in good standing not out dated.  For the consumer to purchase . And to make sure the facing out product can be seen by the customer. Management is always there to help with any questions you may have . The hardest part of this job is very physical. Must be fit to lift heavy boxes and product. The most enjoyable part of the job is Team Work and knowing to get the job done in reasonable time frame.

good,"It's an amazing place to work "
good,nah i guess it was alright i worked in the back a lot so that was great because i didn't have to deal with customers so much. however the batch part of my duties were often stressful.

good,"Typical work day was a fast pace, you had to stay on your toes and have comprehensive problems solving skills for your customers. You quickly learn how to follow instruction and direction while still pleasing your consumers providing job security with returning business.

good,ive never had retail experience and Target was willing to coach me through whatever i didn’t know and they’ll do whatever it takes to make sure you know what you’re doing while you’re working there. You can build your own schedule and the whole store is like a well oiled machine because everyone helps each other out.
good,"To me target was a very friendly workplace where all employees tried to get to know each other and co-exist, although not everyone was as close as family we all joked around with each other and make every day a good one."

The management there was not as involved in the everyday work, however team leads were very present and helpful. Our workplace culture was very fun, we participated together in activities outside of work as well as creating an enjoyable work environment by forming friendships with the other employees.

The most enjoyable part was having the option of sometimes being able to work individually but also having the opportunity to work with my team members."
good,"The distribution centers are great places to work if you're up for consistently putting your best foot forward to better your performance. The work environment is fast paced and challenging, but not stressful like other facilities. Management was always understanding and seemed to look out for their team members. All in all, it's a great job for those unafraid to work hard everyday and put the time and effort in."
good,"I love target and the people there.. its a great job not to fast paced very relaxed and great pay for regular team members. Moving up positions was a problem, I've been promised for 3 years there that i was going to move up, i did work that managers do without the pay"
good,productive busy workplace with a diverse range of employees. Employees are close with one another and team work is easy to come by and achieve in this working environment.
good,"Target is a fast paced job, the people there are friendly and easy to get along with.  You have various tasks to complete, which makes the time go by fast."
good,"everyone was really sociable, i had an overall fun time working there, fast paced and busy. the pay was good and the supervisors were nice and considerate"
good,"Appleton store was a great place to work, great management and co-workers. Pay was low but had decent benefits. Venice store was terrible, low hours , low pay , most management and some co-workers were horrible to work for and with. Would never recommend anyone to work for that store."
good,Great morale to work within. Wonderful staff everyone was very polite and helpful although I didn't work directly for Target I worked for a company called marketsource.
good,"Nice understanding staff. Very physical demanding, but worth the pay, awesome benefits, no continuity between work keys, flexible schedule, opportunities to learn how to operate equipment; STRONGLY emphasizes safety ( always good)"
good,I enjoyed working at Target very much. Everyone there was very accepting and friendly. I felt like I could be friends with my coworkers. They were very helpful as well.
good,The hardest part  would be getting people to sign up for the credit card. I've learned to work.in a fast moving past and I loved to met new people and to learn new things
good,I had a good time at target but it is what you make of it as many people did not enjoy there time there as much as i did.  this is a temporary job and not something you want to start a career in i dont believe unless you know someone
good,"I work at McKinney Super Target 2335 for 5 years as a Softlines Team Member while I was in college. They were excellent with my hours and really were flexible when I needed to change my schedule for school. Management was great and seriously, it's not a bad place to work if you just do your work. The workload can be overwhelming and corporate will walk in and make you change how you operate from time to time, but management always rewarded our performance and made the experience enjoyable."
good,Target is a great place to work. I would highly recommend it. They leave you alone most of the time and trust you to do your work. No micromanaging! Definitely safety centered.
good,Target was surprisingly a great place to work. I learned so much and after showing a lot of hardworking and dedication I was promoted to manager which I loved as I got to display my management skills and learn even more in a fun and constructive work environment.
good,"Good company but you have to work very hard. It’s not a company that you can do little and get by. It’s hard work, and ever changing. Hours can be very inconsistent for leadership."
good,I  worked on the register at Target so my days usually went by smooth. Even though they were days that we were extremeley busy it was okay.  learned how to be patient and deal with customers.
good,"Full of fun-loving people, lots of advancement opportunities, good management system, set work hours with little to no unexpected change. Very straightforward with rules and hours."
good,It was a fast-paced place to work but very teamwork orientated. Everyone is supposed to help each other and it helps get things done and makes sure people do not get overwhelmed.
good,"Safety is #1. Daily meetings at the start of shift so everyone knows the goal to reach. Always get out exactly at the end of shift. Overtime is USUALLY optional. Pay is great,  definitely competitive. Schedules are 4 tens or 3 twelve."
good,"Target was an excellent experience. My coworkers were extremely welcoming and friendly, and it was nice to learn about the benefits and how to maneuver their type of system. The interactions with customers were memorable."
good,The leaders are what make Target a great workplace and provides leaders with the opportunity to grow and develop. Distribution requires long work days around 11+ hours either 3 or 4 days a week.
good,"Nice place to work at but they never give you more than 30 hours a week, how ever the staff are very professional and friendly and customer sevice oriented."
good,Target  was a good company to work for. Got my customer service experience and cashier experience.  Set up  store when it started.  This was the first  store to open in Illinois
good,"Meeting everyone I met during the interview process, my impression was left unfaltered.  Target has been a great employee to me in the past and I think it's fair to say they are still a great employer to work for after 5 years of me working with a different employer.  I'm so excited to come back!"
good,"Target was a very friendly and interactive company. The lifestyle was great, getting to interact with customers and supply accordingly to their needs. Servicing customers was very enjoyable for me, getting to know the customers especially and making sure they received service that will have them coming back to shop at Target becoming regulars. This job required working at a moderate pace even under pressure. Not all days were smooth but that is what made it an enjoyable challenge."
good,Working at target can be fun and if you want to move up quickly you can do so. Things have changed a little since I started and now they expect all new hires to be capable of running the front lanes and not need assistance from the higher ups. Due to this change it can feel overwhelming to a new team member as there is so much to memorize in such a short amount of time.
good,Target was by far one of the best working environment I've experienced. Helped me with a flexible schedule and was filled with helpful team members. Although my position was temporary I'd be excited to apply for a more permanent position.
good,"Wonderful work environment, it is a large corporation but it feels like you matter and that you're missed when you have to be gone. I started working here during high school and they were and have been very cooperative with scheduling and working around events in my life. Management is very understanding and easy to work with also."
good,The work day went by very quick and I always felt like I made a difference. It also helps that I love Target and always prefer to shop there. Management was always very helpful and pleasant.
good,"With my time working there I started as a Cart Attendee pushing carts into the store on the closing shift. It was okay but due to me getting sick easily I asked to be transferred to working as a cashier. Two months later I was working on the register and self checkout, the workplace was fun we had little events that involved food. Fast forward to April 2019 I get sick to the point of puking blood hourly so went to the doctor and they tell me I couldn’t return until they can figure out what this was and to this day I still have not found out. I told my boss I had to resign and HR was understandable."
good,"My time with target was busy but very comfortable. For such a large group of people, it really felt like a family! I've always regretted leaving, but the the salary could not compare what I was offered by another retailer."
good,"Keeps you on your feet and there is always something to do. Management will help you if you need it and the culture is the best. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet running around all day, but if you like helping customers out this is a great job for it."
good,I enjoyed working for Target for many years. I love the culture and the people. An ever changing environment with many opportunities for growth and advancement.
good,Target was a great place to work because it expanded my people skills! I worked as both a cashier and a customer service desk rep. I learned many valuable skills such as how to engage with customers and keep them happy. The hardest part was the slow days! I always looked for other things to do. Management was flexible and always kind. Overall wonderful experience!
good,Everyone was really nice and you get a good discount and and treated fairly as well as paid fairly. You get paid 15 minute breaks every 3 or so hours in addition to your 30 minute lunch break.
good,"I love Target. Getting hired there was a dream come true, coworkers are great and the work environment. I haven't been on the schedule in over 3 weeks, which is not good for me."
good,I like shopping at Target because?  They all ways ask can i help find some . Like pick up my medicine at the pharmacy.  Great prices on a lot merchandise.
good,It was alot of fun working at Target. Not really my choice of job but a lot of fun. It was a good day to day work schedule. Lot of things to do and reasonable time you're in.
good,"Target is a great place to work, coworkers are welcoming and very helpful. You learn how to handle all types of different attitudes and people because everyone shops at Target ."
good,"Worked for Target for 11 years.  Enjoyed the nice working enviroment and friendley co-worker's!  Loved the amount of hours I had weekly. Highly reccomend working there for anyone, especailly those with disabilities...equal oppertunity employer! Great quality produts!"
good,working at target was pretty fun. the area I worked in was the target cafe so it was only about 8 staff members combined between the age and Starbucks. I had a lot of hours which I liked and the pay rate was amazing for someone who was in high school at the time. the manager of my area was amazing but the store manager not so much.. he micromanaged.
good,"I worked as a electronics sales associate. I'll tell you what the managment was always nice and they really cared about how you're doing,other employees we're really fun hanging with in between rushes and tasks.the best part of the job was the fact you never felt overwhelmed or stressed out."
good,Face pace atmosphere. Great employees. Very greatful for staff. Would give us discounts for different areas in the store and would supply meals for the holiday or just because.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target. I was a cashier (Texas), but was also cross trained on the sales floor, guest service and remodel crew. Easy to get 40 hours during the holidays. When it slowed down I would call to see if they needed any extra help. Nine  times out of 10 they let me come in to get extra hours. I have 15+ years of retail experience and Target was the best experience. They treated me much better and the store morale was higher. They rewarded the employees often with food during long shifts and little perks. Truly a team effort and my co workers were helpful. Good company to work for. I recommend it to friends and relatives."
good,"Have had nothing but fun working for target, love the company but the lack of over the pay is just not enough to support my living expenses. The team members are great the leadership is fantastic and management is beyond what expected, but again the pay just isn't high enough to afford living expenses and the hours fluctuate too much."
good,"Fun place to work, pay is good and everyone working there is pretty nice. We have fun and sometimes lunch is provided when a holiday is coming up. We are about to start making $13/hr just wish we got given more hours to work each week instead of what we are getting currently."
good,"If I wasn't moving out of state, I would not have lft this company. Has to be the bet company I have ever worked for. If given the opportunity, I will be going back to work for them."
good,"Target, out of all of my jobs,was the BEST company to work for. I have always said I never want to work at Target. And not only did I found myself working at Target, I LOVED working at Target."
good,I love fast paced keep busy time went by fast. People were great co worker were sweet and helpful I would more recommend this job as a starter job or for extra cash or high school student or college.
good,"I love Target. Management is professional, coworkers are fun and personable, and our customers are great for the most part. Every department is a team of people, and in my particular team we all have fun and do things together outside of work. "
good,"I spent fifteen in a half years at Target, more than half of those years was in a team leader/management position. I had a great experience with the company, and I was a person to go after what I needed to balance work with life. I started as management, was kindly treated when needing to demote for family purposes, and then mentored when needing to get back into a team leader position. I was compensated as I promoted, it was a choice I made, and compensation is there, if one works hard for it, as with life, compensation needs to be earned, and one needs to think outside the box to get promotions with pay increases, as I did throughout my career at the company. The company, based on store size, district and other factors typically follows its mission, but there were stores that were loose with the mission, again, it is store specific and culture, whether lack thereof, or a store that sticks to it, is up to upper management and their execution. I never had a problem networking with the proper team members/leaders/executives/store team leaders, to gain access to a career advancement, and put in the work, again, taking off tunnel vision and progressing for my own personal needs. The specific store I worked at was extremely helpful when I needed to balance work with life, life taking precedence always. I recommend working here, if you like retail, are willing to work a flexible schedule adapting to business need, and want to put in the work if advancement is needed/desired. I was a little disappointed that there was not Christmas bonuses at this company, especially how much is to"
good,I love working at target and  thankful for the experience  and knowledge I have gained. I'm looking for something more. More stable and a solid job. I'm looking to grow and keep growing in the company.  I feel that I have reached as far as I can go at target. And I am ready to keep growing and going further.
good,"I would most be SRT team which is early morning shifts packing out what we get from the truck. I've also worked in softlines, self checkout and guest services."
good,"its a fun, fast paced and friendly place to work. I had the most fun there. I love the 10% employee discount. and if you have a red card, that's an extra 5% off"
good,"Great place to work"
good,This was a great team to work with.  Very positive atmosphere.  I enjoyed learning logistically how everything works together and being able to contribute in that capacity.
good,"I loved working at Target, unfortunately it was seasonal for me. I felt that to be unfair as I was cross trained for cashier, hardlines, and flow team. It's a great place to work, as far as I know they have no strict rules on calling off, and flex fill is really fun."
good,"-never felt like work because everyone was so close with each other"
good,its a great job and people are great managment is great but nobody intends to stay in retail for forever and opportunity to go up comes when you ask or are activily looking.
good,"Target is a fast paced place to work, with the need to do multiple tasks in a day. They respect your opinions and try to work with your schedule."
good,I loved working at target for the short time that I did it was very fun and the hours were very flexible. They were very good about being organized and the training was very easy
good,"Target has been one of the best jobs I have had so far. The managers are very understanding and typically let you complete tasks on your own. I loved the independence. As just a part time sales floor associate, the pay was more than enough to support me while I was in college."
good,"The Starbucks location within Target is the department where I accepted a seasonal job at and was well trained by a knowledgeable existing staff. Since then, I have had the opportunity to train at the Pizza Hut/cafe location as well."
good,The typical day for flow team would be getting there early and unloading trucks. Once the truck is unloaded onto proper palettes then you push the merchandise onto the store shelves where appropriate.
good,"Very friendly environment and hard working team members to keep you motivated to do your best, a lot of room for advancing in the company. Flexible hours"
good,"Sometimes there can be huge workloads with not enough time to finish. Other than that everyone is very helpful, HR is always down to earth and willing to talk with you, and the ETLs love when cashiers sign people up for RedCards. Just be sure to ask for help when you need it, never skim through work even if there's not enough time, do your work well no matter what."
good,"If you are someone who is motivated to always be the best at what you do, this is the job for you. While it is an entry level position, if you are willing to put forth the work, you will move up in this company."
good,I worked at Target when the portrait studio was still there.  I really enjoyed working there.  My job was only a seasonal position. The company overall seemed like a good work environment
good,"Target was a great job, it was my first job and I learned a lot from it. As a softlines team member my daily tasks included answering phones, organizing  shelves, and restocking clothing."
good,"A wonderful place, would recommend to everyone! I’ve only worked there two months but I have enjoyed every minute they have wonderful staff that help with training and any questions!"
good,"The atmosphere was superb. Retail pay rate is, of course, not what I am accustomed to with my skill set. I would recommend anyone for this position, be knowledgeable, friendly, and kind to customers."
good,"Theres always things to do when at Target, stocking shelves, checking people out at the check lanes, returning things, and cleaning up after guests. Its always a good time because management is so nice!"
good,I worked at Target for about 10 months. Target is a great place to work and is a really positive/fun environment. I left because I wanted to make more and Target was only paying $10 an hour and by February I was only getting 10-20 hours.
good,Target showed me what it was like to get ample amounts of work done while also building lasting relationships with coworkers. The overall workplace is amazing with the culture and the ability on everyones part to come together and work as a team.
good,"I would clock in and radio my shift lead and ask for my assignment. After receiving my assignment I'd check the backroom to see if there's any backstock for my assigned section of the store. I'd proceed to go through my assignment and help customers along the way. If I finish early, I'd normally radio the shift lead to let them know that I'm done and that I'm able to help out other team members if they're behind or backed up on their assignment."
good,"Target typically got more busy during late afternoon but calmed down in the evening. I learned how to stock shelves, back stock, and cashiering skills."
good,"It a good place to work very flexible with your schedule I will definitely work there again every time I needed a day off I could put my schedule up I work there seasonal and was pretty busy was able"
good,"The management is understanding. The other employees are very nice and the environment is very nice. Honestly, there haven't been that many times where a guest is just straight up awful. There's plenty of cranky people but hardly ever enough to really affect me."
good,Target is a good job if you're in high school or college or looking to supplement income. It's hard to manage if you're on your own - they don't pay enough to make it if you are living out on your own.
good,It was a great place to work i worked there while i still was attending high school so many years ago but it was nice it was a big difference from what i was doing before gave me a great sence of understanding on a real job
good,"An AMAZING boss drove the awesome culture at this store from 2014 - 2017.  She was one of the best bosses I've ever worked with, so much so that we had a great friendship as well.  Everyone respected her and loved working with her.  She made all the difference in that store.  Retail hours are never easy, but everyone there was fun to work with.  Relaxed atmosphere even during the holidays when it got crazy.  Definitely a respectful group of people, many of whom I keep in touch with.   A boss can make or break your career.  This one was amazing."
good,"I enjoyed working at target as my summer job because the pay was great, the management team and supervisors were all caring, and the job was straight forward."
good,"I love Target as a consumer, so I definitely didn't mind being on the other end lol. I've worked for two stores as a logistics associate. Very productive and meaningful work."
good,"Typical day at work is working with your co workers, helping guest with information about a product. In addition, helping make the store brand and clean."
good,Target provided adequate opportunities for leadership growth and career potential. They focus on their employees and it translates to a better overall shopping experience for guests.
good,I loved the atmosphere at Target. It is a great place to work with decent salary and incentives. Most of the workers seem to also enjoy their job which makes for a better work day!
good,Nice place to work at to make money. The people and type of job is easy. The pay is good the only things is that they only tried me as a seasonal position not for certain.
good,"Management and HR and is so friendly and understanding, as well as the coworkers, the job itself is very easy and the guests there are nice. The pay was great too."
good,It was hard working job I really enjoyed working here but sadly I had to relocate. If you want to you can get cross trained to different department in order to expand your job knowledge.
good,A typical day at target would be push and zoning for me. Nothing was too hard to learn everything was straight forward once explained. Most Team Leaders/LOD were very nice. Some days were slow some days were fast but thats with anything retail. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was the closing shift and trying to put everything back on the shelves while customers were still shopping. Most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone was friendly and easy to work with and if you wanted more hours or wanted to stay longer most team leaders didn't have a problem and would let you stay.
good,"I unloaded the new shipment and restocked, i learned a lot about teamwork and time management. Fast paced work environment. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor and the most enjoyable part of this job was the productivity accomplished with my team mates."
good,I was a hardlines team member for a year and enjoyed my time working there very much. As long as you stay on top of your area and help out whenever you can the time flies during a shift. I enjoyed my co-workers and the discount!
good,Target is a great place tro work for students and retail minded employees. Very face paced. keeps in employees well informed.  A great first job great work ethic
good,Target scheduled my hours around my class schedule and was nothing but understanding. The Team Leaders were a joy to work with just as much as the other Team Members.
good,Take food from the receiving area and put them on shelves. Unload food truck. Place food order at the end of the day. Management seems to change a bit. Nice employees to work with.
good,"Absolutely loved working here and was sad to have to leave. If they had offered me full time permanent, I would've taken it in a heartbeat. The people are great, the hours are flexible, and the campus is amazing! If they call me back to work for Target, my answer will be yes!!! Definitely a great place to work."
good,A great place to work during the season. With good pay and benefits. A learned a lot about retail sales and Receiving. The hardest part was waking up early in the morning.
good,Everybody I worked with was very kind and helpful. The work given to the employees was not over bearing and the compensation was reasonable. The only downside is that they placed me in multiple departments in little time. I would have enjoyed a little more consistency.
good,"I worked here seasonally, even though I was only here a few months this place was amazing. They pay HIGH above minimum wage, a diverse group of workers, manager was nice and positive"
good,i loved it there such an experience for me. i look forward to working there again very soon. my manager was the best manager for my first time working.
good,"My time at Target has been a positive one. The pay is okay, but the work culture is better, and my managers have been some of the best that I've ever worked for in retail."
good,"The team is awesome. Target is one of the best places to work at, team wise. Each target that I have been to or around has always had a great team bond or very diverse. Each day would be different, whether it's going to be a visit day or a day to do reports and hiring. One thing I really enjoyed at this job, surprisingly, is doing payroll."
good,A typical day would start with me opening up my line and giving the best customer service. Working approximately 6-7 hours per day. Saying good night to my co-workers. Looking forward to the next day to punch in again.
good,"I was part of the Flo Team.  Came in 3 days a week and helped unload truck, stocked shelves, fronted merchandise, assisted customers and upsold red cards."
good,For when I was in high school and through college it has been good place to work at. I am getting ready to graduate though and this is not a place to work if you are looking to have a cost of living wage.
good,"Front end cashier trainee, backup GSTL for breaks, answer phone in office for breaks. Customer Service counter. Put stock up. Nightly duties to close store."
good,I would recommend someone to work there if they are looking to be able to become a leader while building good relationships with fellow employees and also frequent customers
good,"It is an awesome place to work as long as you can keep up with constant changes, helping guests while continuing to work and jobs added every so often."
good,"I love the money that you can make at target, but it’s lack of communication. The employees tell you what to do more than the actually manger. Which is definitely a problem."
good,You are always doing something different which is nice for a change of pace. The managers are pretty laid back but still want you to get your work done.
good,"I would stock, cashier, and clean based on what was needed from me that day. All of these jobs have customer service as a requirement as well, and this is very important. Helping the customers at target is something placed on a pedestal."
good,Working at target was a great experience. Its also a great job if your a college student. The environment is very clean and management is on top of their game when it comes to employees. Career advancement is available if you put the effort and time into it. Overall great experience for me.
good,"Target has been the best job I ever worked at , they wouldn’t let me transfer after I’ve been there a year & I had to leave where I was at & had no choice but to leave my job.. they helped me with more then I can explain ."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, it was truly interesting. Staying focused and on top of work was easy. Also, its a clean worker-able environment  The team work as well suitable for any Associate willing to work at Target."
good,"I enjoy working very much at the Target Store. There is an comradely"
good,"It was fast paced, but the employers helped you if you needed help in your section. Learned how to interact with customers, hardest part was keeping off with the clothes on black Friday and Christmas."
good,I really enjoyed working at target. The mangers were very nice and helpful. All the team members worked together. The customers were very pleasents. We were also offered a lot of over time.
good,Working for Target was a nice part time job to have while going to school. It was not enough to live on after school but there was room for advancement.
good,Target was a good place to work I really enjoyed everyone good hospitality but just poor cafe management and not enough open positions to work but other then that I would recommend to a friend for other positions then the cafe part.
good,Learned a lot about warehouse work.Hard work put got easier everyday.very fast pace.manager was great if you did your job.always had the tools to succeed
good,"A typical day is unloading the truck and stocking the shelves. As well if your a cashier you run the register, as well as no matter the position you work with the customers on and off of the stores floor. With this job I learned how to work a basic cash register, as well as how to quickly and effectively stock the shelves and unloading large shipment trucks. "
good,"Working at Target was a great experience for me, having to learn at a fast pace. Understanding each part of the store and the workers around you by making sure each task is executed properly. How we would have our meetings with the hold team naming our work plan out together so that everyone would be on the same page. Making sure each employee is capable of doing the job or needing help to meet the deadline of work needed. I would learn need things and try to have my hand in everyone job position to helping others out or learning to fill that position where it might lack the attention or not able to have all the needs of getting it done. Working at the speed of things just made me want to be there everyday to make sure we are always on top of our stat sheets of pushing products to the floor or back-stocking them where there locations are. Target really help me learn to be flexible on each project I face and to get it done."
good,"At target, I’ve loved my time there! I’ve made such close and lasting friendships and relationships there. The best thing about working at target is there’s so many different positions you could work, cashier, cart attendant, back room, overnight, bakery, deli, produce, etc. You’ll never have a dull moment at target, there’s a lot of action going on!"
good,its good place to work we learned how to help each department when needed they do work as a team .  clean place to work and organized we had a good manager .
good,The work can be monotonous after awhile. Plenty of room for advancement into different areas/departments. Flexible scheduling makes it easy to balance the rest of your life
good,Target was a nice place to work. The stocking and backroom jobs were by far my favorite. Moving around was always a plus. HR was great and there were always jobs that needed to be done.
good,I loved working for Target. There would always be a manager there to give recognition and most co-workers were nice. Plus I was able to do exactly what I loved.
good,Target is a good place to work. Management can get a little annoying at times but its good pay and they keep up with their raises. As long as you doing what you have to do your going to get a good pay raise.
good,Great if you are into a fast paced retail environment. You learn about everything about Target working there because it is one huge market. The job also pays very well compared to minimum wage jobs
good,"It was honestly one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. I’d recommend it to anyone from the legal age authorized to work, and up. It’s always busy, so you’re always busy. But it’s worth it. They appreciate consistent employees who care and show their appreciation for the job."
good,Great company to work for if you like talking and interacting people. I liked back stocking my performance seems to work better while I'm under pressure.
good,The HR team rewards the team with weekly events. The job is fun but the pay could be increased for select positions. I do suggest working here if you are interested in growing a career.
good,Was told I was going to have 30+ hours a week and now I’m getting less than 25. I love the job I’m just looking for more hours because I’m loving on my own and I wish there was more to do when working. I felt like I’m standing doing nothing all the time.
good,"the hours is low and very quickpace, but you can increase it after probation based off your performance and your willing to work."
good,It's a great experience you meet amazing people from time to time. You get 30-minute lunches and 15-minute breaks in between work. The people you work with are cool but like everywhere some days the customers are very rude.
good,"The CA store was a model for teamwork and for leaders to actuallybe leaders with their teams.  Recognition for all was there by all leadership. was able to teach whenever needed in the store to all team members.  Always had an open door policy for any concerns or suggestions, the team always felt comfortable when they needed to talk about concerns and felt valued."
good,Target is a place for everyone to get together and work hard. Your team is your group of co workers but also friends. I loved working at target. I will recommend.
good,"- Once you get the hang of what you are expected to do, it is very easy to catch on."
good,I loved working in Logistics it was fun and exciting every day. I had a great team of people caring and hard working.we also were very  competitive. the culver city store was a great store work at.
good,"I had a good experience working here. Management was good, the benefits they offer is excellent. There is room for advancement here. And relocating is also an option."
good,Target was a Fun and Friendly enviornment to work in. The staff was Nice and the Managers were Nice as well. They all made sure breaks were given on time to all cashiers!
good,"A typical day was normally set and usually I knew what we were doing for that day. I learned a lot about customers and the retail job experience, which included customer and associate expected behavior.I can't really think of a hard part to the job, I loved it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment itself."
good,I enjoyed my experiences there with management and employees. It was challenging work and competitive. I would recommend anyone who is not afraid of hard work to apply.
good,"Come in to work and gather your plan for the day. Usually there would be 10,or so, planograms. Each Team Lead has their own section of the store. Grab all your reshops from customer service and go to my block. We carry radios as well to respond to lanes, help customers and communicate with rest of leads and team. Had a good team so we had fun while we worked. If my dad hadn't gotten sick, I would have stayed."
good,"I loved my managers, fellow employees but not really the customers . They're generally stuck up, rude and bougie. If you can get pass that then you will love this job !"
good,Awesome place to work. Environment is great for a IT Call Center. Queue's are not not over the top like most call centers you'd think of. Pay it's very well for entry level IT positions. Management for the most part are here to help you and will assist you in anything that you need.
good,I unload trucks and push merchandise to the floor. The team is a happy carefree group that works well together. Management is always willing to listen and take suggestions on how to improve the process.
good,"Working at Target was an amazing journey. An environment that is very employment friendly and at the same time fun loving. Target defines Teamwork. Hope i get to work there again,"

good,"Typical day at work would be either going to either Starbucks, café or cashier and start handling customers with serving them and as well as keeping area nice and clean"
good,very flexible with my school and other work schedule. Its a great place to work if they paid more I probably would've stayed. Management is very helpful and you can train in different areas
good,"It is fast paced, balancing task work and customer service. I was mainly a store operator, which is answering and transferring calls. I also helped with whatever task my other team members needed help with. I was often on the floor as well, helping customers with their questions and concerns, while also multitasking with product placements, zoning, and stock."
good,I’ve enjoyed every minute at Target my only regret is that I’m not given enough hours to support myself. If your looking for a good first job Target is definitely it.
good,"“Team” is important here! Leaders strive to focus on team members and the flow of the store. The atmosphere is really great! The only downfall is, if you want to change your availability due to school (whether for yourself or children) they are unwilling to do so."
good,Target is a fast paced work environment but you get very well trained for the job expected. Target has health benefits as well as retirement. Definitely a place you will not be bored because it changes every day.
good,"The management at Target was great, all of the managers were kind but still knew how to get things done in a productive manner. The hardest part about the job was probably that my knees would start to hurt after folding lower shelves."
good,"OK, first i was a challenge but going more into depth with the job got me where i needed to be so i could make thing work out and be better at my jobs that i had to up hold."
good,"Working at Target was great. Everyone was friendly, helpful and team oriented. The management would help the hourly team when they needed help on the floor. A downside: Employees only got 30 minute lunch breaks. I was able to advance to an hourly management position within 6 months. Workplace was fun and fast paced, would get hectic during the Christmas holiday shopping season."
good,Great overall environment to work. everyone is very very nice. the work isnt too difficult and you generally work together. the only downside is hours and benefits

good,Provided a great work environment with great pay. management was fair and had a nice break room. the employee discount was also very nice and there was a Starbucks inside.
good,"Target is so much fun and especially if you have friends but something it does get stressful but always leaving home happy. One thing I don’t like if you work in the  Beauty area is that you can not leave from your area, so you make time go faster by helping guest, zoning."
good,Every place has  its ups and downs but I really did like the work environment. The mangers was understanding and easy to talk with if you had any issues.
good,Worked with great people terrible hours for flow team production but everyone was cooperative and the teamwork was great. the uniform was extremely relaxed in my position    .
good,Overall a good place to work especially when your going to school. It’s fast paced job but once you get hang of it it can become a great place to work. Get paid really well compared to other places
good,"the first thing is to have a mini morning meeting to discuss current issues and what needs to be worked on during the day."
good,"Target is a great place to work. It really benefits students and those that are retired. The hours are flexible and changeable, which can cause conflict if you have another job. Be sure to put down your true availability, this will be even if you are not scheduled. So if someone calls out, you will be expected to work. I love the atmosphere, work with some incredible people, and the customers are great, you learn a lot on a daily basis."

Working in the back room can be a little fast paced, meeting time goals can be tight, but it makes the day go faster"
good,"Very busy company, no matter what kind of whether. Managers favor people, promote those who they like instead of who deserves it . They always have pp&j in the breakroom"

good,A good starting job that can provide for necessary job skills in the future. Good pay and give 45 mins for a lunch break. Good discounts on certain items too.
good,"my team was great to work with. Management took time to talk and meet you half way in reaching your goals. They weren't afraid to do the basic jobs below their pay grade, and customer service was always number one. The only slight drag is selling the red cards and meeting that quota, but managent works with you to try and get you to reach your goal. They are strict on giving you breaks on time and making sure you're feeling good while doing your job."
good,Environment is friendly and well taken care of. The store is organized and management makes sure that you are feeling well and that you are comfortable with what you are doing.
good,Every day you are constantly busy with supporting the staff and running the store. Be prepared to be on you feet for long periods of time.

good,"Shift would be exclusively at the check-out checking customers purchases.  Occasionally I would work in the Spot's discount part of the store, Organizing the inventory, putting the items back where they belonged."
good,"While I enjoyed my coworkers and the culture, I felt the HR department left a lot to be desired. No one was informed that I was a new worker and I was left to teach myself how Target worked, which of course meant I got some things wrong. I was gently and helpfully corrected, but I felt thee could have been a better program for new hires, to help them learn and understand job tasks."
good,Faced paced but with training able to learn to make production. Coworkers willing to help. Good Benefits. Hardest part learning to keep with production.
good,Target is an amazing place to work no matter your age. No matter if this is your first job or you one of many Target will personally become an amazing place for you to work.

A normal truck day for me consist of unloading electronic security items and incasing then for Asset Protection purposes, along with stocking on shelves and overstock in backroom. Ive learned all about Targets eco system dealing with how items are managed in our PDA system, counts on hand, etc. My direct managers are very considerate and tend to ask me how to organize or increase workflow with the other electronic team members. The hardest part of my day is if we don't have a item for a guest/customer, i have a few options to get around us as a store not having but sometimes its not good enough for some guest/customers. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the my schedule and benefits, along with helping happy little kids get the games and toys they want."
good,"I was the Team Relations Manager for Target and I found the work environment fun and upbeat."
good,great work environment. management is laid back and yet they keep things running smoothly. typical day at work is laid back but quick paced your always moving
good,"Great pay. Great benefits. Not so fun work schedule. I resigned right before it was mandatory to work every 3rd weekend. Management was OK. (If you had the right supervisor.) Some managers play favoritism. The amazing part was the potlucks, coworker-relationships developed, very lenient with work-life balance, and HR was understanding. A TON of benefits was available to me. I would go back if I had the chance."

good,"As the summary says, its Target. If you have shopped at Target before then you know what the stores are like. Usually, you have a great visit to Target and you get that same feeling from working at Target as well. The management is great with decent structure and very helpful team members for new people. The jobs themselves are not difficult in most cases with responsibilities being clear and easy to do for most individuals."
good,"I have always loved working in Target as it was my 1st job. As a fresher I learned so many things. For 1st four months I was working for the payroll team and with a good opportunity I internally moved to Accounts Payable team. Here my job was to process vendor invoices with the receipts and pay the bill. There was always healthy competition in the team. The managers were very much supportive. As i was interested in Cultural activities my manager supported me to participate in many events and I could learn skills like Time management, multitasking. The most enjoyable part of the job was competing with each other to increase productivity and quality as a team."
good,I learned a lot at target and developed my customer service as well as a considerable amount of cashier experience. I am grateful for my time at target.
good,"My position was really fast paced but everyone was very nice and very helpful. Typically I would go out on the floor to pick online orders and then bring them back to the backroom to pack them. I learned how to properly package items, stock shelves, use a compacter, etc. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done before the UPS guy came to pick up the packages. The most enjoyable was the actual packaging."
good,Target distribution in Woodland California is very competitive and high pace they had a very good schedule you would work for 10 hour days and you will get three days off and the night shift you made more It was also a team effort to get the work done I would refer people to work there if your local you can make some very good money management is very strict but also about going up the same time
good,Enjoyed daily culture because there was always somethings fun going on. Store team has always had food available for them and leadership team prepared fun events to maintain the culture.

good,"Enjoyed working for parcelnet, great team of people that all work very hard to provide great service to their customers."
good,"what i learned at Target is customer service is key, my typical day was very busy with alot of customer interaction. The hardest part of the job was getting used to their cash register but i was able to learn quickly with ease."
good,The company is constantly changing and help employees feel more comfortable at work. While sometimes the changes come quick it may take a little time to get used to the changes. Management does their best to listen to their employees and help them with the changes. The online store/ship to store dept. was gaining more work and constantly on the lookout for customer orders. I worked the flow team so we would be the ones unloading the trucks in the morning and with ship to store people running around constantly it was not uncommon to see them come through looking for items we had just unloaded from the truck. All in all as a team we worked quickly and efficiently to make sure we got our own work done while also helping others if needed.
good,"I honestly don't know what to say about this company except I wish I could go back. I only quit due to relocation but I loved every single manger. Shout out to my Mall 205 Target in Portland, OR!"

good,"I worked as a seasonal hardlines associate at Target and was surprised to discover how positive my experience was. The staff was incredibly kind and encouraging, the work was not too difficult or overwhelming, and there was always work to be done. Not boring at all. Every one of my co-workers was friendly and we were allowed to socialize freely while we worked. It made for a very comfortable work environment. "
good,"Target is fair about it's work performance. There is good advancement opportunity if you are diligent about your work, put in good effort, and show quality in your task."
good,"Eat a heavy lunch."
good,Target was a wonderful experience. They opened door ways and taught me a lot about customer relations. Starting at cash registers and introduced to cash office. They allowed me to flex my time down to part time. I was the cash office and customer service trainer. When I went in that was always my fun job in a great working environment. Managers cared about all employees and kept team informed.
good,"Great jobs, has its ups and downs but if you got a love for electronics a great job, answering some basic questions will be a must do stay on top new realsed items"
good,Target has showed me you kind find fun in the workplace no matter what you are doing. The management works with you. Its easy to get a day off if you need it.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping guest giving the best customer service that I can give making my job a friendly atmosphere, working well with other team members working closely with most of the managers providing assistance when needed with difficult projects."
good,"A typical day at work was interacting, answering questions with guests. Our number one rule was to always make our guests comfortable. I learned so many things while working for Target, One of them was that being punctual was is always important, if you do a great job at your job you get rewarded. I also learned to have a lot more patients with people and keeping calm under any circumstance.  Management over all was great. They were friendly to our guests and to the employees. I would say that the hardest part of the job was not really having a set schedule and having crazy hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was when a guest would be mad because they didn't like something that was in the store and I would try my best for them to not have a bad impression of our store and I would try to make them feel much better and then they would go to my supervisor and give them good comments about me."
good,"Management needs help in communicating to team better, lack of respect for the employees and stop the favoritism,  hours could be better for part timers."
good,"Demanding but fun place to work. Team members are happy and friendly, but everyone is highly skilled and great and what they do. A lot is asked of you regarding people skills and customer service, and you will learn a lot about being your best at all times. Welcoming and friendly place to work!"
good,"I worked up in the front lanes, or better known as a cashier. My coworkers and I would have lots of fun together. We made sure the guest had just as much fun. The supervisors were very understanding about everything, if you had any questions they would answer it right away. If you need help or didn't understand how to handle a certain situation they would take the time and help and show you."
good,"Work is very productive yet not often stressful. Management is very helpful and excellent at training, while team members are often willing to work together to ensure brand quality across the store"
good,"target was a family . we all looked out for each other ,we pushed each other to meet daily goals. I learned fast pace and how to hold a smile . I greeted each guest , smiled and made their visit to target as wonderful as I could all while scanning and bagging nice and organized . the hardest part was getting guests to open reed cards since almost every one already has one , even so that never stopped me from asking and convincing them to open another one ."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone who has no problem with people, high charisma, and patience. This job is lovable, although patience is needed, I never dreaded going to work."

good,"Loved the people that I worked with. Loved how it was always different every day. Sometimes it was crazy and fast-paced, other times it was nice and relaxed."
good,"It was an extremely pleasant place to work and if not for closing its doors I would still be there."
good,Target has an exceptional management team.  They genuinely care about their team members and pay a fair wage.  The only negative is the inability to become a assistant manager if you do not have a bachelors degree.  Experience does not count if you want to work in upper management only a degree. If it was not for that I would have never left the company.
good,its a fast working paced environment with a lot of hard working people everyday. It has a lot of people that are from different cultures. the hardest time is when a customer can not decide on what they need or want and you try your best to help them to deicide then they disagree.
good,"Target has a quick-paced, friendly and helpful work culture. I gained experience in time management and balanced numerous tasks daily while adhering to deadlines. The work was diverse but not too unpredictable. The company has a respectful philosophy for customer service shown by their practice  refer to customers as ""guests."" It could get stressful at times, especially around the holiday and ""back-to-school"" seasons and the flow could be challenging to tackle at times. Overall, it was a good work experience for me and would recommend Target to anyone looking for a retail position."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. fast paced environment, don't plan on waiting for show one to do it for you. You should be ready to hit the floor and work until your scheduled shift is over."
good,"Working at target gave me the skills to be successful. I was with target for almost a year and a half. During my time with target, I got to cross train in different positions that helped in case someone called out and if I wanted extra cash (lol.) I would communicate with your Team Lead and the other team lead on which team you’ll want to train in... for example; I started out as a flow Team Member, then build up to a cashier and everything came naturally. I ended up being trained in besides flow, cashier, hardlines, consumables and backroom. Only thing I wasn’t trained in was Starbucks, softlines, and any management position."
good,"Great retirement job, Flexible about working part time hours.  "
good,"Great teammates, managers, perks and atmosphere.  I would work there again.  Great place to learn about corporate culture that is nurturing and supportive."
good,"Target was one of my most favorite jobs , I️ recommend to anyone who is looking for consistency , drive in your work & from team mates , & involved & motivating managers. I️ would love to work for them again if the offer was ever present."
good,Customer oriented job which requires guest satisfaction as the most important aspect of the job. Hours are limited and the schedule never stays the same. Unfortunately after the busy season November through December the hours get cut drastically which is a downfall for some . If you are looking for a job with good values and a company that is always looking to improve on products and sales offers this is the Company. They offer a great employee discount and if you have a Red Card thats  an added plus.
good,"I was a over night stocker and it was really fun and enjoying, got to work alone and together with co  workers at the same time, the people were very friendly."
good,"A typical day at Target is just like any other retail store.."
good,Target is a very friendly open place to work. the only downside is how much they push you to go fast however they make up for it with treats. They are also very flexible with hours.
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with!  While the hours were sometimes tough, the people that I got to work with made it worth it!  While I did work as management, I made friends at all levels and if you're willing to make the sacrifices for the hours this is a great company to work for!"
good,"As far a retail management it is a great company to work for.  They pay fair, good benefits and they try to give a work and home life balance.  Like any other job your direct manager can make or break the culture, but overall great place to work."
good,"Target is a great place to work. They are flexible with scheduling and good with break time. Managers are very team oriented and my overall experience working here has been great. Just keep busy and do your work. Plus, guest experience is key!"
good,"Great place to work, stress free, management and coworkers were very nice.  Training in different department was helpful.  Sometimes we received free lunch."
good,Working at Target is a great advantage for a people like me to earn a more knowledge and explore different job works.  Target gives me more advancement to achieve more.
good,"We would clock in and then do the morning pulls. Next, we would have to stock all of the food that was pulled and check dates on food. Then, we would wait for the truck and when that came we would have to unload the truck and stock all the new food. With the food we weren't able to stock, we'd have to back stock it all."
good,Great place to work never a boring moment there’s always work to be done. Most customers are regulars so you build good relationships with the community by giving good service and target is all about pleasing there customers any way possible
good,"A typical day of work was heading to the back of store, helping the unloaders unload the freight and putting the inventory on L-carts. Then we would take the L-carts to designated aisles then we would begin stocking. I learned how to use a PDA, myDevice, and cardboard bailers. Overall it's a good place to work. Great job if you're a student. Really flexible hours and good pay."
good,"Very good place to work, but scheduling is often screwed up, and other employees are often unreliable so you end up taking the fall for them not showing up or for not doing their job correctly."
good,It was a great opportunity to work on my sales associate and cashier experience. Team works was very easy every one will get along with everyone. Scheduling was great.
good,Target is a great place to learn a wide range of operations that go on behind the scenes when it comes to retail. The environment was relaxed but also fast-paced. Holiday season is always crazy and more hours are definitely guaranteed but once Holiday season is over hours are scarce.
good,"Each new hire goes through training for two weeks so that you are well prepared for the job, and the company always was very well staffed at the location I worked at so tasks got done and you got off work at the scheduled time."
good,"I worked at Target as a seasonal full time, I learned many leadership skills and had many opportunities to lead and learn each department to help with future advancements."
good,I loved it nice setting beautiful building free parking plenty of places to eat in building I had my own desk inside of my own cubicle with 3 computers
good,"Great work environment. You do have to ask for more hours since you start off with little hours, and you have to do well to get more hours. Almost all jobs have a collaborative effort since there are a lot of employees"
good,I would arrive about five minutes before my shift and would clock in and then I would go out to the cashier area and I would work for probably 4-8 hours. It was long work and it wasn't that much fun and not really an enjoyable work environment.
good,I had a good time working for the company a good relaxed calm environment really welcoming people. Easy to get a long with the management team they work well with you
good,Quick Paced. A typical day was me packing items management was very picky on who they like they had favorites. The 12 hours would go by quickly because we couldnt tell how dark it was outside.
good,"When you go in you go to the back where the ruck is pulled in and the pallets are laid and ready there is a beltline going and you go to an assigned location and begin grabbing packages and placing them where they go. Later you pull your pallet onto the floor where you begin to stock your isles they prefer you stock the majority of your pallet before your first break. Typically it is preferred that you are done before the store opens, if not you take your pallet to the back and begin using buggies. The managers were nice and understanding and they randomly play games for prizes to keep employee moral high."
good,"The typical day involve us interacting with customers and leaving good impressions. I learn that being great with people can open many doors in life. The management was fair and they inspired positivity within the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was managing multiple customers, and the most enjoyable part was meeting a new person everyday."
good,Great benefits. Come and do your job and you should be fine. Be informed of your job in and out. Ask questions if you need to. Be able to speak clearly concerning finished or unfinished projects.
good,Iliked working at target doing cashiering. i learned how to use the cash register and  help customers with their purchases. zoning was nice too i liked cleaning up and making the shelves neat.
good,I've worked for Target a for about two years and some change. Best job I ever had!  It was easy to work there. And the people I met from there are wonderful . Great Place
good,great work environment. everyone treated fairly. work together as a team to get complete tasks. management team treats each employee fairly and with respect.
good,"Target is an excellent place to work. The staff is usually fun. The benefits are great. The workload is typically shared evenly. The worst part, as with any job during holiday seasons, is the cleaning up after closing. The most enjoyable parts, however, are the volunteer efforts. Going to various places and doing nice things for people."
good,"Target is peaceful and steady paced to busy. Few hours means you can take some classes also. I really liked this job on the way to pharmacy, medical, or lab science degree."
good,"I liked working at Target but unfortunately some of the employees were not entirely dedicated to their work and responsibilities. I had to cover a lot of shifts which I am know to do, but it got old. Theres no I in team I guess"
good,"I worked at Target several years ago and LOVED it, looking to come back to Target. They really take care of the employees. Always learning new things to grow professionally and advance. Yes getting a promotion csn be a challenge but work hard, don't give up and make sure your leadership team knows wherw you want to go. They will help yoi get there."

good,the target in which I worked was fun because of my coworkers. The job requires minimum effort and the pay is great. There is room to advance as long as you carry a good work ethic with you throughout your time there.
good,"I worked at Target as seasonal. It was a peace environment. I was a cashier. Customers were always nice. You barely see a grouchy customer. Target focused a lot on their customer service. Even tho, I was just a cashier I had to greet the customer the best i could and end their experience as best as possible. I also, offered Target credit cards , that would give the benefit the customer a 5% DISCOUNT  everytime they shop at target. "
good,"I worked at Target in Venice, Fl. and it was fun. The people were amazing, fun & friendly.  I have a new respect for what it takes to make a store operate.  I loved this job!

good,Worked 10 hour nights had 3 day weekends. Depending on the season sometimes it gets slow where as Christmas and back to school work picks up again. In the summer its warm as it is a warehouse so they use industrial fans instead of air conditioning. As a packer you're constantly going back and forth on the line you're working and you have to meet a quota at the end of the shift
good,My family and I have been coming to target optical for our glasses for years and we choose to come back because of the energetic and helpful atmosphere the employees provide. I enjoy being a apart of this team because it is fast paced and allows much more independence than other jobs do. My favorite part of my job is helping customers choose the glasses that fit their personality and style. I currently work at the Target located in the River Point shopping center and I love my manager. She works extremely hard to make sure the store is running smoothly and helps the associates when needed. I absolutely love this job.
good,When I go to work I love to see my team they are the reason I go to work everyday. I am busy all the time I am always on my feet but in my position that is normal being a salaried  manager. The management is great but sometimes I feel like I am all alone as far as how far I will go with the company. The culture in the store has gone down hill since our store manager was let go and someone new came on. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done all in one day. The most enjoyable part of my day is going to work and seeing all my team.
good,"Cashier for almost three years, really loved it. I think we got pushed a little about redcards. You can get crossed train in different areas so if you want to move around you can."
good,"I started this job as extra Christmas money, but then I saw how management and other team members were. Great place to work, very fair! All around great"
good,"great job , nice shopping set up , great employee discounts and give away. holiday gifts to employees, great shift adjustments, quality products and service"
good,Working at Target was awesome. My co workers were amazing and so helpful. Meetings before work everyday to discuss daily objectives. Amazing place to work.
good,I really enjoyed working at target. The managers were pretty nice and laid back. I was able to get more hours if needed and when i wanted to learn different departments of the store they allowed me to do so. i was a part time worker so i didn't get any benefits besides the discount then. I worked there about 3 or 4 years ago some some things may have changed. They were also pretty good about allowing me the time off or switch of work times so i could make doctors appointments for myself and child.
good,"Customer oriented, fast paced environment, team players, organized, clean, professional, benefits weren't offered, good job during college, good way to be outgoing and provide customer service."
good,"Fast, fun and friendly workplace.  Amazing team members/friends.  No matter what worcenter you are scheduled to do we all come together to help our guests.  Our guests are first."
good,They supervisors are amazing and work well with their employees. They are also very lenient when it comes to schedule changes and that makes they helpful when you might need to call out or switch a ay that you might not be able to come in. They allow u to come in and pick up hours on your day off
good,"A typical day at Target is never typical.  Every day is something new and always brings new opportunities with it.  Every shift was an opportunity to brighten someone's day."
good,"management was friendly and understanding , job expectations were clearly defined. initiative was rewarded and management was willing to work with individual schedules whenever possible"
good,"I really enjoyed this job. It was fun, exciting, and trendy. The bonus structures were GREAT! I actually miss working here. Perhaps I will go back! Oh, and great products!"
good,"Target is an exciting place to work. As a Target Protection Specialist, you learn how to interact with many different people. Time management is a must and going above and beyond expectations is something that is recognized. The management at Target, for the most part, is really great. They are easy to communicate with and allow themselves to be available."
good,target was one of the best places to work for.they really came through when i needed them.i would recommend target a good place to work.i would still be at target if i had not lost my husband and had to move.
good,I really enjoyed working here and still do. There  just  not a lot of  chances to grow . It has taught me valuable lessons and the abitly to understand what its truly like to be a hard worker
good,"A work day consist of unloading trucks, inventory, and stocking products. At first hours weren't great, however, once management knew I was a reliable worker my hours increased."
good,"I had a very good experience working here and have very little to complain about. Contrary to those ""retail horror stories,"" it was usually very enjoyable and rewarding to work here."
good,"A typical work day at Target can be stressful at times because of what is excepted from the employees, but the tasks at hand are not hard, just a lot to do in one day.  Management was always great, a great team to work with, friendly coworkers that are much more like family.  the hardest part is always the rude customers, but not all of them.  The best part of the job was working with such great team members."
good,"Easy to pick up on tasks and follow a general schedule. Fellow employees are very easy to get to know. I learned how to multitask under pressure and time constraints. Management was generally pretty great and understanding when real life issues popped up. "
good,"This was the best job I've had. I would come in do a mid day zone. Then work pull's (product to shelf). After that your team zones the store. Then put away your go-backs. If you work during the day you would do planograms, help guests out, and work pull's. Backroom you pull the hourly batches (these are timed) to fill the sales floor. Saturday nights you take down the ad. Sunday mornings the ad setup team comes in and sets up that weeks ad up. They will help you learn how to interview give you chances to learn how to manage a team. Hardest part of the job is getting team buy-in when you aren't a manger. Best part is easy work with good pay. If you are a top performer they would give you a gift."
good,"At target you learn many skills that will help you maintain a good understanding of how to be social with the customers in order to sell a product or by also containing a good attitude that attracts customers into the store, another point would be that you learn organizational skills that attract the eyes of a person to various assortments of products."
good,The leads are so great to work with. The pay attention to each members talents and likes and can delegate little tasks through out the week that are bases on those talents and likes as long as the team member wants to take on these little tasks. There are always opportunities to expand a little and learn a new job.
good,"Target is all about Team Work. Everyone in the company works together to get things done, whether you are in the warehouse or on the sales floor. I would definitely recommend this as a job."
good,Most people are professional. I learn how to work with each other as a team. Everyone is very acceptive and welcoming when it comes to new members. The hardest part of the job is to make sure everything goes smoothly when it's busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is we all are able to joke and have fun working together.
good,"Great team and management. Flexible hours. Customers are a priority. Learned a lot on the products. Fun place to work, supervisors try their best to meet employees needs."
good,A typical day is face-paced. I learned a lot about inventory and stockroom information. The management was encouraging. The workplace culture is very modern. Hardest part of the job is unloading trucks almost every day. The most enjoyable part was meeting new friends. Having a serious but comfortable day.

good,"Working at Target is Fun and Enjoyable with options to advance"

good,"This was my first job, this job taught me a lot, it was easy and I met a lot of great people here as well, hours was hard to get Due to over staff at times."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal cashier, and it was one of the most fun and relaxed work enivironments I've been a part of. I learned more from my time at Target than anywhere else. I would strongly recommend Target to anyone looking for a place in retail."
good,"I loved the environment that it gived, it was very open it would get busy very fast and sometimes slow but, interacting with the costumers daily lives were fun to hear, random question on a certain item and I would point out where it would be, the feeling was good telling them so they can get on with daily living."
good,"I've enjoyed working for the company since I joined in December of 2016. My team leaders are very supportive of me in all I do, which is fantastic. I would definitely recommend joining the team at Target if one has the opportunity."
good,"Target was my first job, and I worked there for four years. Fast, fun, friendly pretty much sums up the company. I enjoyed working for Target, I always stayed busy which is great becaus e it makes your day go by quick."
good,I worked for this company but didnt care for the pay. Raises are terrible here. Worked 5years pay started at 8.00hour and still wasn't at 9.00 in 5yrs
good,"Loading 4-7 trailers at a time at the required fast pace is a difficult task to begin with but once you maintain your lanes and managers approve, you move on to driving equipment to sort freight which is easier than loading. Once you do that, specialty functions such as Mezzanine Operator will be considered. That's the most enjoyable part of the job, earning what you worked for."
good,Target was a cool place to work for. Real laid back good night-shift workers and fast paced at the same time I worked there and really enjoyed my time there
good,"I was a great job, I was paid well and I had a set schedule that hardly changed.  I would recommend working here to anyone who asked me.  This was a great job."
good,"Great company to work for. So many perks and benefits. Only wish it was easier to move up in the company, that's my only complaint. "
good,"It was a very productive place to work i learned alot from working at target as a cashier, and then as a retail sales Woman. The one on one interaction with the guest was my favorite part, i kept guests updated on promotions, sales and coupons the guest may have missed in our store circular."
good,Was feeling good how people treat me  especially  my CO workers.I moved location was really hurt that my time watching up at target. But it's not over I can be whatever I want in life.
good,There is a lot of diversity in Target.  They give you plenty of room to learn the day-to-day operations and several chances to advance with the company.
good,"I think the company is very accepting, and cares about its employees. I have learned how to become a leader, and develop my own skills within the workplace."
good,Work is work none the less but at least work at Target at 140 N 12th ave. in Hanford has a team that has character. Honorable mentions to the early morning team leaders for keeping the team pumped up.
good,I've work at target for about a year and the management is great the pay is better than most retailers and they are great about working with you on scheduling.
good,"Working at Target was awesome! The pay was very competitive. The patients that visited the pharmacy were attractive. We dispensed a lot of birth control and contraceptives at my store's pharmacy. The team as a whole was actually a team and was very helpful. Too bad CVS Pharmacy acquired Target Pharmacy, or else I would have stayed and went to go on to become an executive intern for the company."
good,Target wasnt a bad place to work at at all. You would get rude customers here and there but thats with any place where you need to provide customer service.
good,It's a good job to work at. My coworkers are really fun to work with and they help me learn a lot. The costumers are loyal and funny. This is a great experience for customer service.
good,"Working in the soflines area was okay. If you like working with cloths and shoes, then soflines is for you. If you'd rather stock food then hardlines is best. Basically, Target has a specific job for everyone."
good,"From the people, to the management, to the culture, Indeed is amazing! The culture is fun and fosters learning and growth. Management is in tune with what employees need and are always there to teach you and guide you."
good,"A typical day at work involves deep cleaning, engaging with guest and make sure you get to all the tasks. I've learned how to somewhat manage a group, make my own decisions when a leader isn't around and to communicate and lead my team. Management there is ALL about pleasing the guests, so you can say its good. As for management with the team members, you can tell who is someones favorite. The hardest part of my job is probably order/pallet days because you have to date, FIFO and put away things and 40% of the time there is no room, so thats when the problem solving kicks in. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the bond that you create with people: your regulars, coworkers, and leads."
good,I loved working here. It was fun and very friendly coworkers. They had fun things in our breakroom like everyday and they always fed us good. It's a very easy job.
good,"everyone is nice and are willing to help you. breaks are nice, you get a 15 minute break every to hours and a 45 minute lunch. low stress job at the most part if you are willing to have great customer service."
good,"I would help unload trucks and then put all the packages where they go. I would also have to stock the floors, and help customers with whatever they needed. I learned about back stocking items and how to read labels on an aisle in a store. I liked the managers here a lot. The hardest part of the job was getting there, I didn't have a car I had to walk in the rain. I enjoyed every part of my job."
good,Excellent environment and culture. Great pay but hard work for it. Hardest part of the job is the long hours. After you are paid at the beginning of every week all is forgiven.
good,"Target is really making some great improvements right now. The work is hard, but it's innovative and exciting. It's nice to be part of a successful transformation."
good,Must be able to lift approximately 50 pounds. Fast- Paced job. Overnight Stocker. Friendly Environment. Clean Environment. Make sure the customers were treated nice.
good,"Great company to work for.  Diverse and a great volunteer program."

good,The best part of working with Target was the people. The restock team was helpful and communication was good. Hardest part of working was having to wake up in the A.M.. But overall great experience.
good,I work with the overnight stocking team and it has been by far my favorite place to work. Aside from friendly compassionate coworkers the serenity of working in the nigh empty store is sublime. Work is easy to execute.
good,"I loved working here. It's like being around one big family, the management is great. They don't call it management though, they call it Team Leads, helps you think of them less as a boss and more as a team player.  It's a nice job."
good,Awesome day at work with coworkers around to fill the atmosphere. Interesting day at work and enjoyable. Always pleasing guest.
good,"On an average work day, I will do go- backs and organize the racks in the ready to wear department (woman). I will also help with operator (fitting room) and cashiering. Management was great and organized my work place was always clean and ready for the next team. It was a very easy job and one day of training helped a lot. the best part of the job was the Team. they were always so helpful and friendly and that's what really made things easy"
good,A wonderful company if you are a full time employee. Great benefits and fast growth opportunity. The only problem is the hourly rate you are paid for the big responsibility you are assign to.
good,I loved working in truck flow work early get off early its easy simple and working with the merchandise you learn where everything goes i enjoyed target.
good,"My store in Tonawanda is a high volume store which keeps you busy all throughout the day, the managers actually care about making you happy, they're like family."
good,"Target was one of my coolest jobs, and I'm honestly sad that I was only hired on for a seasonal position, because I would have loved to stayed. Every single employee is treated with respect the second they're hired. The management has no problem with anyone or anything really. I've got to say the most impressive part of working for Target was that the schedule was never, and I mean never, late. Or the fact that when I broke my shoulder, they gave me the leave I needed (4 days) and worked with my doctor's orders, instead of firing me."
good,"I've learned a lot while working at target, not really that hard tbh and anyone should be able to do it as long as they pay attention and don't slack off. Working there for about 6 months was great actually, got to meet new (amazing) people, and help a lot of the guest that would come in. Always nice to see a smile on someone face...  specially if you're the one who put it there."
good,I learn a lot working with the staff helping the guest out to the best of my knowledge started a program to help team members work together volunteer set up different events to get them involved in reduce a lot of tension in the work place.
good,I really like the company and would really enjoy working with the company and other team members. It's a great environment to work in and there are great people working there
good,"The pay and hours are really great.During the 90 day period, if you take off. You get put under the non rehirable list. No matter how bad the emergency was. Or even if you had a doctors note, stating the reason you had to miss work."
good,"amazing store to work in ."
good,They work with you to help you succeed. The work is not hard and you get help. With a positive attitude you can do anything. I miss working for target.
good,"Really love being a Barista in the Starbucks department. It is the fun of Starbucks with the benefits of Target. It is rather hard to get time off or change availability, but pay is very good and so are benefits if one were to choose to use them. Also, a lot of room for advancement even just in the retail stores. Great connections."
good,"A typical day at work was relaxed, there was not a lot of different things going on at the same time to distract you. I've learned how to handle the cash register and answer phones professionally. The management was great, many different team leads to help you with any task. Co-workers were delightful; filled with joy and fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was the holiday times. Most enjoyable part was working with nice people."
good,"Incredibly fast-paced. Team relations are very important and will not only decide your day-to-day life, but possibly where your career is going. From what I observed, very easily to move around company if you are willing to put in the work."
good,"Overall working at Target was a pleasure. I hope I get to work for more companies that are as culturally diverse, understanding, and positively structured as this store was."
good,some of the team leads are idiots but still an okay place to go and work at they are caring and try to help you when you need it and are willing to try and learn what can be done to improve the store the next year around.
good,Everyone including is very helpful and makes the work environment very pleasant. The hardest part of the job I feel is having to push the shopping carts back inside at the end of the day.
good,Since this is Direct Sales and you are in charge of your business it is entirely up to you how your business will unfold.If you put work into it and develop your self. This could be a awesome  work and business experience for you. I will be up to you to work as hard as you want and when you want.
good,"Awesome environment, people are kind and generous. Very helpful, great place to start your retail expirience. Everyone knows your name and conatantly showered with gifts for accomplishments and milestones."
good,"Great benefits.  Target is a team oriented organization, there is no disconnect between upper levels of management and lower levels.  A very fun and fast pace place to work."
good,"Very pleasant and friendly workers, good hours, good benefits, great management, they abide by all the working laws, great work environment."
good,I love the fast pace environment and my co-workers were great and helped me out a lot during my first week at Target. Management could be a little better due to the lack of people hired for the position. Target was and always will be a great place to shop at
good,Is hard not to have a stable schedule. I am a full employee but I don't get mu 40 hours a week. That makes it hard for me to stay with the company even do I like my job.
good,"Working for Target is awesome!! The Target culture is all about being Fast, Fun and Friendly, and it definitely is. Excellent management and fantastic Team Members."
good,"Ability to scale up and grow independently. Able to manage a large share of business and be rewarded for efforts. "
good,Working the 3:00am shifts were the best parts of my day. Stocking shelves and cleaning the store with not only my co-workers but also my supervisors was a great experience. They uphold a great team environment and they made the job a great place to be.
good,"My experience working at Super Target was a fun experience. The management was good and I like all of my coworkers. A typical day at work for me, was to clock in, meet with the supervisor of the department that I worked for, which was solftlines (apparel) and hardlines(salesfloor), and I was to do pulls, restocking items from receiving to the salesfloor, pick up abandons at guest services, and zone the area I was working at. The enjoyable part of the job was to help out customers and working as a team with my coworkers. The only hardest part about the job was the excessive cutting of hours."
good,"Your learn about different coffees, you learn how to steam milk, you learn to make drinks special drinks how to be friendly at all time. You get to meet people from all over."
good,"I love Target, it's an amazing work place. It is fast pace, and you do have to be global meaning willing to learn and work in other work centers. The team leaders and just the team in general is great, and helpful. I've learned so much from there, but I am looking for advancement in HR. That's the position I'm in over there and I love it, but I would like to grow in it. With target there isn't really to much advancement for HR."
good,Company was a clean and fun environment to work in great leadership was a very professional work experience everything was done as a team and there was a lot of respect and appreciation for the hard work you did
good,"A typical day at work is 10 am to 6 pm running abandons. Management is great, the hardest part of the job is the constant standing for your shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is the recognition you get for the hard work you do."
good,The managers and staff are always electric and make going to work everyday fun. They are also very flexible with schedule and having to move days. They also train you very well whether it be in the backroom working the wave or stocking and putting stuff away on the floor.
good,I enjoyed my time working at target during the holidays. Was very clean and treated your employers great. Very friendly environment. I enjoyed working with my employers.
good,"we had fun days at work"
good,I learned from my experience at Target that it is necessary to work together as a team. My co-workers were very pleasant people who cared about the well being of other employees. There was usually food in the break room for employees. The food was probably the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was trying to get people to apply for redcards when the checkout lanes were busy.
good,"My typical work day consist of making customers coffee, (Barista) in a fast pace greet customers the correct way and interact with the customers, too show great customer service. My most enjoyable times working at target in interacting with guest putting smiles on there faces. Coworkers are very friendly, most of them, every job isn't great. They all have them people that don't get along with some people."
good,"Working at Target was awesome loved working with the employees their and love the store. I typical day at target would be working the soft lines sales floor putting out clothes assisting customers, helping them find the size they need, opening the fitting room for them, answering  the store phone providing the guest with information they need checking to see if we have the item in stock before they come to our store or check other target stores to see if they have it and put it on hold for the customer making announcements through the intercom and also helping as a back up cashier."
good,"I would usually eat before a shift, I would always try to stretch as I did physically demanding work. Always start the day off positive, I would also try to motivate the team and get everyone focused. Ive learned what it takes to work hard and keep a steady grip on things."
good,"it was great, i always had fun working at target the employees were all full of life. management was a lot of fun. i wish they would've gave us more benefits while working there."
good,Lots of hours at first.  Hours went down after a while.  I worked until the hours got too short. Manager was great.  Easy to change schedule.
good,Working to create a enjoyable atmosphere for team members and guest that come into our store and working to maintain a productive environment where my team members can thrive
good,"Fun place to work at. Typical college job, I worked there when I wasn't at school or at football. My direct produce manager wasn't a very good manager due to the fact she always called off and was mad when she did come to work."
good,"In my short experience while working at Target was a very pleasant one. The workers were always friendly and always happy to help guests and other team members out. The management of the corporation is done properly and I am happy to say that I have worked at Target and would be happy to work there again. I learned many things such as multi tasking, guest service, working under extreme conditions and just being an even more excellent worker. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with the long hours but it is worth it because the people are friendly and the experience working in retail is amazing."
good,the work was great and the environment was quiet. The management were encouraging but the time was just to short. the tasks were very simple and most night got them done depending of the size was the trucks full of merchandise
good,"I learned to keep my self organized and deal with a rough situation with care and ease. Working with my higher ups is amazing, they help maintain a friendly, productive working environment. They go out of their way to help the sales floor team. My team members must be the best. They are amazing to work with, once needing help, they are always there to help get things done. Team work makes the dream work."
good,A typical day at Target was extremely fun and interesting. I loved showing my guests what it was like to work with great people and be the best that I can be. I learned how to be a team. The hardest part of the job was when failed at a task and it influenced the coworkers around me. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we came together as a team no matter how bad our shift was.
good,The management team is always professional and very kind. They are always looking for ways to improve and welcome any feedback. They also value hard working associates and make sure you are noticed when you go above and beyond.
good,Each work day provided an opportunity to learn a variety of different people each with diverse backgrounds which provided various knowledgeable experiences through conversation. Co- workers and managers were extremely respectful helpful and with it being my first job as well as me being the youngest employee they really took me under their wing but also had fun while working. The greatest part was work never really felt like work.
good,journee chargee et mouvementee de rester sois meme peut importe les situations aux quel on feras fache
good,"Esta empresa fue lo mas importante en mi vida como formacion profesional y podria decir tambien como persona."
good,"While working at target i actually enjoyed my time there i had fun doing every assignment my supervisor gave me. My coworkers were nice to me and if i needed anything they didn't hesitate to help. I learned a lot working at target for example how to assist a customer with finding a such item they're looking to buy, helping out with guest service by checking out customers that wanted to return something. I found my work to be easy nothing hard about it because i have the skills to get something done I am a hard worker and I believe I work harder then anyone."
good,Work days were very interesting with a variety of tasks. Additionally Target had a lot of interactive activities and events. I learned a lot about the retail industry including how to interact well with customers. I learned how to back stock and push merchandise and work in the cash lanes. Management was very positive. They always encouraged  me and coached me along. My co-workers were friendly and competent for the most part. The hardest part of the job was enduring upset and angry customers but I felt like it was something I could handle and was just part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I accomplished my work efficiently which gave me a lot of satisfaction. I additionally enjoyed the times when there were fun activities and lunches provided by the team.
good,C'était merveilleux de travailler chez Target. C'était un emploi enrichissant et stable. Il est dommage que toute les succursales ai fermées.
good,I loved my work for this company and the people that I have worked with.There was always something new everyday to learn and do .I moved on to another company for a larger salary to try and help my children through college.
good,"I absolutely loved working for this Target. I worked there for roughly three years, 6 months as a cashier, and the rest of my time I spent as a logistics team member working graveyard shift. Everyone from the managers to my co-workers were great. Within those 3 years, I was offered 2 opportunities for advancement, so they do give you the chance to move up the chain. Target is a company oozing with integrity. I've never worked for a place that cared so much about the opinion of the customer. We went over customer ratings virtually daily. They offer little prizes (gift cards, foods) for no reason. Our managers made a point to show their appreciation, we got free bob evans breakfast one time, free pizza more than just a few times, dunkin donut breakfasts, subway lunches. You get recognized for your hard work, and it only makes you want to work harder. It was a great place that I'd love to work for again. The pay isn't too shabby. Graveyard shift makes overnight differential so start pay is a little short of $10 an hour when you take differential into account. Annual raises on logistics. As a cashier, raises were a little more regular and based off performance."
good,"I absolutely love working at Target. The work is enjoyable and the team members are fun to experience the day with. I typically stock the shelves and zone. I also assist with cashiering, guest service, electronics, and anywhere else I'm needed."
good,At targt every weekend are the top sells because all the people the come from mexico they also come on the holidays are also the top sale of the year we were ablr to get all the customers out on a short time
good,"Enjoy working there, enjoy the fast pace and that there is always something to do and the opportunity to excel and move up in the company."
good,They give you long and frequent breaks. They listen to your suggestions. When personal problems interfered with a work day the HR team was a shoulder to cry on. They give you a pep talk and get you ready to go back on the floor and give it your all. They make it very easy to sell the company card by educating all new employees. The management team had some real gems and they are more than understanding when you have an off day. They make you feel like part of the family. My co-workers have become long time friends. The hardest part of the job is selling the company card. Not because of lack of knowing what your selling but because sometimes it's hard after a long day to muster up the energy to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on holidays. They always have fun stuff in the break room and tons of great food. They make it less of a chore to be away from home on the holidays because on your breaks your eating great food in a great break room with your second family. They pump you up when you need it and make it a fun and competitive environment. I wish I could have stayed here longer because working at this company really was a treat. They make it easy to move up and they do a great job of showing appreciation to their team members.
good,"A typical day is cleaning up, zoning and organizing merchandise, help guests find what they need. My favorite part of the job is the team members, we can still manage to have a nice day at work no matter how busy the store can be."
good,"Target was fun and always active. There was always something to do. I really liked dealing with customer and helping them find the items they wanted to purchase. "
good,"Cashiering is fun, and fast paced "
good,"I really enjoy working at the Target Center, I am a usher and its fun and everything moves at a fast pace but everything is done well."
good,"Loved the flexibility, recognition everyone received for their hard work, along with the advancement opportunities, pay increases was very fair and often. Co-workers were friendly, I made life long friends there. Within 2 years I advanced to team trainer, it was a wonderful experience, I would have so say being team trainer had to be the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,This is retail and has ups and downs. Over all this is fun place to work and there is lots to do. The HR team is so understanding and when they have to redirect a team member they do it in caring way. We all respect one another.
good,"Target has one of the best retail experiences to offer. The entire team is great to work with. Many of the guests that shop at Target have a great attitude. It's not often that one has to deal with a rude guest,"
good,"Target is a fun place to work but the job security is a little bit shaky cause you can be dropped really fast for no reason"
good,Working at Target allows anyone the opportunity to test their talents and grow through learning opportunities and growth oriented feedback.
good,"i have been really satisfied with this job, "
good,"Even though my position was eliminated, I firmly believe Target is a great place to work.  I am proud to have been a part of this fine organization."
good,"The experience of customer service with Target was a great job, the staff was like a close family.  Even the customers were kind.  I was able to always stay busy."
good,"I am a front end supervisor at Target, I manage the cashiers and I am there if needed, I manage all lunches and breaks and make sure they are given accordingly. I push all cashiers to sell what we call the Target red card which is our credit/debit card. At the end of the day I count all tills and close down all the registers that were in use for the day."
good,A typical day at work is steady.  Nothing hectic goes on and everyone is willing to help wherever help is needed.  Definitely a family oriented environment.
good,"Days are very busy and their structure base is so extensive that for any question there is an answer. "
good,While I was at Target I did many different positions which gave me a ton of experience. I would say they have a great way of developing leaders and the operational processes are well developed. You will work long hours and the common retail shifts.
good,"I loved working at Target. It was a fun experience and environment. Fast pace, hard working and nothing but fun people to work with."
good,"Target is the ideal retail job that anyone starting out in the work field should apply for."
good,The people and general store vibe was great.  Everyone from management down all pitched in and helped complete all the days tasks.
good,I enjoy working with the guest who comes through the checkout line for a fast and friendly checkout.  The Target team is a great team to work with.
good,"The Executive Team Leaders are nice and are understanding on individual personal needs.  The store rewards the team when we all have done a good job.  For example, free food for having green scores at the store."
good,I love working there. It's always busy. I have met a lot of nice people. Normally the day is long and busy and the customers are normally nice. I have learned a lot about operating the cash register and dealing with peoples problems. My co-workers are fun. I think the hardest part is that the hours are different everyday. That is kind of hard when you close at 11p and have to be there by 8a. It's also hard because I live a half hour from my job. I love meeting new people everyday though!
good,"The store was always cleaned properly by the maintenance teams and the managers knew how to organize and set up everything properly. My team lead was very nice and also very strict which was a good balance. I learned alot of responsibility by having things that I directly had to work for on my own and other such things. The hardest part of my job on a day to day basis was lifting things over my shoulders on a ladder that weighed excess of 20-50 lbs( even though I could lift them fine it still was tough on a ladder ). The best part of my job was having fun loving co-workers to speak to throughout the day."
good,It was a good job but now im looking for something better. Its was a part time im looking for a full time job. everyone there was good and hard worker always teamwork
good,Every job i have ever had has been fun i have learn a lot of new things from every job i had and i never got fired from any job i either left because lack of hours or i was working temperaly and i have not really had a hard time with any of my jobs i enjoy working with people and greeting guest and its always been nice to meet new people im smart and easy to get along with and very friendly to everyone love to keep the quest smiling satisfied and happy. i love to challenge myself on new task and trying new things and i really enjoy having to have to put more thoughts in a difficult task and im a fast thinker but i always make it over obstacles i over come anything that may be difficult at first.
good,Target is one of the best places I have worked so far. I mean its fun Super fast. But if your customer service skills are not A+ I don't think you should apply.
good,"its always fun ,you get to meet new people as co-workers or shoppers, you learn time management and patience. there is really no hard part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed the work environment here. Target was a great place to work. Every department helped one another, the customer were pleasant. The overall management team was great."
good,Target was a great place to work.  I love being able to assist the public and interact.  I enjoyed working with some amazing people and I learned a lot about working in retail.
good,"On a typical day at Target Warehouse, upon arrival we did a short meeting for daily notes and goals.  Right after that a short stretching and head to work.  You would then head to your assigned work area, pickup your picking list and start scanning and placing items in boxes for it to be delivered to customers.  Fast paced 10 hours a day four days a week."
good,Fun but very busy company. company is very supportive to team members. They train very well. allow for growth within the company. Management grew very big with new and old team members working there.
good,"fun and friendly checkout service, resolve costumers concerns. meet and greet customers in need of direction for any product and item. great and friendly crew to work with."

good,I really enjoyed working here because they were very organized and the leadership was great. They made sure I was comfortable and understood my goals as a team member.

good,I enjoyed working at Target and if they were hiring again i would do it hours were easy to understand and work with and pay rate was great wish it wasn't only Seasonal
good,always made sure everyone was safe after closing had a buddy system no one goes out side alone at night. And if u wanted to switch hours with people they where really nice about it
good,This job allowed me to achieve my personal goal of finishing my education. Target was a fun place to work that allows for cross training as well as job advancement.
good,The company is very organized and a fun place to work at. Co-workers often provide a lot of support. I worked with great co-workers who were helpful in every step of the way. The guests are very nice for the most part and are very understanding in the pharmacy department.
good,"Working for target is a very fast paced job that requires you to stay on your toes and know what you are doing. If you do not know what to do, do not be afraid to ask someone because they are strict on making sure everything is done correctly, but they understand if something is done incorrectly as long as it is not a regular thing"
good,"I started this job while I was pregnant and the staff was very accommodating to my delicate nature and busy school schedule. The guests who shop at Target are mostly very loyal and love to come in and shop and chat. This company is SO accepting of all types of cultures and lifestyles so it's easy to feel welcome in the store. The hardest part about working here is trying not to spend my entire paycheck at the store! Target only offers a 10% discount and it doesn't seem like enough! Everything is nicely made, appealing to the eye, and easy to shop...I can't resist!"
good,"Target is full of amazing people and a great work environment, they push you to do better, and reward you on good fast work."
good,"I have worked for Target for approximately 6.5 years. Target has been very good to me and has helped develop me into a successful and confident leader. I am also grateful that Target has been very accommodating toward my needs with regards to relocating due to personal life changes. I would recommend Target to anyone looking for a fast, fun and friendly environment. Leadership positions provide exceptional benefits and pay and scheduling is fair and consistent."
good,"A typical day of work starts around 10 AM, generally upon walking in I am greeted by the smiling faces of my co-workers. I go up to the break room to greet HR and if I see one of the managers. I wave hello and we exchange pleasantries. Once the ""Good morning""s are done I  walk back downstairs and ask my supervisor what my responsibilities are. If I'm there for a Sales Associate shift then I begin re-stocking clothes and helping guests, if that day is a Cashier shift day then I take my place at the register and begin to engage the guests while scanning their items. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that felt that they didn't receive the proper care. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to give stickers to guest's children and watch their eyes light up with joy."
good,I will always be grateful for my years working at Target because it provided tremendous professional growth. Target always pushes its employees to innovate and give the guest the best experience possible. I worked with very talented people and grew to become a well rounded creative as well as a respectful and fair leader.
good,"So sad target left canada :( best job I ever had. Staff was like a family , discount was amazing, work was fairly easy and pay was fair."

good,I loved working for Target stores! An absolute great team to work with and big chances for advancement. Very fair store.
good,"Was very impressed with my short time with the company. Plus, you get free pop corn on break - whats not to like? Two paid 15 minute breaks, including a 30 minute break on top of the two 15 minute breaks per 8 hours shift."
good,"Had so much fun working for this company, sad that it closed the team culture was amazing and the job was fun. Miss it so much !!"
good,"great fun place to work , especially for teens and people in their prime...atmosphere was great...and products was great and catering for holidays..this job was really fun fun fun"
good,"Everyday it was always something new. I could either be unloading the truck, training in the Target Cafe, or be taken out of soft lines and put in market or health and beauty area of the store when needed. Management is always willing to listen when there is an issue and are willing to help out on the floor when necessary."
good,everyone was like a family we worked all over the store we set up the store from the nothing. loved it there never had any problems everyone was close and respected one another

good,"I work at guest service some days it busy and some days its slow."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to first check my e-mail and keep up to date with all communications about transitions and needs throughout the store. I then take on the task of completing the required workloads for the week. I work by myself however, I partner with the Presentation Team which is about 6 others to make sure that transitions are executed on time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the family work environment and the closeness that my team has with one another."
good,"The company involves providing the aircraft spares across the globe "
good,"A typical day at work would be vibing with awesome guests, meetings with my managers and having fun with my amazing co-workers. I have learned some valuable life skills- how to work hard and be determined, do things in a fast and friendly but safe way, and to always have a genuine smile on my face. The hardest part of the job is really nothing! I value everything I do here and i get appreciated for everything which is something that is truly special for me. The most enjoyable? When my team leaders and my ETLS recognize me for something I did. Also when i am at my favorite and most committed part of the store."
good,While working at Target I learned a lot about retail. I enjoyed helping customer and learning about new product. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management was nice.
good,I have respect for Target and the direction it is being taken in by the new leadership. I would highly recommend working at Target.
good,"On the day to day I supported a team of five in asset management.  I was in charge of work order and database management.  This meant reaching out to vendors to ensure completion of their open work orders.  I also helped with presentations and excel spreadsheet layouts. My co-workers and manager were the best, and I was sad to leave.  The most enjoyable part about my position was the people I worked with."
good,"- Re-shop/ Zone/Dealing with customers while completing task's/ Back up cashier"

good,I love working at Target. There's good people & a great atmosphere there. I learned a lot from my supervisor & hope to grow as a person off what she has taught me. She has truly trained me to the best of her ability in the field of management.
good,"Circuit City was the best job that I ever had. The store itself and all of its sales associates, cashiers, supervisors, and managers were one big family. The store was well run and had many loyal customers. A typical day at work consisted of me arriving, clocking in, selling TVs for 8 hours with two 15 min. breaks and one 45 min. lunch spaced evenly between during my shift."
good,"Target cares about the team members, while trying to increase sales they also create a fun work environment. The most difficult part of the job was training/learning everything that was needed to complete the tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with consumers."
good,"Only reason I gave my two weeks notice was due to personal problems, other than that I loved working at Target and I miss it."
good,"A typical day at Target would involve directly working with the guests from behind a cash register or the guest services desk. I would have the responsibility of treating guests with respect and finding a solution to any of their problems within the store. I also would deal with defective items by labeling them correctly and placing them in the appropriate spot. Some days I would also have cart duty or I would have to cover the breaks in the Target cafe. "
good,Good place to work since there flexible with school. Was offered several positions and advancement. You get to meet several people and the co workers are a blast.
good,"I worked during the holiday seasonal, and it was extremely busy. But management gave me a lot of training time so that I could feel comfortable with my work."

good,"My time with Target Canada was fast paced and filled with great learnings and experience.  The culture and the team demonstrated the ability to be resilient and adaptable with changes, challenges while striving for success each day.  One of the most enjoyable companies to be a part of."

good,"I have learned so much at Target.  The environment is very diverse and everyone is so friendly.  Upon trying to shake hands to introduce myself, I was greeted with high-fives instead.  Everyone is family at Target, and we/they all do their best to make a guest's experience the best one ever.  Communication was exceptional, as we all wore walkies and you use one to ask the entire store a question you were unsure of - even if a guest is just wondering about another store's (e.g. Wal-Mart) opening/closing hours."
good,"Very professional and productive environment. Well organized,clean"
good,"Unloading and stocking can be hard working, but seeing your team's work at the end of the shift is rewarding. Everyone is so kind and all team-oriented. Our LOD is amazing and motivational. The hardest part is getting up at 3 to clock in at 4, but then you're up and energized for your day. I love working with my other team members and learning new things together."
good,"Target is a great place to work, management is fair and flexible with scheduling.  Management is also great to work with.  I work on the sales floor as well as help out on the registers.  I stock shelves and set new products while providing customer services to the guests."

good,"Everyday there are smiles and friendly staff greeting everyone as they come through the doors. Being an employee is no different, You are treated with the same respect and courtesy. Working there has always been fun and challenging. The management has it all together and work as one unit. There are morning, afternoon, and evening meetings for all employees to attend to keep everyone on the same page and working as a team should."
good,My job required me to continuously juggle multiple projects and one time while staying focused on meeting all deadlines and expectations.  My managers were extremely supportive of my work/life balance and were always there to help me out when I needed it.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with many co-workers and managers within my area.  I made great connections at my job with many talented individuals.
good,"I spent a year with Target Canada and loved it. I worked alongside a great team and with excellent managers. The culture was great and there were a number of opportunities to develop my teamwork, leadership and analytical skills."
good,"•	Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"This was only temporary for the holiday season. I worked with the back room team. We picked, stocked, back stocked and inventoried merchandise daily. They require you to be cross trained so that everyone is a whole and can pull together as a team and help in times of need. Management was very kind, personable and eager to teach anyone willing to learn. They are very family oriented and believe in keeping a balance between work and home. Very rarely did they ask for employees to work overtime. Notice I said, ""ASKED"" they never required overtime and you were not reprimanded for simply saying ""no thank you"". This company is an amazing company to work for. I can not think of one thing I disliked or felt they could improve on."
good,"When our partners have arrived to work station"
good,"Good company but unfortunately close their operations from Canada"
good,Productive and fun place to work with the diverse population of different age groups. Fast fun and friendly environment where everyone is recognized for their effort. The drawbacks are growth financially as well as a career. The  best part is great team and a company
good,"Typical work day is fast paced and requires the ability to multitask  at a high level. Results are quantifiable measurable and rewarding.."
good,"Wonderful place to work!  Work/life balance is tough since its retail so your hours are ever changing, but they are very flexible when it comes to schedule changes.  I have never had a negative thing to say.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job is simply being yourself.  A typical day at work consists of data entry, filling prescriptions, putting away inventory, and working at will call."
good,"Since day 1, this has been a great company to work for, despite how it is all coming to an end."
good,its your typical retail store. not all stores are the same. managment can be a bit disconnected at times. its a good job though
good,"My review of Target was good, I always looked forward to going to work there having a positive environment with my co-workers and guests. Also we always were keeping up with our departments and going up for back-up cashiering when it was needed. The hardest part of the job was probably closing up our department you were assigned because it usually took 1-2 hours to keep it up and ready for the next day. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was probably the vibe of the Target and how friendly and helpful all the team members were. I also made many friends there to make you always feel welcomed and always there to help you out."
good,"A typical day at Target was always a fast paced and friendly experience. I would arrive to my work station 5 minutes early every shift to disinfect my cash register and work area and repeat this routine every 2 hours. I would greet guests as they approached my register and assist them with all of their purchasing needs. At Target I acquired the experience of a truly enjoyable work environment as well as experience in working with a large variety of people from the public and how to assist their every request. The team leaders and team members of Target were all very friendly and always eager to help me or any other with whatever it is we may need. The most challenging part of the job was keeping up a steady pace during times where we would find ourselves to be extremely busy, however I was always able to keep up and feel that having experience in high pressure situations will greatly benefit me in my future employment situations. The best part about working at Target was being and working as a part of a team."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in making jokes but being able to be serious. clocking in looking at what my manager has scheduled and go from there
good,"Fast, fun, friendly environment. Employeers and employees are all really good workers to work with. Most hardest part of the job is when the stores gets really busy with very little employees on hand. Most enjoyable part is helping guests find what they need."
good,"Target was the best company to work for. When we got the news that the company was closing in Canada, I was heart broken, and devastated. I love going into work, management is outstanding and I have formed a lot of friendships."
good,"A majority of people give Target a negative view because of the people who work there are terrible but not a single person I worked with gave me a rough time nor did they even come off as bad."
good,Fun and friendly environment. Always work to be done so it made the day go by quicker. work with customers to find items or answer questions everyday.
good,I loved working at Glendale Target. I became very close with not only my co-workers but also my managers as well. It was a very family-like atmosphere. I did not have any over bearing complications with co-workers or supervisors. The hardest thing about the job was working during holiday season and making sure that we had everything done and sorted for the next shift. It was very difficult to complete all of our task at the end of the night. The only way we were able to complete all of our work during the holiday season was by working overtime (which wasn't really a problem for me). The guest were also very easily pleased.  Overall Target was everything I would want in a  company of their type.
good,"Target is a company that makes you feel like your opinion makes a difference in how the company is run. The executive team leads ask for your input on how to make your work station become more efficient in treating guests like they're our first priority. Forgiving of personal situations (death in the family, stolen vehicle, illness) as to not let it be the determining factor of keeping you on the team or not. Fellow team members all get along and help push each other to become better at their tasks."
good,I enjoyed working at Target. The staff and management were very friendly and understanding of others needs as well as treating all guest with the best customer service out there. The hardest part of being a lot attendant was working in inclement weather.
good,"I worked in the front end of the store. Duties included zoning my area, ringing up items, and bagging those items. I learned that patience, efficiency, and a great attitude will make your work day go along a lot quicker. My managers were so willing to help and make me feel comfortable in my job. The hardest part was learning how to not let an angry customer get me down, but it didn't take me long to realize it wasn't me they were mad at. The most enjoyable part about this job was cheering up upset customers, interacting with them, and helping them find anything they had trouble locating in the store."
good,"I loved working for target. A typical day at target was fun and productive, the worst part was getting such small amount of hours, 3-4 hour days, I only got one 5 our day and it was nice, pay is nice and the management is exceptional. the coworkers were mostly nice the hardest part of the job was only doing one task all day long, thankfully management let me keep active. the most enjoyable part was the friendly environment."
good,Target has a fun culture and is a thriving fast paced business environment. Focuses on team development and leadership across any level.
good,"Opening store or closing store interacting with other team members to hand over or take over daily tasks given. Stocking,rotating product,setting planograms,pulling product forward to keep a clean well stocked store,setting weekly ads,price cuts,back up cashier,ensuring all team members are doing their jobs. Oh my the hardest part of this job was to leave my planogram unfinished on the floor in a cart unassisted to be a back up cashier. The most fun was making my customers happy and making it fun for other team members to do their job."
good,"J'ai adoré mon expérience chez Target , malheureusement ils fermeront leurs portes d'ici peu. La communication entre les gens était facile et dynamique. Malgré la grosse charge de travail tout allait bien et j'étais bien traitée , je savais que les chefs d'équipe étaient là pour ses membres d'équipe. Les horaires étaient flexibles ce qui m'aidait à profiter pleinement de la vie tout en travaillant le plus que je pouvais. Plusieurs postes s'ouvraient à nous et nous avions la possibilité de grandir dans la compagnie."
good,"For work, I would come in and be greeted by my on duty GSA and assigned a checkout lane. I would then proceed to provide friendly and fast guest service to the people in my line. I learned to not take cashiers for granted and to be a little easier on them. The management team at Target was excellent. They were on top of everything, from scheduling to making sure you felt welcome every day at work. My store manager was personal and made the job feel more like home. The people I worked with ranged from college students like me to elder adults, but all around, everyone was great to work with. The hardest part of the job was to remain collected when you had to learn new skills in the moment. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to be social with all the guests that came through my line. It gave me the chance to maybe brighten their day."
good,It was a fun relaxed upbeat envirment that made everyone happy to be there. everyone knew what need to be done at the start of the day and we worked as a team to meet the store goals set for the day.
good,here is always something to do. If you cant find a thing to do in a target store then you dont need to be working.
good,Leadership team helps team members focus on specific tasks they need them to do for the day.
good,"Target is a great place to work their pay and benefits are pretty competitive.  Their new pharmacy system is amazing and makes working that much easier, although there are still some set backs to it."
good,"Fun work environment, good people, always challenging and a learning experience"
good,"An excellent place to work for continuous development. I have learned how to train and develop new team members, to work through conflicts professionally."
good,Extremely comprehensive experience for an intern. It was a great experiance to be treated as an actual manager and not really an intern from day 1. Lots of responsibility but a great experiance
good,"i have three target location i used work at Commack North, Medford and Hicksville but Hicksville is worst Target overnight but only best is Medford but i learn lesson but i only wish i want re hire back to Target i learn lesson with my mistake not steal candy and soda at overnight job i want believe second chance right now i live in South Florida i dont care how much money earn as long i keep work but no matter what i love work Target its great discount i learn great team leader dont matter they tell you just listen to them and just learn the best i work there for 3 years my goal i want come back work Target for second chance and i dont want steal anything this time i changed  my life and believe it"
good,"Very friendly environment. Helpful management. Always ready to answer queries. Encouraging team members by recognizing their hard work and efforts during hurdles, which is a team meeting. Great motivation! I love the way they treat the employees and guests. Always encouraging the team members to contact and talk with the guests, aiding them in locating products and making things convenient for them."
good,"I worked at three different targets within the two years I was employed with them. It is a great environment to work for, every store I was at the team leaders were great and the ETLs were always supportive and fun. They are always willing to help train you in any department you are interested in, I was trained in Customer Service/Cashier/Softlines/Grocery/Pharmacy/Starbucks/Cash Office as well as Team Leader responsibilities. If you have drive and determination then it is a good place to work and you can be moved up to Team lead position quickly. One thing I did not like was that OT was not allowed, and the pay wasn't that great. Performance reviews were done every year but the raises were not that adequate, maybe 50 cents. Overall though I did love working for Target and I honestly miss the atmosphere that they provided. The upper management always did their best to make sure that the team members were happy. Doing small things from catching up with each of us with one-on-ones or big gestures like buying all the team members pizza for dinner in the break room."
good,Setting up and clean-up of conference room . Handed out information on recovery in mental health. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the cultures of the peoples.
good,I worked overnight and had to unload the trucks and sort out items as well as put them on the floor. I enjoyed working there because my co workers always helped each other out as well as the managers. we were a team and they always treated us whenever we did a great job.
good,"I have work at Target since 2007. Personally I enjoy working for the company where I work at. I'm not sure how the other Target's working culture differs then mine but at my store the people I work with is super friendly and the store supervisors are laid back down to earth people. The downside is that at times the store where I work at can be under staff and the workload can be overwhelming. The pay is somewhat ok, 9.08 an hour is an ok start, at least it’s better than 7.50 a hr. Overall if you are someone in school who are looking for a beginner’s job then Target is for you."
good,"Fun to work with other co workers and supervisors, I learned alot about customers service. The hardest part of the job was remembering the items to their right place, But at the end of the day I remember where it belongs, The enjoyable part of the job, I had a great time with the other co workers."
good,"Target lives up to its motto of ""fast, fun, and friendly."" The culture features healthy levels of communication, employee empowerment, minimal gossip, trust, and (to a degree) performance-based pay. At night team members also frequently have access to free day-old Starbucks pastries (and other freebies) and a 10% discount that includes not only merchandise but food as well. One of the few downsides is low pay (perhaps this is the basis for their slogan, ""expect more, pay less."")."
good,"I could count on everyday being encouraged by the supervisors and fellow employees at work, as well as being in a friendly environment, which made coming to work each day very easy."
good,"Being a cashier can be fun but it can also be very challenging. The best skills to have being a cashier are patients, organization, understanding and working at a fast paste those were my top four skills that got me through my days at the work place. Over time working at target all my skills improved because I learned how to deal with all kinds of different customers."
good,I love just being in a area where you are always able to help some one on a one-on-one basis.
good,Great overall experience. Upbeat employees/Co-workers and a environment that rewards hard work.
good,"A typical day on the job as a pharmacy technician is somewhat hectic, but if that's the type of career you're looking for, then hectic is not a problem. I learned so much on my externship here. I learned skills ranging from pill counting to keeping patient records. My co-workers were AWESOME! They were welcoming since the very moment I stepped foot in the pharmacy to my last day of externship, and if I had the opportunity I would definitely work with them again. The hardest part of the job (which I didn't have the luxury of doing) I'd have to say was dealing with the insurance companies. More often than not, the technicians were on the phone with insurance companies trying to clear up issues that had arised either because the drug the patient was prescribed wasn't covered due to formulary issues or the insurance just wouldn't pay for anymore refills. The most enjoyable part of the job, in my opinion was filling prescriptions. Most people would find that part of the job tedious and meticulous, but I found it rather therapeutic. It also gave me slightly more knowledge on my brand/generics which I wasn't prepared for at all when I walked into the pharmacy. I wouldn't say I have a vast knowledge on them now either because it's not like I had time to sit and study every medication while on the job, but I can say that I know slightly more than I did when I began."
good,"Over all Target is a fast pace, guest culture, team building company. Each day you learn something new, while developing yourself and those around you.  The hardest part of the job is leaving each day because it is like home and your team is family.  So you want to do your best to support them and set each and everyone up for success.  The most enjoyable part of the job is pervading great service to the hundreds of people you encounter on a daily basic.  You get a chance to impact life's and make them a positive experience."
good,"Overall benefits, work environment, and job duties are great."
good,Working for Target is like working with family. They are close net and they are always willing to work with their employees. I would highly recommend Target as a career choice.
good,"Everyone that I worked with here was very respectful to one another, maybe once in awhile, there was a little heated discussion.  But over all I truly enjoyed my job here."
good,most days were at a fast pace which i like because i like to keep busy. Co-workers were cool people and got along with everybody and didn't really hate anything about the job
good,"I loved working here because everyone was so close knit. Plus they didn't care about tattoos and piercing, since this does not defines someones capability to do their job. Management was great working at Target, they tried to get everyone involved in group activities so that work wasn't as stressful. Co-workers were amazing, we all did what was best for the team meaning; we always helped each other out."
good,i loved interacting with guest and using my customer service skills.
good,"A typical work day consist of helping to train new employees, learning how to work in different areas of the store, greeting and serving customers. Managers where very helpful and flexible with my scheduling. My co-workers where friendly and easy to work with. My job was relatively easy to me, clear cut directions that where easy to follow. Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work in the many different departments Target had, ranging from sales floor to pharmacy to the pizza hut located inside of the Target i worked in."
good,"•	Directed and managed 50 + team members during Leader On Duty shifts, responded to guest and team concerns, and made business decisions which impacted my team to achieve daily goals."
good,"My schedule was from 4 am to 8 am."
good,Target employees are treated with great respect.  Employees are rewarded on a daily basis when meeting sale goals for the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that you are surrounded with every single day.
good,The most enjoyable part of Target is working with my fellow team members. Everyday I go there its always a positive envirorment.
good,"I get in at 7am, greet my team and first thing is check and reply to my emails. Generate all reports needed and work on projects for the day, while assisting team members with numerous issues. I've leanrned so much at Target that I believe I need to bring else where to show what I'm capable of doing and bringing to a new company. My coworkers are great at assisting me and making sure we get thework done. We have created such a bond that allows for honesty, encouragement and motivation. The hardest part of my job is me not allowing myself to leave until all of my work is done, only happens sometimes but when it does, my coworker is willing to finish working on it or I will save it for first thing in the morning. The most enjoyable part is being able to assist and be that helping hand for my team members. They know no matter what they are going through they can walk into my office and I will be there ready to help out with a smile and a solution. The human resources field is my favorite, It's sointeresting and I cannot wait to keep progressing."
good,I really enjoyed working for Target.  Your co-workers are fun to work with.  I coulndn't have ask for a better job.
good,"-the hardest part of the job is the truck unload"
good,"Great place to be, these guys know whats going on. Teamwork."

good,"managing clients"
good,"I have worked for Target for 11 years and enjoyed my time. However, I am looking to get into more of a career opportunity with the ability to grow. The company is a great company to work for but, I am struggling with retail hours and lower compensation."
good,"Trained new team members on guest service skills including: stores Red card credit card and debit card applications, problem resolutions, and encouraged professional relationship building. Have been cross trained in the following areas located in the store: cashier, customer service, target café, target pharmacy back up cashier, sales floor, cash office, and the Guest Service Assistant position."
good,i enjoy working for target. i look forward to be part of the target team again. it was such a positive experience.
good,"Typical day work, go in greet everyone, clock in and go straight to my station. I learn new things everyday in how to make my job easier and enjoyable. My co-workers are friends and we work as a team. The hardest part in my job is unloading the trucks in the morning but gets easy afterwards. My most enjoyable part is working together and finishing my work."
good,My duties were managing the fitting rooms and making sure each customer was helped. maintained a clean work area. My area had to be complete at a certain time. Some cashier experience. The hardest part of the job is getting multiple tasks done at one time. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that all customers were helped and left the store happy.
good,I love working at Target. The management team is great and the job atmosphere is also great.
good,sometimes they can get on you about things that are not your fault and then get upset when you cannot do something but they have yet to train you. Other then that its a pretty fun energetic place.
good,I enjoyed working at Target. It was the best retail job I ever had.
good,"It was fast pace, learn how to use a pallet jack, management was wonderful, I got along with my co-workers, my enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,"Bastante puxado o dia dentro de cada atividade"
good,Target was a great atmosphere to work in. All team members were energetic and willing to help one another as well as customers. I learned a great deal.  Time management was key and one of the most important aspects I took away from my time here.  I worked mostly with the logistics team and everyday we had specific time requirements for certain tasks to be completed.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with customers who were not willing to work with you.  Some of the time I would get customers who were upset with me because we did not have a specific item in stock.  Even after apologizing for the inconvenience customers can still take their frustration out on you.  The most enjoyable part about the job was working in such an energetic environment where everyone was willing to work with one another.
good,"I was the Executive Team Leader of Assets Protection and my job was to reduce shortage through educating team members and stop external theft while providing a safe and secure environment for our guests. "
good,everybody is fun and helpful. You clock in and you try to sell sell sale. while being around people that enjoy their job also. the more cards you get the better chance you get an extra break or a candy or drink or some item. You learn to work fast and friendly.
good,I love working at target. I love interacting and meeting new people even if it was only at the register.
good,I've learned a lot here and made lifetime friendships! The management is great and understanding. We are all one big happy family and great team players!
good,"Target is a great place to work. The benefits and pay are great, and job security for those who choose to grow with the company is great. Management and co workers are great. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and the overall passion for business and execution from all leaders."
good,"I love working here! The job is physically exhausting, but in a good way - I leave feeling like I did a good job. Each day is a little different as we deal with guest orders, system issues, and all the many errors that can spring up with so many integrated systems. A typical day starts with a warm-up and some company messages, then we're off to the real work. I walk upwards of 15 miles a day, through three floors of the building and typically pick at least 1500 items for our guests by the end of my 12 hour shift. Our management is friendly and personable, and they try to stay in touch with us even with such a large working area. The hardest part of the job is finding something productive to do on slow days. My most enjoyable days are when I work under strict deadlines and get everything done ahead of time. The only issue I have is that I like to keep moving, and all the advancement opportunities are computer-related jobs. I would like to be able to improve myself in the company, but unfortunately the only way to do this right now is sit at a desk."
good,Working at Target is really amazing and the managers are very hands on and listen to any concerns you may have.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much.  As a team we got our job done in a timely manner and helped each other when needed.  It was a fun face paced job.  My supervisors were very hard workers as well. It was a great environment and company to work for. A typical day was arriving to un load the truck/s. then going to stock the shelves and backstock what was not needed on the floor. Then I would go into receiving or setting planograms. I learned so much about logistics. I don't believe there was a hard part of my job, having to do POS work was challenging but only because I did not do it everyday.  I still enjoyed it though."
good,"Was fun just to get there, learned to do inventory in a department store signing pricing learn how to use different kind of equipment. Human resources were always available the hardest part of the job was reaching the goal sales but doable. The most I like was my co-workers"
good,"most days is a comfortably faced paced. The management team was so fun and involved. I Truly enjoyed the team i worked with. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with different people every day, and working with my team."
good,"Typical day would be to run reports, answer phones if need be, scheudeling, set up interviews, conduct orientation/job offers,"
good,"A typical day at work for an early morning/overnight Logistics team member is fairly cut and dry and can be repetitive, but this is mitigated by the fact that management and co-workers are great. The people really make the job on this one. The most difficult part of the job is trying to divvy up the jobs that need to be done, since everyone is willing to give an easier workload to someone else."
good,Target is a great company for a young start up professional. Retail is retail and work life balance is a problem but overall great company.
good,While working at Target I was cross trained in Starbucks and as an cashier.
good,Working at Target has been one of the best employers I've had while working in the real world. The atmosphere is very open and engaging and the employees are just as welcoming.
good,After working at Target for two and a half years I can say that they are very considerate of your personal life when it comes to making a weekly schedule (if you communicate with them).  I honestly wouldn't have any dislikes from the company beside the low pay.
good,I loved this job every morning unload trucks and stock merchandise. Fast paced job day go by fast.
good,"I spent 3 years there and everyday I was informed of my progress. "
good,"Assisting my store and the district with company initiated Human Resource metrics."
good,a typical day was unloading trucks and stocking shelves.  i learned how to use a handheld computer gun to locate and stock merchandise in the warehouse.  The management were very helpful.  My co-workers were pleasant and fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job was when they let everyone go since it was a seasonal job.  The most enjoyable part was helping the customers with any questions they had.
good,"Enjoyable fast pace workplace, I have learned to be a leader among a team of co-workers, management has always been helpful, I have worked well with other co-workers, the hardest part of the job is having to consult team members of poor attitude, most enjoyable is the over all work astmosphire,"
good,"Management is great and kinds"
good,"Would unload the truck and then stock the items on shelves/clothing racks."
good,"I work unload truck, stock shelves."
good,The experience of Target is that you know that Quality is key with the success of the customer and the company. A great job with managers who respect and value your experience.
good,"I would start the day off with a meeting with otherr team leads and upper management in an informal setting, get daily reports and the run department reports.  Set the standard of pace for the day with expectations of timeline and daily review of processes and convey those standards to my teams.  "
good,I learned different things while working in the Pharmacy and in a medical field.
good,"I typical day at Target was fun, I meet lots of great new friends everyone was very friendly and very understanding. it was very fast pace and the days would go by fast, normally I would be putting clothing away or working the fitting rooms, I also answered the phones in the office to cover staff members breaks. Some of the time I was on the register doing cash and dealing with customers, but over all it was a fun place to work."
good,Target was my first job and the people are so nice there and welcoming and you all feel like a family at the end of the day.  Sometimes they will be hard on redcards if you are a cashier but thats what people need to do.
good,"Once we arrive we get our blueprints of each aisle. We aquire our supplies the work requires and get the job done."
good,good company to work for hard to move up within they are flexable with hours needed good with letting people have time off just need more money
good,Great place to work. always busy. Management is wonderful. Would tell people to apply there.
good,"Fast, fun, and friendly. fair chance of moving up, and making target into a career. Good benefits"
good,"I am currently employed as a Presentation Team Lead for Target. Target as a whole is an excellent company, and I love the job. I have been with the company for over 6 years, and have worked in more than 4 positions with 2 different stores. I am currently seeking a new experience with a new company. What I love about Target is the safety I feel I have with my job, the security, the co workers. Its a very demanding job and is constantly the only thing on my mind when I am not on the clock. I feel that while there, I have no time to breath. I skip my breaks, I work on my lunches, it is a very hectic and demanding work schedule. Every weekly workload vary's so drastic, hours are tight, the presentation team is small, and its very difficult to complete the workload without the tiny misc. factors being taken into account such as fixture availability, the overall state of the store, call ins, the amount of clean up work that has to be done in an aisle, hours being cut, maintaining guest service, team member productivity, team member corrective action. If you slip just one day it will set you back weeks, and with a job that is so focused on metrics, there is just no room for error, ever. An entire store will fall apart without a good strong presentation Team Lead that can get the job done. It takes a very motivated individual to pull of the job correctly and these leads are hard to find. It takes a lot of planning and collaborating on my part, and while I love the high octane pace and pressure of the job, the fact that it runs my life is not something I want. I have spent the last 4"
good,"I have truly loved working for Target over the past year. Every day I learn something new either in my position or something new to help me for advancement from my position. "
good,"I joined this company as a part-time employee while I took business courses in a local community college in preparation for the MBA program. Compare with other retail stores, Target trained its employees very well to provide high quality service. You can clearly see the difference between Target and Walmart in terms of: quality of employees, level of training, quality of products and over-all store appearance."
good,A typical day at Target started really early and lasted long.  I would start by unloading trucks and once that was done I would then proceed to stock the unloaded items and then back stock the exta inventory.  Then once the stock is handled I would then walk around and assist guests.  Management was nice and very professional.
good,i loved this job the most because it was very diverse and the management was very professional i wish i would have finished it out there
good,salesfloor dealing with clothes and inventory.  Helping guest check out deal. Friendly supervisor and team associates.
good,"Began with stretches at work station, gear up then get to business. I learned every type of forklift machinery. the employees were easy to get along with. The managers were great and I never seen them try to intimidate employees under their authority. my coworkers were great to work with, they would always be saying jokes but doing our job. the time would fly. I didn't see anything hard about the job but during winter and summer, the weather was the tough part. The people there were the most enjoyable part of the job I'd say."
good,"I've learned to deal with unsatisify customers"
good,My day at work consist of watching cameras fro suspicious activity and apprehending theft suspects.
good,"Aprendi a ter espírito de equipe e a auxiliar a todos da empresa;"

Pulled back stock from back room to replenish the sales floor purchases and stocked the sales floor as needed, also led the hardlines team in a routinely scheduled zone (front facing product) if scheduled to work zone. Attended the guests (customers) for returns and exchanges at the guest service desk. Assebled bicycles, Cashiered, and sold electronics with attachments such as accidental damage, and replacement plans. I learned the ideal of retail store operation. Managment was consistent and fair. My co-workers were equally proefficient. Even though it was manageable working under stressful periods of peak sale days, the hardest part of the job was working with co-workers or managers who didn't maintain their composure. The most enjoyable part of the job had to of been the interaction with the customers."
good,It was a place of comfort and a place to grow and learn new things. The environment was respectful and you were able to work well with others.

good,"unloading the truck to stock the entire store for sales. i learned how to unload and load the truck freight onto the floor and pallets. target was a friendly enviroment, got along with everyone even mangement. the good thing is that we worked together as a team to get our task done. and to see smiles on customer faces upon our new sales."
good,Great place to work with hardworking individuals and management that will get their hands dirty and help you do your job.
good,"All Staff, Senior staff is well Skilled in each of his Job."
good,"I started out on hardlines on the floor of Target. Management allowed me to learn different parts of the store and I was able to work were they needed me; from the back room to the front register. I would come to work clock in and go strait to work helping customers or getting the stock out on the shelf. I never had a problem with my co worker and everyone worked very well together. The only part of the job I would say was hard, was the days I had to be to work at 4:00am, but once I was up and moving it was good. The best part of the job was working at a place I liked, with co workers I liked working with."
good,"To open prepare for the day would be to turn on all warmers, add water to steamers, remove past Date items, and refresh stock ie cups, lids, etc. Through the day would be temp logs, and rotate hot food items. Cashier back-up as needed.  Close would be all that in reverse.  I learned that the way an employee treats Team Members, and guests reflects on the company as a whole. Management was great at motivating, and strict on policies. My co-workers were all ages, and ethnic backgrounds.  I had a blast.  Hardest part was leaving.  The most enjoyable part was my returning guests who always stopped in to say hello."
good,Good place to work and meet new people. I have met so many people that I can call good friend. I gained a variety of experience mostly human resources experience.
good,It was really a great place to work and I really enjoyed the people that I worked with.
good,"Had a great job experience and was happy to get along with everyone; staff and customers included. Everyone was willing to lend a hand and worked hard to complete the days work load. The management was easy to get along with and was helpful when situations arose that required their aid. All-in-all great people, hours and environment. Would work there again in a heartbeat!"
good,"A typical day at work starts by hitting it as soon as I am clocked in. As the revisions specialist I work independently most of the day. This has made me a good self starter. I organize my workload for the day and systematically complete 40-85 revisions a week. I have taken away many great work skills from my experience at Target including, organizational skills, customer service skills, time management, interpersonal coordination, and marketing skills. The hardest part of my job is some weeks there is more than 40 hours of revisions, so it can be a struggle to finnish on time. In these situations we have other team members help my team out."
good,"I am very hard worker and I can do all thing at work place, sometime I help them also help me too if I have a lot of work willing help me out end our work shift. Also willing learn new thing, also enjoy foods that they provide us to eat lunch too."
good,"Target is an upbeat fun place to work,  I thoroughly enjoy working for the company and enjoy the people that surround us each and every day.  The co-workers are like family and care for each other.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a friendly atmosphere.  The hardest part of the job is driving 30-45 minutes to work and the cost of gas.  There are not enough workers from my area that allow for the carpooling that would be very beneficial to everyone involved."
good,It is a nice place to work where the team members and LOD's get together and have a good time will getting important thing done.

Management was well-organized and most of my co-workers kept me from slowing down by helping me enjoy my job. The hardest part of the day was trying to get work done on the sales floor within a certain time limit while being questioned by guests about any and all things. The most enjoyable part of my day was  working in the back room where it was only me and my co-workers where we worked swiftly and efficiently while we joked and talked or working in electronics."

good,"I love the culture of Target! It is such a great place to work. The problem is there is not much room to grow and they will not make you any leader without knowing you wont be there for 10 years +. And it takes anywhere between 5-10 years to hit $10 a hr. All in all, its a great place to work, not so good of a place to make a living. But I defiantly recommend it if your going to school"

good,"Worked the sales floor for Electronics, helping customers throughout my day on top of placing inventory and keeping the department up to par."

It was my flexiblity and ability to work in a variety of departments from Food Avenue (cafe), to cashiering, to produce, to being a fitting room attendant and store operator. I have learned that if you are nice and respectful to others you will get the same in return. It was not unlike me to go above and beyond no matter what job I performed and what department I was working.

The team I worked on was a small group that worked together to set up parts of the store such as for back to school or christmas. We worked 4 to 5 days a week and made full time. The best part of the job is that you really felt that you accomplished something by the end of the night because you would see how you would change the store to new phases of the year."

I have learned how to work in a very fast paced environment, management was great, my co worker's were teamplayer's just like I was. The hardest part of my job was having to tell a customer that we did not have something that they were looking for, the most enjoyable was giving great customer service and making sure the customer is satisfied."
good,"the hardest part of the job would most definitly be getting your body used to the overall pace at which team members are expected to perform.

good,Start your day with a meeting explaining the plan for the day and warm up for work. Get scan guns and head to your work area and log onto the appointment with the team you are working with or by yourself. Some days you would be working with a team of 6-10 people and others you would be alone. Co-workers are very knowledgable and helpful to getting the job done and making every day stress free and learning new ways to complete your job. Management was rotating frequently so the hardest part was explaining to them that on a daily basis it can be hard to get production with the freight we are given. The most enjoyable part was working as a team and being around my co-workers.

good,"I worked in the shipping department. Typical days at work varied from loading 53' trailors by way of hand, to using a fork truck to drive pallets around the warehouse to deliver to other departments. Hard work was a must. Only one hour for lunch, but twelve hour shifts. Managers were more than willing to help with work when your section was being overloaded. Everyone had a great time helping the team out, but this was extremely hard work for a D.C."

good,Well planned out days that weren't tedious or repetitive. Management was very good at recognizing the work of all of us and we all worked well as a team.
good,"If you have to deal with the stress involved in working retail, at least choose a company that does its best to make any employee feel comfortable and able to provide fast fun and friendly service. Target's management does everything they can to handle any situation with utter finesse, and are adept at keeping a store in top condition for running as smoothly as possible."

good,Working in an environment that consist of always putting out merchandise to look presentable to guest was a bit challenging. Had to make sure the newest items were in front to catch attention to guest. My co workers were alot of help due to managing five departments. Hardest part was having to do a project that was due at the end of my shift and gathering all tools and merchandise to ensure that the clothes racks were set properly exactly like the display my manager had.Enjoyable part was knowing i did a great job every end of my shift
good,Unload trucks put merchandise to floor.I learned to b a team player there and i like all my co-workers.Management seems to work against you there for some reason
good,A very productive and fun place to work. Very pleasant people to work with. They recognize you and special dates and achievements.
good,"The culture at Target is very good. They actually promote individuality, they don't make you shave your facial hair or weird hair style, so long as you are a clean person. I was there for 6 months before I promoted to manager and whenever I was bored with my position there was always a way to change to another one; however, without a degree you have pretty much no shot to promote into executive level even inside the store. Everything else is great."
good,I was a very great oppertunity to get the feel of working in a busy pharmacy.

The company really looks out for its employees and makes sure that they understand that the people that come to shop there are seen as guest and not customers. The managers that work there keep an open door policy to make sure that their needs are met.
good,"Since it is my first job, its a nice way to start off in the work field. It looks good on your resume. Its a mandatory clean, organized store. They don't schedule the right amount of people for the work they be wanting to have done by a certain time. They have good teamwork. Most of the managers are good, understanding people while one or two talk to you like you are beneath them. Other then that its a nice place to work."
good,Company caters to employees as a person. I loved the atmosphere of the company it shows that its a fun place to work.

good,Management at the corporate level was the main issue. It’s a good job and easy to do. Market is the best place to be. We are all hand picked  because we work and you are mostly left alone
good,"Keep you moving and on your toes. Making sure the customer items are picked correctly. Get pay, smiling faces and hard working employees. Enjoy assisting the guest"
good,I learned a lot about consumers and how to interact with them as well as a variety of sales tactics that could eventually benefit me in the future. The hardest part of the job would be standing and the most enjoyable part was getting to speak to the guests and also getting the experience of being on the other side of the counter. The workplace culture is very diverse and experienced employees are very helpful.
good,"It’s pretty easy , I was put at multiple different places and covered multiple shifts and everything was easy to pick up on. I worked seasonal so it was always pretty busy but everybody has great attitudes and were super nice ."

good,"Most target employees are required to work some nights, weekends, and holidays, although management is usually flexible about which nights you work and which weekends. Working with customers can be stressful at times, but the Team Leads do their best to keep morale high. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting customers, helping them ring up or return items, and assisting them with locating items."

good,"When I come in to Target, I'm usually welcomed seconds later by friendly faces that I'm glad to call my coworkers. While it may seem like an everyday department store job, working at Target has definitely been my favorite work experience to date. In electronics, I basically have to make sure the department looks good, is organized, and that the guests are all satisfied, something I've actually gotten a lot of joy out of. I've loved technology since I was 3 years old, and my department was a great place where I could share my knowledge and love for tech. Since I could only work during summers because of college, I wasn't able to branch out and expand my work there to do even more with my department, but the possibilities are there. All in all, Target electronics is an awesome place to be for techies like me."

good,Great company to work. Taught me many skills over the years and offered promotions fairly giving anyone who works hard the chance to promote within the company
good,A regular day is normal but a busy day it would be bad communication that’ll have everyone doing other than what their told as a main objective. Otherwise everything else is simple.
good,"Target is very diverse and the environment is very steady. The employees and guest very friendly. While working at Target I was allowed to a variety of things from cart attendant, cashier, customer service, food court, and electronics."

good,"Wasnt able to start working until December 2nd though I was hired on November 3rd however, once I started I really enjoyed my time spent there. All my co workers were very nice and helpful and management was very nice as well. I really liked seeing the store director and others from HR out on the floor or in the back doing the same type of work we did for the holiday season. You usually don't see that type of thing happen. I would definitely go back again if I can next season!"
good,This has been my favorite job by far. I enjoy all the people I work with both my equals and management. The management cares about their employees and its an overall great environment.
good,I loved working there. The employees were friendly and the customers were great and they all said they loved target. They said all the employees were very enjoyable and everyone seemed to like their job.

good,I loved working there wish there would of let me stayed but it was seasonal. The people there was so customer friendly and friendly to others they make sure that the work you put in was appreciated.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty straightforward. Essentially ringing up guests at the cash register and making conversation with them, and making sure they found everything they were looking for. I learned how to use a cash register and better my people skills.  Management was really great, everything was organized. We had a mix of different races on the sales floor and behind the check lanes.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with those really nasty customers.  The most enjoyable part is making friends and having people who come through your line who remember you from the previous time they were there."
good,Great Company and lots of hard work. Great opportunity to learn.  I would love to receive management position so that I can continue to learn and be used to the fullest extent of my potential.

good,"I have not worked for too many places that I can honestly say that I absolutely love working and if not for the fact that the position I held was seasonal, I could have seen myself working for them for a long time"
good,My time at Target thus far has been a wonderful opening for myself at the workforce. The employees are kind and are willing to help at a calls notice. The management are fair and will work with you through anything job related. The actual work is pretty straightforward and is complicated at times but by no means impossible with some effort. It's a very engaging job and the team even goes as far as bringing food in for the rest of the members to compensate for their time. This isn't always but it is fairly frequent and it's incredibly generous.
good,I’ve had about 8 jobs and Target is by far the best place to work for. There are a couple issues with management but nothing to serious. They work around your availability and treat their team members fairly.
good,Target is a great job where you can be laid back and work at your own pace. The jobs they have are really easy very tedious but easy. I will apply in the near future.

good,It was a pleasant experience working for  target. They just need to be careful who they put in their Management teams. My co workers were very inviting and professional.

good,Target I was a cashier A cart attendant customer service representative straightening and stocking and cleaning the department. Flexible schedule reasonable managers wonderful place to work
good,"Was seasonal and was hired after had to stop working for personal reasons. I always liked coming into work. My department was softlines, everyone was super helpful. Occasionally there was drama between coworkers that were still in high school but not a big thing. If you finish your job/section no one will be on your case. I never had my manager come up to me and tell me I was slacking or wasn’t doing a good job. Got a gift card for my birthday."
good,"Working at Target has been a very interesting experience. You have to really be on your toes because it is almost always busy there. Often times, you will be in the middle of one task and be asked to rush and do something else, which can get hectic but it makes time go by faster. It is overall a pretty enjoyable job."
good,I really loved this job. I felt needed and wanted while working here I was always greeted and treated with respect. when working at target I felt Management was very understanding the workplace is very laid back. I really liked working at Target. There was nothing I disliked about working here.
good,"I loved working at Target. I would not have resigned if it weren’t for me currently attending college. It was a very welcoming, loving job and I never felt like i was working, I felt like i was apart of a community. By far one of the best jobs ive ever had."
good,There is great training. Good leadership and support.  There are many things to learn.  It is challenging and enjoyable.  The customers are generally great.  I love my job.  I would encourage others to work for Target.
good,Stability and flexibility with location and opportunities. Fast paced work environment and ability to learn new tasks every day. Being open to learning is key.

good,Employees are extreme outgoing a lot to do but worth the time. management is nice everyone at target feelslike a family so you will always get along customer are also very nice.
good,I loved been a cashier for target every day was a new exciting day because your around new people all the time  I love the target mission statement ' what can we do to make it better for you our customers.
good,"I loved everything about target,they had a lot of opportunities to get off into. Love how they didn’t call their customers/customers they called them guest treat all guest with respect"
good,The management were extremely compassionate and they demonstrated an open door policy. I especially enjoyed the promotional gifts that were given fir incentive to sale redcards
good,Target was my first retail job and I was really lucky to have great managers. I was primarily a cashier. It wasn't hard at all because their systems were very well rounded and made it easy to figure out how to do things and fix mistakes for customers at the register.
good,It is really a nice place to work. I would to like to be compensated more and for them to make sure they count all my hours for the week on my check. I enjoy it though
good,"No complaints here at this time. I transferred from the DC to the retail store. Took a pay cut in doing so however, my health is more important than money at this time in my life. I’m really pleased that I was able to keep my insurance even though I’m not getting 40 hours a week however, if I work hard, I’m sure that the hours will eventually come. I’m satisfied at this time."
good,Enjoyed working here. Most of my day involved standing behind a register. More responsibilities when opening and closing. Management was fair and conversational. Big emphasis on getting red cards.
good,I got to do multiple things like the register guest service sales floor food service photo go backs etc I had fun most of the time at target Black Friday was so crazy
good,Target runs are always fun. I would recommend working at target because of its openly friendly environment and hardworking coworkers. Team work makes the dream work.
good,Working at target was almost like a dream come true that I never knew I'd dream. That is if your cool with working retail and customer service. The environment is fun and friendly.
good,I enjoy working for target as a company . My day to day opportunities are elders & great possibilities to grow and move up  in the company . The customer service is a must .
good,"Kind employees and fair leaders. Overall clean, organized, and intuitive store layout makes working there easy. Great benefits and fair pay that competes with similar stores."
good,"I enjoyed working at target for the 4 years i was there"
good,Most certainly a place of employment where you will love the opportunities for advancement or just to complement your employment skills. They try to accommodate you for your availability and have paid training.
good,"Loved working there. Team members and customers are great, the company was very organized with everything everyone got along. I would pack the online orders and restock the shelves when I was on the floor"
good,Community champion as 5% of their profit is being allocated to their communities. Likewise volunteer reach out is terrific and they portray great value for human rights
good,"I liked working there and  achieved my first raise after 1 month of working there also there was a lady that liked me so much she brought her kids in to meet me.  I won the managers trust by signing 3 people up with Target Red cards, their loyalty card."
good,Target is a get place to work mark the manager in St. Augustine was kind of a pain but other thank that the just is great I loved the customer and I loved my co workers.
good,"In my time of working with Target, I was surrounded with coworkers who cared about the you and the business. My position was fast pace and I would definitely work there again."
good,When I first was hired I started out one location staff was very friendly . They made me feel welcomed. I had plenty of support. I got a chance to one thing that I loved working in fashion merchandising.  But the ultimate elation was when I had to take some time off abruptly. After tending to the personal. They welcomed me back
good,Target was a very easy-going yet at times very challenging due to the fact that we worked grave-yard shift and had deadlines to meet. The environment was very well maintained and that's something that really makes somebody want to enter a facility.
good,Working there was alot of fun. I was part of the fulfillment team filling customers online orders. The rest of my team was super friendly and always willing to help each other if there was ever a problem.
good,"Target is a great place to work. Decent amount of hours, great pay, and management was always nice. But if you miss 3 days, you’re fired. I wish they were a bit more lenient on that but they are not. I miss working there but I, unfortunately, missed more than 3 days."
good,"I worked a seasonal postion at Target, I enjoyed being involved with Customer Service Experience and helping the customer at the check out. I would work for the organization again."
good,Good experience working for Target depends on location. Always ask management when applying if that store is right for you! There are many positions which I like.
good,I would recommend and enjoy working there again the  team members were wonderful and I felt we were productive for the company We had one of the highest productivity Ratings in our district
good,With alot of fast stress free time no hard backbreaking work easy to get along with employees and staff upkeep on storage and organizing the time for everyone
good,"This job is for those who can't stop moving. In Flexible Fulfillment, you are working on collecting items for online orders, while also helping out customers, and retrieving drive-up and pick-up orders as they come in. Management is on top of working the front and back at all times. Everyone was friendly to one another and could sit comfortably in the break room. The hardest part was having to juggle between all three tasks while staying within a time constraint, and running from one side of the store to the other. I enjoyed the fair compensation, management, and the people who worked there."
good,"A typical day would start with me clocking in ,checking in with the DOD, usually run to the big stock room to grab a re-shop cart and then getting straight to the task assigned to me."
good,"A typical day of work at Target consisted of unpacking, organizing, and distributing merchandise to the appropriate areas of the store. It also consisted of answering incoming guest calls, transferring/ directing or assisting with those calls for the appropriate department or question of the guest. We would often backup the cash registers when it was busy, and being on the sales floor team, we specifically emphasized on organizing floor plans, promoting sales through our ads and weekly deals, to make the daily sale goal. The culture was productive but not manageable, eve on the busiest days of the year. The hardest part of the job was balancing multiple tasks at once, all while managing the dressing room and folding/ putting away clothes that were constantly being returned to the store or tried on by guests. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team that made sure we all worked together in a positive environment, all while helping each other out with our daily goals and tasks."
good,"I enjoy meeting new people and the connection you gain with all the regulars that come into the store. I enjoy the atmosphere Target has, the people you work with are great, such a friendly fun place to work."
good,"It's an easy to learn job, all of the managers are very friendly and resourceful. They love to help new members and of course, customers. Breaks are either 15 minutes or 30 minutes, the amount of breaks you have per day depends on your shift hours. You get payed on your 15 minute breaks but not the 30 minute ones."
good,Honest it was an amazing job every one was so friendly and they were very flexible with everything. Meeting new people was such an amazing experience.
good,"the other employee's was good, but the sick days needs some working on. I was let go for being in hospital and not coming to work i started to get real ill at the end of my work cycle."
good,"Besides the Verrrry Annoying (and Mandatory) push for their Red Card holders/new applicants, this was a Great place to work! Often there was some free food like cereal and milk in break room and a big tv always playing a movie in the Break Room. Saved the day for me Many times. Sometimes leftover candy, fruit, juices or snacks were left in there for us. Was so thankful for that, made me feel really appreciated. Love the variety of department's to work in. A popular and fun place to work. Great managers too."
good,"Everyone in the management helps me through my day to day at work, they clearly explained to me every assignment that I need to do. They helped if I needed to."
good,I realy enjoyed working there and highly recommend  it was a fun environment with steady work and was a lot of fun for a first time job and it is not a lot to take on
good,A typical day working for Target was fast past and I folded clothes and I cashiered when it got busy and cleaning stocked shelves and I help put up seasonal products. the management was very good for target I liked them a lot. the hardest part of working there was picking up all the clothes that the customers left on the floor. the enjoyable part of working at target was the people that I had worked with.
good,was the best job that ive had just wish they would have took my notice when i put it in and not talked me into staying so maybe i would have left in good graces so i could be rehired.
good,I only worked there for about a month it was pretty laid back but we always left later than we were supposed to. I worked the night shift so the store was pretty empty
good,"Great pay"
good,"It’s a family atmosphere at target DC everyone is helpful not too many bad attitudes everyone gets along well. Management is the best I’ve seen in any Warehouse. Their helpful and they keep you on you toes, they also have a great way of showing their appreciation by sending thank you cards in the mail to top performing associates and builds other associates so that they may be a top performing associate as they develop. An awesome place of employment in my book I wish I never moved, (Target DC ,Midway,Ga"
good,"Hard work, good pay and benefits,  many perks. Distribution center not store. Weekend shift very good for my personal life schedule. It's a warehouse environment so very inclusive of all personal lifestyles. (Tattoos,long hair, beards, whatever...)"
good,"Good benefits, decent pay, teaches you how to deal with different people, and can be stressful at times. I think the pay could be more depending on what you bring to your team and your overall work ethic. Overall Target is a positive and welcoming workplace."
good,"The only problem I had was not enough recognition or unable to work in a different center like an office job. Wanting to learn something different. The pay was okay, but for what I did at target I felt like it wasn’t enough."
good,Decent fun laid back time consumer fast pace friendly hardworking great hours great pay easy work days stocking great trainers all around great place to work
good,"Target is Target. You go in, adjust items on shelves and help guests. It's an extremely easy job the key is just to keep yourself busy the entire time. As long as you do that you'll do just fine. And make sure you make an effort to gain knowledge of the layout and the items of the store to help out guests, its what you're there for."
good,"Great place to work. Lots of room for advancement and personal growth. Can be difficult to raise a family while in management, as the time commitment can be quite demanding."
good,"I loved working here for target I learned everything quick well as far as loading procedures and safety for target loading in certain ways , how to stock bulk, I quit myself due to the shift that I had yes this place is 4 day 10 hr work weeks but going in at 4:30pm-3:15am was taking a toll on me im used to hard work and general labor warehouses but on 1 st shift anyways I would highly recommend it you top out within the first 2 yrs , once I quit I found a 5:30am-1:30pm job two streets down wich worked better for me but if you like that night shift and don't mind it id say GO FOR IT ."
good,The job is easy because majority of the time you are either folding clothes or putting them back on the racks. The only thing you have to learn to know is where the other items are in target so that you can successfully tell a guest where it is they are looking for.
good,"Great environment to work in, good employees, great health benefits and 401k, great pay, unpredictable schedule, not guaranteed all hours, slightly organized, HR is friendly, safe work environment with regularly scheduled breaks"
good,I would consider working to anyone. The environment was amazing and the management was very friendly and great. I worked multiple different positions and loved being apart of the team.
good,"I loved working here, but was sad to be let go at the end of the season. That particular Target has an admittedly high turnover rate, so I'm not surprised though. They prioritize selling Target Credit Cards over guest satisfaction at that one, and I refuse to promote credit cards for any company. They looked at my Red Card sales instead of my Guest satisfaction ratings and decided not to keep me. Beyond that, they are a company worth working for. They also had issues with making sure I had specific days off for working at my other job, but once I showed notice from my other job of days I had to work for them, the managers were pretty reasonable about it."
good,"I have enjoyed working at Target for over 10 years now. There have been many changes over the years, some I agree with and others not so much. I would recommend to others to apply. I am currently looking for a change."
good,"Working at Target has taught me work ethic, developing work-life balance, and how to become an effective team member. I was able to develop a number of transferrable skills that I believe will help me in the future. Management is very helpful in developing team member's skills. The work is very hands-on and provides a lot of opportunities to communicate with fellow team members and guests on the sales floor."
good,Very organized setting. Hours seem to be there if you want them. Pays better than most retail stores. Schedules are posted quickly so you know your shifts way in advance. Interview process wasn't too bad. Mine consisted of two short interviews with two different people on the same day. You have to supply your own red shirt (at least at the Target I work at you do).
good,"Once you get hired, Target is a fantastic place to work and develop!  It's a fun working environment with lots of opportunity to advance and learn new skills."
good,The coworkers always are very kind to each other. Management actually cares about you and will help you whenever you ask. Management does floor work and doesn't bother you and let's you do your job. The average day consists of stocking shelves and helping customers.
good,"Amazing place to work at, upper leadership is always their to support and give valuable feedback on how to go about the store operations the best way possible."
good,Typical day at Target is a lot of quick-pased and multitasking. Between selling customers and taking care of all the reshop it keeps you busy all day.
good,"I enjoyed many challenging roles at Target, and it is a very collaborative environment! I would recommend the company to others seeking to move up with their career."
good,i thoroughly enjoyed working as an sales associate at Target. management were kind and on call for any occuring problems. Customer service was number one priority. fast paced with many opportunities.
good,i live working for target they are always busy and have great intensives i would recommend any one to work at a target plus the pay is great and they are always willing to work with your schedule
good,"All of my time spent at target was such a good experience. The people were kind but knew how to chaninge their employees. They tough us how to work fast, be friendly and to have fun! We were required to have paid brakes every 2 hours which helped me be more productive during work hours."
good,It was a great environment working here at target I always loved the people and the customers it was a very clean and safe environment all the time and the management was awesome! I would recommend working at target to a friend or family member.
good,"Everyone was very welcoming and friendly. The first day if i had any questions no one had a problem helping. At the start of each shift, we would grab our supplies, and go to work. Everyone got along, we had fun however we got the job done at the end of the day."
good,This was a good first job.  Overall I did get the amount of hours desired but management lacked communication.  The work environment was very relaxed but productive.
good,"I read my email first to see if there's anything that I need to get done first, before going to the sales floor and assessing the store on what needs done. Then lead the team throughout the day on pulls, zone and breaks."
good,"love this company , nice place to work , Management quite supportive  , We have lots of empowerment .CFT engagement is very good.Good Welfare system from HR"
good,clock in and get with the leader of the department you are working in amd they will tell you what to do. sometimes they would send me to other departments to help
good,I have been employed by Target two different times in my life and I will definitely go back if I need extra funds. Absolutely love working there and the work is easy so you can really focus on making it correct.
good,Company has a good culture and managers that respect you. It is fast past and challenging in a good kind of way. I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a part time job. Some benefits and discounts are offered for part time workers and the pay is much better than most of other retailers.
good,"i would return to the company and fulfill my hardwork and to experience more of their company. my typical day at work is easy going at my pace, with no rush nor pressure from my manager. "
good,Good place to start when you're going through school. Good place to use when you can't find anyone else hiring. Good place to stay if you can make it into corporate or salary based areas of work. Try your best to stay away from negative coworkers and focus on your part in working areas other coworkers complain about.
good,"it is good place to work to start with.  if you want to work there for long time - you can. for manager - odd hours and are tough for family time at home, etc.."
good,It's a great company.great benefits you can grow with this company the mangers are nice you get your hours. The pay is good you have the choice of working overtime.
good,I loved working at target. I worked with a good team. The atmosphere was really positive. I like knowing at any moment you could see managers and team leads on the sales floor or at the registers slaving away just like you not hidden uncaring and unreachable in some comfy office while you do everything. I worked at the Minneapolis north east location and the management there was really willing to work with me when it came to scheduling and time off.
good,"Target was a great work place, I worked for target in several different locations in several different states.  I worked mostly in the back room doing logistics.  Receiving, replenishment.  Also did picking for online orders and packing of online orders.  Over all I loved working for Target, management changed not for the better, and it was time for me to move on."
good,"I loved working there , but the other team members and chemistry we all had working as a team really made the difference. everyone helped everyone when I first started there, then things just went down hill, we lost a few people and target started putting pressure on management about the amount of time it should take to get things done which was unrealistic. we lost a lot of good management replaced by others that everyone didn't like and it just went on from there. I would work or target again I truly did like working there just know that of course it will come with workplace drama. Target is a team environment so if the team is terrible it can make the job terrible."
good,"The work environment at Target can be friendly and fun with the right people. Also, management is right on top of things when you need them. I would definitely recommend working here."
good,"Job is great im always busy so the time flies by.my job is independent for the most part but sometimes team leaders will check up on you.the hardest part is probably lifting heavy stuff,only about 60 lb"
good,"Target is a great opportunity for retail management. The hours are very demanding but the satisfaction of achieving goals is a great feeling. Team work, dream work and Target has a great team to help achieve goals."
good,"It was a fun place to work and met alot of cool people there, customer and employee wise. Also management there was pretty on point with them listening to you and being flexible with you."
good,"I lived working at target, the pay was great, amazing coworkers, and it was an overall easy job! The reason i left was because i wasn't getting enough hours and i was exhausting myself working two jobs because of the lack of hours target provided. Often I would get 3 or 4 days a week with a 4-6 hour shift."
good,I loved working at target. The managers were great and my coworkers were awesome. I loved coming to work each day. They worked with my other job and was willing to work with my school schedule and also my other job with scheduling. I actually was sad to leave but I had to focus on school.
good,"I was a backroom team member for over ten years. Most of the time, I was behind the scenes, pulling items from the warehouse. Recently, the company changed its policies, and my role changed to general merchandising. Now my workday doesn't seem so repetitive. I have various tasks to perform in a timely manner, and it seems to make my day go by faster. I like the fast pace because there is never a dull moment. I would suggest this job to anyone who hates sitting down for long periods of time."
good,"As a short term employee of Target I was empowered to learn and encouraged to grow within the community. My efforts were not taken for granted and the company sought to recognize and show gratitude to it’s team members for their performance not only individually but also as a whole. Support and management was able to be reached within each store and also beyond if needed. The company has placed many outlets to its employees for betterment within the company but also as an individual in your own personal life. Had I not needed to relocate due to my spouse’s military orders, I would have quickly returned to the company following my maternity leave with the hopes of receiving my education as a benefit they provide to its team members, furthermore to promote and grow as a target lead. Thank you for the wonderful experience, and invaluable learning and instruction I was given as a team member."
good,"Very easy to pick up worksite activities"
good,The HR department is very willing to work with people so they can optimize their schedule and give them flexibility in job tasks to avoid burnout. There are enough employees that 95% of the time you can get the days off you request.
good,"The pay was not bad at target, and I very much enjoyed the company, and work environment I was provided. My coworkers and Managers seemed to be friendly at all times. There was a few drawbacks I felt I wasn't learning anything so it was a dead end job, and work hours were poor. I would ask for full time, but they could never afford it."
good,"I would begin each night by checking my email for any updates or notices from coworkers in regards to my work. I then would head back to our Receiving desk and begin the process of unloading the truck, scanning it in, ensuring product was there, and making sure it was our truck. My team would arrive shortly thereafter and we would all help unload the truck, take product to the floor, and then stock it throughout the night. very rarely were we unable to finish stocking. I learned how to use a lot of equipment, managerial experience, and logistics processes. I felt supported by my managers, and I had a solid team with a lot of camaraderie. The hardest part of my job was how physical it was, but it was good work. I felt good at the end of each completed shift."
good,A typical day includes helping guest and trying to keep your area clean and maintained. The management is great and willing to help. everyone is expected to know everything.
good,"After working for Target for 2 years, both in Washington and Idaho, I can say that it is a great place to work. I was always recognized for my hard work. My coworkers (including management) easily were like family to me. I would recommend Target a million times to anyone willing to work hard and be efficient."
good,"I loved that job. Good people, fun work, and happy customers. I always managed a smile, even on the most hecktick days. I had the best supervisors and managers there."
good,Great fun place to work! Great people to work with. Sometimes the store became very busy but our team at 1783 (store number) got the job done and always encouraged guest to return
good,"not a hard place to be a cashier, customers can be really stress-inducing, and the dress code was pretty simple. The best part is the discount, worst is the lack of shift flexibility."
good,"Of course working at retail you deal with grumpy customers. But the environment with co workers isn’t all that bad. Sometimes it does get stressful and management does get grumpy but it’s understandable. While I was there, there was some managers that were lazy and rude. Other than that I sometimes miss working here."
good,"Easy work, great pay, sometimes unorganized, co workers are nice, customers nice. Last minute OT, supervisors sometimes don’t communicate. They understand personal problems."
good,"0-tolerance policy when it comes to safety , very safe and productive work environment. Very good Management . would very much recommend this company to people who are very serious about their profession."
good,"The work is good, benefits are OK. Hours can be a little hard to deal with. Good training program. Communication is OK."
good,Loved the job nice and relaxing for the most part just wish it paid more. It was fun working back room. Quick pace at times but ounce u know where everything is at its fine.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is teamwork. The management workers are great. They offer prizes on who gets the most target credit card applications. They give free lunches or treats.
good,"Working at Target was a really good experience for me, it helped me build up my communications skills as well as my time management skills because I didn’t want to clock out of work and not have finished my tasks."
good,"Good training program.  Management was fair. I enjoyed this job it fast paced and made your day fly by.  Employees all worked together as a team,  if you needed help your co-workers were right there to help you.  Store manager would come up an ring help cart attendants grab carts outside in the snow an rain to make sure sure customers had carts to do their shopping, you wouldn't see that at Cub or Walmart."
good,I love working around and with people. patrolling all grounds kept me very busy and writing reports as well. Watching all cameras as well. I really enjoyed that job.
good,You start off your work day with a daily team meeting. Then you meet with your department leader to discuss what tasks need to be done for the day then you do the task while assisting customers.
good,Working at Target is a very relaxed job. You have to help the guests find what they are looking for and keep your area tidy and cleaned. Put back other items and make sure the racks are stocked.
good,"The managers were pretty cool"
good,"I loved my job and working here. Great friendly people and bosses. Wish I could have stayed but couldn’t due to the hours being cut, and no room for advancement."
good,"There are lots of different types of people to work with."
good,I really enjoyed working at Target during the Christmas Holiday season. It gave me a chance to do my Christmas shopping and to also make money and help customers. Some days were very busy but some other days weren't as busy and it was actually really nice working there. The management was good and I'm still friends with some of the other workers even though i havent worked for them for over 10 years.
good,Great place to work! Always lots of hours to pick up and relatively customizable schedule. Everyone who works there is very nice and you will form bonds with your coworkers.
good,A typical day at work can mean a lot of different things. You're either constantly busy with guests or you aren't busy at all. There are many things you will be required to do whether you are or not.
good,This is a great place to work. Nice people to work with along with the management team. If you want to work part time or college student this is the place for you.
good,"I loved working at Super Target. There’s great opportunities to advance as well. And they let you cross train in any department if you ask. Which results in you being able to pick up more hours. Management was poor when I was there which resulted in me leaving, but I had a wonderful 5 years. Definitely not a sour experience. Not a bad first time job."
good,A typical day at Target consist of hard working coworkers that are available throughout the store whos there to make sure you have the absolute best shopping experience possible.
good,Target is a great place to work... they really appreciate their employees. I really enjoyed my time working here. The enviornment is great. I liked it.
good,It was fun being there working the most part but the managers was sloppy and liars but work was fun I enjoy being there. I love the hours I was getting and the pay. I was one of the best and fastest in the company and learning more as I was going along
good,Target is one of them companies you love and hate to work for. The Team leads are lovely and friendly. But the pay and hours can suck sometimes. They should offer Overtime!
good,"Great place to work while doing school. They are very understanding of school and encouraging that you continue with school. They do however like to have open availability, but they will work around your schedule if you’re a great worker."
good,"Its a fantastic company and my team are all stars. I just need to have a full time job in order to afford the basic things for my family like a car, roof, and food. I'm not upset with Target about my part-time status, that's what I signed up for. I just, unfortunately, can not survive with a part time position."
good,Always enjoyed my time. Management was always good. Pay was always decent.  Hours were hit or miss. They pay more now then when I worked there. I have and continue to recommend target as a job when asked.
good,"I work in the Softlines department. I go into work with a mentality ready to tackle the day and enjoy every minute of it. The team is driven and thrive on unity, we help one another day in and day out."
good,"Good pay and hours, required breaks, not great training. They train everyone in cashiering. Very flexible working with student. Able to take a leave of absence for things like school. Sometimes they'll have pizza or food in the break room. Have to take an unpaid 30 min lunch if working 6 or more hours. Good friendly people, typical retail customers."
good,target is a good place to work at. Because not only the people there are nice but also the managers are also nice . The hours there are also flexible and they follow your availability and make sure you are able to come into work everyday. It's a very nice environment to work at.
good,Target fives the opportunity for you to go to school and work with the flexibility of hours and if it's hard  you to do both you can choose to take a leave and they can hold your job for you . That one main reason why this job is great. I love how the job is diversity and non judgmental.
good,Target is an amazing place to work. The managers are very helpful if you don't understand something. The work environment is really nice; it can be fast paced but if you know what you are doing it is not stressful.
good,Target is something Hilo needed for a long time. Their pay as well as benefits allow you to be able to survive in Hilo. Internal fighting among management and even shift make it hard to communicate though.
good,Great work/life balance. Very ethical and smart organization. It is very good in providing the support and infrastructure to scale applications and learn open source technologies.
good,"Target is a great place to work. The staff are really friendly and are great to work with. If I could recommend this job to anyone I would, and the pay is awesome"
good,The LOD's were all very helpful and always came when assistance was needed for the cashiers. They all helped me learn how to use a cash register and other tasks for my position. The hardest part about the job would most likely have to be how to deal with upset customers because we have to accommodate to their needs. The most enjoyable part would have to be learning more behind the company and the discount.
good,I loved working for target. Team members were great to work with. No complaints. Awesome place and environment to work.Felt valued as an employee. I would recommend target to anyone.
good,i really liked working for the company. the management was very friendly and easy to work with. the workplace was also very friendly and easy to work with.
good,"I unfortunately was working alone in flexible fulfillment while still relatively new as the only other main person in the department was in surgery leading up to the holidays. I had a second job and overextended myself, then was given hours outside of the schedule I set clearly because of my other job. "
good,"Teamwork here at Target is respectful, there is a clear feeling of togetherness and acceptance.  Management is very helpful, they are also knowledgable, funny, and enjoyable."
good,The typical day of work consisted of helping guests find items and make sure that the store was in top shape. Co-workers and managers were very friendly and understanding. They are willing to help out if there is a lot on your plate.
good,"Great place to work, management can be great but it depends on the manager. Pay is really good and hours are consistent and flexible. Raises are often enough."
good,"Not much to say aside from how great my experience was there but I might be biased. Management can be a little wonky but they are competent at their job. The sound of the TVs in the morning sometimes get to you but fortunately if you are not on the sales floor and just shipping packages, you are free to listen to music (in one ear of course)."
good,Phones kept steady and sometimes overwhelming. Coworkers were cooperating and offered help in every which way. Organized work space and flexible work schedule.
good,"Personally, I loved working at Target because of the hours, pay, and workload. I worked in the Electronics section and, even though I was part-time seasonal, I was treated with the same respect. Of course, you have to work hard and keep up with the fast pace, but your hard work is seen and awarded."
good,this job is great as a career and for something temporary. They allow us to branch out. they care about their associates wellbeing. occasionally have small events for the store.
good,"It was a good experience overall, they put a little too much pressure on the red cards. The managers are nice but are on top of the red cards. The pay is pretty good"
good,"Co-workers were very nice, when they we're teaching you new things they would be very patient with you since you're new. Also they are very friendly with you, overall a fun place to work at and very chill place."
good,"You will be expected to work very fast and you will get a lot of experience. You will learn to use the cash register, stock shelves, and answer customer questions."
good,"Target was very professional and I was amazed at how quickly they were willing to cross train me in various departments when I expressed interest. I was able to work in 7 different departments (it was a Super Target) with careful training in each department. My shifts would bounce between these departments after training was complete, so, I was never bored or felt like my job was repetitive. The benefits are great and the work environment is amazing."
good,"Although I hated my job as a cashier, I loved working for Target. Everyone was very friendly with each other and I became friends with most of my coworkers, which helped create a more relaxed workplace vibe. My manager was even aware that I was not a fan of cashiering and helped me get training in other departments so that I wasn't always cashiering, which I really appreciated."
good,A day could get busy or not but it was a very pleasant environment to work. Help was available when I needed. I learned about being a cashier and how to assist customers. The hardest part was adding and subtracting the money.
good,"Target is a fun and relaxed work environment. The management at my Target store is great and are very kind towards the employees. Although this might not be the case in other Targets, our Target is given free lunch from somewhere in the town center at least once every week. The work culture is focused and know how to relax and have fun. Great place to work."
good,Pretty easy routine you do Daily definitely chew gum cause air is dry if you work in the aisles of candles or cleaning supply. People were really nice easy to make friends manager was cool. But target is pretty selective after the holidays if you’re seasonal it’s a very low chance of staying also everyone hours get cut a pretty good chunk. Customers aren’t bad either pretty good maybe you get one carol or Karen or a extreme football dad yelling at you cause the store is out of Gatorade or something. But you can definitely call for backup from other coworkers for help and accommodation.
good,"Any job that I’ve ever worked, I would totally owe it to my attitude and how I look forward to having a great day at work. Having a passion for what you do is important."
good,"I started as a seasonal employee in late 2018. This was my first real job. I enjoyed working seasonal, and after seasonal employees were let go in January, I reapplied to a nearby Target by my house instead of school, and started again recently. The hiring process was relatively easy compared to other jobs I had applied for."
good,I was a seasonal employee and got as many hours as I wanted. Great supervisor and staff.  The discount was great too. I will work here again when positions open.
good,"Target provides me with experience as well as an amazing working environment. Most of the time, there is a certain schedule you follow in order to complete all the procedures. Employees are all willing to help each other when needed."
good,"Excelente, supervisor miy dedicado al trabajo muy buena empresa"
good,I absolutely loved the target experience. Was definitely short lived because it was seasonal but the short time being there  i did have a stressful but productive time there.
good,It was great from the beginning to the end. I learned quickly and I was given responsibilities I didn’t know I could handle until I did. I would work there again.
good,I have had a great experience at Target. They pay well and there are alot of mentor help to help you advance your career. Flexible work schedule and wonderful management.
good,Great job nice people work in different departments  treat workers fairly let your work days very I would tell everyone to apply for them. They have good discounts
good,"I had a blast working at Target. I worked in Electronics, assisting guests with everything from cell phones to TVs and game consoles. The hours are part time for most positions, and can vary depending on department. I averaged about 30 hours per week. Pay was really nice considering it was a retail position. Managers did not micro manage or try to get us to push crazy protection plans (though they were strongly encouraged and pushed for, as it is a good service). At my store, we had three shifts: open at 8 AM, work until 1 PM (usually), mid shift from 1 PM to 6 PM most days, and closing, which was usually 6 PM to 10 or 11 PM. Target has a great culture which empowers its employees. I would EASILY recommend this company to anyone looking for a flexible job."
good,I loved working here I wish it wasn't a seasonal position. Everyones is nice and helpful. We had an orientation and training that helped a lot to be informed of everything about the company.
good,"Once again, it was a fun place to work thanks to the manager and supervisors. I would definitely recommend the Germantown location. Although if I were to be critical of this location, I would say that one of your supervisors might be a d*ck. So, good luck dealing with that in a calm manner."
good,"Es una buena empresa, con buen ambiente de trabajo y buen sueldo para empezar."
good,"The job is good. It is part time job unless your manager you can get full time. This job is good for high schooler, and if your living with someone. If you need to on your own you have to get a second job."
good,I have worked at target for 1 year and 6 months it’s a really good job for now I have learned a lot from this job and meet really cool people working here I have learned to be more organized well working here and to help my guest as much as I can. I make sure I have done my work and reached my goals at the end of my night I work the apparel area of the store so Im always working with the clothes. My schedule is very flexible I work the nights and days so I know what’s its like to close the store and what it’s like when the store opens.
good,"Typically a day at Target, is a fun-filled day with great employees, learning multiple departments, achieving great communication skills and doing things that will benefit Target as a whole. The hardest part of the job is probably the back room, which just takes a lot of hard work and dedication, which will improve overall. The most enjoyable part of Target is walking in, and getting a good vibe from employees, the guest and mainly the managers!"
good,You get out what you put in here. Great place to start your career to develop business acumen and how to manage teams through times of change and growth.
good,Target had a great team effort. It was not unexpected to see the store manager or HR manager on a register behind you. This showed me not only did they value the team member they knew that helping was important as well.
good,This is a great place to work! Incredible staff and very understanding! It’s easy to learn so I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a first job but it also has amazing opportunities for growth and advancement!
good,A typical work day at target would conclude of hoping on a register right away and interacting with customers ringing up their grcoeries and clothing and etc.... on the weekends it’s a fast moving pace because it tends to get very busy.
good,"I worked in the back at target for during the holidays. I packed up orders customers would put in online. I would go to the front of the store, find the items off the shelf, take it back and ship it out for the customers. As christmas got closer the amount of orders would build up and required us to work faster to get everything done. It was a good experience to work in the back and see how things are ran."
good,"I loved working here so much, I wish Target Canada was still here. The staff was always amazing and the higher ups wouldn't breathe down your neck for you to get your work done. Overall a very satisfactory place to work."
good,"In the short time that i worked at Target i enjoyed it so much. The team leads are friendly and they were understanding. The store was very clean, every one was very friendly. Overall just an amazing experience."
good,The management isn’t that great but working here was great. The supervisors weren’t that great either but what you got to remember is your there to work and get paid
good,"Flexible hours, good training with knowledgeable staff and strong Management support.  Picking merchandise was challenging during holiday season. Time spent at work goes by quickly in fast paced environment."
good,It was a really fun job! one of my favorites actually. The only reason I didn't stay with the company was because I was moving and the local Target store here was not looking for new employees.
good,"The work was really straight forward and easy. We all worked together as a team so everything usually got done, but there was still a lot of responsibility for each person to do their part. Management was kind of unprofessional."
good,Target is a good place to work at I loved it they train me for skills that I would use in life or come in handy in other jobs I would consider working there again in the future
good,"I loved this job and the people i worked with. They quickly became my family. As any job,  it can be fast paced but they works well with you as a team. You have more freedom on the register and can make decisions on your own. Company policy is not too strict or tool lenient"
good,"A typical day at target would be answering the phone, going up for back up, pushing inventory to the sales floor pad, greeting guest and going up for back up. I learned how to become a more communicative co-worker, servicing guest, how to drive sales. Management focused on setting goals for each department to drive sales. This job can be stressful on a very busy day but it is a great work environment. Target is flexible around your schedule."
good,"The job was fast paced and fun, very easy to learn the job and the co workers are extremely helpful. The job was seasonal so the hours were slim but they made me feel right at home for the small time I was there."
good,"its been an honor working at target, the staff is very friendly and helpful. not a stressful job, you know your assignment and you are provided a reasonable amount of time to get it done. very good environment and management."
good,A typical day at target was very interactive and I always found myself busy doing one task or helping guests. Everyone is freiendly including management and they are very understanding. The hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule. The most enjoyable part was interacting with guests and team members.
good,I was with Target for almost three years and walked away with many friendships as well as many skills to help me improve my customer service skills. I enjoyed the workplace as well as the guests that would come into the store.
good,Quick paced environment. Very easy to get involved.  Friendly coworkers. Management is approachable. Work itself can be repetitive but easy for the most part.
good,"I wish I didn't leave when I did, but I was going to school to become an electrician and I didn't see them benefiting me for my future besides getting a paycheck."
good,I liked working here even though it was only for a seasonal position. The staff is all pretty nice and the training was really good. Would work here again part time.
good,The work environment a target was fair but you did get a lot of negativity and management was not very good due to how employees are treated.  The pay is very good as well as the hours and you got a 10% discount I would recommend the work environment for other people it just wasn’t for me .
good,"daily meetings with supervisor for daily work "
good,Great pay but no heat or air. If you like working fast and with others than this is the job for you. Supervisors are normally laid back. Most workers have poor attitudes but they do make you work lots of overtime just recently.
good,"I would certainly recommend working at Target to anyone who needed a job. They are very warm and accommodating to my needs. Everytime I had a change in schedule,due to changing school schedules, they were always willing to sort it out without changing my hour limit."
good,My time there was fun and I wish they had kept me on the team with them. Days varied depending on the amount of orders for the day. Team leaders do whatever they can to help you and make sure things are done in the correct manner.
good,Very fun and great environment to work in I love that the team I work with was positive and motivating and suppotive.seeing guest smiling was rewarding
good,"Everything at Target is straight forward and easy to understand. There is always someone you can go to with questions or for help. The work culture is pretty great, and it is very team based and generally fun. They were very understanding and flexible, especially when  came to changes in availability revolving around a school schedule. I developed a second family there and looked forward to going into work. There are many managers, which makes addressing any issues you may encounter very easy to address and get taken care of, especially because of their great open door policy. I had to take two medical related leaves of absence and they were incredibly understanding and helpful. The only downsides that I faced during my time there were when they didn't have enough hours to give out a couple of times, and I wasn't getting as many hours as needed. This was frustrating, but it was eventually resolved after speaking with managers and human resources. Towards the end of my time there, there was a shift in management that didn't work well for many people, because it altered the atmosphere of the workplace, but because you work with so many people and several leads (managers) it didn't totally destroy the workplace, and it still felt like a nice place to work."
good,Well we would get there about 12 and pulled out a full 8-hour shift unload the in an hour and a half get everything organized on pallets take them out to the areas that they need to be unloaded and put on the shelves that would take us three hours to do the whole store take our first break and get right back into work until we're done right before we open clock out go home
good,Very well paid career with some room for advancement. Management is struggling to retain its employees and senior team is somewhat productive on finding an outlet for team leaders to alleviate the situations.
good,"Generally, I really enjoyed working this job. It was a good pay rate and the employees and customers really made my day go by quick. But Management could have been better. They were quick to berate you for something you can't help and try to humiliate you infront of your peers."
good,"Fast-paced and exciting work environment., Very collaborative and helpful staff. There was no hard aspect to this job. I enjoyed every day here. The customers were the best part of the day."
good,Targets call center is  a great place to work when it comes to pay the down side is the phone calls never stop. I would recommend working there because of pay
good,"This job taught me so much about customer relationships, working as a team, and customer satisfaction. It was very fast paced but left ample amount of room to grow and venture into different departments. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with different people and solving a customers problems."
good,I had an amazing time working here. All the managers were really easy to talk to and made working there great. I was hired them knowing about my health problems and were 100% supportive. I worked in 2 departments primarily but did take shifts in others and I enjoyed it. I w po ull gladly go visit just to see those people who work there who have now become people close to me.
good,"Great job, the store has a team work vibe."
good,I loved this job. There was a lot of teamwork and you never felt as if your job was at peril. We also did a lot of charity work which I loved.There were always incentives
good,I learned how to respect retail more along with working at a fast pace but being organized. They didnt work with my school hours very much so it made it hard but not impossible.
good,very friendly place to work for. they have huddles everyday to increase employee productivity.Increased pay every few months depending on your work ethics
good,"Target was pretty good to work for. Excellent staff, and management felt like they cared about us. Came in early 5:30 left usually around 1:30-2:00. Quick paced work though."
good,The co- workers were great to work with. The management was awesome. Open-door policy with team leaders you can confide in. Was just time to move on and find learn more.
good,My schedule from school hindered me from reaching my desired work ethic . When I was there I recieved nasty looks from co workers because of my age and of me being a newbie.
good,"Highly recommend working for Target, great company, great vision. The only reason I left was due to personal reasons and my health. Long term benefits are great with Target as well."
good,Nothing wrong with working at this target location back in 2011 seasonal year. I meet people from interesting backgrounds. I though I worked in a great service flow team and everyone got everything done.
good,"Out of the three places I have worked while in college, Target has been the most flexible and understanding about prioritizing school. The company has a great leadership team with an easy to understand structure."
good,"Flexible days, friendly family orientate environment. Breaks are spreaded out threw shift in a reasonable fashion. Opportunities  is available upon position."
good,"Working at Target was so boring, I could barely stand it. As someone who loves to work hard and get things done, I found it extremely tiresome to simply wander the store until something was needed of me."
good,"Working with many team members to cull product, replenish produce of better quality, and help consumers with concerns for a better shopping experience"
good,"A typical day at work  greeting customers, answering questions, offering assistance, suggesting items, lending opinions and providing product information. Friendly people, love working as a team member."
good,Great while it lasted. No more pharmacy though. First job here and never had any major issues with the company. Was really a fast fun and friendly place to work. Sad they decided to part ways with the pharmacy.
good,"As my first job, I had a good time working at Target. I would go in and work though the hours I got weren't something I couldn't do much about since I was new."
good,"Depending on the situation, you can be trained to work in different areas of the store. If you are not available to work all the time they will try to work with you."
good,"Most team members and managers were easy to work with and helpful. Human resources was flexible with my schedule to achieve a work/life balance. Some of the jobs became tedious and repetitive, but overall comfortable place to work."
good,Target is a very great company to work for they have a lot of events going on daily they are also very active with the team I loved working here because of the environment
good,"I enjoy going to work and the climate is pleasant.  I feel there is room for advancement.  The management team is pleasant and kind.  Although training could be more in depth, there are plenty of opportunities to learn as you go."
good,Overall I loved working at Target and was a good learning postision and enviroment for me to be in. Coworkers was nice and always willing to help someone in need.
good,"Always really great people to work with!"
good,"I had a great time working at target, i was just mainly a cashier, but you saw a lot when your working in the front, the store was constantly busy, and eve when the store wasnt busy you could still find something to do. there was always something to do. the management was great, very well organized."
good,"I worked there for a long time if they paid a little more I would have stayed.  Everyone got along with each other it was like a family with your coworkers.  I enjoyed working there,  if they paid more I would go back."
good,"Management is understanding and kind"
good,The managers work well with team members to teach effective ways to complete the zones and multitask between helping guests and “zoning.” Good job for people who are quick learners and work well both by themselves as well as amongst others.
good,"i worked mostly in the clothing areas and enjoyed it , keep busy with customers and making sure areas where neat and clean, fun working with all others, management people nice to work for"
good,"Very well managed, fast-paced, always something to do, repetitive, honest work, hard work, motivated team, customer is number one priorty, if you need help a coworker will assist"
good,This job is a great part-time job for first-time employees and experienced professionals. Through working at this company I learned a lot about responsibility.
good,"I did not work at Target very long, I only worked there as a temporary job before starting my plumbing trade. Target is a good job because you learn a lot about customer service."
good,Definitely worth trying. Target is a big store full of opportunities and friendly faces. The work wasnt so difficult and the pay was suffice. Great for fast paste workers.
good,"Working at target as a teenager was memorable. Target's environment was always great, it was never uncomfortable speaking to coworkers, managers or the guests who came in throughout the day. Being eighteen at the time and having a job as a responsibility showed me the peak of adulthood. Management encourged the staff to communicate with people who were strangers and with that it had given me the opportunity to breakout of being a shy person and have full blown conversations with many people."
good,I enjoyed target. i unloaded the truck every morning and would challenge myself to see if i could put away my merchandise before the other departments. most of the time i did..
good,During holiday season it is busy and fast paced. You deal with really nice costumers and really rude but that is everywhere you work with customers. Easy job for holiday season.
good,There were a lot of training opportunities and tasks to learn. Never had down time. We always stayed busy. The customers were amusing and all so different. Target was great to learn a lot of skills
good,I would recommend working at Target to anyone. You are able to set up the hours on a Day by day basis and are able to get additional hours if others do not want work their shift.
good,I loved my job at Target! It was a great place to work while going to school. I made wonderful friends here and management was wonderful and always left room for questions and always made sure I was comfortable with my job! There is plenty of room for growth if you're willing to work and the company takes good care of their employees. I was sad to go but am so thankful for Target and will remember my time here with joy.
good,Working at target for two years was great. I learned a lot and was able to work in different department. The guests/customers were always nice. The management was strict but very nice. One can never have 40 hours a week or overtime but they do try to work with your schedule so it's great for students.
good,"I enjoyed the culture at Target. The organization prides itself in staying very organized and clean, by putting Safety First daily. Production was effective and fast paced."
good,I would recommend this job to someone else because its a good job to learn physical labor and teaches you to keep yourself busy at all times. Very good place to work.
good,"Warm up for work. The team leader gives you your assignment, find you a standing forklift, log into it, and go to your trailer and start loading from a conveyor belt."
good,I loved working for Target because there too you interacted with many different people from different background. So was nice to be able to talk to them and get to know a little about them.

good,Great place to work at and I would have loved to been able to stay longer than seasonal. I enjoyed working with different people and helping out customers when needed. I am impressed with the customer service skills at target.

good,I loved working at Target. the people are amazing the customers can be crazy but they making working their fun. I loved the work it wasn't back breaking and they didn't expect more than you could handle
good,Working for Target.com is great. I really enjoy the atmosphere. It is generally a call center setting. Training classes are giving to insure everyone is up to par and prepared to do their job effectively.
good,"I wanted to work somewhere fun that also paid a fair wage, and Target was the perfect choice for me. I'm in electronics, and it's basically where I thrive, as I love books, movies, games, and all that good stuff. The people I work with are wonderful and were very patient when I was new and still learning. In fact, they're all still wonderful if I ever have any questions about anything. The pay is honestly wonderful, especially if you're right out of high school or even college, as it's better than the minimum wage here in PA (which is currently $7.25) "
good,My experience I talk it was great supervisors and managers are great hours fluctuate weekly  so that was something I had to get used to my only concern is that the job ended too soon.
good,"I honestly dont have much to say besides I loved working there and the people I met. "
good,A typical day at work is getting to work and start to unload trucks and start stocking item where they are suppose to go. I learned how to properly stock items on the shelves. The work culture was very good. The hardest part of the job was going fast and not being able to take your time to stock the items. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a group while helping others stock and making money all at the same time.
good,Great place to work for! the benefits an discounts are good as well. its always overtime the pay is decent an you get paid weekly. if you want a day off request it a month to two weeks advance. Also they have tuition reimbursement for business or associate degrees.
good,"Newton DC is a  newer  facility, friendly people, and fast-paced environment. Management was approachable, HR department was excellent, always helpful."
good,Nice place to work from my experience.  Management was nice and understanding. Work is repetitive but coworkers and guests gets you through the day. If you're a hard worker you can advance within the company rather quickly.
good,Target really surprised me by being a wonderful company to work for. They train the employees well for as many situations and scenarios as possible. Customer service is truly the top priority.

good,Target has a respectful workplace culture. The internship program was robust. The management team was wonderful. Enjoyed my time as an intern and would recommend it to anyone interested working for Target.
good,Target was a great job. I really enjoyed working with fellow employees and creating friendships with them. I also enjoyed talking to customers and helping them check out and get the discounts that they deserved on their orders.
good,"I enjoyed my job, I got to work on the plano team, and pick up hour in the fitting room. I could have also picked up cashier and other department hours if I had wanted to.  I had the greatest manager while on plano who worked hard along side of us, he was a great team player.  There was some drama becuase it is a sales job, but overall liked working for target and would recommend it."
good,I worked overnight so not many people were there. Everyone was very helpful and were willing to help you fix your mistakes. The hardest part was trying to stay up all night and not knowing when you are getting off. The most enjoyable part were the breaks and unloading the truck where you got to work and get to know all your coworkers.
good,"Overall target is a good place to work at, just didn’t get enough hours that I needed. Mostly been trained to work in all departments of the store, which is a bonus."
good,I loved working here.. I meet nice people and they loved me. Customer service skills where at an all time high on a daily a basis. I enjoyed going it work
good,"Work is very predictable, yet constantly changing. There is always something to do and you're never wondering around trying to find something.  The coworkers are great, the LOD's are amazing and the guest that shop there are always happy to be there and constantly looking for something to buy. Training is easy to follow and you learn as you go."
good,"Target was an interesting place of employment, learned many tings from my coworkers and also things from the customers I would recommend it for a first job."
good,This retail store was fair and collective despite i had a relocation! Other than that the job is recommendable to any and the environment is calm and acceptable!
good,"great job just need good shoes your standing all day I advanced in my job quickly and learned other positions.. you always stay busy ,  there's a smoking session and you don't have just stand in one spot"
good,excellent job for college students. flexible hours and easy work in a clean and stress free environment. Cashier job is the most hectic and demanding. Wear comfortable shoes!
good,"I enjoy working here overall, the team members and management are all kind and they are always eager to help everyone. The work is fast paced, and there is always something to do."
good,I had a great experience working at target. Everyone there is friendly and efficient. There is no competition it’s all collaborative. I’m thinking about applying for the one here!
good,A typical day at work is checking to see what workload is required for the day. while helping guest and co workers with any thing that they may need. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the final outcome of the job task and the smiles on the faces that I have helped.
good,Some rude people but I worked around that great hours for part time position. I would recommend to someone just graduated high school. No hard work mainly a cashier so dealing with customers more
good,"I work early mornings, the early morning shift is very productive and very fast past its also easy. All of my co-workers and my managers are very kind, funny and we all have a good time as we are working hard and fast."
good,"target is great. The people are great. work culture is great. mentorship is great. I just wish it were in a bigger city. minne is amazing, but winters are brutal"
good,I was still in school when I was working and the managers working with me and my school hours and at the same time gave me decent hours to work with at the store I learned something almost everyday I got along with all my managers and at the time I going through a rough time and they were willing to work with me the hardest part of the job I found was when I first stared I was having a hard time remembering where everything the store was but the most enjoyable was the smiles on every customers face that I came across and if they were having a bad I was able to change their mood by the time they left the store
good,"I only worked there shortly and it was the most amazing spot to work. A lot more freedom to do your job at your own speed without judgement. There was very apparent advancement when you excelled at your position, as well. They had amazing benefits and amazing culture that cared about the employee as a person rather than the employee as a number. I was sad to hear that Target hadn't taken off in Canada. It was ahead of it's time."
good,Everyone is very friendly; your coworker become your target family. The managers are understanding and patient. They have flexible hours and they pay well. Overall a great place to work.
good,"Target is BY FAR the most friendly company Ive ever worked for with Excellent Management. I could do better by showing up on time (even then they have worked with me). Besides me bettering my attendance, i dont see any improvement needed in the Workplace."
good,The company was very interactive with us. Made sure that we were health feeling well. They provided great benefits and very understanding that people do have life outside of work.
good,Target was an amazing place to work. Everyone was considered family there. Not once did I ever have any problems with anyone or anything. Even the customers were friendly.
good,"Very fun culture and flexible management. Great pay. competitive pay, vacation time is great. Great communication. Great food, gym is awesome and free."

good,"Management understands the life problems associates may have and works along to meet needs as they arrive to get optimum performance. Advancement in Target very possible to those associates who demonstrate interest, responsibility and trustworthiness. All stores are neat and clean and the employees all illustrate the ""can-do"" attitude. This makes for a rewarding experience during the work day. I don't remember having any benefits during my small time with them 20 years ago. I have no opinion available in that respect."
good,"Target distribution is an excellent place to work. The people are friendly,management is approachable and HR really seems to care about employees. The hardest part of the job is the heat in the summer months."
good,My manager was amazing. He prepared and trained me for everything i might encounter in the future. I was offered the chance of moving to management as well.
good,"8 hour shifts, no expectation to stay longer. Grab equipment and get straight to allotted workload. Manager was always flexible/understanding about changing circumstances. Pay was decent and always get paid overtime, holidays, shift differential"
good,I always had fun coming into work and communicating with my work friends. Very chill environment. Tedious and repetitive work. Always something new coming into work every day.
good,"All of my managers were good at welcoming me with a smile. I had to take a leave of absence due to mental health, and HR was very helpful and extremely understanding."
good,"A typical work day included stocking shelves, making sure sales floor is nice and neat for efficient customer flow."
good,I really like everything about my job and the store I work for. We are one big team. Everyone is polite and helpful. The Team Leads (Managers) are great. They treat Team Members like people. Days start with Good Morning and end with  Have a good rest of your day.
good,"Operate cash register, scan guest items and maintain a clean work area. Make sure your register is balanced and you scan all big bills to make sure they are real"
good,"I had a great experience working at Target in Opelika, AL right out of college. Was a great team environment and great company culture. If you work hard you are rewarded and if you qualify advancement is available."
good,"Faced paced environment , great team work and you will always get feed back on your performance.Fun and fast paced environment.I would recommend this place and they definitely work with your hours."
good,clean register
good,Guest love the warm welcome as they enter the store... guest loves how we go over and beyond to get the items they want ..the overall experience coming from the frontend is awasome
good,It's a good place to supplement you income. But for a serious job you can not rely on set hours. you can go from 40 to 15 hr with no warning.  Loved the people and the managers. Like another family atmosphere.
good,"Ive had the pleasure to be employed by Target, I was able to experience many different aspects of such a competitive retail cooperation.Managment was so motivated and fun to work for and with.I was able to learn fast and the wonderful thing is they recognize your ability and help you excel at your preference.."
good,"Target was very professional and cared a lot about its customers. Everyone was willing to contribute to make it the most productive environment possible. Things always got done no matter what. I felt motivated to do my best. Since my manager cared a lot about her customers, I felt like I had to take after her example and perform well. I am glad that I made that decision. It feels good to help out a customer when they need it and give them quality care."
good,"I liked working here. I was working in pretty much every area of the sales floor and it's easy to learn. As far as retail goes, I thought that this was a good job to have."
good,I have had a great experience at Target. I have enjoyed my time there and would be happy to continue to work there.  The culture is great.  The people are great.
good,"Target DC is a good job. The pay is good and the managers are good to you. The job will take care of you, as long as you take care of the job. Good environment."
good,i liked this place alot it was pretty fun. I helped a lot of people. My favorite thing was the video games. I made alot of money. I would do anything in my free time like help other people
good,Flex is ship to store but at the location I work at they have a small team so the chances of being kept were small but it was a fast paste environment the first week it’s easy to get the hang of packing the second week was doing picking and that was a bit tricky but of all was a great seasonal position.
good,A typical day at work was a full shift. In the mornings the store is relatively slow. i would use this time to go ever daily conversion goals with team members.
good,"One of the most pleasurable work environments I’ve ever been in. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Target in Trussville,AL. If every work environment was like that place there would be a lot more employee satisfaction and better customer service all around. Management goes above and beyond to make the team members feel valued"
good,"Target was like my family for the short year that I worked there. I really miss my old target store. Management was on point, team leaders are understanding, they are flexible with hours. they are flexible with needing time off. They APPRECIATE you and everything you do. Lots of company get togethers, bbq's lunches, on holidays they bring in outside food (olive garden, pizza, etc) They award you for your work, they take the time to listen to your problems, should you have any, they WANT you to grow with their company."
good,"knowing that you work hard and multitask at the same time will move you up a spot to becoming management faster. Working at Target is better then anything else, they work with your schedule and when you have family emergence, they are friendly and kind peers to their employees and coworkers, everything they do is for our guess and employees."
good,"A typical day for an Asset Protection Specialist at target included taking inventory on high theft items, reviewing empty packages and no receipt returns.  It was a fun work experience and working with guests and the employers made the work place exciting,"
good,A Typical day is working more than one department at a time for covering breaks and lunches. Learning never stops at Target. Always things to learn if you are willing to move around in different areas. Management is really nice and relaxed.
good,Great culture and vibe. Target knows how to carry its brand name and put its self out there. They are not afraid of taking risk or opportunities in new brands.
good,Great work life balance.  Management wants to see everyone succeed and will work with you as long as you are willing to learn.  The structure of management is beneficial to work life balance.
good,The job itself was pretty fast paced because of how much foot traffic the store has. The pay was also pretty well and fair which was also extremely nice.
good,"While working for Target, I feel I gained a lot of work experience. I dealt with a lot of customers and lot of situations. The management was good but could be better, and the employees were great! Overall, I loved working there and I am glad they hired me for the short time they did."
good,"It wasn't just a job working at target , i had fun on what I was doing. On a daily basis I interact with people and that is what I love to do. The managers and my coworkers was awesome."
good,"Management likes to have fun on days that will be busy and stressful by providing activities or food for everyone. "
good,Target is a great company to work. It's very chill and relaxed. Also they are willing to work with your schedule. I would recommend working here just don't expect anything more than 20 hours a week if your part time. But it is possible to get more just don't expect more.
good,"Target´s breakrooms are not anything close to dull. A vending machine for both healthy snacks and an assortment of beverages only grace the room with their presences. The real blessing comes from the long spotless tables that employees could gather around and conversate; mealtimes were no longer an escape, from a busy seasonal day, but now played as an extending hand for the co-workers to become friends, who share the same goals and inspirations. Activities and Seasonal Cook-offs are the highlights of this breakroom, and that´s really where Target´s Family gets their spirit."
good,"I worked mostly as a cashier. It gave me a lot of people skills and taught me to how to deal with a customer. I normally worked in the afternoon to close. I really enjoyed those hours because at the end of the night I would get to learn more about the other positions in Target. The only thing I did not like about Target was how excessive they were about you taking a break after 4.5 hours, even if I was close to the time I had to run all the way back from wherever I was and clock out for break. I also did not like the 8 hour self checkout shifts. I had fun learning how the SCO machines worked or helping when it came to covering a break but standing in the one spot for 8 hours was very boring. The management was very kind and understanding. If I needed a day off and could not get it picked up from the shift board they would understand. This was rarely needed I always remembered to type my requested days off into the computer. Also when I put in my 2 weeks they were very kind about it. They understood I was having a difficult time balancing school and work since I had two jobs at the time. They said they would love to have me back if I ever chose. Overall they were very nice people. I would say my favorite part of this job was how much I was able to learn with my small amount of time there, especially when it came to running reshop or helping a team member finish their carts before the end of the day."
good,"We all have issues with our work place. However, Target is one of the better retail jobs you can have. Management makes a huge difference in how my day would go. Overall I had a wonderful set of front end managers. However, my store manager was very cut throat...didn't care about her team. I did not like her style of managing the store, and was not alone in that opinion. You have to have the right management to enjoy target, I stress this because I did have wonderful management overall. My typical work day was spent at the registers or service desk. I enjoyed my guests for the most part and at first I was given freedom to do my job. As time progressed...management began tightening up on the front end team to the point...where my job was not fun anymore. It became less about helping the guests...and more about her wallet. I always put my guests first and foremost. Target is a good place retail wise to work, just make sure you meet your management, and like who you are working around. I did run into trouble with a few co-workers talking behind my back, and a few ETL's in the store talking about other target team members. Overall, I loved Target, and was thankful for the experience."
good,Wonderful place to work many great co workers . Very friendly place and nice customers . Not the best pay but a good place to work for if your in high school or love to shop at target !
good,Working for target you need to have a great attitude and be a peoples person minimum. I was in charge of keeping aisles and the floor tidy and clean . As well as as assist with guest questions and item help and informing them with deals and promos we have going on in the store.
good,"Great leadership, productive environment, helpful management, and all around great experience. I learned a lot in the little time I had with the company, and enjoyed every moment of me being there."
good,As a 16 year old I learned a lot about working and time management. I don't believe I would have made it as far as I have in the working world had this not been my first job. I just wish I could have climbed the ladder but no opportunities were evident.
good,"in a day, you must come in ready to go fast, you need to learn to help all the guests needs, and, ask management for help its what they are there for."
good,my employment with target was very short but i enjoyed it great management happy helpful staff and they were great to work for if i could have i would have kept this job too
good,"I learned a great deal about the merchandise. I enjoyed the customr service aspect of the job, there was something different going on everyday and lots of room for growth."
good,A typical day at Target was usually busy and fast-paced. Normally management was always running around but always somehow still made time to make sure the tram was doing okay. And the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help guests and keeping up with making the store look its best.
good,"good  working experience with the target over there good managers good staff great team "
good,Fun and can be very busy at time. You get 10% discount on everything you buy. target gives you the shirt and you have the pants and any kind of shoe to wear for work.
good,"Though I am a student, I was hoping to stay on after the season. I enjoyed working with Customers, helping them locate items and keeping the store clean."
good,It was an awesome opportunity to work here. I got to know many people and learn a lot of new things about retail company. I really liked the pay as well.
good,"I liked working at target i was a cashier but i had some hard times, i was working with my sister and we had different hours so it became very hard to go at different times but i'm currently looking for a job now so that i can work alone. So overall my target experience was good."
good,"Great place to work. Love the people I work with and my job. Cashiering and guest services you stay busy all day. Helps to pass the time. Learned team work skills, and how to run a cash register. Also some stocking."
good,I love working at Target. Everyone you work with is extremely nice and most of the customers you talk to are really nice. I don't get much hours anymore since the holidays. The interview was really easy and I was offered the job right after the interview. I have never had any problems with anyone. This is the best job I've ever had.
good,"Working at target was pretty laid-back and easy, however considering how well the company does I did not feel that the pay was reasonable (minimum wage)."
good,"Within a month I was promoted from season to permanent, I also got moved from logistics to planogram and I absolutely love it! Since, I'm spending so much time setting the shelves and pulling my own product I get to learn so much about what goes where in the store since i'm setting it myself. I made myself stand out by taking up others shifts and now i'm cross trained in 5 different areas around the store. I never find myself bored on work, and my coworkers are so friendly!"
good,"Working at Target was easy and was able to communicate and get to know new people. The work was very independent, but was also a team effort to get assignments done."
good,i had an awsome experience working at target the staff was super friendly very respect i walked in without any experience n the team was willing to help me after a week of training i was good to go
good,"Days are normally filled with deciding new set-ups and products that need to be organized.  Setting up sales plans.  Organizing, and storing all of the products that ere recevied every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (unless holiday season)."
good,"Really fun to work there. The downside was it was at 4 in the morning. But when I told them I was interested in cross training, they jumped to the idea and Did it."
good,It was a fun and challenging place of business to work for. The company promote within and I loved to get the company red cards on a daily base to get reward.
good,"relaxed job, everyone is very friendly. target is a very family oriented store. ive learned how to use a cashier, how to do discount and give out red cards"
good,My reason for leaving Target was due to education wise. I forced to leave by my mothers boyfriend. Because he basically wanted to make me do everything his way or else i get kicked out of the house.
good,Target was a great place to work and very fun. I enjoyed the customer interaction and being of assistance to the customers. It was very fast paced and kept me busy. Management was great as well!
good,"fast fun and friendly day. always getting support from team member"
good,"Probably my favorite job get discount day of hire, pay is great, place smells amazing, and feels like a vacation just working there, I'd recommend anyone to work there. Target is amazing."
good,"Great place to learn customer service"
good,"A good place to work it keeps you busy and there is a lot you need to get done. Especially during holiday time, spring season, and back to school season and also summer too."
good,"Target is a great company with a great culture, always changing and innovating.  Best part of the job is the people you work with and the training and development culture."
good,"Target is a fun place to work, I enjoyed my employnent there, but it was no room for advancement. "
good,A typical day would be restock sales floor and frontend. I learned time mangement. The workplace culture was team driven. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with items they needed and wanted.
good,Very great company really love what I do just really want to be more involved with another part of target but for people who want to work here the money is very good just show up to work.
good,"Overall great place to work! Everyone gets along and works together well. You can pick up as many hours as you want up to 40 sometimes OT . Holiday pay and some weekend compensation,"
good,Great workplace and you would learn a lot during your time here work on the daily goes as follows you go check in and do as much as you can to help the team succeed
good,I learned that  working hard to get you done that only faster but also on time and typically when we worked yeah we goofed off a little bit but we were always working when we were doing it and I guess the hardest part of the job was hard sometimes trying to find out where an item went because there was a miss print on the box so that was fun LOL
good,"This is a great company to work for, competitive pay, fun work environment, rewarding work. Recommended as a first job. Flexible scheduling and great leadership opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work starts at a slow pace but it can get very busy and hectic but I enjoy working with the guest. I would recommend anyone to work here, its a great place to work at.  The people are friendly and the hours are flexible."
good,The atmosphere was happy and fast paced. Work got done in a timely manner and well but there was no room for negative attitudes. Co-workers encouraged each other and helped each other out for the better outcomes of tasks.
good,Great place to work. All team members and all hire up are very positive. They are all about helping you advance your training and overall health. They are hard on you at times but only to better you because they know you can do completed tasks. Very friendly.
good,Target is an excellent place to work.  The work is very good for helping with teamwork and customer service skills.  Management is also very helpful with helping you get to where you want to.
good,a typical day at target begins with a warm greeting from just about all the employees. i would say that is the most enjoyable part about working there. management is very flexible with hours and they are very respectable and cool despite the fact that they are your boss. i learned a lot of good tips regarding teamwork and a sense of urgency.
good,"I come in promptly, and begin my day by pushing out a cart of merchandise."
good,"With this job I was able to gain more experience in Customer Service, I learned to work well with others. You work with a nice team to make sure the job gets done."
good,"I worked here seasonally through the holidays. It has been my favorite place to work. I did a great job here but they still didn't keep me because of red card sales. Which is believe is unfair because everytime you ask someone if they want one they say no and aren't interested to learn about it. So they tell you you're a cashier, but you also have to be a sales person as well. I wish I could've worked there on off season because I think I would love it."
good,"Everyone is like family, I loved coming to work everyday. Always had weekly events for staff. Manager was great, always opened to new ideas. Was able to work overtime whenever I needed too."
good,Communication amongst employees is so consistent that things always get done in a consistent and timely manner. I learned that jobs can work with you as long as you keep up communication. The workplace culture was very friendly and seemed more like family than co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be during the holidays when the stores are jammed packed with people but everything in general is mostly easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with many different kinds of personalities. They feed their employees with snacks and meals catered from a select few restaurants.
good,"Target is an awesome place to work , expecially if your in school. They do allow you to pick up extra shifts, if needed ( only if you are not going to be headed into overtime). The job also tries to work around your schedule Incase of family issues-ETC . They do also have counseling advisors that are there when you need them."
good,I worked at a Super Target for just under 2 years. Loved the store and my fellow employees. Lots of events and incentives to keep the moral going strong within the store. Was able to get a lot of experience in multiple areas within the store as well.
good,I started out as cart attendant and then with good time and patience they allowed me to multitask my jobs by giving me different position and my bosses were very impressed of my work ethics but still wanted me still as cart attendant which I was proud of.
good,"An intense, stay on your toes kind of job. I enjoy the challenge that is brought to me every day and I meet it with eagerness. I do the daily count in the morning after receiving and signing out equipment, then set up my work station to be ready for any guests with answers. I engage every guest with our promotions and see where I can help them save money by improving their services that they already have. I enjoyed helping people the most, from my team, to guests, to myself. I'm all about customer service and solving problems. I believe the only hard part about this job was really the lack of team members. Having to work excess hours has really gotten to me, especially having to run a store by myself when I was supposed to have a team of 5."
good,"Fun place to work.  Great for people needing some extra cash.  Not a place for those with expectations of full time employment.  No specific path to promotion.  Limited on positive or negative feedback. As hourly pay keeps rising, hours keep getting cut."
good,A very good place to work for overall. The hourly pay is very good and the scheduling is very flexible and the discount is very good as well. Management is very understanding of your needs as well.
good,"I must say that this was my first time getting a job via temp agency and they were great at getting me a job and proactive with following up to assure I get the job. I love the pay, hours, and weekly checks! Only flaw was that the staff on site had horrible communication between us, our temp agency and Target co in general."
good,the place has the best coordination of any of my jobs I have had in the past. the veteran associates were helpful when i was fairly new and the management didn't chew me out when i was still learning procedures.
good,I love everyone I work with and my job is very very flexible with me and honestly this is the best job I’ve had! This care about you at target!!!!!!!!!
good,My position as Facilities tech is a team lead position so it comes with great responsibility. It's also the only job that guarantees 40 hours and no weekends!
good,"Retail is demanding, Target, is one of the most demanding.  However, Target provides a team culture that is immeasurable and incapable of being replicated.  The training I was provided and then provided my employees was amazing.  The culture was fun but demanding."
good,A typical day at Target is fast paced and timed with just about everything. I learned the importance of inventory and customer service. The hardest part of the job sometimes came from making sure to complete all auto-fills in a timely fashion.
good,"The hours are very flexible, they always allow you to take in more shifts when you can. Fast paced job, cooperative co-workers and friendly staff willing to help."
good,Target is a great company to work for. The pay very well and offer great hours. The only reason I am leaving is because I am relocating to Texas and as why I am applying for jobs.
good,"I love working for this company but it's very difficult to move up from within. The leaders and team leads are kind and understanding. Always willing to lend a hand when needed. Over all a great place to work. Unfortunately, not if you wish to move up the chain."
good,I’m only hired as seasonal but it could possibly be permanent which I’m hoping for. I really enjoy working there. I like working graveyard shift. The only thing that I dislike is that I never get a full 8 hours. Also not a set schedule either. Other then that everything is great everyone is friendly they get us food a lot which is awesome. My bosses are amazing and work really hard.
good,It was a cool job it was seasonal I learned from working there the staff was great it taught me how to work cashier stock and un stock it was great work for the holidays
good,the Target i worked at has been a fun place to work where ive learned a lot and made good connections with my coworkers.  something that I love about target is the emphasis on the guest experience.  With a lot of businesses you would expect most discussion to be task focused and on financial well being of the company.  alternatively target has a lot of focus on how our guests are doing and what we can do to make Target a Great experience for them.
good,I learned to serve customers and collaborate with team members. I was given important responsibilities and learned what it meant to be part of a team that promotes a brand.
good,I enjoyed working with Target. It was overall fast-paced but I always had a ton of support. The people I worked with were great and I felt like I made a lot of friends there. Management is super understanding and is willing to work with you. I felt welcomed and appreciated.
good,"Target is a great place to work. Very team oriented, no one is left out on their own. Enthusiastic managers make this a great place. plenty of jobs around the store so you can move around and not get bored."
good,I got to learn how to deal with people patiently on a everyday basis. I learned to put things in order and help people finding what they need in short periods of time.
good,You have to know you job.. Everybody always want to be in competition with each other. It's a very fast pace and seems like everything is about getting numbers.
good,I absolutely loved working at target and working with the people there. My job was very easy and very much worth the pay. The only hard thing about it is trying to meet the stocking goals when you first start out but with time it gets easier.
good,"Busy, productive place to work.  Learned to work with people of multicultural backgrounds.  We had good managers at our Target."
good,It was a tough but fun job.  Everyone would say hi and the managers were excellent with accommodating your personal needs.  I would definitely recommend Target.
good,"A typical day at work would go by quickly. There was never really too much trouble given that I didn't work in a bad area, got along with all my coworkers as well."
good,"Average pace job place,  Employee's are great and helpful, Everyone was willing to help each other. Things got done with none hassles. I never had a problem with anyone and always enjoyed being there,"
good,Very fast paced but fun and challenging. Great manager to work with. Team work a must. Although there was a lot of hard work it was always fun to get done when you work with great team members
good,I love to work at target. If I didn't want to go back to school i'll still be there. I love the enviorment the and the workers. They will work around your schedule.
good,"I loved working there, it was a great environment and all the people there worked hard to work as a team and get what they needed to get done done. Everyone had a role and they all played it to the best of their  ability including myself."
good,"good fun place to work, no, clicks, was appreciated, for the most part. Managers were good understanding people. if we un loaded the truck at a good time we got free drinks, wish i could have transferred when i moved, couldn't cause no job available,"
good,While i worked at Target i loved it. There was always something to keep me busy but also was not yelled at or condoned for taking a couple mins to talk to co workers. I enjoyed working there and would love to go back!!
good,target is a great company to work for. I wish I didnt leave because now that I am going to school my degree could have gotten me a higher up job as a store team lead or something similar. With education you can move up the ranks.
good,"Target is an excellent company to work for. The culture is very upbeat and the management staff is always there to help you to succeed. While it is definitely fast paced at times, there is a sense of being on a team and working together to make it through a crazy day."
good,great company to work for got the exspirence and whirl with new people and new things the exspirence was good working tube sales floor was a good experience yup learn how to talk too guest our was just a good exspirence
good,"Target was an exciting time. Though Target now only offers part time and doesn't move the amount of merchandise they once did in the 80s, it was a fun place to work and I had a real fun time and loved my job."
good,"Zoning, straightening, sales floor assistance when needed on the sales floor, back and fort to front lane cashier for back-ups, friendly attitude face"
good,Fun and friendly workplace that included many team building activities. Loved the opportunities to volunteer with community geared events. Time always flew by quickly while you were work!
good,"Fun place to work, Lots of opportunities and positive management, Perfect workplace culture, Place to learn while working, Its completely open when it comes to creativity,"
good,"Okay job for college student and wanna get paid decent. Better than Walmart, Walgreens, cvs, any department stores pay. I really like working for Target. So far!! However the scheduling is different every week so you never know what to expect. I hate closing."
good,Everyone was really friendly the work environment was always positive & the customers were always pleased with the service they received during the visit
good,I learned how to be more fast pace when it comes to work and to keep my eyes opened to my surroundings. I became more alert with my surroundings thanks to Target. It really helped me to stay on my toes.
good,"I learned a lot from Target. my first day went fast if you didn't catch you eventually would.Team members bring you in like family.Everyone is smiling with a little pep in their step.My manager Sarah Wolff was an outstanding manager who was dedicated,loyal and mostly intelligent.An amazing person that thrived at everything she did and climbed and worked hard to dig that path for her and her family.Successful business woman that girl.But like i said helping others makes me thrive.Warms my heart knowing that I can be of service to the elderly.They have been here longer than us so we need to help them."
good,"You might be looking at that like wow almost all 5 stars. Yes x100."
good,"Since the time you punch in is busy classifying items and dealing with all the vendors that comes to bring the products to the store.do inventory on items that needs to be send out the store to backstock  while veryfying that the products that are avaliable for customers are in an A ok shape with the best quality .if product is not on an A ok quality it gets defected and send out of store whether is on crc ,salvage or donations.the store supports less afortunate people by donating its products to families that have the needs but not the money to buy it ..it works with different charities  donating food and day to day items on a daily basis.i get to work on defects,esims,donations,credits,receive vendors from many different companies,take deliveries from UPS,Fed ex ground and fed ex ,take care of backroom,inform when food is deliver ,communicate with team members of different station and let them know when items arrive at the store,work on bales,plastics,Mir, male sure that items are correct  and have the total amounts of products,review the prices and maych them to the product.work onnot on files and no dpci,recycle cardboards,while disposing on a eco-friendly procedure and following rules to each one of them.LOD make sure that you take your breaks on time and makes sure that you someone is there to releive you so you can have your breaks.so for me is a learning experience to work as a receiver and i enjoy it.thank you"
good,dEAL WITH customers that are rude and nice. Helping customers finding all the items they need. Need to know about their products you sell. Need memorize prices and isles that items belong in. Selling credit cards target
good,My experience with target was great. There was a lot of teamwork and camaraderie that made for a good work environment. the customers are always happy to come to the store so it makes for great customer service experience.
good,"It was a fun job to have, Id definitely work for the company again if that meant I could move up. Its a good place to work at, you gain a lot from it."
good,"Sometimes work could be stressful if we were short and trying to pick up work for other people. You do have to meet a quota. Some managers were really on your butt about it and others understood that some days it wasn't easy to get there. "
good,"Upon being hired it became very clear that it was going to be a very positive experience."
good,"This place is a really good starting job, or someone that needs a flexible schedule because of school or kids. The atmosphere is pretty awesome and everyone who works there is pretty cool for the most part, and it's not extremely difficult."
good,"working at target i made friends really fast, everyone around me was amazing. the hard part was dealing with customers with bad attitudes, that i could handle but i wish i didnt have to."
good,Great place to work. Fun environment. Very flexible with scheduling. Management is great. I enjoyed meeting and greeting quests. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole shift

We have a great culture, great development atmosphere and are focused on driving sales while offering great guest service. One of the hardest parts of the job is the schedule. Not the hours (50+ a week) but the nights, holidays and weekends. The most enjoyable part about the job is working as a team to obtain sales goals!"
good,Target is a great place to work. Always great peeks and usually some kind of snacks for the workers in the break room !!!  Management is fabulous and great company workers too !  Pay is average. I love to meet all new people every day I work. A very caring and respectable place to work.
good,"A typical day at Target starts with serving guest with a smile on my face and keeping guests happy as we get busy.  I would always try to let guests know about our Red Cards because we are the only store who had a Debit card and it saved you five percent every time you use it. Management is great at Target, they have always treated everyone as team memebers as long as everyone is doing their job. To me the hardest part of the job is when guests get upset about different price differences but usually it is easily fixed, Target is always following the rule customers are always right. I loved Target most for the guests I had many regulars, so many wonderful people would come purposely to my line after they got to know me and they said it was to see me smile. The diversity and culture there is great there is no such thing as prejudice and there are people of many race and different religion and different region."
good,Some days were slow the other days were super busy. Everyday I was learning something new. Everyone was during their job when they was told to do so. Working at Target we have a goal to reach at the end of day and at the end of week. We helping people save with the Target Red Card.

They are some of the kindest people on the planet, and I would love to work there again given the chance.

good,Enjoyed working here because I definitely enjoyed working with my hands I love working in packaging and receiving I also it allowed me to use the forklift and gain more skills
good,"Well I've been at target for about 2 years now.  When it comes to promotions honestly at my location, if you work hard and show interest it's as easy as 1,2,3. Its, definitely harder if you don't stay late, or you're not someone they can count on to come in on an off day or even if you do the minimum with the job you already have. They are very big on in store promotions which is nice so as long as you have a hand to lend then you'll be fine. The managers are fun, informative and a really good group. The pay is nice plus you get an annual raise BUT when sales are down it can be hard. I'm full time and ive been getting part time hours for months now which is a little stressful! My store loves to cross train which is a benefit especially if you want to pick up more hours and you're open to learning something new. Honestly this group of Managers and fellow employees are amazing and make up for the lack of hours."
good,"Everyone got along, management takes care of their employees, room to cross-train, lots of team work, opportunities to pick up more hours, always learning new things, etc."
good,"I loved the culture at Target and actually miss it sometimes.  I recommend this job for anyone who is still in college and wants to start off their career.  If you don't work hard and have a negative attitude, you will get fired.  If you go above and beyond and stay positive, you will get promoted.  I thought management was very fair and was given a promotion within 9 months, but I worked hard unloading trucks for flow team.  My unload team was the fastest in our district."
good,"Target allows anyone the ability to advance within the company. All you need is the right attitude, drive to do better and willingness to help out whenever you are needed."
good,The environment at target was always very inviting and and warm. everyone was like family and loving i can say your had to be a team player to work at target its all about team work and helping  each other reach their goals of the day.
good,The whole target team is one and they make sure that no man is left behind. Target works with your school scheduled but you do not get holidays off. On holidays they make sure that the time you spent working on those days are enjoyable. Target taught me people skills and how interact as a team!

good,"I liked it I just thought the pay could be better. I worked the fitting room, answered the phone and sore the clothes where they belonged. I just didn't like when you finished your area someone would come and mess it up as if you didn't make sure everything was neat and folded together"
good,"The people are friendly, work is fun."
good,"Target allows for you to train in all areas of the store, providing you with more opportunities to receive more hours. When working in different departments, it almost feels like a new job every time. It's a nice way to break things up."

good,This is a great place to work if you don't mind working retail. They pay really well for most of their jobs. The one major downside of working here is the inconsistent hours that are given. Sometimes you work nights and sometime you work mornings. Sometimes you get full time hours and sometimes you have to fight for 15 hours. Overall the managers and coworkers were amazing. I enjoyed my time working for Target.
good,"I love working at Target! Management is very understanding and will listen to any troubles. The tasks given to you are not strenuous and different everyday. Never a dull moment! The guests tend to be friendly. Coworkers easily become your best friends and make you want to come to work even on your day off just to hang. Again, I love Target and the people in it."

good,"This was a great place to work. I was a cashier, and I loved the work environment. The team leaders are so nice and I became very close with the people I worked with. And the company treated us well too. There was a break room with food available a few days a week. Schedule is flexible also, I worked approximately 30 hours while attending college. Pay is ok, I believe that the minimum cashier wage was raised but I could be wrong. The hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with the occasionally unreasonable customer, and there were times when the computers would glitch, but that all comes with any job. The best part was the sense of family and support among the team members and management. I would recommend this job for anyone, whether you want a part time job or a career there is opportunity for advancement and the hours are flexible!"
good,Fun people to work with. Everybody is willing to help you to get your job done. Feels like one big happy family. Nice company.
good,"The motto at my store was always fun, fast, and friendly service, and the majority of the management and staff seemed to follow suite. Despite having large tasks and very busy and stressful days, the management and team always seemed to keep things to a realistic level, understanding that everyone was working hard and continually trying to lift our spirits. It was a much different feeling than other retailers I've worked at, where the management would usually just callously list goals and be unhappy when/if those goals weren't met. People are more than just efficiency machines at Target, they're people again."
good,I learned a lot working at target. Its a very social environment so I was forced to engage with guests throughout the day. I believe this really improved my people skills as well as my productivity. Nothing to really complain about because the staff was great and everyone was treated fairly.

good,"I enjoyed my employment with Target Distribution Center. I gained a lot of knowledge when it came to teamwork, powered equipment, and especially shipping and receiving. The hardest part of the job would probably be the heat. The thing I enjoyed the most about working for target was that time seemed to move fast since there was always something to do that would keep your mind occupied."

good,"Enjoyed my time in target. Everyone was very kind & hard working."
good,"The hardlines team's objective for the day is to come onto the sales floor and head directly back to the back stock room.. The job description for this particular part of the Target team is to stock all the shelves full so that there is always product for the customers to buy. The stock room typically only pulls stock two times daily and we were responsible for getting it to the shelves in an organized fashion, while making sure the area we are personally assigned to is tidy and cleaned up for the customers  "
good,"A typical day at work includes communication through emails, meetings, and quick huddles. I must ensure all team members have the tools they need for success. I have learned how to strategically manage a store that has 40 million dollars in sales each year. Working for this company has taught me how to consistently drive sales based on consumer trends. The management in the company is very involved. They help in finding solutions to any issues that come up during daily store routines. My co-workers are all very friendly and feel almost like family. The hardest part of my job is managing talent. Many complex issues develop everyday involving multiple members of our 20-80 person teams. Solving these issues can sometimes prove very challenging. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my whole team is working as one cohesive unit. This means I have done my job correctly and the store will ultimately flourish."
good,"From the moment I started at Target, I knew it was going to be a career I would love to wake up and go to everyday. My co-workers had great attitudes and were excited to make a difference in their workplace, which made me that much more motivated! I worked in many different areas of the store but enjoyed being a GSA above all. The work level varied as the days went on but I never felt as though all the pressure was put on me, my co-workers and managers made sure to make you feel at ease. I made many life-long memories and friends at Target! The hardest part of the job for me was feeling as though there was always something else I could be doing, I felt like no matter how hard I worked I enjoyed my work so very much that I wanted to make even more of a difference then what I was. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have fun everyday at work, due to the different projects, questions, customers, work loads, etc. Such a great company to work for!"
good,Everybody would get a long at work. The environment was always a positive one and everyone seemed to like what they were doing. Management did a good job interacting with every employee and had fun activities.
good,"Starting out as an overnight stocker, I showed interest in the other positions and got promoted to logistics where we reset/changed around items in the store. I was then able to be scheduled to any position that was needed. The co-workers we all very friendly and helpful with anything. The hardest part would be lifting some heavy boxes, but most were marked with the team-lift sticker. The management would make us mini starbucks drinks. They also have a great HR which is very confidentiality with any problems."
good,"The first thing I did when I got to work was make sure the front end of the store looked presentable for our guests. I would cash the registers and sign off restroom sheets. Throughout my day, I would just make sure cashiers were doing their job and guests were happy. If cashiers needed money or had a question about the register, I would need to walk over and help them. The hardest part about my job was getting support from management on busy days. It was also learning how to multi task because there were many responsibilities. But I absolutely loved working with such a diverse team."
good,"This company is by far the greatest I have ever had the pleasure of working for. They're all inclusive when it comes to your lifestyle and personality. They don't judge on looks, religion, or anything from what I've seen. They back the LGBT community, they allow religious freedoms and style choices such as tattoos and piercings, and they will never judge based on your appearance. The attitude of the environment is a solid team, everyone helps out. I've seen managers and team leads down on the floor doing just as much work, if not more, than the sales associates and sales floor team members. This place is all about effort and doing a good job. The team members are always friendly to each other and to the guests. There are no employees, just team members, and there are no customers, only guests. One of the greatest things is that if you have a regular shift (8 hours) you get 2 on-the-clock 15 minute breaks, and a 30 minute clock-out lunch. So basically if I go in at 1 and leave at 9, I take a 15 at 3, lunch at 5, 15 at 7, then clock out at 9. A great system to get a breather in during a hard day especially."
good,"Honestly a great place to work, not the best pay to start off with depending where you begin, but the hours make up for that. fun eviorment, time flies by if you keep busy."
good,"Enjoyed every minute of it"
good,Its a fun job u can see evething when it's arrived nd put displayed. On Sunday we do ad signs what's on sales for the whole week. We do inventory on March. We count everything we have on sale floor nd for cashier it's easy to learn

Though some days were stressful with the pressure from management and team members, the good outweighed the bad.

good,"Rarely have any down time, but its a lot of fun busy work. Ive learned how to be adaptable and flexible not only with work situations but also with guests. The management is great about recognizing everyone's individual work ethic. Co-workers are very diverse and full of fun. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly guests. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to truly help someone find what they need or resolve their issue and they end up being really happy when they leave the store."
good,Everyday the entire team comes together to get everything done as fast as we can. Me along with my coworkers are recognized for our daily contributions during break.

good,"Target is a fast paced, fun place to work. I have gained a lot of retail experience in my time at Target. The work is hard some days easy on others. The people are great to work with and very helpful."
good,"7 days at work "
good,"A typical day at work includes regular cashiering duties: ringing up customers' purchases, answering questions about special offers, and  being as helpful and friendly as possible. Since I was first hired, I've learned about selling grocery store items, which I never did in previous jobs, and improved my 10-key speed. Management is usually very helpful, even working alongside the cashiers during busy times. They encourage us when we do well, and gently correct us when we don't. Most cashiers work alone on their checklanes, but we're also aware that we're an important part of the ""store team"". I've enjoyed the times when I've been able to get to know fellow team members. The most difficult part of the job is the monotony of doing the same thing for hours on end, but also paying close attention to detail and customers' preferences with each sale. The most enjoyable part of my job is organizing the merchandise on my checklane, organizing merchandise in other parts of the store, which I'm allowed to do occasionally, overseeing the self-checkout registers on occasion, and training new cashiers."
good,"A typical day at work is calm and productive when everyone works as a team."
good,learned something new everyday with help from my co-workers. plenty of duties while on the job that kept you busy and working fast paced. management was tough but helped when you need them. overall the experience working here was amazing and i would definitely work here again also recommend others to work here.

good,Unloading packages onto pallets learning to stack to maximum capacity while still achieving safety. Outgoing and helpful co-workers with a love for the job. Getting of early was a good benefit of this job.

good,"It was a wonderful place to work, easy, quick paced, you could get promoted very quickly if you have a good attitude and work hard. I miss this job. Every night we would start off with a ""huddle"" each of our managers would come to the back room where all the overnight flow would be starting to unload the trucks and they would tell us about the night were about to have how many people working, how many trucks, what time they want to be out of here, and every night it would be told in English and then in Spanish. Each night while unloading trucks they would give us each a cold (sometimes icy) bottle of water or mini Gateraid. If we went fast enough and finished unloading the trucks before what the managers ask, we would be given a free snack bag of chips and a Gateraid. If the crew finished and got out of the store before they wanted, they would buy lunch from nearby restaurants for the entire crew. One time we were told we did so well we could buy one item under 3$ and we would get it for free. (even if it was a gallon of milk under 3$ "
good,"Amazing place to work, miss it everyday. Learned so many valuable skills that I will take with me to my next job/ career. Everyone I worked with was so invaluable. Getting new products in was the most exciting part of my day there and meeting new people"
good,Worked very happily for years until new Supervisor came into play.  Supervisor wanted own handpicked crew - most were relatives of that supervisor.
good,"Your average big box retail job. But the management does what it can to find you hours and show you new things. Volunteer opportunities, just pay is a little on the low side."
good,I took pleasure in serving the guest of Target Store. Managers were a delight and so were my fellow employees. I appreciate the opportunity offered to be an employees there.

good,"Despite only working 2 jobs, Target was by far the best job I ever had. Everyone cared about everyone. If you needed help with ANYTHING, someone was always there to help you, even if they didn't work in your department.

good,As a seasonal sales associate I was able to learn a lot in a limited amount of time.  The entire staff was very supportive and always willing to help guests as well as co-workers.  Management was very respectful of requested time off as well as gave very good constructive criticisim.
good,"Great customers, co-workers, Supervisory, and Owners. The vibe and culture of my job is always welcoming. A typical day at work is providing friendly service  to every customer. Learned to have patience with rude customers, and handling pressure. My co-workers are friendly people. Hardest part of my job is multitasking with tons of customers and running around the floor for assistance. The most enjoyable part of my job is being active."
good,in a typical day we would ship merchandise to 56 store. We also will receive merchandise from the benders witch we will have to receive and sort it out to get distributed to different part of the warehouse. in a day you could learn a lot do to the fact that there is different department and they would train you in it in case they would need help you will be able to flex. the job in out bound was the most hard part of the warehouse do to the fact that they load trucks by hand. The best part of the job are the hours and the shift case they where very flexible with the employees.

good,"Working at any of my retail jobs gave me a great experience. None of those jobs were boring. I would look forward to go to work. I have learned to deal with different types of customers and how to handle their situations. My co-workers were like myself, funny, energetic, and optimistic. The hardest part about any of my jobs is not getting  the task done. The most enjoyable part of working is the feeling of accomplishments I have made before going to work and having customers or guests leave with a smile on their face.

good,"I loved working at Target, everyone was very nice. The hours were the only down fall, its retail so you could work Monday and be off Tuesday and come back Wednesday through Friday and work Sunday. Unloading the freight from the trucks early in the mornings and stocking it in the back. Physically demanding, having to lift up to 50 pounds but I enjoyed that part."
good,"I loved (most of) my managers, my coworkers, everything about the job! didn't keep me past the 90 day period but i guess it just wasn't meant to be"

good,"Target had amazing team culture. I loved the people that I worked with everyone was extremely supportive and kind. I learned managerial styles and other retail systems in place that I have developed and maintained this knowledge. The early hours such as getting up at 5AM for certain shifts was the only downside to this job. I loved meeting new people and being on my feet. Some of my responsibilities included: managing staff, catering to guests, and deploying and keeping track of inventory through out the store."
good,Target is a very fast paced and exciting place to work. The people I have met throughout my time at Target have all been amazing and motivating. A typical day at work is very active--I am walking throughout the store leading the teams and making sure that the operations of the store are running to their most efficient and effective capacity. The hardest part of my job is the day-to-day tasks that only make a low level impact. I also don't fully enjoy working every other weekend. The most enjoyable part of my job is the that it is active and the people I work with are phenomenal.

I used the AD set to scan items, handle inventory of DVD/Blu Ray, CD music, video games, and electronic products.  I also unpacked products and put them on the shelves.  I was a cashier and always provided excellent assistance with guest shoppers and helped them find the products what they wanted.

Know going in if you are a cashier you will have to get customers to apply for the Red Card. Some stores drive it more than others."
good,"All I can say about this company is that everything was just wonderful. I would definitely work for this company in a heartbeat. No questions asked. I was only a seasonal position so I did end up being let go, but no complaints here. We got employee discounts on everything in the store, and we had a Starbucks."
good,Target is a great place to  just not a very fun work environment. I didn't really feel appreciated while i was there either.
good,Target was the very first job i have ever had. Target through multiple experiences has set the foundations to become the out going an professional sales man i can possibly be. The average day at work is very busy as soon as the doors open customers poor in with questions on the best deal or information on the latest products or sales.Our managers never ceased to amaze me with there energetic attitude an there ability to always provide an entertaining environment for us the employees to work in. Me an all my co workers mingled great in entertaining ourselves an having our (customers) guest join in on the fun in order to get them comfortable in our work space environment. The hardest part was learning the ropes with it being my first job but i manage to overcome this adversity. in all the job was amazing an the experience i gain took me a long way.
good,"At Target Canada ""Speed is Life"" was the motto and each hour brought different challenges to negotiate. Each employee had the opportunity to become a complete retailer."
good,"Target has one of the best managers that I have ever worked with."
good,Target/ Starbucks is a Joy to work for. My store has great employees and management. Everyday we had our regular customers who are very friendly. My management team worked along with staff which made the job a learning experience.The one downfall is not enough hours and difficult scheduling.
good,"I absolutely loved Target! It was the best retail store I ever worked at. The managers were very flexible and understanding, also encouraging and helpful. I learned how to truly be a team member."
good,"Each department is a Team, and the success of each team depends on the whole team working together in sync.  There is no room for weak workers.  It is fast pace, guest oriented, and every day can be a good or bad day depending on your attitude.  I think we have great benefits compared to other places that I have worked.  If you are a social person--like talking to people (whether guests or fellow team members) then this is definitely the place for you.  "
good,Working at Target as a Guest Services Trainer has taught me valuable lessons and has given me amazing experiences with Guests that will benefit me in the long run. It has made me a better person today.
good,Training was very detailed and simple. Any questions during or after training were answered. Co workers were very friendly and eager to help new team members
good,"Very friendly people to work with.  always smiles every where you turn."
good,"Ensure the store and property meets guests aestic and cleanliness expectations.  Ensure the reliability and function of all systems in the store including; Apple devices, plumbing, communications, lighting, safety, displays, HVAC, refrigeration, and  powered equipment.  Complete these things in a financially responsible fashion by managing owed talents and vendor management."
good,I cant say many bad things about target. They started me off at a pretty decent salary. They treat you very well. They are very politicly correct though. Every ones pretty strict.
good,"I started as an intern and worked my way up to a store manager position. I love leading teams and developing people. I work 60 hours a week and work weekends, so would love to find a job to balance work/life."
good,"Target had everything a person in retail could ask for in a job.  Friendly staff and management.  Benefits are the best in retail.  Medical, dental, and vision.  401K is the best!"
good,Target is a very good company to work for and with. They really do care for their employees. I would go back to this company if they would offer me another job position.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. My typical day at Target is a very busy day. I deal with all kinds of vendors. I put up sales plans and delegate instructions to the employees. Back stocking, stocking the floor, shipping and receiving trucks that come 6 days a week.  I was a Sales floor associate as well a cashier when needed. Also, I did the produce, meat and deli dept. when needed as well. The hardest part of the job is trying to finish 40+ sales plans by the end of the week. It does get done but it can be stressful but i loved what i did at the store."
good,It's was unfortunate to see it closed. Target was one of the best places to work for in retail. Very positive and uplifting. The management was excellent. Always looked forward going to work. Co-workers worked well together always willing to help each other. The job wasn't hard at all cause the work environment was always pleasant.
good,"Target Canada had a great management team which had a great open door policy for the team members. It was all about team work, fast, fun and friendly was the main focus of us all."
good,"Target was very joy able to work for, the break room always had something to eat and co workers were very friendly. management made it very easy to talk to and always worked with your schedule. my work at target included stocking shelves, keeping lanes neat and becoming a back up cashier occasionally."
good,"I worked for Target for a very brief period as a Floater pharmacist. An advancing and difficult pregnancy forced me to stop working. The job required flexiility and adaptability as I was constantly moving from one store to another. However, the excellent organization of Target pharmacies and resultant continuity meant that I never felt out of my depth at any store. I was very impressed with the competence and ability of technicians also to adapt to a different practitioner and enjoyed my work thoroughly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the efficiency and continuity of the pharmacies. The most difficult part was a lengthy commute at some points."
good,A typical day would be checking emails and seeing what the Teamlead had outlined for you to do that day. Then get started on the projects that needed to be done. I learned to relax and take each day as it was whether it was busy or not .Management  was awesome at Target they were there working beside you . Co-workers were always there to help. There were no really hardest part of this job. It was an awesome place to work they had good team culture. Guest service was always first and formost  which I think is important because without the customer you have no job.
good,"Being a Target Team Member means being part of a family. I haven't worked there for a few years, but I still keep in touch with my previous supervisors/coworkers. Everyone is very nice and encouraging. The marketing/sales floor merchandising work is extremely hands-on and requires time-management skills to complete successfully, but this is definitely the most enjoyable part of the job. The toughest portion is being able to handle stress during extremely busy holiday shopping times and managing angry guests, however, I always viewed these as learning/growing opportunities."
good,"I truly enjoyed myself at this job. It is without a doubt my favorite job to date."
good,"Exciting to learn different area's of the business, great co-workers and the management staff is top notch. I am always busy, however all team members jump in to help one another."

good,"Ótima empresa de se trabalhar, na verdade uma escola onde aprendemos e aplicamos os nossos conhecimentos em prática, empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar."
good,I like all the duties I perform.  They are very flexible with schedules.  Clean and bright work environment.  I work with very helpful people and feel very comfortable asking for help if I don't understand something.  Management is very complimentary.
good,a typical day at work requires an assembly line team that we together to unload the trucks we have come inn every night an distribute the product through the store. I learn that team work play a big roll an a company that size everyone doesn't work at the same pace but it always get done. our leads was great to go to they were easy to talk to at all times. My co-workers we all made one another feel like family an made wok enjoyable. The hardest part of the job will be when your supervisor pressure cause he or she is under pressure or mad so they take it out on you. The most enjoyable part of the day will be the fact that we got it done no matter how complicated the task where.
good,Everyone was so nice to work with and everyone was so supportive. The management was amazing and was always there for you if you had any issues you needed help with.
good,"I had the good fortune of having a relaxed boss who was able to work with me which did me a huge service later on. I learned a lot managing a group of 30+ people, how to quickly identify strengths and weaknesses, communication, disciplinary skills, leadership effectiveness. "
good,"On a typical work night, one team would unload the trucks and assort the deliveries to their proper designated sections and take them to that particular section and would repeat this process until all the trucks were unloaded and delivered items were dispersed.

I get a lot of job satisfaction from a job well done.  "

They were the type to get down and wok with you, or fill in a position, not just tell you what to do.  Target was great!"
good,"Every day at Target you are reminded how important and rewarding it is to be part of a team. One of the key features that makes Target's culture so unique is the daily ""huddles"" that are basically team meetings for the sales floor staff every day. In those huddles we began with recognition, which is a chance for anyone to recognize another team member for something they did. At our store there was never any lack of recognition, everyone there loved to tell other team members about how someone else had either helped them or gone above and beyond for a guest. After recognition the team leaders went over any specific goals for that day, or any important information we needed to know for upcoming events. The hardest but most rewarding part of the job was balancing guest interaction with specific tasks I was assigned. Of course it was of the utmost importance to make sure our guests found everything they needed but it was also a focus of ours to make sure the guests felt welcome. At the same time we had tasks on the sales floor we needed to complete, and sometimes those two goals were contradictory. However, it was extremely rewarding to make a genuine difference in someone's day by helping them find that perfect gift for a loved one (for example) while also completing a difficult task I had been assigned."
good,"-Typical Day At Work Is Enjoyable Especially If you Like Dealing With Customers"
good,I love that team work and team building are so important to this company. This type of ideal in a workplace makes the job less work and more rewarding for the employees. At times working with upset customers is quite challenging and discouraging but you can always count on a fellow team member to help you out.
good,"A typical day at Target as a sales floor team member includes answering questions from guests, making sure guests are taken care of and finding what they are shopping for.  Another major part of being a sales floor team member is bringing out products from the back room out to the sales floor so the shelves are fully stocked and guests are finding the products they need."
good,"Target's way of operating is one of the most unique job's i have worked for yet. They are all about helping customers, who we call guests. When cashiering, i make sure each and every guest is acknowledged, ask them how their day is going, and ensure that they leave with a smile on their face. Seeing a happy guest is one of the best parts about my job because i know ill see them again. Among my coworkers and I, we all have to work together to meet our daily sales. Through communication, collaboration, and team work, we can achieve it with ease. The managers or LODs (Leaders On Duty) help maintain the success of Target going. Target has been a great learning experience and helped me get out of my comfort zone and make an effort to converse with each and every guest."
good,"Target is  a great place to work, with plenty of opportunities to advance. You get noticed for the work you put in, and it is like working with one big family. The hardest part would probably be starting out, but once you learn it s a breeze."
good,The store managers are very positive and the other team members there are very helpful.
good,A typical day at this job is you would either start your night by unloading the nightly truck or you would start pulling inventory from the back room to be put on the shelves that night. After the truck is done then the floor team would start stocking shelves from the items from the truck and the pulls.  The backroom team would finish the pulls then move on to putting the excess inventory from the truck to locations in the back room. The backroom team sometimes comes out to work the floor. This is what the process is for almost every night.  The managers and supervisors are fantastic.  They are all knowledgeable and helpful.  The team members are all friendly and helpful.  If you have a question or need help with something they are there to help.
good,"Working at Target was a very fun experience. Usually I would be left in charge of managing the front end. Making sure that the guest left the store happy. All of my coworkers loved working with me because I made the day go by fast. Fast, Fun, and Friendly is the motto and I made sure I went the extra mile to ensure it was just that everyday, The hardest part would have been dealing with the most difficult guest that didn't have a very pleasant experience. I would make sure my team would go above and beyond to correct any wrong. Management definitely backed me up with that and made sure every customer was happy."

The hardest part is having to tell a customer that you don't have something either in stock or you don't sell it. The disappointment on their faces is what I dislike the most.

Ensuing all health and safety regulations were being followed.  Delegating cleaning task to team members so product was constantly rotated and shortages were kept to a minimum. Providing positive feedback to team members.  Writing performance reviews and delivering them."

good,Long hours of administrative work as well as training and developing new in role team members
good,I enjoyed my time at target. Wouldn't mind working there again some day.
good,A typical day at work involves walking into friendly faces that seem more like family.  I've worked at two different locations and have seen this culture at both consistently.  You are updated on the stores goals and opportunities and given a boost for the day.  What I've learned while working here is how to create business relationships and drive good business.  The management is great. Everything and everyone is set up for growth. Everyone progresses and is challenged. My coworkers are amazing and great team players.  The hardest part of the job would most likely be labor. Considering it is retail it takes work to stay in stock and cater to every guest that enters the store.  Yet it is still the most enjoyable part of the job because it gives everyone the opportunity to work together and build trust.  You can see the results of your hard work when you make sales and receive good pay from it!  I will always recommend Target to anyone.
good,"Very nice co-workers, very nice customers and a great place to shop."
good,I was I was working for was the checking price and then I was on the sale floor and clothes area and then move to cashier
good,"A typical day at Target food distribution is around 8 hours on average, however it is a ""work till the work is done"" job so it can be 6 hours to 14 hours depending on the variables. Management is Decent and seem to care about the individual employee more so than most companies."
good,"Courteously greet customers and efficiently process transactions within busy, fast-paced retail environments. Operate cash register, scanners and computers to itemize and total customer purchases; collect payments and make change for cash transactions; and balance drawer at the end of each shift.

My co workers were a pleasure to be around and everyone was always so lively. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the satisfaction of helping a customer have a successful shopping trip.
good,"Target was a great place to work with friendly co-workers and very helpful management. As a hardlines team member I worked on the sales floor to assist customers with their purchases. This required teamwork in many circumstances with my co-workers, which taught me just how important working together as a team can be."

I achieved new knowledge in which I can apply to my work and in any other future careers, such as communication, reading planograms, and of course to work safe in a fast fun and friendly environment. The most enjoyable part of the job, is that I get to work with a team that consists of team leaders, team members and store manager, who put all their effort in doing their part of the job, yet they go out of their way to provide excellent communication, teamwork, and always answer any lingering questions to help get tasks done."
good,Targets works well with those who look for part-time or full-time work in all aspects of the store.
good,"I loved working in Target. Everyone was amazing to work with. I was a Fitting Room and Soft lines team member. Everyday for me would be pushing freight and new shipment of clothes to the floor. once finished, I would organize and usher guests to the fitting rooms. Target thought be to be a team player and have a fun time working. My co-workers and team leaders were always helpful and treated me well. Hardest part of the job was at the beginning before the store even opened for business. It was tough but well worth it."
good,I like flexible my schedule work at early morning for 4- 5 hrs.  I feel like quick work. I push to unloading for stock. I keep to clean for the receiving area. I enjoy to meet who work with member team.
good,"working at target is super fun! however if you work at a low volume store but your store gets busy there wont be ""enough"" coverage so you'll have to work double time and for the amount of pay you get it may not be worth it unless you are a team leader. if you are working cashier or somewhere other than on the sales floor then youll be oka"
good,"I love Target, not as a place to shop but as a place to work. They're love for thier guest is superb. I dont believe there's another department that reaches thier standards"
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy as a gsa. I learned strong communication skills from the position. Management was a little shy on direction, however once they give you a clear objective the work is at your own time and pace but it better be a fast pace. The hardest part of the job was juggling all the tasks at one time but it is doable. Most enjoyable part was the whole staff, the friendly customers, the kind of duties I was responsible for."

good,"Target strives to be the best company ever. This is apparent in the benefits provided, the team development, and the diverse culture that Target promotes. Target seeks to provide quality products and excellent service. I've learned to collaborate with a highly effective team and ultimately how to reach goals in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is learning to leverage your resources when seeking to achieve a goal. Working with Target is not about how much you can achieve, but how much your team can achieve. Therefore, working for Target may not be the best fit for highly independent or entrepreneurial people."

good,"My job at target was to pick the product that needed to be out on the sales floor before customers arrived. Occasionally I would help unload arriving trucks. "
good,"Typically the area you are assigned to work in each day is usually the area you spend the whole day in, however, depending on the amount of customers in the store you could be recruited to help in other areas. Most jobs were relatively easy, yet fast paced. Depending on your work area, a high degree of time management skills are necessary to complete all tasks before the store closes. Most difficult part of the job was difficult customers, and not being able to gain experience in other work areas. The corporation always works very well with schedules, and is a great job for teens. Overall, I enjoyed my time working with Target and would highly recommend it to any job seekers."

good,"Stock product"
good,"I was normally on the closing shift at Target, therefore I would get there around 4 or 5 in the afternoon and stay until after 1030. I would just straighten up my area of the building, and return items to their proper location. Pulling items forward, folding clothes or putting stuff away was a normal day. I liked the job because no one really bothered you and you just did your duties and went home. I learned how to fold T-shirts and how numbers work to identify items. The job was typically pretty easy unless you had to do end caps, which werent that hard but tedious. My co-workers and management were very helpful and friendly."
good,Target has been a great place to work fro the 4 years I have been employed by them. I enjoy my position and the team I work with. One of the most important aspects about my job I love the most is my work life balance. I work on a rotating weekend schedule so this gives me time to spend with my daughter and maintain a life outside of work.

good,The focus on development and innovation makes Target an excellent place to work.  I am surrounded by incredibly talented coworkers and leaders.
good,"If you like people and making things happen Target is great. Target is all about making the team happy and driving a great relationship with the customer through the team. Target has a very high focus on the mesuring what we do every day. The goal set by the company is only the begining, goals are increased and reset weekly by leadership and is always just out of reach by the majority of employees"
good,"A typical day at work consists of throwing truck and getting all of the boxes onto the floor. Then empty the boxes and put that merchandise on the shelves. Then once the store opens, we as a team continue to put stuff on the shelf, but also provide guest service and ask our guests if they need help finding anything. I learned how to work well and communicate great with my team members when it comes to guest service, perhaps if I do not know where a certain product is. Our management/supervisors are always around to help with that and make sure our team stays focused on meeting our goal times. The hardest part of my job I cannot think of one thing that stands out, and the most enjoyable part of my job is the sense of accomplishment I am giving Target, and talking to guests and making them feel as if they can ask anything at anytime!"

My coworkers are great and we work as a team helping each other out day to day.
good," Target, my first job after high school which left a lasting impression on me in which I will never forget. I still remember to this day that interview I had when I got the job; it was with the Store Manager at the time. I remember her asking me about my hobbies, and at the time I was big into computers with my friends, gaming, and I've been an avid electronic guy for a long time. I was applying to the sales floor position at the time, but the Store Manager put me in electronics where I didn't move for almost the next 5 years. At the time there were 2 electronic specialists that worked there (position doesn't exist anymore), but their job was focused around everything electronics and it was my job to assist customers in the department. What this job really taught me about was customer service, and over time I really started to enjoy it. I would seek out customers to interact with them, talk, help in any way I could, because to be quite honest I enjoyed it. A typical day at work would usually involve this, answering tech questions on televisions, cameras, and helping out in movies and even books. At night we would do most of the clean-up, putting away what we called 'abandons', just misplaced items and to tidy up the store. Usually not my favorite thing, but it did teach every employee about where things went, and after even a few months you knew where almost everything was in the store. "
good,"Target is a hard company to leave, they have great managers and personnel, if you want the work they can certainly provide it, they bent over backwards to work with my school schedule."

good,Very lively busy fast paced store. Local customers love the assosciates and the management team. Very welcoming.
good,"This was my first retail job. Very exciting and fast pace job. I enjoyed this job very much. Management was the best I ever experienced. I worked the shoe department and jewelry, but my favorite position was back up cashier. I worked the Christmas season, I was suppose to be just for the season. They liked the way I worked that they kept me. It was a real pleasure working for Target."
good,My experienced with Target has been good. My team is excellent. I was given full freedom to shape my position to better serve my pyramid.

good,"A typircla day at work I would go to my supervisor and ask what lane I needed to get on. I would go to my lane make sure i had enough bags and change turn on my light and start checking out customers. I learned that each day you might get 1 or 2 not so nice customers but ultimale the rest of the customers were great so l learned not to focus on the not so nice customers. The mangagement was great they were all on the same page, the stood behind you when a customer may complain about you. I met some really nice co-workers and there were a few that did not want to be bothered with anyone but most of my co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of my job was seeing someone securtiy had to take to the back room for stealing. My most enjolyable part of my job was meeting new people."

good,"I learned a lot working at target, from working on the cash register and computers, to associating with the guests and customers. The other employees were a pleasure and very welcoming. The hardest part of the job was making a mistake at the registers and having to quickly adjust it to avoid any problems. I enjoyed coming into work and being around friendly people."
good,The best part of working with Target is Target Culture. It makes sure all the Team Member's beliefs are valued and respected. This indeed helps TMs to perform better too.
good,"I would still be working for Target now if it had not been due to personal problems, if I could get rehired full time( full, part time) I would never leave them, Target is an awesome Corporation to work for in my humble opinion."
good,Started with Target before this location opened and it's a great place to work. The managers are team players and always pitch in to help with everything which makes our jobs easier. I like the work flow of the pharmacy much better at Target than other pharmacies.
good,"I was in charge of changing the price of the items, count pieces, keep track of the clearance, print labels, use the computer, change ailes design, work in teams and meet expected time frames. I learned many things from my co-workers such as laber reading, placement and keep track of different tasks. The hadest part was leaving such a wonderful team but knowing that I learned so much was my satisfation afterall."
good,A typical day with Target Darts starts off with checking my email and browsing over if there are any response from our contact from yesterday. Afterwards I work on my to-do list and go on from there. Management is great they treat their employees well and they make you feel that they are approachable. My co-workers are great as well fun and a lot of interactions. The hardest part of my job was designing Spot UV packaging because I have no experience with it but it didn't took me a long time to understand it because I was taught by the best in the business. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie.
good,Office has no recreation room for employees. At some point employees are not treated with good value.

If there was somthing that I didn't understandthan they were there to help. The management were also great in helping out the team on the floor as well. They didn't just sit back in an office and bark orders. They were part of the team.
good,Dont know if they are still in bussiness. Advanced fast up to supervisor. If you work hard they will train you for advancement
good,"At work, we would have a moment in the beginning, middle and end of the day to recognize someone in our team huddles. It was used to encourage and lift others up with a round of applause and a compliments. I learned quickly how to ring people up and to even find short cuts with our machines. It made things easier on us an the customers who were in a hurry. The hardest part with the job was the walkie talkies were carrying around.

The most enjoyable part of my day is the people.
good,Cash office in learning organization skills. Great management who communicates well with the team.
good,"Target pushes for a fast, fun, and friendly environment and that's what you get if you work for them. Instead of calling shoppers customers, they call them guests, as they are guests to the store and welcome to shop there. It's a great place to work!"
good,"Keeping a positive attitude, providing excellent customer service to encourage guest to come back."

good,"A typical day at work was behind the Guest Service desk or a register helping guests with their purchaseor and/or returns. I was cross-trained in multiple departments so when a Team Leader needed me I was able to hop off a register and be active on the sales floor. I learned more customer service skills such as answering phones and dealing with guest complaints. I also learned more about planograms and how they vary from company to company. Management was awesome. Target really had a way to make you feel like part of the team right from the start. They also had a great work bench where they advanced you as much as they could in as little time as possible. My co-workers were just awesome. I could not have asked for better ones. They made me laugh and helped me when I needed it. I would say the hardest part of the job was leaving. I moved to NC with my husband for military reasons and it was hard to leave such wonderful people. I had put in transfers and began working at Target down south but it was just not the same and I left the company shortly after. MY favorite part of the job was going into work knowing that I was going to learn something new. One day it was the pharmacy, the next it was Guest Service. I learned how to make planogram signs and change shelf prices. I learned how to use a Symbol more in depth and find products in the backroom. I also learned how to use a walkie with no fear of sounding ridiculous on it. I definitely had an awesome work experience at Target."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me being there at seven to divide and stock the candies for the front lanes. Assisting the GSTL or GSA with thier daily set ups. Giving additional help to other cashiers and guest service team members, relieveing for breaks and lunches.The managers there were very helpful and understood we were more then just employees.They treated everyone with respect. The hardest part of the job was when we would stay late to fix store, but the most enjoyable part was the themed lunches they threw every month."
good,Just overall great place to work provided me opportunities to make changes whenever needed.
good,"Typical day at work would be organizing ,zoning and preparing to greet guests with a positive friendly smile, ready to assist if assistance is required. I have learned along the way management skills as well as social skills. Management kept team members in a positive frame of mind and all workers are always team players ready to help each other if assistance is required, My hardest part of the job was saying good-bye, after 13 years of service. What i enjoyed out of this job was, learning team work and social skills as well as all those other skills learned with in those years of experience"
good,"Started while in school, then was offered a better paying part-time job. Was not employed there very long."
good,"A typical day at work consist of pulling the store back together after it has been shopped, restocking the shelves, and whole lot of customer service."
good,"A typical day at Target as a Flow Team Member consists of unloading a truck with our goods on it and moving them to the floor. The team generally consists of about thirty people to help one another accomplish the tasks. Working together as a team is extremely important and is shown by each individual. The management is honest, direct and respectful. The most difficult thing about this job is obtaining more hours. For when everyone wants more hours, less actually get more hours. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is the ease of work. It can be challenging, depending on which part of the store, but for the most part it is a good paying job for what work is done."
good,I would have to say this is one of the greatest places I worked at. Amazing co-workers and customers. Always something to do in the work place. Favorite thing I enjoyed was working electronics. Always someone to speak to and sale something too.
good,i did not work here that long because my husband had to relocate because of the military but it was a good place. we worked hard but had fun too. my team was very nice and we worked together this is a good place to work
good,"Target is a great company to work for, and has a lot to offer to its employees."
good,Very fast pace work envirement. High level of training and developement opportunity. Fun place to work with a diverse group of people.
good,"Fantastic management, always holding events, contests, or having special food in the break room ""just because"". Cashiering at Target is consistently fast-paced, which makes time fly, and the team leads are always available to answer questions. They push you to be at your best without being too rough or mean. I have a great time interacting with the customers and there's a great atmosphere and friendliness between coworkers."
good,I enjoyed working at Target because it was a fun and happy environment. I learned how to work well with others. Management was the best they worked with me on everything. My Co-workers were great I still keep in touch with some of them!
good,I had to be at work before the sun rose in the morning at 2 am. That was by far the hardest part of my job other then that was pretty straight forward. I would get to work and unload the freight truck and head to my section and stock it. When I completed my section help other complete theirs and help clean up afterwards.
good,Part time job for 6 hours daily I worked there .I learned from my job coach lady teaching me what to do during training time before hired me . Co -- worker and I were gone together daily to do our work areas in her departments and I worked alone in any department until I worked with her .I work so hard to keep up a job straight in the shelves . I enjoyed my job very much .
good,Typical day included showing up early in order to unpack the freight trucks waiting for us. Working with others to stock shelves and assisting customers as needed. Coworkers were all a joy to work with and focused on team work. The most enjoyable part of the job was just the relatively stress free environment created by management that gives everyone a fair chance to shine.
good,Able to work when I want it's a real easy and fun job it's my own company and I love to organize things for people
good,"Very organized, great management staff and good benefits."

good,Working with trains and on trains was an awesome experinace. I liked my co-workers becasue they were very helpful.
good,The main thing is keeping the food hot and bring out the food when it run low
good,"Working overnights at Target was a blast. This is the only job I regret leaving. From Management to co-workers, everyone made it feel like a family. Management listen to all complaints and suggestions and would act on them immediately. One example is that our supervisor saw that we were looking bored and tired halfway through our shift and requested a radio in the back room. The next night there was one on each side of the backroom area and we were allowed to bring our mp3 players and mobile phones to listen to music if we didn't like what was on the radio. Everyone worked together and worked hard, the only time supervisors and manages would not be nice and friendly would be when you are not working. Supervisors also work hard to reward excellent work and acknowledge good work. I would work here a million times over."
good,"I love working for Target! This region has issues with availability for advancement, but in general Target Corporation has a great vision for its company. Pay is competitive and environment is fast, fun, and friendly. Management is what you expect in retail, but overall very proficient in their responsibilities."
good,"I've been working at Target since I graduated high school and it is an awesome place to work. This is a great first job or in between job for someone still looking for something else. I have worked many different shifts and have been cross trained. The management for the most part is awesome, inspirational, and encouraging. The toughest part is learning how to handle guest situations when the guest is upset."
good,hard worrk and great customer service skills got you very fair with both companies
good,Target is a great place to be a part of. The benefits and opportunities are endless. The management as well as the team leads treat all employees with the upmost respect and kindness. The entire corporation has an open door policy so therefore if one has and issue or a question they need solved they have a higher chance their voice will be heard.
good,"To long ago to remember, I learned about merchandising, there's was nothing hard about the job if you give it your all."
good,"Responsible for managing my retail sales team to maintain the sales floor for optimum customer service, responsible for working with upper management updating sales demographics, and responsible for ordering to maintain retail sales area. Furthermore, I was responsible for interviewing, training, evaluations, and dismissing employees."

M y co-worker nice to work with.the hardest part of the job at holliday season, the store was very packt and had to be very carefull, the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaccion of doing things right for the company and giving people a valuable leccion for their lifes."
good,"A typical day at Target was clock in, check schedule, and head to do cashiering or restaurant."

good,Teaches new employees and first time employees how to perform correct work habits and are very paient in doing so.
good,Target was the best first job. I started working there in high school and it was a great experience and opportunity.
good,"Would start at 430am after that we would clock in at 5 and go straight to the back to unload the trailers. During that time we kept each other up and motivated while moving at a constant fast, but smooth past. Next we got started on stocking first groceries. Next would be the outdoor and home department and then we would take our first morning break at 8 am. the hardest part for me was not to get hooked in the entertainment area like a child ,but my coworkers kept me busy with questions tips and concerns like a family would that’s why there considered a target family. Management was awesome with this being my first job out of fast food; they brought me up to speed in no time. My most enjoyed part of the day would have to be leaving because I knew I would be back tomorrow."
good,"Great place to work, great environment. A lot of work to do that is not in your job description."

Target is involved in several local charities whether it be fund raising or volunteering, they are always willing to give back to the community that supports them. Everyone for the most part seems to enjoy their job."
good,"I enjoyed working for Target because it was almost as if we were family. No one person was better than the next even if you were a Frontlines Manager. I worked for this company as a cashier and sometimes would be required to run the Customer Service desk. I learned a lot about Customer appreciation and communication. Working as a Cashier has helped me with my People skills and was the most enjoyable part because I left the last empression on a guest and majority of the time, made a friend. :)"

Anytime I had a question or needed help with something of my own or a customer's, the managers were more than happy to help and never once made a fuss about it."

good,Target Corp was a great place to work. Everyone was happy to be there and they treated everyone like family. You also are recognised as an individual and not as a group which its really nice.

good,"I am lucky to work with the team that I have- one that is driven by guest satisfaction and the desire to achieve sales goals. The management team is flexible with each of our team members and their needs, working to create a workplace environment free of negativity and brimming with productivity. There is little room for career advancement beyond being trained in multiple areas of the store, but the opportunities are there if you are willing to put in the effort and months of training before consideration. The pay is great for a part-time retail job. Working on the Style sales floor is unlike any other retail job I've worked before. Target is dedicated to their brand and their image and holds its team members to that standard."

good,I loved everyone I worked with! They were all so helpful and very informative when I had questions about the job! They also give you an employee discount which is great if you are a big Target shopper like I am. I would definitely re-apply for another seasonal job here!
good,"Good place to work! "
good,Target is a great place to work. Great people and employees to go along with the job. Managers are friendly and love to take time to make sure you understand your job duties.
good,I loved my time at Target.  If you have to work retail this is the company you will love.  Very efficient and they love their guests. The management really takes time to train their staff.  There is a sense of ownership in the department that employees work in.

good,I loved working for Target. I love how they showed appreciation to employees as well as what the company stands for in their views with equality and diversity.
good,"I had fun while employed as seasonal help. The managers and coworkers were all friendly, informative and optimistic. It got stressful tho when mutiple customers ask where things are, that i had no idea where, answering calls n knowing where to transfer it to or if more in stock but would recommend."
good,working with the people was a great experience. Pulling stock out of spider infested shelves was not so safe. got to work with different people of different culture.
good,I loved working at target because of everybody who worked there. Every one was on point with their work and even when it was bad days everyone stuck together. Target was really a great job
good,"Greet customers at the entrance, place product protection device on high theft items, receipt check on exposed items, prevent money loss for the company"
good,"Didn't have any issues, fast paced style of work. Fast paced during the holidays and the weekends, only had a problem with one manager my entire time there."
good,"I knew that this job would be difficult because of all the lifting and running around I have to do, which does leave me tired but nonetheless I still like it because it keeps me on my feet."
good,It was a good job I didn’t work there long cause it was kinda boring nothing to do and it wasn’t a fun place to work and the job wasn’t easy your had to know what your doing

good,Target was one of my favorite jobs. Everyone was nice and understanding and management was awesome. They will always make sure everyone is okay and gets done as a team.
good,"Every day was a good day, even the bad ones. Sometimes the job itself or the customers would be stressful, but the team was amazing. I had pride to work here. There were always games and prizes given to employees to push sales! Everyone on the team was like family and with that in mind, they worked with everyone to provide a good work environment. Team leads understood family values and were fantastic when I had to leave to have my son. If family issues hadn't prevented me from doing so, I would probably still be at the company. A girl I trained is already in management, which shows you cand definitely grow if willing to work."
good,"At Target you would greet the guest with a ""hello"" or a simple,""How are you today?"" Letting the guest know that their opinion matters and that we will provide exceptional customer service. I learned how to multitask and to be more open towards people in general, due to me being not as social in high school. The management is exceptional and they work with you, if you have any upcoming events/ holidays or religious days, so you can enjoy your time at the store and that you feel treated well. The hardest part of the job is the different areas in target that you have to memorize in order to help the guest achieve exceptional service. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different interactions with the guests that approached the hacking out stations. Knowing and learning everyones way of shopping helps us know how to ultimately help you the next time you visit the store, for an even better experience."

good,Target has been one of the greatest jobs I’ve had. I’ve been a part of targets team for about two years now. Since the day i started it has been my best decision.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The only thing I see as a downside is that it takes a long time to get certain benefits or getting full-time. I don't regret working here. I would recommend this job.
good,I started working at Target not too long ago and I quite enjoy it. The managers at my store are very communicative and help make your day go by smoothly. They're not the stereotypical managers that breathe down your neck and will get very upset at a small mistake you make. They are understanding and only want the best for you and the company.

good,"A day at Target is very relaxed. I've learned how to ship and pack with accurate information. The supervisors and co-workers all seem to enjoy their job as you can sense a welcomed feeling at Target. The culture of Target is to make the customer their first priority as customer needs are always fulfilled. The hardest part of the job is trying to locate a specific item in the backroom that isn't listed on Target's Website. However, we contact other store locations in order to make sure the customer gets what they are searching for."

good,I love working for Target. It is a very good job and cares about your needs. I love working with friendly people who I could consider my friends.

good,I had no issues with any of my co-workers. The office staff is very helpful and the operation managers would get out there on the floor with you to help if needed. They were not afraid to get dirty and was always willing to take suggestions for improvement throughout the company.
good,I made a very poor decision that I will always regret and had to leave.  Target is a very wonderful place to work.  I greatly enjoyed the people I worked with.

good,"Worked all of my shift doing ship to store orders. Pulled order, pack order, shipped orders. This was something new to me and the training could have been handled better. All team members were very helpful when I would run into a problem.  Management were very new to their positions and didn’t have a good knowledge of things in running the store."
good,"I had a wonderful time working there, even though it was short lived. Many employees worked there and I did not get a lot of shifts. When i did work it was very busy since it was holiday time. But the staff was great and helpful. They were kind and answered all of my questions, and kept my training easy to learn. The hardest part of the job is always going to be working in such a big and busy store, especially since it was my first job. It was very important that i learned how working in costumer service was and how hard you need to work to get all the work done right. Id say my favorite part was working the register and talking with kind people around the holidays, making people laugh and people able to help anyone find something they needed."

good,"Target is a wonderful place to work for. I have worked for target for 5 years. flexible hours, worked well with college/school hours. cut hours made me lose benefits"
good,"Very proffesional. Selling redcards was a little annoying but the customers were nice and the managers were awesome, super proffesional. I was a cashier and it was so easy. At my store in Watauga Texas, the managers were so helpful and the horus were really good during the holidays. At my store there were only part time shifts for cashiers but you could get up to 30 hours in two weeks during slow periouds."
good,Target was my all time favorite employer. They work with people on their availability and tried to offer more hours when allotted. I learned many different ares and used lots of electronics to perform my tasks

Eligibility is based on average hours worked, length of employment service and position. Great work life, great pay and atmosphere. Consistent volume so you never get bored. As well as amazing benefits as far as health insurance and over time depending on availability. Working with this company was very easy. Everything was fast to learn. A typical day would always be fast paced and packed but went smoothly and well organized. Co-workers were always on point with their task and friendly. The hardest part of the job was goin on break on time because of the volume of customers but the most enjoyable part was having a smooth day surrounded by a good environment."
good,I loved working there it was great the only reason I had to leave was I was going through a separation and had to move temporarily. The management treated me amazing and everyone was very helpful. I loved working at target! It was a fantastic experience!

good,"I believe Target really sees their motto through even with employees. They want their shopper to feel at home, to be excited to go in, to be helpful, to know any employee goes above and beyond for you, a real sense of community and I always loved target but never really understood why until I worked there. It’s like the Disneyland of retail."
good,Target is a great place to work. I need another job because I'm a mother of 4 and the cost of living for us 5 is higher than they pay. But they start you off at 12 and it plenty of room for growth. And the managers are friendly. Don't get me wrong they do their jobs as far as management and enforcing company policies.lovw the job.

good,I was a stocker on flow and market team for about 2 and a half years. The hours are nice and flexible and you can choose to work overtime but never forced. Full time is really only given to TLs and a few team members otherwise it’s 4 to 6 hrs 5 days a week. It sometimes doesn’t feel like work because your chatting and having fun with your co workers. Plus break time adds up to 1hr 15mins and the two 15 min breaks are paid!
good,"Cashier was fun but many hours no sitting at all. People were very nice, I like to interact  with people, it was fun. But sometimes you need a chair to sit and rest for a bit."
good,My favorite part of the job was the positive working environment that Target demonstrated. Each coworker you come into contact with is extremely friendly and is willing to help another person out when they need. I love that there's a constant reminder that each member of the store is a part of a whole team. So it makes everyone want to rally together to get tasks done.
good,"My overall experience at target was very eduacational Because it helped me with my social skills. Such as meeting and greeting others, helping others find objects, and communicating with others. Bought a stylish I’m sure I do this online resume st because it helped me with my social skills.

good,"As a student, I've had to adjust my schedule several times throughout the years. I've never been made to feel as if I had to choose between my job or school. The support I've received is like family. I graduate soon and it's hard to think of leaving for fear of not finding another workplace like this."
good,"Target is a fun, fast paced work environment. Management is very encouraging, helpful, and caring. The hardest part of the job is being in bad weather when the store is short on carts."

good,I enjoyed my time working at Target. I never had any complaints because they made it well aware for me to know all rules and regulations. Managers are always present and willing to help along with all co workers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, it was probably my favorite job ever my position was in softlines, we would do most of the ground work for the entire store. This includes answering phones, assisting guests, pushing truck, backstocking, selling products, launching brands, etc. I learned a lot while working here, mainly how to launch new products and keep inventory. Management was pretty laid back except for the LOD's, they always seemed upset about something. I made a ton of friends working there and the workplace was always laid back and chill. The hardest part is dealing with rude guests. Best part was making new friends and being alone most of the day."
good,It is VERY physical do not go if you are lazy. They give constructive criticism so take it and move along always get better At what you do always bring food
good,I didn't plan on leaving target but my schedule kept  changing without my permission. the employees and customers were amazing and i would like to go back sometime.
good,All the employees were very kind and respectful. I never had a problem switching shifts or needing anyone to take it. They always accepted any time-off requests
good,I enjoyed working at a fast pace because it helps me stay motivated and time is being utilized efficiently.  I contribute to team work by assisting conveyor lines by box cutting and sending them to different stations.
good,"I have been with target warehouse for 19yrs.  I have been a trainer, i've traveled for target, and lead teams on day to day duties.  With or ship from our regional dc to the customer , we send product directly to the customer . My family and i are relocating to Conway South Carolina in june 2019.  I am looking forward to the oppurtunity to working in an office environment."
good,"Great work environment. Well rounded staff overall, as well as the supervisors. Excellent pay rate. Quick and fast paced job, I would definitely recommend this job to a friend."
good,"I worked at Target for 7 years got promoted 3 times. Target was an absolute great company for me. I learned way more at Target than I did in College. Lol. The hardest part of my job was (bad employees). They brought down team morale and made a good day difficult. But besides that, I’ll recommend Target to anyone to learn how to be business owner and an effective leader."
good,"I was able to promote quickly with Target; they offer amazing advancement opportunity.  within the first 9 months, I was able to promote from a guest service counter person to a Supervisor over the front end operations.  This was brought on by a Management staff that was observant and believed in promoting from within"
good,Wokring at Target was good. The mangers always asked us as employees how can they make our jobs easier and fun. so we would make up a game for example: Whoever gets the most red cards within 2 hours gets a free starbucks. So it made things fun and enjoyable.
good,"Always on time never late punch in and out have great customer service skills what you doing"
good,great managers and team leaders great working place for new working teens  u get two breaks a 15min and your lunch.which i recomend to all companys .the hard part when store is close u have to put all the items that in  the carts back on the shelves so u might bethere for an extra 1hr to put things back up
good,"I would recommend anyone to work at Target. The management team is great and incredibly understanding. If you do your job well and maintain good attendance, you'll be quick to advance. It's a great community and culture to be a part of, and I never expected to like it this much."
good,Fun and professional place to work in. The upper management is awesome and professional. The team members make it fun and easy to work with. There is always volunteer opportunities available.
good,"Working at Target is exactly what you would think that it is like working at Target. Unloading freight was fast-paced. Pushing product to the floor was fast-paced. Working the floor during business hours required focus to completely your job with the periodic question from a customer. There was not micro-managing. You were expected to do you job. My job was good because I worked both warehouse and store floor, so I got the best of both worlds."
good,"I left due to not getting the position I was hired for. A typical work day consisted of me returning items for guests, listening to guest complaints or complements. I learned a lot from Target. The hardest part of the job was dealing with Bounty people. The most enjoyable part of my job was although there was a uniform code they were still flexible with it. Also you can be you, meaning you can let the tattoos show as well as your piercings. I recommend this employment to anyone!"
good,Target is a great place to work. They offer amazing flexibility and they also want to work with you. It's really easy to move around within Target too.
good,"As a Hardlines Team member, for a average day of work. Pushing out merchandise was a daily task, the priority two line which it was called. Was the primary task for push. Team Leaders would gather all Hardline employees to assign each individual a department to which I was responsible to perform reshop and zoning. target language for putting back out customers merchandise that they did not want after all at the end of their visit. To zone is to have the shelves and merchandise look presentable within the department you were assigned."
good,"Target is a great company to thrive a successful career in retail. Whatever direction you choose within retail, leadership is supportive with letting you design your career path."
good,"I enjoyed working at Targets, everyone was great. The Store was clean and management was will to help if needed. Friendly CoWorkers and the starting pay was within reason for a part timer."
good,"Start the day by clocking in and seeing who the Team Leader is for the day/night, and then start doing your assigned job (can be seen from your work schedule online). "
good,It's a great job for teenagers to have as their first job or a second job. Very organized and worked with great people. Guests were often very nice and understanding.
good,"Worked two positions, some days cashier and some days worked carts. Clean bathrooms and work in the back of the store. work on returns and shipments. You can hop from position."
good,A new work enviroment. They teach you a lot about everything to do in the store. Great Management. I wish to stay working in there but i had to relocate.
good,My coworkers were all so nice and all about teamwork! As long as you pull your weight and and have the right attitude you’ll be fine. It can be a little rough being on your feet and walking around so much but you get used to it after a while.
good,"Amazing job experience."
good,"I'd show up, grab one of the devices I needed for work and start working. My job for some of it would be mostly inside the backroom. So I'd go back there see how well everything was going, create a plan for myself and some of the newer people that go there and go on with my day"
good,"Loved the culture there it was amazing"
good,"When Target offered a pharmacy, the culture and focus was all about team and patient care. There were numerous Target developmental meetings and forms to complete that sometimes seemed very unrelated to the practice of pharmacy."
good,"Target is A Friendly Environment to work with.  Non-judgmental, safe , and considerate team. Target Is Awesome . TARGET TARGET TARGET TARGET TARGET TARGET TARGET TARGET TARGET"
good,I loved this job so much. It was the best job I ever had. I had awesome work experience with Target. If I can work for them again I would indeed. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with awesome people.
good,"Days go by super fast, but is a bit more physical than you’d expect, especially if you’re a guy. There’s always a huge workload, at least that’s what makes the day go by fast. The hugest drag for me was receiving the food truck everyday, the backroom looks like the apocalypse 95% of the time and it can be very difficult to move huge temperature sensitive food pallets around in super tight spaces. Most days after receiving the truck it’s mostly a chill day, but you still gotta time manage well so you can get as much done as possible. Also you’re better off getting a morning shift because the workload is lighter and a little less is expected of you. The later shift people have to clean up all the stuff left unfinished by the morning shift people. So if anything’s undone, they will sometimes understand it was a lot, but other times will whine about it. Overall it’s a good job but you’ll definitely have lots of work to do all the time. If you like staying super busy it’s a good job but can be very stressful sometimes."
good,I love working for target this month alone i lost so many people i missed work i called in and explaind what was going on and they worked with me all the way they are very nice people and wanna see everyone succeed. They will let me know if i did something wrong and explain how yo do it better.
good,"Target was one of my best jobs. Excellent place to interact with friendly people and expand your growth. Clean, and friendly coworkers and bosses. Majority of shoppers were very polite."
good,This was a seasonal position. It was a competitive work place because you were expected to get customers to sign up for red cards. If you had the most per a certain time period you were rewarded. I enjoyed the interaction with the customers and the all around experience.
good,"Great for a first job or job experience in general. Target provides a friendly work environment. Plenty of opportunity to move up or around in position, if you choose to do so. Managers are great, but also understand that work is a priority. Most enjoyable part has to be the satisfaction of helping a guest with any concern or question they may have."
good,I wish every other retail will have work standard and the friendly neat clean store like Target and make sure everyone work as team to get thing done in timely manner
good,"My experience at Target has been an overall incredible experience. I reccomend anyone looking for decent pay, safe enviornment, and opportunity to apply."
good,Target is a great job to have friendly but also competitive great atmosphere i enjoyed coming to work everyday and staying late when i needed enjoyed helping people and getting the job done
good,"Target is a very good place to work and offer very flexible hours to work with your availability. They have a great, laid back staff who are always willing to help you if you don't understand something. All in all I believe that Target is an excellent work place and I would recommend it to anyone looking for work in my area"
good,"It was a great experience working here is very paced, friendly co-workers, but it was somewhat difficult having different supervisors"
good,They are a great company they take care of their employees and their community. They have many incentives for the employees they make work fun and reward you for your hard work. They do allot of awesome things for young children in struggling homes all the way to days for the elderly.
good,"Its a pretty nice place to work. Management provides lots of encouragement, but since there are a lot of employees (close to 300) it is difficult for management to be completely aware of anyone slacking and often promote people not based on merit, but on personality, even if that means they'll be on their phone 60% of their shift."
good,"Target was a friendly environment place to work."
good,"Very fast paced, hours go by fast and it's a bit stressful but nothing that's impossible to deal with. Management is great, very professional and comprehensive. I love the Culturism there. The hardest part of the job there is getting everything done before closing as there are customers walking in 3 minutes prior to closing and last minute re-shop that needs to be sorted before closing the store to ensure everything is completed at the end of the day as per store requirements."
good,Working for Target as my first job gave me a taste of retail and dealing with people in the outside world who aren’t classmates. It was a wonderful experience all the team members were friendly to me even though I would make the first move to befriend them. Leadership was usually excellent for me. Others may disagree.
good,"My typical day at work included stocking shelves and backstocking extra products, zoning my area, maintaining a clean and organized department, as well as helping customers with their needs. I learned a lot about working in a retail environment. Management was extremely helpful in teaching me necessary skills to learn and improve my job skills. Workplace was extremely friendly and inviting."
good,"I got to help customers find what they were looking for when they were shopping. I waited on customers when they came in to the café to eat. I always stayed busy with customers or cleaning. I learned a lot about café work, cashiering."
good,"I was a flow team member for almost 2 years. I loved it! The day started at 4am and I was off by 1pm. Pretty sweet hours.  I was able to request time off, request a certain schedule.  The company had a great work life balance.  The pay was minimal but the job was not stressful and extremely fun."
good,Target is a great place to work. They will allow you to train & develop and advanced your career. Everyone on the team is so friendly and very team oriented. I am so proud to be apart and work for an amazing company.
good,"Working in the HR department, there is always something new and challenging.  Love the structure of there being a system in place for consistency.  Manager are great at communication and making sure that you are supported in all decisions."
good,Target was a good company to work with. The pay should definitely be increased for the workers because it is not a easy job to do. I would suggest a higher pay for the employees.
good,"Working at Target is a great place to be, they work well with school schedules, managers are understanding and easy to talk too. The way how Target operates is amazing and work is very relaxed."
good,Has changed a lot for the better since when I first started working. Work/life balance is great. Pay is also very good for the area live in. Opportunites to learn new skills are always available.
good,Target is a fun fast pace place to work. Good with scheduling around other priorities. Fast and Friendly. Management is nice and understanding when things come up.
good,"Honestly, this was my favorite job that I have had to this day. Great team, made sure I was well trained. Management had great problem solving and overall just a great company to work for even in the rush of the b]holiday season."
good,Amazing staff and coworkers made my work experience better. Even when I attended school they worked around my schedule. Also worked around my basketball schedule it was amazing.
good,"This place was by far my best job. The managers were always fair to me and were the coolest. Obviously, this doesn't mean that they are naive and will let you get away with things. But if you're lucky enough to work here you'll enjoy yourself"
good,"I loved it "
good,Completely enjoyed working for Target. I only exited the company to attend to family member.  Great growth opportunities.  Excellent at training employees.  Company does their best to help you succeed.
good,Very flexible schedule that is perfect for a student trying to make some income on their off time. I have enjoyed being able to work for this company and request any needed time off.
good,An incredible first job! The community was great. The items were nice. Discounts were amazing. Appreciation was given. Hard work was recognized. Feedback was helpful and nice.
good,"Everyone is amazing super friendly. the job was easy, the location is perfect the store was nice and well organized. you would see the same guest come back daily because they loved it so much."
good,"Great job, and keeps you busy at all times. if you need money and hours working at target is the job for you. great working environment, fun to be around"
good,"Honestly, I loved my time at target and am incredibly sad I had to leave. I have worked a lot of retail with some managers that were not great and some toxic environments. Target is not one of these places. The people you work with are the absolute highlight of the job, I met some of my best friends there. The management is awesome, and the company actually cares about their employees (in the retail industry that's pretty rare from my experience) Pay is pretty good. The job is not always easy. There is a lot of lifting and organizing quickly and even running from place to place but I like a quick paced workplace and think it adds to the environment. Overall, Target was a wonderful place to work and I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,Nice place to work very fast paced you will shed a couple of pounds 12 hours are a little hard to do on your feet entire shift with only two breaks 1/2 an hour and one 20 minute break
good,"On a typical day, we spend 100% of the time interacting with guests and creating a great shopping experience for them while connecting with them. I learned a lot about guest service and how to deal with angry guests. Overall, Target is a great place to work and really learn how a business is run and maintained."
good,"Working at Target is highly encouraging, energetic, and team oriented. Their training and development are superior to other companies and they truly make you feel valued as a professional. Target is very guest-driven and process oriented which allows for driving sales and a constantly changing retail environment. Working at Target will assist you in your professional development and growth. There are multiple growth opportunities throughout the company."
good,I LOVE WORKING HERE! Leadership is on point with helping others. Your voice is always heard and something is done about it. Target values you as an important part of the team and you are never left out.
good,I really like working for this company I hated when my location closed other locations was kind of far for me to travel but over all great company to work for all. All 5 ⭐️ 👍
good,"Working there is very organized. But it is also timed and not everyone works at the same pace. We have fun days, they feed you during the holidays and special events/"
good,"I enjoyed making everybody smile, and I miss working there. The management at target are the best they helped me become a better person, and they gave the best 4.5 years of my life."
good,"I worked at a very busy Target over the holidays but it was to be expected and we were prepared for it to be packed. I've learned many things as a cashier like cash handling, keeping my area clean, communicating with others and trying to help customers out to my extent. My favorite thing was working in apparel, I cleaned, organized, and put everything back on the racks while helping customers find what they needed. Overall, it was a super easy job and there was nothing hard about it."
good,"Target is the best example of Fast, Fun and Friendly atmosphere. They believe on high energy making sure customer are highly satisfied with their service."

good,"Target was a great place to work, I enjoyed the work and my coworkers were so fun to work with. It did get very competitive, but it only helped me to work even more."
good,"A typical day at target is like a run on your off day, you just run until you know that, that run is accomplished before you get back to your starting point. What I've learn at target is that we all come together to achieve one main goal and if that goal doesn't get accomplished, then we would be all off track. The managers there are very helpful when it comes down to being stuck on a task that takes two people to finish. The hardest part about working there is when someone calls off and we have to cover that persons shift but the most enjoyable part of the job is when we get through the day with no problems!"
good,I really enjoyed working with target. They will work with you schedule and work with your school schedule as well. They also provide store discounts and other personal benefits.
good,"I applied to target after taking a year off after finishing high school. I lived with my parents and was able to relax and earn spending money for myself, with which i built my first custom PC, and kicked off my experience at university."
good,This place was a breath of fresh air after all the corrupt management I've worked under. Great family environment and loved the discounts for employees.
good,everyone is nice and friendly the work place is nice as well its just that they just give few hours and i need more that is why i leave my job in their
good,Great place to start but unless management is what you are interested in i would not recommend staying for the rest of your life although there dollar for dollar match of 401k up to 6% is amazing
good,It all up to you On how far yo are going to go with the company. Once your in it’s a easy company you just have to do everything by the book just to make sure you come out on top. Some of the manager stuck but they are pretttybcool

good,"Very much enjoyed working here as an intern, very transparent in terms of personal advancement, human resources department is excellent, constantly motivated, open door work atmosphere"

good,"When I worked at target, my managers were so understanding and were always there when I needed something. No drama, everyone was friendly with each other. Never let there differences get in there way."
good,Target is a great place to work. As soon as you walk in there is a positive vibe. The guests are great and the bosses are great also. They make sure they are always encouraging their employees to succeed.
good,"Target provided myself with knowledge and an experience I never expected to gain. I gained multiple co workers that I will cherish forever. I also gained education on leadership, and diversity. Target is very complex and offers a numerous amount of benefits. Target allows me to work and still receive my college education. Target also offers counseling services, scholarship services, discounts for places all over the world, time off and more. One of the best jobs I've ever had."
good,"After a year, I was kind of over the retail environment. The team kept me coming back though. All of my managers were great to work with, and my other co-workers made it interesting enough. I couldn't get better flexibility, and they worked with every family emergency."
good,I managed a small team and we would work price changes and clearance on a daily bases. My team would handle rearranging clearance end caps as well as make new ones. I would look forward going to work with a team that worked as one.
good,With a great team lead and a good work drive you can advance your career at target. There is always a friendly manager or team member ready to assist you with any questions you may have.
good,Working at target is a great job to be in  Whether your in school or at another Job they well welcome you in no matter what. They assist you of needed help on language or dont know where to look for.
good,I like working at target because it a fun job and interesting to learn new stuff everyday the employees at target are really cool people and they really nice to me and them manager are very nice
good,"A typical day at work place is very rewarding ."
good,"-you get a raise every year"
good,Good working culture with fun fellow employees. Yet challenging in the field of assets protection. It quenched my thirst for doing something semi exciting without being too much in harms way.
good,"Everyone I've met at Target has had great personalities and its a great starter place to work. No discrimination, definitely an equal opportunity employer. Gotta love Target."
good,My experience was good overall. I spent 10 years in different manager roles and each help me to become a better leader. I love learning so much about myself while working there.
good,"cok eglenceli, is ortama ve kulturu cok iyi. isin zor yanlari pek yok."

good,"This is a very relaxed place to work."
good,"Very professional and nice environment to work at , nice manager team and coworkers .i really love everything about target , their clothes are very comfortable"
good,"I folded clothes, I helped customers, and organized shelves. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and deal with customers on Black Friday. I learned how to improve my face to face  interaction with customers."
good,I never worked anywhere else where the management was so understanding of their employees and and that they have lives outside of work. You can work as a team and pick up hours easily. You can cross-train in other areas. You will be recognized for doing well. You can get benefits I just chose not to utilize them. Pay was very nice.
good,"I loved going to work everyday. I was always busy and my fellow coworkers were awesome. I also loved the customers, which were mostly mothers and families. I connected aloy with them, being a mother myself."
good,"I enjoyed working with all my co workers, everyone was really helpful when it came to tough situations. All co workers and helpful and understanding. The guests are always very polite and would brighten up my work mood."
good,"Target has taught me so much about how to be a great leader.  It asks a lot ion its team members and its leaders, but it gives you all the tools you need to be successful.  You have to be self motivated and very driven to be successful at Target. Retail is very tough, and changes constantly.  We work on the whim of the masses, and that mean having to adapt quickly in order to stay competitive.  This is a difficult message to get to teams, and is what makes retail not for everyone.  You will get paid at Target if you find success, and you will meet some pretty incredible people that are doing things for the right reasons.  Ethical, moral, inclusive, and truly about our guests and teams makes Target a great place to work."
good,I have learned a lot from Target. They have taught me how to work as a team instead of an individual. When unloading the truck we have to come together to sort out the product and stock the floor in a safe and timely order.
good,"Over my 11 years at Target, I can say it was never the same thing twice.  This company is not afraid to change course, admit faults, and course correct to keep moving forward.  The work is exciting, and fast paced.  Colleagues help each other for the most part, and work is rewarded in many different ways."
good,"I would come in to work punch in at 4:00am Get with my team and divide the workload of ads, revisions and displays. We got 4 hrs of a customer free store. Go to lunch at 8am. Finish what little work I had left to do clean up and be out and finished with my shift by 12pm still getting to enjoy the rest of the day."
good,"For me I would be going around the entire store covering positions that needed to be covered. There was always something to do for me so I was always busy. Everyone who I worked with was so great to be around, they made you feel extremely comfortable to work there. Management was great as well, I have only minor grievances with a couple of the managers there; nothing of note. Workplace culture was kind of laid back, there were jobs that had to get done and sometimes I had a lot on my plate (I would be working in 3 different departments working on multiple things at once) and wouldn't be able to get everything done once in a blue moon. The hardest thing to do was balance all of the work that I would have to do in any given day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people there. Everyone who I spoke to was so nice and genuine and those people made my worst days better. I learned so much while I was there, I would say that, that was my first real job and learning how to take on the responsibility of so many jobs at once and learning how I react to that pressure was the best thing I learned there."
good,Family oriented place to work it was fun and I would recommend anyone to work at Target it’s a great experience and very fun I also learned a lot too.
good,I personally loved the work place because everyone was happy and nice and beyond helpful. The most important thing you get out of working for target is learning how to be a team player and working fast and efficient with others.
good,A typical day at work for me was to come and clock in . Then ask a manager where i should be for the day . After that i would either be helping a co-worker or just cleaning up the area that i was designated to and helping customers with what ever they needed. I would describe the work culture at Target very as diverse.  The Job was not hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a back-up cashier.
good,I loved the environment in the store how everyone got along and how work was a fun place. Everybody was very respectful too. I really did enjoy working there.
good,"Everyone is so caring, and teamwork is big for them. I️ was a cashier, training was easy and fast. The day goes by fast working as a cashier d as long as you  engage  with the customers"
good,Friendly work environment. Fast paced and experience engaging with hundreds of customers on a daily basis. Benefit is 10% Discount on purchases made in store.
good,"I loved working here, I liked talking to the people that I worked with and meeting customers that always came back. I would go back if I had the opportunity. The only reason I left was that when I worked in target cafe there was a rat and they did nothing about it."
good,It's a very good experience and I hope you enjoy it sorry is the best job you can ever have. And also the management and pay is really good. Can you get good skills and experience from this job.
good,I liked working there because you were always busy through out your shift. My day went by quick. It was fun everyone that I worked with were team players. If you didn’t know something they would teach you.

good,"I enjoyed working with the team I worked with. We were well staffed and it was great to know the store could trust you in what you said. When I got to work I walked the front end, I made a break schedule for the day"
good,lots of room to grow. supervisors are supportive and encourage personal growth. there are opportunities to learn different responsibilities that lead to moving up in the company.
good,"stock and manage displays "
good,I only worked for about a month. It was a seasonal job position. I actually had to relocate. It was upsetting after I knew I was gonna get hired permanently. Everyone in that store was just perfect.
good,Working at target wasn’t bad  for me it was just the fact that I stayed to far from where I worked and it was overnight. It was my first time doing overnight so I wasn’t to familiar with it but the time I did spend there wasn’t all bad.
good,Target is an excellent employer. They have a progressive company culture and truly care about their employees. They pay more fairly than any other comparable company.
good,"Target really takes care of their employees. They are very organized and have goo team spirit. Management is fair. The benefits are great, but the pay was very low...might have increased by now"
good,The time I spent at Target was great. I miss all the coworkers and management. It's a great company to work for as long as you enjoy dealing with the public.
good,Fun work place everyone was super friendly and guest were always a pleasure to have around. Also a quick pace job on your feet the whole time until break which wasnt so bad
good,I learned how to work with people and and help people out with their everyday needs. I also was a fast worker who never was late and always cane to work with a positive attitude and a great sense of humor to customers and co workers.
good,"I love this job, I wish I didn’t have to leave but hours are getting cut. It’s a great place, workers are helpful, always get your breaks, and everyone treats you equally."
good,"Target provided a typical retail pharmacy working environment. Target pharmacy was more isolated within the store confines than other pharmacies I have worked for, but provided a more personal and private means of communicating with patients. I enjoyed my service at Target."
good,Target is a good choice for me while i am looking for a  position in the medical lab field. It is a seasonal job that i am thankful to have. I enjoy providing goods to customers and the people are very friendly.
good,"Always came in, days can be both slow or very busy depending on staffing. My manager was flexible and wanted all staff to have a good work-life balance."
good,Working at target as a cashier is great It's a bit fast paced with all the customers but you receive nice benefits such as an employee discount card 15 and 30 minute lunch breaks and everyone is very friendly.
good,"Its taking me a while to get used to the 7 hours on my feet. I have flat feet and the wrong shoes, so that isn't helping. I hope soon I'll get me a pair of good shoes and my I'll be able to go through a day without pain."
good,Working at Target was awesome! It's was a great job the pay was good .But my passion is helping people in the medical field. So i followed my heart...
good,"Everybody is helpful and is serious about doing the job. Very clean and organized place to work for and even the store manager gets her ""hands dirty""."
good,"Target is a very nice place to work part time or full time. Management is very nice, friendly, and understanding and will also schedule your hours around your school schedule if you request them to do so. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday!!!"
good,"Target was such a fun place to work at and I definitely regret moving on. Very fast-paced but this made time go by very quick, breaks were mandatory and on time, management was very good at appreciating employees, and very fun coworkers."

good,"Based on the position, your hours can either be fixed or flexible/inconsistent. Working on the planogram team (POG) the hours were fixed Monday through Friday, but as a soft-lines brand the hours were more inconsistent. The atmosphere, as well as the management at Target is incredible and there is a ton of room for growth if you're willing to show up and put in the work."

good,"I enjoyed going to work. It was just a mutual workplace. Everyone got along and it made work less like work. I learned a lot of things in regards to retail, and expanded my flexibility in job positions in the retail business. The work place had a lot of young people, but the older people shared so much of their workplace wisdom and it made work even less like work. The hardest part would sometimes be the guest. There were a lot of customers that would not accept our rules and regulations we were to abide by as associates. But I liked everything about working at Target on Fulton."

good,"Target is great company full of opportunity,  you learn something new everyday. A great place to get introduction training in various retail positions."
good,"Working in Target was a fun yet stressful experience. Although the pressure was intense, they made it very clear what they were expecting from their employees. A typical workday as a cashier would be communicating with many guests, constantly promote the RED Card and the manager will check up on the cashiers every hour. I learned how to promote a card, how to work under pressure and how to manage my time well. The workplace was not so welcoming because most of the employees like to keep to themselves. The hardest part of the job was persuading the guests to apply for a RED Card. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know many guests."
good,"If we were still living in Billings, Mt., I would still be there. I loved working for this company and with others that were a part of my team. Great employers and great benefits."
good,"cleaning time limit bathroom attendant"
good,Target is all about FFF and work life balance! Target is also futuristic thinking and is taking making efforts to compete in the current business environment.
good,This workplace was exciting and fun. I always did different things and learned something new. The other workers were very welcoming and since I was very young ten with little to no work history they were very understanding
good,"Target is an amazing Company in which I experienced much growth.  As any retail Company, it requires many hours, and work life balance often suffered.  The benefits were very good and the Company worked hard to keep culture at the top the importance."

good,I had a blast working for Target it was the best job I had working overnight to learn a lot from MODs to Current Staff. I had a problem with and MOD that Force me to Choose between School or Work. Which I Believe I was wrongfully Terminated. My working Attendance is Excellent. I have never Stole nothing from Target I just want and opportunity to get my job back.
good,Target is a very good place to work for first time experience they would help you step by step with alot of positions and the managers are the best to work with
good,Great career to have I love the job but i need a second job due to lack of overtime. Great environment and they are constantly making changes to better the environment
good,"A typical day at work is processing physician's and patients prescriptions and have them ready in a timely manner so the patients can come back and pick them up. You always want to keep your work area clean and stocked up so it is easier to work around in a tight space. If I notice anything that is about to run low, I would inform my pharmacist to order more. I also verify insurance to make sure that they cover the patient's medications. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to learn more about medications and helping patients get better."
good,There was always a lot to be done and never enough people to do it. I like a good challenge. The job challenged me. The staff was amazing. The managers were great for the most part. I recommend working for target to anyone who asks.
good,Fun place to work good discount. But they need more people helping with carts like all cashier take turns like 2 hours on and off not just one person on it all day
good,"I am a part time employee at Target and I have been there for almost 2 years. In the almost two years that I have been there, I have received 3 raises. I started off making $9.00 an hour and I now make $10.69 an hour. I have been able to branch out and do other jobs besides being a cashier. They have scheduled me to work at Guest Service as well as Food Avenue so that I am not doing just one job every single day. The management at Target is for the most part pretty good. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with rude guest and one of the most enjoyable part of my job is having guests that are very friendly and the pay raises as well as the advancement in the company"

good,"Everything was fun, the work was quick and the shifts went by quick. The leads were all very understanding and listened to what I had to say. I was trained in multiple potions."
good,"I worked on the Sales Floor both Hardlines and Soft lines. They are both fun to work. Your day goes by very quickly that's for sure. there are always something to do and your always helping guest find the things that they are looking for and directing them where it is if they don't know themselves. I also work in the Deli/ Bakery as well just to get a few more hours in and to also help their team members out. There I sliced meat and cheeses for guest that came up to the counter. Helped them figure out what to eat for their family dinners. In the Bakery I took orders and handed out cookies to the lil ones as they came up to the counter. Also wrote Happy Birthday on cakes if the baker wasn't back from their break. Last but not least I was a Guest Service Assistant , which indicated I kept track of all the cashiers and photo place, eye wear and the food court. If they had problems or ran into problems with guest or just by themselves I was there to help fix and figure out the problems for them."
good,"Enjoyed working at target, the team culture they have established is great!! There is never a boring moment. The only downfall is when the hours get cut, but if you are a good worker you will be asked to work in different areas of the store which will keep you steadily working. The more cross trained you are the better your raises and the more valuable you become."
good,"Working at Target was pretty awesome. Though I wasn't there for very long because I had to have surgery where the recovery time was longer than expected and they were not able to hold my position for me. But while I was there the people were great. Most people who work there really wanted to be there which made it a more fun place to work. I was a cashier so I really just had to help people check out as well as keep my station clean. I learned how to really communicate with people while doing my job and how to make them happy even if something was going on that they didn't like, whether that be with a product or with something to do with something that I made a mistake on. Over all I really liked working with the people one on one."

good,"I enjoyed being apart of target's team. Great place to work. All team members were friendly and helpful. I worked hard lines, and my lead was great. I was hired only for seasonal, but i enjoyed every minute, because my team members were great."
good,This job had many great opportunities from learning courses to move up or switching departments to learn a different view of of the company. The scheduling was very open and flexible as well as picking up extra hours when needed. I made many life long friends from working here and learned many new work skills.
good,"Good people that work there. Everybody usually works together to get the job done . The customers are amazing, management was good, hours wasnt always great while there but the pay was manageable."
good,"Great company, culture and benefits. Communication is key to have a successful career at target. Learn from different areas of the division for example Home, Beauty, OTC."
good,"I have been a cashier a little under  a year  for target, I enjoy every minute I spend there thanks to my co workers and guests.Overall I have had by far the best work experience here. We rarely have problems in my store and we all do our best. One thing I love is that even if you try you get told how apreciated you are. I love nmy team and meeting new people in different departments, I have a target red card and love using it, the only down fall that I can really complain about is we can't use our debit card ( Regular debit) in order to get our team member discount, but we can use check, cash, and gift cards. When a debit card is considered cash I just don't see the difference. I feel very safe in my store and I wouldn't want to be anywhere els."
good,"friendly environment to work, everyone that works there can promote to a higher position. they are not discriminatory and it's a really fun place to work."
good,Love working at target stores inc people are ao friendly. Management was great.....  So id like to advance to something more challenging i work from 6 to 10 pm and i would push karts till like 9 then close as the last cashier.... So id like to try something else and keep learning more things..... Would just love that
good,Managements and coworkers were great. They have patience with me and communicated well thru writhing if I don't understand them or lip reading. Meetings were always updated mostly thru my managers.
good,Company has a lot of rules but they are easy to follow. People that work there are nice. Had no problems working there . would like to go back working on that.
good,"One of the hardest parts of the job at target was keeping up with the customers. That place was always busy, I had to work my butt off to refill all those cart lanes. It was tough but it had to be done and I just tried my best to keep and give each and every customer a shopping cart."
good,I loved working at Target. It was one of my favorite places to work. Target is an awesome company and they have exceptional customer service values. I loved the management and all the employees I worked with. It's a very positive environment.
good,"Always busy and doing something. There is never a dull moment; however, you can tell who management does favor from time to time"
good,"You are given assignments and left, with very little to no supervision, to getting the assignments done."
good,"Interacted with customers regularly "
good,"A typical day at work consists of non stop moving all day. I learned from target that being a team isn't so hard. management, could use a little tweak. Hardest part of the job is making sure that I get my workload done before the end of the day, as well as making sure I help others finish theirs. The most enjoyable part of a day at target, is when we have our team huddles and everyone just takes a minute to be goofy, talk about their plans for the week, and kind of just hype each other up."
good,"Working for Target I had to be on my toes. They are a very busy company, plenty to do, to keep busy. I enjoyed my co-workers, especially in the pharmacy. I felt challenged everyday, which kept me very motivated. I had great medical and dental benefits while I was there. I learned a great deal about HIPAA when working in the pharmacy. How to talk to the customer and what to say, or not to say. I enjoyed learning about different prescriptions and there uses."
good,Everyone had some funny stories to tell and they knew how to get the job done. The managers and employees always worked together and they always helped out customers to the best of their abilities.
good,"Target is an amazing place to work at. Target Truly cares more about  a person's work ethic vs. their outward appearance, i.e. Unnatural hair dyes, tattoos, and piercings. Very friendly environment to work in and there is always something to do. Very rarely do they allow employees to go home early. Everyday is a new experience with guests and work loads alike. The team work in Target is always a pleasure! Everyone has each others backs and are willing to help someone else even if their work load gets behind a little. Being flexible is a huge part of this job, especially if you're a sales associate. Sales associates can be ping ponged back and forth between work areas and the checklanes to help with guest traffic. Holidays are very busy and can get frustrating with all that needs to be done, but it's worth it for free catered food or treats. Everyone gets their fair share of recognition and get three breaks for every eight hours of work. Health Benefits are provided along with Dental, 401K, Vision, a certain percentage off a sprint bill, and a few other benefits for both yourself and your family. A hard but rewarding place to work at. "
good,I absolutely enjoyed my time with Target pharmacy. The staff is very courteous and easy going. Working directly with your supervisor is easy when then are more than willing to help you with anything. The hours were very ideal.
good,Target was very fun and exciting it was sad to see me go. I started at south bay target it was an adventure. starting with the HR ETL he is filled with jokes and at the same time he knows his stuff. south bay was more like  family holiday cook outs. sports competition between departments. award ceremony. But my personal favorite was the Food service ETL alwasy smiling  and always had a story o telll. it was a wonderful place to work.
good,"Target was the first company that I worked for and it taught me how to be better at communicating with customers, how to be self-dependent, and whenever I would have issues, they would help as soon as possible and show me ways to resolve it myself."
good,"I love working for Target. They are a company that listens to its workers and will do anything to make sure you love your job and feel that you're useful in your position. They offered paid time off, sick days, and overtime. They genuinely cared for your well being and did their best to make going to work fun (working in collections is typically not seen as fun work). They also offered incetives for doing well like prizes and monthly bonuses. They had advancement opportunities for those interested and would help if you were looking to move to a different department. Target is an all around great place to work no matter who you are."
good,"I enjoyed working in Target Group they're a great employer and I would personally recommend them to anyone that's looking for work, I would also advise to get in touch with Red Recruitment about getting in as a temp with a chance of then possibly becoming permanent after that by applying for any internal positions that are advertised internally."
good,"There were days where we had almost nothing to do, and then we had days where we were so overloaded, that they had to bring people from other departments to help us catch up. We would be standing on our feet with nothing to do for up to 9-10 hrs in a 12 hr shift, not being allowed to lean or rest against our work spaces. Overall, it beat sitting at a phone all day."
good,"It was a great place to work, everyone was very nice and helpful. It's one of the best jobs ive ever had. It was a lot of running around on some days to get guest orders and it was always busy in the backroom. Hardest part was probably having to bring boxes 20Lbs+ down on a latter without dropping it. The LOD's were very nice and always told me i was doing a great job"
good,"Loved working there, I had a great pay and worked 40 hours plus OT.great job opportunities to grow with the company. Works well with your schedule. Hr is always there to help you and find a solution"
good,Worked seasonal in Logoff SC!!  Great place to work.  Hard work but great job.  Really enjoyed my time there.  Hoping I get called back for an FTE position.
good,"Awesome , awesome , awesome place to work and manifesting different crafts , great place to shop and its always overflowing wit products that you need on daily basis along following a great price deal."
good,Muy buena compañía para trabajar ningún cambio en su forma d ser como compañía
good,It was fun and very easy unload the company  trucks make your own pellets and call for someone  to take dat pallet to its section and den you were done making pallets go out on the floor and stock the product on the shelves.
good,"There are a lot of opportunities to move through positions, the management encourages personal growth and professional development. The work environment is very fun and professional."
good,Great place to work. Management and co-workers are supportive and enjoyable to be around. It is a positive place to work. Some positions are part time but you have the opportunity to get cross trained in other areas to make up your hours. so you could work 4 hours unloading truck and work 4 hours as a cashier or in the backroom. not many companies off that.
good,"I recently started working at Target. The environment is really calm and quiet. The location where I'm working is a bit small. It can be a little over crowded when cashier lanes gets a little busy. Overall, we get the job done. The employees are very helpful and friendly. There benefits and employee discounts are super cool. "
good,"When I was hired at target I had no problems picking up shifts, if there ever was an emergency (family, immediate emergency, broken down car etc.) my co-workers and I were able to jostle around shifts. At target there was also positive management with lots of room to grow within target"
good,My job is fun. I love the people i work with and the management is very helpful with anything and everything. The most enjoyable part of the job is working and having fun with another team member. For me there wasn't much of a hard part of the job.
good,"I worked at target as 3rd shift flow team/stocking. While lifting things can be treacherous and hard work, it really pays off in the end. The atmosphere and amount of respect you get from every crew member was awesome. The managers and team leaders were very nice and always open to whatever question it may have been."
good,"Pros: flexible schedule"
good,Always interesting new people everyday. Love working in an office. I worked for 3 years counting the cash everyday. Loved every min of it.
good,"Would work graveyard shifts. I would go and start putting merchandise away, make sure the aisles where clean so customers would be able to walk. I learned that it's not easy to stay up late and to make sure the whole store is stocked and clean. Found that my job was not that hard as people would say it is. Management was good. Co-workers would work together to finish the task that someone was told to do. Very friendly and willing to work with others with no problem."
good,"Target is a wonderful company who i very much enjoy working for. The environment is wonderful and the team is amazing, its like joining a family."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me clocking in, getting on my register, taking a 15 min break, and back to my register until i get off. I ultimately learned how to talk to and work with a wide range of people. The management was very productive throughout the day, making sure things were running as smoothly as possible. I had no problems with my coworkers. They were helpful when needed and we usually conversed a little on breaks. The hardest part of the job were the rushes we had. Having to make sure enough lanes were open, bags constantly being restocked, and trying to satisfy every customer. The most enjoyable part was being able to work in different sections of the store after a certain time period of being an employee."
good,A typical day was busy and productive. I learned a lot about customer service. My managers were all great and very easy to talk to. My co-workers were amazing. I loved working with them because they made it a friendly environment to be in. The hardest part of the job was making sure everyone left happy because there are just some people that you cannot make happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all different types of people everyday and connecting with them all on different levels.
good,"Handling all the cash transactions for customers"
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Target which made for a easy going and stress free enviorment. There was great communication between employees when dealing with customers, also great communication between employees in the backroom. Customers were very friendly an understanding in certain situations such as not having a certain product in stock an being referred to a different location. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for stability and a long and satisfying career with this company"
good,"Target is a all around great place to be, the management is very understanding to the employees and guests. We always try our very best to make sure our guests enjoy their time in our store."
good,Target Canada treat us fairly outside of the closure.  The management and team at Saint John Target was one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,The people at Target Distribution Center are very helpful and are willing to work with you to make your job much easier. Great pay and even better opportunities for overtime.
good,Great place to work overall.Just a little racist at times.I loved working with the etls. Fun environment to be in around the holiday times
good,"Management is great and co-workers are fun to be around. If you have great time management skills, then you can successfully move up to management quickly."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target. Everyday was fun and exciting as I got to meet a variety of people. The work was fast paced and everyday I was on the clock I was challenged even more. The hardest part for me was learning the store layout and each individual aisle. My favorite part about the job was when I found the item a guest would ask me about. All in all, the management and team I worked with was great and I would recommend anyone to Target."
good,Typical day is fast paced and very busy done by 10:15 AM and have the rest of the day to get things done around the house and have a social life. A con is having to go to bed by 8-9 PM and be up at 3AM
good,"-Standard work day"
good,Target was one of my favorite jobs.I Liked my supervisor and we had a great working relationship.The hardest part of the job was having to quit for personal reasons. I learned allot about retail backroom logistics and sales floor inventory replenishment. Got along great with all my co-workers as well as the store mngr.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits, help with school scholarships, etc. I had a great team to work with and over all just a great experience. I only left because I was wanting better pay. I learned how to print labels, work a PDA scanner, learned how to create bar codes and how to easily find something off a shelf. Co-workers were great, was able to create friendships with a few and glad to say I do still keep in contact with most. Managers were awesome. What I loved most about the management team was their way of understanding. They were very nice and had a great way of keeping us all on task. The hardest part of my job was keeping my designated area clean and making sure everything was in its correct spot before the end of my shift. I could fix a whole table and within a matter of minutes it was destroyed by a customer who liked the shirt at the very bottom of the stack. Other than customers destroying my work, it was very enjoyable and fun. I never complained about having to work and our employee discount came in very handy."
good,"Target was a interesting place to work at. As a Cashier, if you were the opening one, you start your day at 8 AM most days. You are by yourself till about 9 AM at which point things start getting busy. You spend A LOT of time dealing with the public. If you do your job, many come back looking for you.   Management encouraged you to take the lead in doing your part to take care of people. Depending on your coworkers, things could go very well each day. But making a person smile when they were done going through your lane, was the most enjoyable part of the day."
good,Target is a wonderful company to work for. The work was always exciting and always changing. Co-workers were all good and I got along with all of them. The most enjoyable part of the job was always being busy.
good,"I had great team mates it was the best place I have ever worked"
good,An enjoyable place to work with great leadership opportunities. I enjoyed my time there and only left because of CVS buying them out.  I probably would have never left otherwise.
good,My job is fast pace with multi tasking which makes the day go by fast and I feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the days.  The company treats employees well which results in happy co-workers and team work is expressed continuously.  Great customer service is stressed which results in happy customers for the most part and I have learned to resolve issues when we do have unhappy customers.
good,"The Management was good, the place stayed neat. The Co-workers help each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers out on finding something or choosing what product they desire most."
good,Verry fast paced requiring quick decisions. Going the extre mile to keep the guest happy. I go to photo station the first thing. Organise that dpt. Go to guest service to releive co-workers for breaks and lunch.the hardest part of the job is getting too many guest in line with no one to back you up. The best part of the job is the satisfaction on the guest face at the end of a transaction.
good,"There is no typical day at work.  Every day is new adventure, so be prepared.  My biggest takeaway from Target is that you need to be able to adapt and reinvent yourself every couple years to stay relevant.  I worked for some amazing leaders at Target.  Those that are not amazing do not make it very long.  The hardest part of my job was making sure that I was able to provide the hours that my team members required to ensure that they could live sufficiently from week to week.  The most enjoyable part of my job is developing people in to better people/leaders."
good,Great people and great place. Love the culture and the people. Management is friendly and kind. I think you would love to work there and it is very professional
good,"I enjoyed working with the people, guests and team members alike. I learned to deal in a fast paced environment during an extremely busy time of year. Training was fast, and I learned as I went. I had worked at a convenience store before, but the amount of items to ring up, coupons, sales to keep up with was new to me. My management team were there to help with any issue I had come up, and gave constructive criticism whenever I needed help or made a mistake. The reassurance I received made it easy to ask questions or ask for help. The only problems I experienced were the physical nature of the work. Standing, lifting, bending all took a toll on my aging body, but as time passed, that became easier, too."
good,"Target is a great work environment if you're looking for something where you're always busy and love helping people. After helping on the sales floor and cash register, it was certainly a promising location of employment for any age."
good,it was a amazing place to work in.ever body help each other out if they where having a hard time.it was sad to see it close.the training was great we all did are role in the store.
good,"Just in two years as an Executive Team Leader (ETL) with no previous managerial experience, Target educates and develops you into a strong leader. From understanding the importance of customer service and what that means for the long-term success of the company; working closely with team members and leading them to meet company goals and their own personal development. This company is always innovating and looking forward which makes it feel like an exciting place to work."
good,"Friendly place to work, they work as a team and help each-other. I learned leadership, the hardest part of the job was to keep up with backroom inventory."
good,"I loved working for Target. In fact, I plan on working there again at some point. The pay is good, the schedule is very flexible, and they support your choices in life."
good,Target was my very first job and I enjoyed it there very much. As a seasonal worker I will be let go on the seventh of January and it is extremely saddening because working there was relatively stress free and all of my fellow team members were very nice and encouraging.
good,"In a typical day i have at least 70 guests i check out at my register. I learned a lot of customer service skills and how to handle guests when things get out of hand. The management there is great they are all so nice and don't have a problem helping you when needed."
good,"Supportive management with a great sense of humor. Cared more about how you developed within the company rather than sales figures. An actual decent amount of sticklers, but in a good way. Would recommend working here to any who have considered"
good,"Everyone at Target is an important part of one big team. No matter what department or section you are in, someone will be there to help you when you need them and there's no fear of being chastised for mistakes. Everyone has been in your position before at some point and makes a point to demonstrate empathy in regards to helping new team members. The team leaders don't hesitate to roll up their sleeves and work alongside team members all the while managing day to day operations of the store."
good,Great company with lots of room for advancement. Perfect for students and recent graduates. Typical day at work consisted of working the cash register along with a mandatory break. Management was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed working there.
good,Working at Target was really good ! Everyone really works together! The front end cashier team... all were supportive of each other! We were treated well by supervisors.. manage of this particular store is a very sweet lady!!!
good,"Target was a great place to work with flexible hours, helpful management, and room for upward mobility. I only worked there for a summer, but the staff made it clear they believed I was a helpful member of their team and they encouraged me to return once I'd finished school. Target seems like a great company."
good,"I loved working there, everyday I got to work I was greeted with a friendly smile from everybody. Everyone was understanding and kind to one another, I'd work there again if I could. I loved having access to a starbucks and pizza place during lunch, and even with walking around the store and getting to see al the new set-ups and displays was nice."
good,A typical day at Target was when the self check outs were either running very slow or crashing and it up setted the guests and then they would take it out on the employee's. the thing is that you were always learning new things about the company and getting the necessary feed back from management they gave the support and they always helped out and they didnt hide in the office like the ones at Walmart would. I want target back it was the best company to work for I honestly think that if the company had budgeted for a loss and then it would have come around and would have gotten better and the consumers have got to get their heads out of their butts and allow other competitive companies in it took ex number of years for walmart to get where they are and target would have done the same if given the chance and not pull out after short time it takes time to bounce back and that is with ALL companies big and small.
good,Good place to work very caring coworkers and management .There are many jobs posted for the workers to advance and benefits are very good. There is some lifting that can be hard sometimes but overall fair pay and raises make it good place to work.
good,"Working at Target required being on your toes and able to complete all tasks on hand. A typical day at Starbucks was spent running back and forth to make drinks while keeping everything stocked.I learned that I had the ability to stay on track and automatically know when I needed something. My management was there to check in or assist when any problems arose, whether it be in Starbucks or on front cash register. My coworkers were very helpful in teaching me and guiding. I needed a bit of assistance for a while. The hardest part of the job was the heavy demand of customers. My job was very fast paced and required an iron will. The most enjoyable part of working at Target was the many people I got to see every day."
good,The typical day at work the different challenges. The knowledge of the company on a daily basis. Management is a challenge of different departments. Co-workers where all different and fun. The hardest part of the job was politics. The most enjoyable was the company understands family.
good,I was very comfortable with my job at Target.  The management was supportive and extremely friendly and caring.  I have never loved and enjoyed a job as much as that one.  I was disappointed leaving knowing that there were no Target Clinics in the F-M area that I could transfer to.
good,"Worked between 3 and 6 hours.  I learned management skills.  My bosses were very helpful and encouraging in my advancement interest.  Hardest part of my job was to drive 40 minutes away.  I truly enjoyed every aspect of my job, from unloading the truck to help various departments stock product."
good,"I would scan products and help customers, Management cared about you and there was excellent perks to the job. There was a starbucks in the store and you could use your discount there. The hardest part was there wasnt one. I enjoyed my job completely. I got to see new people everyday and help them with what ever they needed. From getting something from the back room to cashing them out."
good,"I loved working at Target, I love my supervisors as well as my co-workers. Everyone was friendly and very outgoing so work went by fairly quickly. I was always excited to go to work and rarely had a bad day. It was hard being up at 5 in the morning, but I got through the day."
good,Received great training and it was always a fun environment. It was also very customer oriented. Making sure customers left as pleased as possible and that they received what they came in to purchase. Target also made sure that everyone received training in the job titles within the company and also had a great way of helping employees in job advancements within the company.
good,My experience a Target was very positive one. I was able to use the establishments views and work culture in my every day life.
good,"Target was a great place to work. you get to see new faces everyday, as well as developing a relationship with guest who frequent the store. There was always room for advancement. Target was very lets say accommodating when it came down to work availability. The hardest part of working a customer service job is patience. You must have patience to deal with unhappy guest."
good,"It's really what you make of it. Some stores, like every company, have bad management, and some stores have great management. You deal with the good and the bad, and try and climb the ladder. Expectations are increasing, as is workload. The compensation is fair, but it could always be better."
good,"most friendliest, compassionate company I've ever worked for with a great sense of team work throughout their company. Very amazing company to become a part of. Compassionate about every single associate and their own creativity and necessities or concerns about the job."
good,"i star at 6am we unload truck, from there stock them on the sleves. the hardest part was getting the truck done before the store open at 8"
good,"i came in at 6 a.m and left at 12, sometimes 2 or 3 . . . work was great we started putting together manikins and learned the importance of team work as it took many of us to get the truck done per day, the hardest part of this job was getting there, i was using public transportation other than that the job was not hard at all. . . i enjoyed the workers the most it made my day so much better when they talked me through something or helped me get done in time"
good,"- I helped build up two other Target stores before starting to officially work at my own. "
good,amazing management. great hours. having to be on your feet all day is definetly hard but  very fast pace. customers can be difficult as well
good,"I would recommend Target to anyone that is interested. It is an amazing work place and they have great benefits. I loved meeting new faces every day and seeing regulars, I loved coming to work knowing that I was always welcomed with open arms"
good,"A GSA is the Front Lanes Lead. So during your day you watch over the lanes. Make sure Guests are happy, assist your cashier's with problems that arise. Take money order's for the register drawers when they run low. Assist at Guest Service. Take care of the Cash office. Run the break schedule, Fill in where needed.

good,"Best employer I have ever worked for! Management is amazing and truly want to do whatever it takes to ensure people succeed in their position and have the opportunity for advancement. Fun culture and very focused on getting to know the people you work with not only on a professional level. Great work life balance, offering work from home options and flexible work schedules."
good,The management was reasonable to understand problems when calling off. Friendly and enjoyable work place where your co-workers want you to do the best you can. The work environment was very upbringing and supportive if you made a mistake. The hardest part of my job was getting so frustrated when you had to redo a table you just zoned and trying to figure out how to make then print the new labels for items. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to be treated with respect and kindness from my co-workers to a point they felt like family.
good,The day started early and fast paced. Learned a lot about working as a team that I didn't with my previous job. Management interested in what they could do for you not what you could do for them. The best part of working at Target was the people.Even though the store is closed we still get together
good,"A typical day at work: I used to work from 12pm to 9pm. Was looking after core operations. Everything out at Target was structured. Balanced work station."
good,"Helping guests find what they are looking for!."
good,"Target has been one of the best decisions to work there in my life! I love everybody I work with and the new skills I learn each day. With amazing pay and benefits, and a dedicated, exceptionally nice upper staff managers, my success at Target has given me the ability to serve my community through volunteer work and one-on-one guest interactions that always make a smile. I hope to continue my positive track through Target after my college days to be an Executive Team Leader and make my employees feel as amazing as I did."
good,"I am a very dependable individual and looking to work independently as a customer service representative."
good,"In charge of medication review, dispensing, technician supervision and overall patient satisfaction. Also responsible for flu clinics and coordination with other departments of the store."
good,I have no cons about target. They treat their employees like they are needed and follow state and federal laws. I get a team member 10 percent discount plus a 5 percent red card discount. I have nothing to complain about.
good,"Throughout the few months I spent at Target i learned a lot about retail and customer service, however from my prior job at Best Buy, I was able to bring forth my skills and display them. I had an amazing time working with my co-workers and I made some great friends while we were on the job. The most enjoyable aspect of working at Target was helping the customers find that one little thing that they were looking for, whether it be a size or a colour or a specific style, and seeing how happy they were by the end of it. I enjoyed every aspect of my job at Target and I didn't suffer through any hardships luckily."
good,Great teamwork environment with opportunities to grow within the organization. Focused on a customer oriented mind set that delivers outstanding results.
good,"Working for Target was a great experience! The Management was very welcoming and friendly as well as the team members, They always served meals to employees even during holidays when employees worked, gave a good amount of breaks so you wont over  work yourself. They always had something going on to keep employees motivated."
good,"i worked as a packer . I loaded the boxes with target items putting them in the right box to go out to stores. i only worked friday,saturday sunday and mondays 12 hr shifts"
good,"This job is an awesome place to work if you are a man, but this work is just not cut out for women.  I worked on the docks loading the trucks and you talk about a grueling day.  I could barely move when I got off."
good,"Being productive and sometimes it has rewards for jobs done well, especially when we are at the peak seasons.  The management will often leave out food and treats for us.  On the especially long tough days we are given pizza, sandwiches, and have occasional cookouts for the workers after our shift is over.  My typical day is to stock the infant department, and when finished, and have extra time to help out anywhere in the store that needs help.  I have learned so much to describe now, but basically good working skills, the best way to accomplish my tasks, help customers, and get along well with others.  The hardest part of my job is I have to get up very early each day to be at work by 4:30.  The most enjoyable part of my job is doing a good job, and the people I work with."
good,une journée n'est jamais pareilles Cez Target donc etre tres proactif et etre capable de vivre avec des changements.
good,"Target, in Martinsburg, Virginia, is a fun and productive environment. All departments work in tandem and are willing to assist if needed."
good,"great company to work for, aspirational ambitions for global sales and a fun place to work if you love darts. "
good,There was never a dull moment at Target I always enjoyed going into work knowing it was never going to be like the last time. It's always a new experience with customers and co-workers. I enjoyed my seasonal time at Target. I learned how to promote and sort of sell items to customers. The promotional item at Target was their Red Card. It was a Target Credit or Debit card that earned you money off and even rewards.

Facilitate dialog to understand the guest's concerns and present appropriate solutions to retain the relationship"
good,"A typical day at work would consist , me helping our guest to the most desire I can. I learned that you can make new relationships with all types of people. The hardest part of the day would be leaving , when you love your job and helping people. The most enjoyable part would be the guest letting you know that your appreciated and the acknowledge your work. Co-workers are uppity , full of joy ready to take on the 12 hr shift."
good,"Target has been a great place to work. If it were possible for me to make a career out of retail, I would love to make it Target. The employees are great people to work with. Target is a place where you get the job done inn a timely manner, but you are also able to have fun while doing it."

good,"A typical day in the Soft Lines division of Target would include but was not limited by:"
good,"The days went buy very fast because I was constantly occupied; talking to guests, assisting with zoning, stocking...whatever time it was there was something to be doing. I learned as a Target team member how to use a register, courtesy expected from a retail associate, time and attention management skills. Those in charge were kind, understanding and patient with me and gave me the time to ask questions and learn as I went. My co-workers were friendly and really helped the day advance by with smiles and good spirit throughout the day. The hardest part of the day was probably finding a comfortable position to restock bottom shelf food products for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the day I feel would have to be interaction with guests and enjoying such a versatile crowd; many people of different cultures, careers and interests never ceased to make my day with the fact that I can assist them ,and their short conversations left my mind fresh with a memory to last me ages; It made my week knowing I could impact their day in a positive way even through such a brief amount of time and make sure they leave the store in good spirits."
good,"Target is a fast paced high energy environment where performance is recognized and rewarded.  A strong company with a history of innovation, I would willingly recommend them as an employer of choice."

Their motto is ""Fast, Fun and Friendly"" which is carried through in all that they do. You work hard, and at a constant, fast pace while promoting fun amongst team members and vendors."
good,"Target is a great company to work for. It is a fast paced environment that will challenge any leader on how well they can multi-task. You are continually challenged to grow as a leader and are constantly given feedback to improve your performance as that leader. The most challenging part of the job is not to become complacent. If you can challenge yourself daily to exceed expectations, you will succeed. The most enjoyable part of the job is working that wide variety of Team Members and the constant guest interactions."
good,"Target is a nice friendly and team feeling workplace. Working at Target is like having a second family, When I first started everyone welcomed me and made me feel right at home. A typical day at target is very exciting and a lot of guest service, if you are trained throughout the store your day will be even more exciting. Being trained every where in the store on a busy day at target requires you to be every where answering call buttons, assisting the guest, answering the phones, working on the cash register, helping the guest shop, helping out the in the other areas in the store Including (market, electronics, customer service, training new team members, and being the operator/answering the phones/directing calls), bringing merchandise to the floor, handling guest complaints, and more. The hardest part of the is not knowing the answer to a guest's questions, in other words if your not trained all over the store its hard to answer some questions, but not that hard because we are a team and you can ask anyone on the sales floor for any help that you may need. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing and feeling and realizing that target is a team and you work as a team. Its very exciting and there is always another team member there to help you do there job and your also because we are a team!!!!!!"

good,"helping our guest. setting up new displays for the new year!!great co-workers and sups.long hrs,"
good,"The day starts off with having to restock items in the frozen food section and work all around to the lunch meat section. As time goes by, I recycle the cardboard packages by places them in the baler to clean the work place. I learned to use motor skills better, communication skills with fellow employees and customers, how to multitask better, and to have a positive attitude in the work environment. The management is impeccably well in the store I work in. With supervisors being there advising the employees what to do, what not to do, and figuring out problems very quickly. My coworkers are a terrific bunch of people. They show positive attitudes, have all their work done by the appointed time, available around a flexible schedule, and never make the environment boring. The hardest part of the job is having to work around the guests as they shop in our store. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be with all the good people who work there."

The hardest part of the job was adjusting to 3rd shift. The most enjoyable thing was getting to interact and work with great people.
good,"My day at work consisted of getting my work order for running and converting rolls of paper into various sizes and types of sheets. I learned how to really measure and understand the way paper works, my managers were all manual laborers at one point and were very knowledgeable in training me. My co-workers worked very competitive along side with me in an effort to see who can produce as much product in an 8 hour shift. the hardest part of my job was having to gauge times a job would take to run and be ready for the next order by the expected time."
good,"Friendly people, made sure you have a break so you can relax for a little. At target it was a must. Very conciderate and understanding to things going on in your personal life."

good,"My coworkers were the best, everyone is there to help you out when you have problems. The supervisors are so understanding and also fun and easy to talk too. I learned how to operate the cash register in one day and the next day I was already taking in guests. The hardest part of the job might have been keeping track of when to punch in and out at the beginning but with help it was no problem later on. The most enjoyable part was talking to the guests as they checked out. It's always the best feeling to see them smile as they leave and also thank me for taking my time to explain offers and deals. I would more than definitely recommend this job."
good,"every one was willing to help and greet you."

good,Great place to work. wonderful people. great bosses Nice coworkers
good,"This was my very first job at 16 years old. I applied for cashier and ended up getting hired in the Human Resources department. I honestly learned how to do everything at this job. From payroll, to data entry, and even on slow days I would fill in as cashier and even work the fitting rooms which boosted my retail experience. Management was very helpful, but I also loved that they let me breathe and trusted me with some responsibility as well. The entire team was like a family. We helped one another and there was never conflict. I can honestly say that there was nothing hard about the job and the most enjoyable part was interview preparation. I enjoyed being the one to call people and let them know they had a interview and hearing the excitement and eagerness in their voices."
good,"Straight to the back room to unload the truck, we had to be fast and lift heavy boxes. I learned new things because target positioned me in many positions. Target works with many people so there is always some one to help, for example management as well as the co workers. Everyone gets along and we show each other new things. The hardest part is the heavy lifting but the most enjoyable part is the learning new things everyday for example pricing."

good,"come in, clock in, and the day is pretty much alright from there. Pretty lax but fast paced."
good,"I helped stock the store with carts and cleaned spills. I also maintained the restrooms. I did not enjoy cleaning the restrooms every hour. The job was fast paced during the holidays, but it was nice to be outside and isolated from he busyness inside. All of my fellow cart attendance were very nice and helpful. Some co workers that worked inside, treated the cart attendants differently. We had to do all of the dirty work. I didn't mind the job at all, besides cleaning the restrooms."
good,"Target's new system in function of team is more team oriented. I learned that instead of working as individuals per assigned section (1998-1999), the team effort succeeded at a much higher productivity rate; the latter PT. The most enjoyable part of working was brief customer interaction."
good,very organized. managers treated you like family. very flexible

All the managers are easy to talk to and they work right along with us. Every day at Target was a learning experience.  It seems that every day I worked there was something new to learn. All my co-workers were great to work with and I've made some friendships by working for Target. I always loved the way Target was flexible and worked with you to schedule what best suited us as employees. They seem to always say ""yes"" to any vacation time, personal days off or to schedule changes.  The hardest part of my job was having to drive an hour to work and an hour home.  I could have transferred to a closer Target but I love the one I worked at.  I loved my co-workers, my hours and my days off and I didn't want to chance losing any of that. The most enjoyable part of my job, without a doubt, was all the people I worked with."

good,"My daily starts off at 7am "
good,"Typical job at Target would be, clock in, see what location/area of floors they put you in, and do the job straight from there."
good,"My typical day at work was unloading product off of truck, and palletizing product according to plan. Then pulling product to the floor, and stocking product according to plan. I learned how to unload the merchandise and stocking according to the store planogram. I also learned how to use PDAS, and pump trucks. I found my Team leaders and supervisors very helpful and always there when needed. I enjoyed working with the team i worked with, it felt like a family, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with great and helpful people, and making the job easier by working hard together, and sharing helpful ideas. The hardest part of the job would have to be fitting back stock in the back room. But always managed to pull through and do all the tasks we were suppose to do in an night. All and all a great environment to work in. Miss it very much, and was very sad to leave!"
good,Fantastic people make working at Target great.  There is a huge focus on collaboration. The work/life balance can be trying at times.
good,Fast fun and friendly... Feedback cultural... Willing to give back and help out the community..
good,"All employees in the store, as well as managers, give a really good ""vibe"" showing both professionalism and lividity. The casual, everyday work load was not overwhelming, nor physically and/or mentally stressing. All managers are very friendly yet can be stern when necessary. The company and management itself is well-run and well-organized. I was very pleased to work for such a positive company and would recommend employment to said company to anyone."
good,I loved the environment in the store. I loved the customers. They had plenty of online services to make everything convenient for you. The register was very easy to work on. The only thing that wasn't great was the pressure of having to keep a high speed score and try to get people to sign up for red cards (target credit card). The store was always clean and the management was very helpful.
good,"The day begins cleaning my position and checking"
good,I got this job when I was a senior in High School. It was a fun and energetic work environment and excellent for a student to be in. Had a great time working there until I had to quit due to a family crisis.
good,"During my time at Target I had many opportunities for advancement. It was a fair and fun work place. I started off as a cashier. I obtained the skills necessary to work in different departments throughout the store. I was first advanced to Cash Office Specialist. In that position I arrived promptly everyday at 7am. I counted and prepared the cash to be distributed throughout the store and for bank deposit. My second advancement was as a Guest Service Assistant. My duties were to oversee the front checkout and make sure that guest were provided with exceptional fast and friendly service. Overall I enjoyed my team, management, and my service."
good,I loved the fast pace work that sales floor had for you and making everything look nice on the shelves.
good,Target was a good job and is especially good for you if you are in college and need a nice fun job where the customers are nice and the management is awesome.

good,"Target is a great place to work. Very busy, hard work but the benefits are worth it."
good,"Fast fun and friendly work culture"
good,"I was originally hired in a ""blanket"" hire for new store opening in Burbank, CA.  Was there for 3-4 months then transferred to Culver City, CA store and stayed for a total of 3 years...Great environment, managers worked w/employees with schedules, training, and promotions. Co-workers always seemed happy to be there as well as myself. Pay was not great, but always great environment. Almost on monthly basis management treated us to nice lunches. We got discounts on everything in the store and of course everything was of pretty good value.  Because of the locations, we were constantly surrounded by tv and movie actors and the people that worked for them...so it was a little glamorous...The hardest part of the job was trying to stretch the paycheck because, as I said, the pay was dismal. I came with years of customer service and cashier experience so it was very easy to assimilate into environment."
good,Working at Target was a lot of fun.  All of the employees felt like they could talk openly with everyone.  It was a wonderful place to work.
good,I learned that I should always check carts to make sure there is nothing on the lower portion of the cart. I should always be courteous with customers no matter what. I am always busy doing what needs to be done.
good,I worked at Target for almost 5 years after graduating High School. the people were always positive and were like my second family. Getting along with your co workers is one of the most important things in a business to help to make it successful.
good,"Unload truck"
good,"I loved working at Target."
good,Very good. Clean reliable job. Bosses are very good to employee's.
good,"Fast , fun and friendly work culture. "
good,A typical workday would require 5.5 hrs of work completing task. I learned to work at a fast pace. The management were very polite and respectful to the whole staff. Co-workers very respectful and friendly. Hardest pat of the job would be when team members do not follow their task. Most enjoyable part of job was everybody was like one big family.
good,"A fast, fun and friendly place to work.  The company really values their team members."
good,"A typical day at work is a day when we have to unload the trailer of 2400 boxes. Once the unload is done then I go to the floor and began to separate merchandise to be properly placed in correct location while having to be timed. What I have learned from this is it may be hard, but I can get the job done and on time. Team work is good at times but so is working by yourself. The management is Great! The hardest part of the job was placing the items in the proper location after being separated, but once you constantly do it, it becomes easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the job is all done."
good,"I liked working at Target. It kept me busy, I had lots of fun while working there. The management is awesome down there. The only reason I left from down there was because I moved from that area."

good,Company is oriented around ensuring employees are empowered to make things correct.
good,"Working at target change a lot of for me not only in the work place but in the my everyday life. The days were fast and steady with much to do. Project in every corner of the store waiting for the right team member to come along and display the merchandise. The team members are not only hard at work but are ready and willing to help out each and every guest that comes in the door. Don't get me wrong just like any job there are days that are some times harder then others but being able to work in a place were you have TEAM LEAD like MATTHEW JACKSON who make sure that everyone is in place and is ready to work hard and get the job done it make going into a day like that much more easy then a slow day.  "
good,"Target is a very excited place to work. Most co-workers are very easy to get along with. A few times a month management does a special day for the team members for example, sandwich day they make us sandwich during our breaks."
good,a typical day at target was enjoyable to work there the co workers where helpful and we already knew what had to be done by the time i clocked in to work.. I learned how to set up new work stations n clothes areas.the hardest part about the job was not making people happy..
good,"1) great work crew"
good,I have always believed in the fact that I am a good salesman but that being said I still believe in learning more and increasing your Knowledge. Target Mobile/Glentel has not only helped me believe in my sales abilities but also their extensive training programs and the attitude of helping their employees grow and move forward has motivated me to work harder and enjoy my work.
good,"I worked here when i was looking for part time hours during my education months. Target is the perfect place. If you're a college student like me. You'll have something in common with most Target employees. It's really easy to meet people, the learning environment is excellent, the pay is in a good equilibrium with the work-load. I honestly have no complaints about Target."
good,"Target's Property Development department was a great place to work.  The policies, standards and all processes are easy to follow and make your job a breeze.  Everyone is a joy to work with and employees seem to truly enjoy what they do.  There are unlimited growth opportunities once you have secured a coveted full-time position within the company and they take care of your very well.  Management runs smoothly all the way down the chain.  They truly care about your growth in your career and as an individual and set goals for your during your time there.  Along with setting goals, they also give you the tools to reach your fullest potential, and work with you to reach them.  I've never worked with a company so focused on not only being successful as a whole, but work towards each individual employees success in their lives.  While some of their policies are pretty rigid and it is definitely a corporate environment - these actually add to the workplace rather than detracting.  Everyone knows the boundaries, and those that don't follow them, are disciplined appropriately for it."
good,"Working with Target was an experience to look forward to. A day at work started with the team of 15 members getting together which the manager at the appointed time to plan the day's schedule. It was up to the team members to decide how efficiently to do the work albeit having a little fun in between."
good,I loved Target . it was a very bright and friendly environment .
good,"The pace is hectic at times, but honestly it is the team members that make the job easier. Everyone jumps in and helps no matter what the task is. It is truly a team environment."
good,"I always enjoyed working at target, it's a fast paced working environment and as long as you are serious about the work you are asked to do then it is easy to advance. The managemnt varies on locations is what I have always been told, but I always found a way to get along with everyone."

good,"My days usually begin with coming in the morning, receiving and organizing the day's shipment, bringing the product to the floor, then either recovering the general area or helping customers."
good,"As a Team Member Trainer, I was responsible for my department's equipment certifications and training, as well as my usual daily task.  On a day to day basic I referenced a self kept calendar of my fellow teammates certification expiration dates in order to keep everyone up to date.  I was also responsible for follow up on any performance factors(safety, productivity, reliability, etc) among my peers.  My daily tasks included picking of freight, putting of freight, and assisting my supervisors with any problems.  My position required me to maintain a high level of problem solving when partnering with my peers and other departments.  "
good,"A typical day at work is lively with lots of new moms and women. I learned a few things about hospitality and nonjudgment. Management is supportive but communication needs improvement. Coworkers are priceless. Need to get back to 1+1. Enjoyed seeing the cute babies and happy college students."
good,I interacted with different people learned new cashing systems. Over all great management. i had a good work experience
good,"i had great time working there, the co-workers were great, had lots of help when i needed it, and the store was well managed when i was there. Meet alot of good people guest and co-worker alike, couldn't complain about the hours, and the pay is only min wage but there's always room for advancement, that's always a plus. "
good,"*A typical day at work ensued; greeting customers, maintaining clean fitting rooms, organizing my desk, sorting clothes and logging my daily work activities and times."
good,"fold clothes that are on the folding tables"
good,"A typical day at work would have been putting merchandise on shelves, backstocking and general cleanliness.  I have perfected the ablility to work as part of a team.  The management is wonderful.  There is fluidity between the managers and the regular employees.  My co- wokers were always cheerful and helpful.  The hardest part of the job would have to be the long hours on your feet.  What I enjoyed the most was being part of a wonderful team."
good,"A typical day at work can, like any other retail position, be frustrating, but everyone works together to create a welcoming fun atmosphere."
good,Target is a great company who is very devoted to their employees.
good,This job was a nice place to work because of the people I worked with and I liked the hours we worked.
good,Target really gives you an opportunity to succeed. They let you develop your leadership skills and give you constant feedback. It's a great internship!
good,"I loved going to work with a positive attitude in order to see how many people I could spread that attitude to. A typical day involved making sure that everything in the store was as neat and visually appealing as possible. It also involved addressing any concerns a customer might have and doing everything possible to satisfy said concerns. Maintaining a steady flow of merchandise to the sales floor was an additional responsibility. I learned how to more effectively communicate with my supervisors in order to complete any projects or assignments. I thought the management there was very understanding and fair in their relationship with employees. My co-workers were supportive of one another and collaborated well together. The hardest part of the job would be meeting every customer's expectations while ensuring all employees were on the same page together. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing a customer leave satisfied, especially if I helped resolve their concern."
good,"I worked as a seasonal hired cashier for Target. As a company target has strong values and a very positive, welcoming culture. The work itself was very typical however the company's commitment to pleasing ""guests"" (customers) and ensuring that employees had a friendly and stable work environment was always evident. Management was easy to talk to and were always quick to help when needed and gave good constructive advice."
good,"starts early in the morning (4:00 a.m.) but everything is nice because we get to do what we need to and still have part of the morning to do other stuff, like go to school!."
good,"I learned how to manage work on a social basis. My job involved talking to people A LOT. And to do so, you must smile, greet and proceed with doing so with every person. I ended up finding a love for talking to guests. I could practically whip up a conversation about anything and everything. Some guests are rather difficult to talk to, but there is something special about each and every human that I can find. I was a aloof at first, but with keen and eager management I was quick and ready to set foot int he world of retail. What I loved the most was that my manager(s) were willing to help me work around my busy school schedule. They genuinely care about your well being and your success in life. The only thing that could ever possibly be upsetting is if a co-worker isn't having a good day. Working at Target is a team experience. And I absolutely loved my team!"
good,"I worked at Target for 3 years. I loved every second of it. I decided to leave because you can not advance in position into management without a degree. My manager was great! She was very driven and dedicated to Target. My co-workers were alright. Most were lazy and a lot of people come and go. Team members who were there for over 10 years still worked at the store even if they were ""old school"". The benefits working at Target are great! I was working 36 hours a week in softlines and I worked with an awesome team of 4."
good,Working at Target was very exciting and rewarding. My co-workers were absolutely wonderful and easy to work with. The easiest part was the connection with the workers.

Break starts at 3:00 am and ends at 4:15. The part of my job that brings me joy would be when the colleagues can switch schedules.

good,the only thing i have to say it was a great place to work for and i have nothing bad to say about anything
good,"Fast, Fun, and Friendly was the motto and that worked for me. We started off the night unloading 1-2 trucks, separating boxes according to department, then using a pallet jack we took the freight to its designated area. By the time we were done unloading the truck it was break time. After break we had meeting, then off to work. Our team leader would turn the radio on and some of us, (including me) would sing out loud while doing some hardcore stocking. Everybody had walkie-talkies to let our team leader know our progression throughout the night. After about a year of unloading and stocking they sent me to the backroom where I learned how to use an inventory scan gun called a PDT. I learned how to do picks and back-stock, which was pretty easy. After I had gotten good at that they made me a trainer for the back-room. When I first started off management was great. Easy to talk to and straight forward about what they wanted and expected from us as a team. We had two or three others come and go while I was working there. Some seemed like they didn't know what they we're doing, which made our job more difficult. That was pretty much the hardest part of the job, having to adapt to managers who we're unfamiliar with the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and our teamwork."
good,Target is a great employer. They seem to have all of there pieces in order and it shows through their leadership. The work was very demanding but the goals always stayed consistent. Never raising to unreachable levels.

By taking on more responsibilities without being asked, I lessen the load on supervisors. My co-workers are the best-they always keep the mood enlightening."
good,Working with other college students made it easier to work there manager was a college student as well so he knew how to schedule me when i have a busy week of school ahead of me
good,"Fun place to work. I was able to help customers with whatever they needed. I enjoyed working in the jewelry department, women's ready to wear area, and sometimes the electronics department. Working in different areas challenged me to learn new things and increased my knowledge in some products. Working in teams, I was able to make friends with my coworkers it made working enjoyable and fun."
good,"A typical work day would include ringing up guests, making proper change, and ensuring a clean work area. I learned cashiering skills, the ability to work with guests, and efficiency at the cash register. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the hectic environment around the holiday season. Many people at those times can be a bit impatient and impersonal, but I still strived to make the experience of the guests a quick, efficient, and friendly one. What I enjoyed most was when the guests were friendly, but not in the way, and the job goes without a hitch."

good,"Great company to work for, there are always opprotunity for advancement."
good,"Working at Target was by far the best job I had so far...the work was hard...they demanded that you do your best 100% and not many jobs do that. Unfortunately I had to be let go due to lack of work but if they called me right now and asked me to come back, I would. The atmosphere was always positive and the team leads no matter how tired they were always kept the team members motivated to get their job done and have a fast, fun, and friendly atmosphere. Target taught me the value of meeting goals and they always did the best they could to keep employee morale at it's highest. The hardest part of the job I will admit was learning the areas in the store because it was a much larger atmosphere than what I was used to but the longer I worked there, the easier it got."
good,"A great and fun place to get customer service experience. The co-workers and team leaders are helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is remebering the back of the store lol. But the most fun part of the job is meeting the ""interesting"" customers."
good,"Come into work, clock in, go to work station and warm up before starting your duties. Well if it were my first experience with retail I would've learned everything there was to learn about retail just from this one job! Absolutely loved this job and wish I would've been able to stay working there. Management was extremely respectful and considerate, they would talk to you about any arising issues you had either at home or on the job and they were always more than willing to help you out as best as they could. Co-workers were amazing individuals as well, you could count on them for anything. Hardest part of the job was that I had a newborn and it was an overnight position so trying to work overnight and then come home and try and get some sleep was almost impossible to do. Most enjoyable about the job was that since it was seasonal things would always change and keep it interesting, not that repetitiveness is a bad thing, I also enjoy that as well, but the changing flow really kept it interesting!"
good,"Working for Target means that once you walk through the door, you're expected to give your all mentally and physically. However, due to budget cuts, no one is allowed over 40 hours which drive many team members to look for second jobs which impede on their already limited work schedule. However, despite the limited hours and ever-mounting workload, you are sure to have fun interacting with guests and with fellow team members."

good,"Target is a great place to work, and you learn new things about customer service.  I was a cashier, so I would scan and bag items according to the guest's preferences.  Sometimes, items would ring up incorrectly, for example, if the sale price wasn't ringing up, I would change it for the customer.  I got a 15 minute break every two hours, and a 30 minute break if my shift was five hours or longer.  I learned about how to serve customers and how to interact with them in a pleasant way.  Management was great, one or two team leaders (managers) would supervise the front end and were happy to answer any questions we had, this helped especially during my first few days.  One day, I got a call asking if I could work that day, the manager let me choose my hours, and offered to pay me an extra hour for free. I could choose my hours that I was available each day of the week, which was really nice.  The workplace culture was great, some of the cashiers were also my age, which was nice, and a lot of the cashiers. like me, were happy to be there.  The hardest part of the job was when it got really busy, I had to work kind of fast to keep people moving.  The best part of the job was interacting with customers, and making conversation with them."

good,A typical day at work would be helping multiple customers with their concerns about their orders and such. I have learned that everyone is human and makes mistakes in their life and I have also learned people are very sweet and caring. Management was beyond caring and sweet to everyone individually. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with their needs and succeeding at the end of the day.

good,"They don’t give any hours. You only get 4-6 hours . Most of the time it’s 4 hours. A waste of time. I just quit recently because my needs are much bigger than target. My checks were 2-400 every two weeks. Sometimes it was 200 every two weeks or it was 300 bi weekly or maybe 400 if I’m lucky. It’s cute money for someone who is in high school and want to buy your own school clothes or if u just need quick money, or gas money and you’re a college student and just need a lil something. 3 hundred every two weeks is cute but i need MONEY I HAVE BILLS. Plus taking disrespect from customers every day for the little amount of money I was making was just NOT WORTH IT. I’ll never take anyone’s disrespect. That’s y I quit and got hired at another job that pays more."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the team members at the front of the store. The were very few problems that I had with Target, the managers were very helpful and considerate, and when the floor managers were busy assisting other customers the team members were more than willing to lend me some assistance. The hours were very flexible and plentiful which  played to me satisfaction. I had a great time as a seasonal employee at Target and will definitely return for a permanent position."

good,"I had many jobs throughout college. Target was my favorite. My managers were amazing and so were my coworkers. Always worked with my hectic school schedule. Living in an area where the minimum wage is only $7.25, Target is a great place to work. I worked in a specialty area where we always got plenty of hours. Very easy to switch days with coworkers and very easy to pick up shifts once you get training in other departments throughout the store. During college, I averaged 30 hours after picking shifts up. I highly recommend working here and they always give us free snacks and food (a big plus for us college students.)"

The people I worked with were awesome. I had a very healthy and fun relationship with everyone. Workplace culture is perfect! I learned how to work the register, sign people up for Red Cards, organize my register, request change through the system. I learned how to return and exchange through the computer. I learned to problem solve and deal with aggravated guests. I learned how to lead a team to success! The hardest part of this job was probably closing. It comes with a lot of responsibility as a supervisor. Closing each register, including the self check outs. Making sure all money is accounted for and put in the safe. Making sure guest service and electronics registers are closed. I cannot say I enjoyed one thing because I enjoyed all of the responsibilities and daily requirements of completing my job.

I will always cherish the memories I made and the relationships I have made with employees and my guests."

good,"Typical day at Target is normally pretty easy. In my department, I do my price changes, then I pull my auto pull and work it to the floor, and then after that is completed, I work on my freight that came in the night before. As I work my freight to the floor I zone the area and make it look presentable so the guests do not have a problem finding what they're looking for. I also assist guests in finding what they are looking for. It helps that I do all my shopping at Target so I have a basic idea of where things are elsewhere on the floor and not just in my department."

My managers were fair and were willing to help when asked. The hardest part of working at Target is keeping your energy up, especiall for closing shifts. It can be easy to get distracted or winded.

good,"A typical day at work during an 8 hour shift I start by reaching out to my L.O.D. and team up with them to see my tasks for the day. Normally my shift on a Saturday would be from 1:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. I would have to start on working out pulls from the back and work them out to the sales floor while engaging with guests and answering phone calls and questions as they come. Around 4-5 p.m. we would start on our zones, mine typically being the home department. I have learned a lot from being a team member at Target. I've learned some leadership skills, how to work smarter not harder, and overall that the workplace can still be fun while getting things done. The management at Target is the best experience I have had with management by far. They care and show pride in all sales floor members. Every team member has their own sense of skills and talents that they bring to the floor every single day, and makes it even better when our leaders show daily recognition to us and take in pride in their teams. The hardest part of my job is not being able to do everything at once. I love being busy and I love the feeling of accomplishment, which makes working at Target 10 times better for me.

I'm told not all stores are like this, however, but the management there was less comprised of bosses and more so of a team that wanted to see their people succeed.  We could talk to them and discuss our qualms, suggest a plan of action, or ask for a second opinion.

I can never thank them enough for their diligence, it helped me to become a better man."

Management is very attentive to its employees. The culture is an easy going one, no drama between employees or management. Hardest part is being able to help solve situations that are out of our control because it feels as if we letting our customer down when in reality we have little to no alternatives to help them get their items of choice.

It can also be an excellent time to boost employee empowerment. However, review time can also present a number of challenges.

good,"I worked here as a seasonal employee on powered equipment using a Crown man up piece of equipment. The hours were hard to meet, and at the time my vehicle could not keep up with the distance that I had to travel. This by far was the best job in 12 years that I've ever worked at. The management was stellar, the employee base was warm and welcoming top down, and the pay that you received was so great that it provided for a full home of children with growth available as well. The only reason I was not kept on is that my vehicle broke down during winter, and I physically could not make it to work. My car spun out one day due to bad maintenance and I was almost killed trying to just go in/come home. After several near death experiences I finally let go of the job, and hours reduced due to their slow period so I was eventually let go. This is the only place I had ever tried so hard to the point of almost dying to make it into."

good,"The days went by quickly. I liked how collaborative the team members were, teamwork really made the dreamwork. They gave us a pretty cool discount and it was an enjoyable experience."
good,"I had amazing and equally awful coworkers. The people that pulled their own weight made everything go so much smoother and team work was key. However, you had just as many people there that seemingly did everything in their power to screw all of that up at every given moment as though it was pure malice on their part. Management had about the same ratio of great and bad workers. Depending on how good you are in general with people determined how well you did with customers. More than once I talked an angry customer into being sweet as could be. About a 5th of the time however you had a nearly insane person to deal with. Just typical life. It all depends on whom you work with really."
good,"Everyday working at Target was filled with good communication & representating the company with a friendly smile. There was a strong ,reliable, united team which made working there comforting"

good,"Working at Target was admirable.  The management is passionate about keeping the company in outstanding.  In addition, there are a lot of opportunities for career growth."
good,Target is a gateway to any job afterwards. I say this because Target is a very successful company and it is always busy so we are constantly on our feet helping any guest with questions. Working with teams is crucial but you make the best friends ever. I think the hardest part of this job was not enough hours sometimes that made us worry about our daily lives outside of work. Overall this job is a great retail experience with new openings and a fun place to work.

good,Enjoyed my time there.  Great job right out of college to learn management and skills needed to be successful.  Great people to work with for the most part.  Upper management needs a lot of work on being human and better to people.  They create insensitive people at the upper level.

Everything at Target was very enjoyable, especially the atmosphere in the store and among my co-workers."
good,"Typical day at Target, walking into the store early but the store is always in motion. Happy employees happy costumers. I've learned that giving good costumer service makes your job experience a lot better. Management is good just not when people call out and there is no one found to cover the shifts, low staff. The hardest part of my job as a sales-floor associate was restocking the clothing racks with the right clothing and making sure they are in the correct place, other then that the job as a sales-floor associate is easy. Helping Target costumers find what they are looking for so that shopping at Target is not a hassle."

good,"Working at Target taught me a lot about more than just working in a department store setting. One of the biggest things I took away from working at Target was that I learned the importance of team effort and executing tasks with the help of others that are around you. I always have been a very solo kind of guy, but whenever I worked there that all changed and I actually became more dependent on working in a team setting. My favorite thing about target was that everyone there always treated each other with the same amount of respect that they were given. There was not a single person I remember that would give me the lack of attention just because I was new to the team and if I give respect and attention to my fellow co-workers I would get it right back. The hardest part of the job had to be learning so many tasks at once and how to operate so many different parts of the job."

Management wise they are very willing to help you or anyone that's in need of help . They get out on the floor and help when its really busy . The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer's that are not making it easy for you . When you are trying to help them the best you know how to .

Being productive and punctual is also a must. Interview is basically based on how much you stand out as a person. If you plan on applying, make sure to show manners, review about the company, ask what they expect from the company, tell them times where you had to work with a difficult person and how you resolved it. The interview could be a little stressful, but keep in mind they were interested in you, so make  sure to reciprocate that same interest."

Checking all the cameras to make sure they were working and unobstructed, then walking the floor, particularly the high risk areas. I learned a lot about the types of theft that occurs in the retail world and the best ways to deter said theft. My department manager was amazing, but left shortly before I did and they eventually allowed me to move to another department as I had a conflict of interest with the new manager (we had dated previously).  The hardest part of the job was confronting suspects, because you couldn't know if they were going to be violent. The most enjoyable part for me was when we would walk the floor in plain clothes during peak seasons and hours to monitor suspicious behavior."

The managers are cool they reward you with things when you meet goal for the company and they make you feel apart of a team instead of just a individual working for pay. i would say the hardest thing that i went through at work was standing for a long period of time and then had to rule out the pain with a smile to every customer.

good,"There's not 1 bad thing I can name about this Company / Location. This is from my personal experience (years ago). They were so diverse! They did not care nor judge you if you had tattoos, dreads, piercings, etc... As long as you still looked professional and represented the Target Brand / Company properly, they could care less about those things that most companies stress about. You were encouraged to be yourself, drive sales, get customers to engage into the Cartwheel / Savings & Apply for the Red Card but most importantly, give them the best experience possible by proving them with great customer service, make their checkout as fast as possible & thank them for their business. "
good,Working at Target for me has been an amazing experience! I started as just a salesfloor employee and then transitioned to electronics and then to A cashier supervisor. My managers have been always helping me to improve my skills especially my communication skills. they also have helped me work on my confidence. They have helped me develop my management skills. the only bad thing is the lack of hours depending on the season.

We usually had runners stock them throughout the store, but on occasion I would have to go out and do it myself. The other team members were willing to help me in any way possible to help excel my skills. I would say the hardest part of the job would be the constant lifting if you aren't prepared for it.

You're there to be a guide for the guest; many ask where items are located and ask if they need help lifting a heavy item.

Our pharmacy team worked extremely well together to cover each other's time off and make every day manageable, no matter the daily workload.  Hardest part of the job was guests that expected their rxs in 15 minutes every time and also wanted us to ring up their whole cartload!  Most enjoyable part was the friendships made with the guests over the years- watching the kids grow up and be a meaningful part of their medical history. (ie- helping mom and dad deal with a lice outbreak, helping a grandma seek a doctor for a suspicion (and confirmation by Dr!) of shingles, helping a husband manage his diabetes, etc).  The guests made it all worthwhile!"

I would say one of the hardest things for me to learn was how to locate items on the equipment knowing which number belonged where, One of the other things i think i struggled more was to get out of my comfort area.

I am trusted to use heavy machinery, computers, and other electronic devices. I am often asked to stay late for my shifts, to come in early, or to come in on days off, which can be hard, but it shows that Target pays attention to hard workers. I have been asked to cross train in at least 4 separate areas of the store, which show that Target will do what it takes to empower their employees, and give them hours."

good,"Its hard to tell what a typical workday is at target, meaning one day i could come in and my job will be nice and easy. Other days it can or will be quite stress full depending on what time of day it is or what month of the year it is. The most stress full days I have encountered were around December. The end of the year is a stress full month because the store is jam packed and everyone is in a rush to get all there needs or wants done. How i coped with the stress was maintaining a positive attitude and thinking of the nice paychecks i would be receiving because of the hours I were getting during that month. The main things I learned while working at my Job that stood out to me were how much more i became respectful to our Guests and not only that my Co workers. I enjoy working with my Co workers there very nice and not lazy. They believe in teamwork which i feel is a strong connection any team should have in a Job. The hardest part of my Job is when I have other Co workers and or higher ups asking me to do several tasks at once. Even though it can be very frustrating I still do my best to meet every ones needs. The best part of my job that I like is we are all a team and everybody helps everybody, not only with just our job it can also be if someone is having a bad day and needs someone to talk to and I appreciate that a lot. This is how i feel about my Job working at Target"
good,It was a great place to work and everyone was nice and great to work with. I was sad to leave when I did. Getting to know guests at the register was so rewarding.

I learned different ways to fold clothes and jeans, which way hangers go on clothing, and how to keep guest happy. The management is incredible, they don't give me a hard time even when things are stressful, they always show a positive attitude, and they care about me and my personal activities. My co-workers are awesome as well, they are easy to talk to and make the job fun. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all of your tasks accomplished in such a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be conversing and helping customers find what they need!"
good,"Working at the target in the Pheasant Lane Mall was a wonderful experience. The workers there are really friendly and will happy to help out their team members or guest. At our target we make sure to keep the environment healthy. As working as a retail sales floor team member, it could be a little difficult. But it's always great to challenge yourself. I believe harder work makes you stronger. A typical day at work is mostly multitasking. Everyday there's always a task to be done. On the other hand its almost my responsibility to look out for the store, help guest that look lost, or even back up on registers if cashiers were needed some help. My experience working at target is enjoyable."

This is a very unstable, gossip filling, unorganized workplace. Target also pays poorly and over work you. When hired they will tell you that you get mandatory 25-30hrs a week, reality that's only the first week after that your hours will be cut to two or one day a week with 4hr shift for $7.50-$8.50 a hour. No annual raises. I worked for this company for two years."

good,"A day at Target included working in the backroom, taking items out and stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was allowing to have two fifteen minute breaks during a 8 hour shift. The hardest part of the job was working abandons that would typically take quite some time to finish. All of my co-workers were hard dedicated workers who always stayed focused on task. What I learned from working at retail/Target was guest satisfaction is always number one. And when you're guest is happy and satisfied they will be willing to always come back for an even more enjoyable experience."
good,"great place "
good,I had a great overnight supervisor and enjoyed working with the other team members. target helped pay for my college education and introduced me to become a volunteer for big brothers big sisters

good,Everyday there would be something else that would crop up.  My co-workers were nice to work with and we all got a long and supported each other.  My manager was always will  to talk to us if we needed to talk.  The hardest part of my job was not really being able to see what the Client(Customer) sees so I can not see what is truly going wrong.

good,Great customer service.  Wonderful co-workers who are always willing to help.  Upper management is good but the newly promoted lower management can be difficult. Selling the Red Card is very trying.  Great guest and wonderful co-workers.
good,A good place for someone first job good hours during the holiday season. I learned that it is okay to trust who you work with.
good,"A typical day at work would start out with letting you team leader know you are clocking in.  They would usually give you an objective to complete for the day; whether that be working on reshop/z-racks, or zone certain areas.  I quickly learned that always being on your toes is key; especially during the busier seasons like Christmas time.  You'll be helping customers on one side of the store, and called up to cashier the next.  Management was extremely friendly, although intimidating at times.  The opportunity to make friends with co-workers definitely made time go by faster.  The hardest part of the job would probably be becoming familiar with certain terms and routines your job entails.  We all obviously want to do a good job, but confusing a CAFF cart with a Reshop cart can possibly put you in some hot water.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that it went by really fast.  One minute I'm zoning Active-wear and the next minute, I'm about to hit my 5th hour, and I have to take my lunch.  Overall experience was a fantastic one; super glad it was my first job experience."
good,Target is a very busy store.  I work guest service and its really fast pace and multitasking.  We call each other team member because we all seem to work together as one.

I learned alot how to use and manage coupons, how to count change & money, remebering numbers on fruit, i also learned how to work the computer you have to have lots and plenty of experience with microsft excel and word. The hardest part of the job was dealing with hard and complicated customers i had to learn to stay calm and positive most of the time but i got the job done and at the end of the day i left customers smiling and walking out the door with positive vibes about target. The most enjoyable part was when we were busy that made time go by alot faster and things went constant and very well for the most part i enjoyed it and we got free food every other day at the job."

good,"I worked the Starbucks located inside the Target. I would make the coffee and serve it to guests, along with suggesting coffee products.

good,"I absolutely love working for this company.  I would continue to work here if the store was not closing.  This company gave me the direction I needed to be a better person.

I usually would start my day doing go-backs while also zoning aisles and answering guests' questions and calls and backing up cashier. My co-workers were great, but I would spend half of my shifts there working alone since they would have us work different departments at once. My bosses were also very vocal and clear about what they wanted us to do and what they expected from us, which I feel was really helpful. I don't feel that there was anything difficult about the job, I think at first I would feel like things seemed hard but I would catch on quickly.

I believe they should focus a little more on employees and not just their managers for each department. while the employees worked their bottoms off and gave all they had even while sick.

good,I'm a team player as well as working alone. Most enjoyable part of my day at work is making the customers feel welcomed and just their overall experience great. The hardest part I have found in some of my prior jobs is when one person does all the work and everyone else takes their job too easy just being lazy about their jobs. Now in terms of management their were some managers I have worked with strictly by the book almost impossible people to work with then I worked with other managers whom were so easy going that they worked with you and not against you.
good,"I have always and still do love working at Target. I started working at my store before it opened to the public and have enjoyed working their ever since. I am fortunate enough to work with the best team members ever and an amazing management team that have truly become a second family to me.

good,"A typical day at work starts with me making sure the money is in order for my guest service for change request. Then I print out my schedule for the day and open up the café. Compliance is huge with Target so I make sure all my employees up at the front end breaks and meals are received at a reasonable amount time before six hours into their shift. I make sure my lanes and self-checkout have the right amount of product to sell to our guest and drive maximum last minute sales which are huge to major retailers like target. I partner with my superiors and equals alike if I have multiple task to do and not enough hands to do them to make sure all my deadlines are met and I don't fall behind in my workload. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all the guest out the store in a reasonable amount of time when I have to manage three areas at once and lose coverage throughout our peek hours and don't have enough cashiers to get the job done, that's when its time to improvise and find creative ways of directing traffic and not lose efficiency at the front end.

The most enjoyable part was seeing teens, young adults, and even older people enjoy their newly bought electronic devices."
good,"It was an excellent place to work. Management ability and tratment was very good. Employees were treated very well. Work loads were comfortable. Payment was all on time. When they closed down we were given ample notice time and pay. We were well trained in all the related depatments.I worked in different departments like flow, soft lines and also on cash. Team leads supported me a lot. I was able to learn a lot of new skills. We were given immediate recognition by the leader of the day as well as team leads. I have a good collection of these written recognitions. I cannot specifically say what the hardest part was as i was allowed to do what i can do well. In all it was a very pleasant experience which i will remember all my life. I enjoyed working in cash registers. I was able to meet a lot of people. I was able to improve my customer skills."
good,"i've learned about stock and how stores operate at closing hours. the management was good alway listened to anyones concern. co-workers were awesome they know how to make you feel welcomed and always lend a helping hand. the hardest part i would say is doing the toy section by your self. i enjoyed going to work and working wit people who are fun to work with, there was never a dull moment."

good,Calls to all union workers about up coming events. I learned to patch calls to the president. Management was very helpful with certain calls that may have brought a challenge.

good,"Find the proper equipment, enter into my task list, scan for out-of-stock product. Set some revisions in assigned departments while maintaining an organized section for scanning.  Put up PTM labels and headers in each department. Constantly check guest orders and retrieve them in a timely manner.

The management can be rude at times, but for the most part their great. Co- workers are the best part of the job they are so nice and all are willing to help.

good,this was a Seasonal Job I had a lot of fun here I used a pricing gun to see where things went on the shelf and etc I got to work with electronics
good,"Working for Target as a cashier seems like it would be a simple job, but the level of responsibility they give to their cashiers is tremendous. I was not only responsible for my station, but for the appearance of the front of the store. Once my responsibilities were taken care of, I would work with and handle customers' transactions. There were times when I would work a full eight-hour shift, and be completely ignored by the managers. When it was time for me to take my lunch, I was unable to flag down a manager to alert them of my time to take a break or a lunch. I understand it was my responsibility, but the unavailability of the managers was frustrating. My co-workers were friendly, and the culture diverse. However, some co-workers were competitive for numbers of red cards sold. The hardest part of this job was having to pick up the slack of the managers, co-workers, and cleaning up after customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Meeting new people and getting to know them in the short period of time they passed through my lane was great."

good,Good place to work.  Fun environment.  No negative from coworkers and boss.  Most enjoyable part of the day was making everything in order.
good,"A typical day at work at Target would have been, showing up for work a half hour early. Clocking in, and heading off to your work station. Whomever decided to work with you, was who you were working with. Working a 12 hour shift can be on going, but not with the right coworkers, communucating with coworkers, helps you get your work done and if you'd have question they'd be more than happy to help. The hardest part was sometimes, the 12 hour shift seemed endless, and the breaks went by too quickly. I enjoyed how nice my coworkers were and how they always would put out a helping hand, best warehouse to work for, in my eyes. I have learned a lot from target, it being my first warehouse job, will make it easier to get another warehouse job and I'll know what I'm doing."

good,Always moving around on the sales floor. I loved to interact with the guest and help others. My supervisor was like a father figure to me. I like to work the camera system and solve cases and incidents. the hardest part was not being able to help someone.

good,"I was a warehouse/Supervisor at Target."
good,good job and great company. you are instructed to work quickly and accurately. their feedback system really tells you how you are doing as an employee
good,"Awesome company, has ample opportunity to learn and explore."
good,"A typical day at Target would target off would my team and I checking our equipment which is know as a PDA. This machine allows backroom workers to maintain an organize stock room. we are about to back stock and pull items. I learned about caffs which are items that need to be pulled to refill the sale floors. During my time at Target I was about to expand to other departments such as electronics, hard lines, push, HR, and even cashier. The management at Target could have bee differently. I love working with my co-workers. They are friendly and are hard workers. Even though Target was an amazing place to work at there were some hard parts. The hardest part in my day was 12pm because they caffs were really long to pull. The irony this was my favorite part as will because my team had to work together to finish the caffs and it was a great feeling to finish it. I"
good,I think this was a overall great experience and that I felt like I wasn't being judge and everyone was so friendly. I can come in and feel welcome by everyone. The guest were sweet and kind because that's the vibe you want to give them. The elder would laugh when I would ask them for their IDs to ring up alcohol.
good,Target is a good place. The management is good there are always there to help the hour associates with task and coach trained them so they can get head in the company
good,"Multitasking, communications with different departments, General office,"

good,This was one of the best places I have  worked at.  You were treated with respect . I loved going to work every day.  Enjoyed my time there with all my co-workers.  We were like family.
good,My co-workers were friendly and upbeat people. I learned returns and go backs. I worked with unhappy guest and turned them into happy guests. I enjoyed working with people and making a small relationship with them
good,"Everyday at work ill be on the register greeting guest and scanning items. Helping guest when they have a question and maintaining a positive professional attitude."
good,"I love coming into work knowing that I will be able to impact someone in a positive way. Whether it's helping a guest find a product or helping a fellow team member accomplish a difficult task, knowing I am helping someone is very rewarding."
good,"pleasant people to work with, flexible schedule. great organization."
good,A typical day involves organizing tasks for the team and controlling inventory in everyway possible.  I manage a team of 85 store team members having them work in a safe and efficient manner while controlling both external and internal theft.  The communication with the team and other management team members are great to work with on a regular basis.  The hardest part of the job is doing internal investigations of team members and management team members by reviewing daily cash reports and point of sale.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team to accomplish goals that have been set forward.
good,I loved the work place and most of the people that worked there.
good,"This job involves constant interaction and communication with the public. I was promoted the the pharmacy department, where I assisted guests and maintained orderly filing of prescriptions. I found working in the pharmacy department to be the most enjoyable aspect of this job. The hardest part of this job was working around my schooling."
good,"working fast with PDA, concictencey non stop work, overnight 9 to 6am"
good,"I learned how to communication with guests everyday and help them much as I can. I work so hard and finish the required of the day. I enjoy myself at this position job at Target. All team members are team work, there is no ""I""."

good,"everything's great, great team, great efforts, great management"
good,A lot of people have their issues working for a corporate stores but I just think those people complain too much. I enjoyed my time at Target and will continue as long I have the opportunity to work for a Target. Yes it can be difficult but that life so have fun while you can.
good,Coworkers were always upbeat and friendly. The management was flexible and understanding with scheduling. It was my first time working retail so I learned how to deal more with the public and how to run a register.
good,Great for a first job. The supervisors take their time to make sure you know how to perform any task that is assigned to you. At times it is fast paced. Professionalism is one of many key focuses. Another key focus is team work.
good,"great store to work at"
good,Target is a great place to work. The atmosphere is one that is inviting and caring. I learned so much about the company and it's culture in my time there so far. My co-workers are amazing. Everybody cares about each other everyday. The company cares about it's Team Members.
good,"Maintained a great relationship with everyone, employees as well as guests, was easy to always have a smile on your face. I learned how to do presentation in which was hard at first but then became a very fun job."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with walking for an LOD (Leader on Duty) to see what tasks are priority and need to be done. Tasks can range from jumping on cash to assist the front end, or doing reshop (putting items back on the shelf that guests have returned) or stocking shelves with pulls from the backroom. Retail has defiantly thought me greater patience when dealing with situations. The hardest part of my job is defiantly the number of hours that i receive not many 4h/week). The best part of working at target is defiantly the team member environment, everyone is very friendly."
good,Target is a productive work place. Where you can have fun and yet work hard.
good,"Friendly people, good atmosphere. Normal work load. Any job with this title is going to have the same expectations. Good stuff Target."
good,"great environment"
good,"I started working here in March and I have enjoyed it ever since. The work I do is easy. Anyone can do it. It can be a bit physically demanding at times. My managers and coworkers are nice people and everyone is polite and professional. The team warms up to newcomers quickly, one just has to be outspoken and humorous -- we get along with those types the most. The 15 and 30 minute breaks are sufficient enough. I'd say the only bad part of this job is the uncertainty of how many hours you get each week. One week you can have 20 plus 30 plus hours, next week you can get less than 10."
good,"Mornings started off great, my co-workers helped me learned the objectives and fast ways to accomplish them correctly.  There wasn't a hard part of the job, everything was very easy-going.  The most enjoyable part of the job is actually interacting with the guests and helping them with their needs."
good,"Greet and assist customers in identifying, locating and purchasing merchandise in a department store environment, Answer customers’ questions concerning, prices, availability and uses of merchandise, cashier, Set up advertising displays and arrange merchandise on counters and tables to promote sales, Stock shelves, counters, and tables with merchandise and stamp, mark, and tag prices on merchandise."
good,A typical day at Target varies with the changing business.  I learned how to be a team player and thinking strategically.  The business needs dictated what needed to be done.  Sometimes the hardest part of the job was deciding what was the biggest opportunity and how you are to get it done.  I learned that sticking with the decision that you made and if it was not the right decision what did you learn from it and how to avoid it in the future.  Working with the team at the store is one of the most enjoyable parts of the job and helping a guest locate the item that they were looking for when they came into the store.  In a sense you are helping to make memories for those guest!!
good,"The service provided by myself, or anyone else was always super friendly, and fun. Working with the employees, and the shoppers was always a good time. Being able to work efficiently and put a smile on someone's face at the same time always made my day."
good,I've worked for this company for a year now & all I can say is that its great! The employees all work together well like a family. The work is  fast paced around the holiday season and can be a little chaotic but if one is confident enough in their ability to provide excellent service working here is a breeze. I highly recommend trying Target to experience the atmosphere because there's great opportunity for the ones that put themselves out there and show that they want to grow with the company.
good,learning how to become a cashier then transferred over to customer service desk
good,"O would come into work at 10:00 p.m., and we would start unloading the truck, and then we would load the pallets, and pull them to the areas where they belonged.  We would take our first break at 12:00 a.m. this was a 15 minute break then it was back to work which we would start putting up the stock, and rotating the older items with the newer items.  At 2:00 a.m.  this was our lunch break after that it was back to work, and we would finish putting up all of the stock.  If there was any stock left we put it  up in the back room on the helves.  We would start to break down boxes, and zone .  At around 5:00 a.m. we would take our last 15 minute break.  After this we would have to finish our jobs breaking down boxes, trying trash, an someone was Always's put in charge  of the  Trash compacted they would  dispose of  crushing boxes, and disposing of all of he trash.   We would help each other finish our departments, and se would be down, and out of Target by 7:00 A.M. . no later then 8:00 A.M."
good,This place is a great place to work and full of chances to move up within the company.
good,"Working at Target is a great opportunity for work. For me, my days consist of unloading trucks and stocking the merchandise so that guests can come in to the store and get exactly what they need. My co-workers are an amazing group to work with, especially when we recognize each other for the hard work that we do. I've learned a lot about the process of stocking the merchandise and all of the little things that matter, such as putting food with the closest dates n front and food with the furthest dates in the back. Everything is well organized and I am very satisfied by the end of each shift."
good,Target was an excellent job. Great co-workers. Great Atmosphere. Training was good. Great first job to have. The guest were sometimes rude but they teach you how to handle each situation. I love my team. I learned a lot and we all helped one another. Going to work was the best part of my day.

good,"A very fast pace environment, but very enjoyable. The work environment is always positive and great. Managers are a pleasure to work with and are very flexible."
good,A typical day at work is always busy and fast. What you learn is that every customer are there for different things. The management is very orderly and tight. The co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is having to get all the work finish before the store closes so there wont be so much work after the store closes. The enjoyable part of the job is that even though its busy during all work hours you can always have fun because of all customers and employees making the day go by faster.
good,"Making sure your equipment is work properly in order to help the guest. Treat the guest as if they were you and you needed to get that product so do everything you can to help them. Remember to treat your employees equal, because they are the ones that help you when your boss comes to you. Even though you are on your feet all day try and make the guest feel good about their experience at your store.Keep merchandise on store shelves looking good and also help answer and question that a guest may have; work at the guest service desk helping guest with questions or returns at the jewelry and electronics counters.

The management is a little hectic, sometimes it seems they dont have a clue as to what is going on, but they are fun. My co workers are incredibly helpful. The hardest part of the job, was the training. They didnt really have anyone to help me. They kind of just fed me to the wolves, 3 days before black friday. Also, they dont give enough hours to actually live. I enjoy the fast paced environment and working with customers the most."

good,"Work Hard and Fast but have fun. The shift that I work is the 4am stocking shift. We have fun, are allowed to listen to music and have conversation, as long as the work is getting done. Luckily, my store is always getting the work done on time because we have been to other stores to help them out and they are not allowed the same privileges that we are at my store. So I guess the target experience varies from store to store."

good,"Target was one of my favorite jobs, however i just didn't like when i would be on break and and have mangers talking to me about other managers in a bad way"
good,"A typical day at work was never short of things to do. You're always kept busy, and on your toes. The store was often busy, mostly during the weekend, and also on friday nights. Being so busy the time went by fast even on longer shifts. We were graded on how fast we could check out the customers with a computer system, so we had to keep up a fast pace so our scores wouldn't go down. This also included packing up the customers shopping for them, so that they don't have to go to the trouble of doing it themselves. Whenever it did go quiet we were told to tidy up any shelves or stands nearby, and clean the till belts to make them more presentable for the next customer. Most days included taking different types of payments. Also including WIC, and filling out a bussiness form for certain charities customers would buy merchandise for. At the end of the day our team leader would sometimes ask us to help tidy up, and re stock any empty shelves for the next day."
good,"I was never in love with the idea to unload product, but it was a job nonetheless. I used a RF Scanner some times and I has a hand radio which was cool but I was paid 9 dollars an hour. The break room was nice we, ""as a team, `celebrated holidays`"" but it was unprofessional to say the least."" The management chose favorites and I never had my fair share of hours, I worked my butt off but I guess it wasn't meant to be. The job to me was easy but I just wasn't getting paid enough and there was a lack of pay so all around it was not worth my effort."
good,Target was a great place to work. I started off here and even though im under another company im still a target associate. I love target and it taught me many things from cashier all the way to becoming a leader. i enjoyed my time here and im glad I started off here.

I have to find a way to motivate my team to have the guess sign up for one. Everyday I go to work I come up with ideas like games that I can do to have with the team to get them excited to work and be there. One thing I love to do with my team is role play pretending I'm the guess and seeing how they would ask me. With doing that I feel like they would be more comfortable talking to a guess about it. The most enjoyable about my job is having fun and coming up with fun games to play with the team.

good,"-target was a fun place to work at."
good,"I could have not asked for a better work environment for my first job. I found most days to be fun and for me to handle the work load that was given to me by my supervisors. I also could ask for help if the weather was too bad, if I knew I was undermanned because of too many customers being in the store or them just recognizing me for working hard in extreme conditions. A typical day would be me running around the store and the parking lot, which implies that I would be cleaning and restocking bathrooms, greeting and assisting guests, assisting the customer service desk by taking go backs and trash to the back, assisting customers with take-outs or other customer service, backing up and attending to guests as a cashier, taking trash from Starbucks and hangers from the cashier's islands to back, filling up the inside cart rack and filling up the reserve carts on the side of the store, cleaning out and restocking the janitorial cart, and cleaning any spills or messes throughout the store. I learned just how hard it is to work as a guest attendant and my job was a very important cog since I was the man who got this from point A to point B many times throughout my work day. I was placed with so many responsibilities compared to my coworkers that stocked the shelves or worked as a cashier, which at times I would work as a cashier.

I learned that Teams to come together when the Management supports the whole store to work as 1.  My co-workers were all wonderful individuals that will always remain dearly in my heart and mind.  The hardest part of my job was losing my college students that needed to go on with their studies, as well as their lives.  I really loved working with all of my co-workers.  Lastly, the hardest part of my job was to have to leave, as my husband passed away and I needed to move to be close to my children.  The most enjoyable part of my job, was to have a purpose in life, to be able to listen to the guests and look forward to seeing them every time they came into the store and greet them with kind words and a smile.  Target allowed me to be me and just enjoy working with all of the wonderful people.  "

good,A typical day at work at target is customers and sales. my co workers were helpful and generous
good,"While a lot of us think of a Sales Associate's duties are mainly at cashier desk, I think the major responsibility of a sales person is Customer Service. Beginning from a friendly greeting, inquiring about customer needs, accessibility in finding the product, offering guidance and advice, to helping them check out with the product, and not to forget to offer to open a Store Credit Line/Card is a series of experience a customer undergoes at the store. In my short time at Super Target, I am fortunate to learn these techniques and applied effectively in my later role as a Financial Service Representative. "
good,"I worked on the sales floor. The Target I worked for had great communication between all levels of management and all levels of staff. They place importance on the term ""team."" Once securing a job at Target it is pretty easy to move up, most of the time they pick in-house applicants. They offer good benefits, even for part time. They contribute to local communities and  put on functions with surrounding stores. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know co workers and the fact that you worked in the whole store so you get to meet and get to know other workers from other areas. They are also BIG about getting breaks, 2 15 minute breaks every 7.5+ hour shifts and a unpaid 30 min ""lunch"" every 6 hour shift"

good,"Clock in, Grab equipment, Start your product application on PDA and review with team members who is taking what area of the store to work out of in the backroom, pull products at the location in the backroom that your PDA tells you and the ""Asked"" amount of each product. Objective is to clear your application's product list as a group with-in every hour for the next list to generate. Must not be afraid of heights it's a very big store so for them to carry stock for the store the only option they have is to build shelves that go up very high, you are on a ladder a good 20% of your day, back-stock products that did not fit out on the sales floor to their proper locations, charge out old out dated products, work in very cold conditions for the freezers sometimes for very long amounts of time. The management is tough, smart, fast and demanding but try to understand life situations and work with you if you play you dedicate your self in return. The hardest part of my job personally was keeping everything clean and safe, they hire allot of people who don't share that same concern or are very busy, so maintaining an area to help keep stress and work flow steady was hard at times. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the backroom cleaned and finished everyday for the overnight, it was kind of (day side vs night side) to see who could finish their job better. The best part of this job is that their back room is high volume, fully functional warehouse that is easy to learn for any beginner starting in warehouse work. if you can master that backroom you are ready for bigger and"

good,"Target is a great place to work; like any other retail company, they are very focused on training and developing a great team while maintaining a great place to shop for their guests."
good,"A typical day at my previous job would be somewhat busy. On my very first day i was able to learn how to product transactions and greet the customers. after a couple of hours i was on the lane. The hardest part when i first started was voided a payment. I made a mistake first, but I learned from it. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers find what they needed and registered them for red cards. That was a plus for target."

There is always a daily routine that is followed for data entry, patient drop off, electronic doctor fills and faxes, counting, cashiering, putting the order away, placing the order for the following day, RTS's, and much more. I have learned everything I know about pharmacy from working at Target Pharmacy as well as keeping up to date with my continuing education credits. I have wonderful management and co-workers. Everyone works really well with one another, as well as with the patients. I absolutely love my job as a pharmacy technician, I like being challenged and learning about new drugs and how they work. The hardest part of my job can be insurance problems but I always manage to figure them out so that the patient can get their medications."

good,"4am shift starts off with truck unload process, then stocking the boxes from the truck. The process takes about 4 hours depending on the size of the truck. Then, proceed to my other departments im crossed trained in. The hardest part of the job is maintaining dead lines because the truck must be finished before the store opens at 8am.

good,"Employee focused. They lose the connection by using subjective rank comparison between distribution centers, and would better served to have goal each distribution and measure their achievement against their goals - I have faith they will learn and implement ""objective"" measuring to drive business, and increase moral to avoid union pushes"

Target is the reason that I pursued a career in retail. The most enjoyable part of my job was the team builds and opening new soters with the company.

good,meet the goals for the day.
good,"As an employee, you are treated fairly and management always welcomes you to talk to them about anything. As a flow team member, you open boxes and stock the shelves. The boxes have a label which tells you exactly where the item goes. It's extremely easy, but they prefer things to be done in a very fast manner. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff; in general, the faster you do something, the lower the quality of work. Thus, many employees don't do things the way they're suppose to be done. If you're a really good employee, you will fix these issues, which will make it take longer for you to complete your job. Overall, great company."
good,awesome
good,"Working for Target has taught me a lot, has improved my quality of work experience."

The co-workers are very helpful, especially when you're a rookie coming to a team of veterans. They all take you under their wings and help you become the best Target employee you can be. They're always there when you have questions or need help on certain projects assigned to you. It's probably the best team-oriented work place anyone can work at."

I assist guests by helping them find whatever product they are looking for as I am restocking the sales floor. I have learned how to mutli- task by completing a backroom assignment and assisting guest in a timely manner. I cooperate with my co workers so that we may evaluate our daily tasks so that we may be able to set an organized routine to accomplish our tasks in a timely manner. We strive to complete the job as quickly and safe as possible so that we may have room for opportunity to make improvements and updates outside of our assigned daily task. My co workers are very attentive and we commute consistently to prevent errors or accidents to establish a safe working environment. I enjoy exercising a positive attitude and receiving positive attitude from both my co workers and guests.

I then left Target to further my Education and attain a Bachelors degree in Management."

good,I worked for Target for 5 and 1/2 years. I loved every minute of it. I had never been able to say I loved my job before but I truly loved working as a pharmacy tech at Target. The pay was great with consistent raise each evaluation. Team members and team leaders are very nice and very understanding. They always pushed for the best in guest service. My hard work was always recognized. The scheduling is very flexible. They are very understanding about home life and they really bend over backwards to help you. There is always room for advancement. I learned how to handle difficult patients by having empathy and understanding that most people are just overwhelmed by having to sit at a doctor's office most of the day not feeling well and by the time they come to the pharmacy they're just ready for the day to be over. So I work fast and efficiently to make sure their needs are met in a timely manner to get them out and back home to get better. The most enjoyable part about my job was the patient interactions. I feel that I held a connection with each and every patient I encountered and just tried my best to help their day get better. I gained a lot of appreciation for my empathy with patients. The hardest part about my job was probably any insurance denials that had to be dealt with because it makes the prescription process slower and it puts added stress on the patients who are just ready for the medication so they can go home. Overall my time at Target was great. They are a great company.
good,target is an amazing place to work they are helpful and great at training. they go above and beyond to make sure you know you job and that you are doing it the right way. the atmosphere there is great. everyone is friendly and easy to talk to.

I started as a flow team member, but was taught how to audit, correct, and stock the backroom, as well as scan incomming items and entering them into the system on top of all the other duties involved with being a flow team member. I worked much more than the part time I was initially hired for, and it was a wonderful experience."
good,"Working for Target is ideal, especially if you're looking to move up within the company. Cross training is allowed as long as it's within your experience and opportunities to be trained for other departments are not frowned upon. Management treats you as part of the team and not like you are below them. They give you the praise and respect you deserve and point out your qualities and improvements without criticizing your ability to do your job. I felt happy to work for the Target company even if it was only for a short time (seasonal)."

You have nice co-workers and mean co-workers everyone, so you just have to deal with it. At Target, you'll find a lot of nice co-workers. The hardest part at Target is when customers start a argument with you.

Being friendly and nice to everyone is the biggest thing you have to do, because in the end, you'll get a good deed out of it."
