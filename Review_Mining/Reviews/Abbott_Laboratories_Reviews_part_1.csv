bad,"Management has created a culture and an overall feeling of less than with direct labor employees. This culture is felt everywhere creating low morale among employees. High demands on production rates, as long as the rates are met the supervisors receive large bonuses. This place is a place I would not recommend to anyone for employment if they are trying to find a technical career. The pay scale for an hourly employee is also far lower here as well."
bad,Finally made it into the mid 30k per year after 5 years. They make you feel like your such an asset to the company but will low ball you when merit increase comes along unless you're a suck up or always in management face you go unnoticed (college degree or not). I've pitched ideas that are still being used and got nothing for it. Not even recognized or praised by my manager. They will use you and make you feel bad for asking for a raise. Don't waste your time like I did.
bad,"Pay is very low for what we do and it is very stressful in my area pay is more at fast food and training is not clear work environment  not good we need better lighting and upgrade on Our equipment and production would improve if you treat people fair they will repay you by working together and produce a quality  part,  I  think Abbott has no loyalty  to their employees  at a"
bad,"(4) 10 hour shifts, yet constant mandatory overtime. Managers say 'just get with the program' to protect their bonuses. You are a number, here. This place is dirty for a medical production area. Restrooms are constantly destroyed by co-workers. If you request time off, you get blamed for it & typically do not receive timeoff."
bad,They were horrible they didn't treat their employees with respect nor did the supervisors treat u with respect certain sips had relations with other co workers which made the environment hostile
bad,After working there 4 years I was transferred to a new group with no notice and placed under supervisors who knew absolutely nothing about what I was doing for the company.
bad,"They are NOT a software company. Their whole model is to send the work offshore, and/or justify a visa for someone from India. The two consulting companies they use are India companies. "
bad,"Horrible place to work, specially if you are a minority. In 4 years I basically had no bonus; even though the CEO was making 40MM a year.  "
bad,"Nonstop Constant overtime "
bad,"I left Alere because the management made everyone feel like a child, always over the shoulders and not flexible with breaks and time away from the desk. Also not friendly in explaining new work that came in"
bad,There was no structure I the workplace. Management didn't know what was going on. Had sub-par training. Lead technician didn't know how to balance delegating and performing their own job duties.
bad,"Management has created a culture and an over all feeling of less then with direct labor employees. This culture is felt everywhere creating a low moral among employees. High demands on production rates, as long as the rates are met the supervisors receive large bonuses. This place is a place I would not recommend to anyone for employment if they are trying to find a technical career. The pay scale for an hourly employee is also far lowere here as well"
bad,"Abbott was probably one of the worse companies that I ever worked for. The training was horrible and rushed. They are quick to write you up and then put you on a final warning. I often times felt very de valued there. I felt like just another  warm body taking up space. Management was horrible. My manager was hardly ever in the office, she was very aloof and just a poor example of a leader, horrible!  The team leads were unprofessional. There was no room at all for advancement.  The customer service manager  was very temperamental and sneaky. This place is not a great place to work. They don't care about their employees at all. Right now they are terminating folk and outsourcing those positions to the Philippines. It is literally a revolving door there. DO NOT APPLY AT ABBOTT....DONT WAIST YOUR TIME!"
bad,"I had very stressful job and no chance for get permanent job."
bad,"Management sucks. Everything is personal. If the manager likes you, you can do whatever you want and still be a employee there. In order for them to like you you must be a rat and secretly tell on everyone. These managers and coworkers tell if you went to the restroom 2 many times. They watch everything you do and say just to tell the manager. The pay sucks when your not liked, we are very underpaid compared to other Abbott employees but only the manager pets get paid the big bucks and they get the schedule they want. The turn over rate is very bad because of all these reasons. There is more to tell but that would take 2 days. Promotions, salary, and schedules are all based on if the manager likes you or not. This is at the Gretna Louisiana location only."
bad,"Coworkers very welcoming and inclusive, but management does not know what they are doing.  Excessive and ineffectual manager scheduled meetings severely impede productivity and then management faults workers for lost productivity.  Excessive and repetitive manager assigned training does the same to productivity.  Was required to complete over 150 WI/SOP self-led trainings within the 1st month but was not allowed time to do so, was rebuked for not exceceding full workload while completing all the additional trainings (I completed all assigned work on time and per schedule while completing the trainings at the same time, but I was rebuked because I did not perform ""extra"" during the training period).  Loud 'bro' culture in neighboring departments (complete with mini-basketball games over and across cubicles) are a distraction.  I had an hourly temp position and the manager expected me to work the overtime but not report it to my temp agency because she was not cleared to approve overtime but the projects required about 60-70 hours of work per week.  She was incensed because I would not break the terms of my contract with the temp agency to do this for her.  She promised flexible hours/schedule and reneged.  Other workers always complaining about being overworked and underpaid - very negative attitude towards management in department.  Lead analyst told me she hadn't been allowed to take vacation in nearly 4 years because every time she requested time off the very next day she was either assigned a new project or to be backup on an existing project and it just happened to coincide"
bad,"Unfortunately, I had a terrible manager with this company.  She asked me to lie to customers, and she did not follow the maternity leave policy.  The expectation is to have no home life."
bad,"11 jaar gewerkt bij deze werkgever, en sfeer/mentaliteit is 100% Amerikaans waarin je als nuchtere Hollander in mee moet gaan. Ze hebben een eigen Cao gebaseerd op de zuivelcao, met die verstande dat ze alleen de dingen eruit gehaald hebben die het bedrijf het beste past. Het basisloon lijkt leuk, maar in de onregelmatigheidstoeslag is ook je vakantiegeld/13e maand etc verwerkt zodat het onderaan de streep behoorlijk tegenvalt. Momenteel ben ik al weer een aantal jaren werkzaam in een bedrijf die wel onder de zuivelcao valt, en dat is echt een verademing."
bad,"What can you expect when Talent Acquisition is base in india?"
bad,"Imagine your greatest fear. Now, multiply that by 10. That's what working for this company is like. Extremely poor management, very terrible pay, severely understaffed, incredibly overworked, definitely undervalued. Each day, you lose a massive chunk of your soul especially if you're put in the wrong dept. (i.e. accessioning)"
bad,"I came into Abbott ready to work and gave it my all. Coworkers were amazing but that was about it. Abbott's training was thorough and they did not just throw you out on the floor. They made sure to take time to teach you. HOWEVER, management was trash. They had favorites and gave special treatment to certain individuals. I was a top performer for almost 6 months in a row and gave it my all to only still be fired for the lack of communication from my manager. I emailed several of my managers about my vacation months in advance they approved it. They said since my PTO was short I just would not get paid for it. I did not care about that. I came back to multiple write ups and my manager saying, ""oh no one told you you get a write up for each day you are gone when you are short pto?"" Most call centers just dont pay you this company only care about you working nothing else. My trainer attempted to fight for me but since my manager did not back him up I lost my job. You are under paid and they are short staffed in the Client Services Department so you are taking a TON of calls for only 15 an hour 16.50 if you are on the evening shift. I went home drained and irritated. I was relieved to get fired from that place it is TOXIC PLEASE DONT WORK HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!"
bad,they had a cafeteria was alright because someone from there threw away my original lunch so much diversity in that place its like being in high school again
bad,This Job was horrible. The company is doing lay offs every year and doesn't give a heads notice.  You could be a valuable employee and they don't care about value. Not worth  working there.
bad,The supervisors are lazy and are not willing to help. The upper management show favoritism towards certain supervisors so there is no where to go if yo have a complaint.
bad,"Daily heads-down coding of SQL solutions"
bad,I worked almost 2 years but not permanent as a temp. I tried to get permanent but they are not good to listen me or any person What ever they think they do. i was a hard  & honest worker. I was sick one time and i asked for permanent job because for the medical insurance but they never listen to me.
bad,"Dirty and If they don't like you, you will be terminated in one week, lead and operator didn't even follow the procedure, I remember when I cleaned up the rusted conveyor it takes me 2 days per line, approximately 8 manual lines back then I'm not sure now.. can i put negative -10 Star -☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆"
bad,"Nice people, lots of turnover. I don't think the company is even under the same management as it once was, at least not the area I worked in. It may have changed from 8 years ago."
bad,"Horrible bosses, no advancement and treat temp people really bad, too much stress and you work like robots, don’t care about you.  People treated like you don’t know what you are doing."
bad,Great place to work until the plant was closed and all operations where moved to Costa Rica.  Employee well being was very important to management.....
bad,"The  group I was in had some smart people  and some people that should not have been there .  some  did not read the SOPs  before going to calibrate equipment.   I did my best to explain the sops to those workers  but in some cases they were more interested in pushing paper. "
bad,"It was a learning experience, you are expected to pull your own weight and come prepared. Good team structures. If you have a problem, speak up, let them know what you think,"
bad,"If you like long hours in a short staffed organization, then this is the place for you. The systems used are very antiquated as well. But some people like that. Unfortunately, it delays deadlines, etc. Working in high tech most of my entire career, this is a very slow reacting environment. Wasn't for me."
bad,"I did not like working at Abbott because the lead from IBM and Abbott both had created a very stressfull environment. I will not work here again. Thanks,"
bad,I worked at Abbot for about a month in the neuromodulation division.  There wasn't much training provided and management was very disorganized. There wasn't much of a workplace culture and manager played favorites with employees. There is also no learning curve even though they don't train you properly at all.
bad,no company culture. no long term vision. very boring job and no career advancement at all. some co workers are just very negative and it makes the overall experience even worst
bad,Working at Abbott was quite an experience and it help me to gain experience in other areas of the shipping and receiving industry as it related to manufactured products.
bad,Servicio pésimo al personal. Falta de ética hacia el operador de parte de la supervisión.
bad,very stressful didn't expect to leave company this would have been a great place to retire however I received an unexpected layoff one thing I could say about the company is that they feed you.
bad,Abbott was a most unwelcoming company to work for.  They do not compensate employees properly.  There are very few American citizens there and it is hard to find someone that understands english.
bad,The only thing about this job was the pay and vacation time. That is the only thing good about this job the rest of it I will not comment on all do to the fact they dont represent families like they say they do
bad,"They laid off their IT department just to hire us, contractors for half the money."
bad,good place to work good to work. always nice staff. always. lovely plavce. good money  good staff. great staff. the best staff. easily the best staff. oohp
bad,Management has their favorites and they lay off everyone else. There is no room for advancement because everything has left for overseas and there is no more jobs for anyone else.
bad,"The Alere of Gretna, LA Accessioning department has horrible management. They are disrespectful to anyone under them and show favoritism to certain people they like. They will overwork you, underpay you, and ask you to do tasks not in your job description."
bad,"Management is awful, work is miserable, no room for advancement.  Business is immoral and at times unethical.  Co-workers were good, but there is no time to interact, so it does not really matter.  Medical notes are ignored or ""lost"".  Pay was awful for many years, now is at best average, but very low for the work they expect and the way you are treated.  If you can get another job-do it!!"
bad,Terrible to move from temp to hired. Worked as a temp for almost a year and there were no opportunities to get hired in. They were cutting jobs when I went elsewhere.
bad,"I can honestly say this was the worst job I have ever had. The pay was just ok, the benefits were awful, I told them what I wanted out of the company and what I did not like from my last job. They talked up the company like it was a wonderful place to work, so I left the current job I was in to go to Alere. I think after the first month, I knew I made a terrible mistake, they started changing every rule possible and on top of all this, they do not offer true sick time. They have what they call PTO, which was really just vacation. You had to give 48 hours advanced notice to miss, or you were wrote up, pathetic. Please reconsider if you are even thinking about going to this company."
bad,"na in this particular context there is nothing left to add but to leave this part blank.  Will add more later if applicable.  Nothing left to add, not applicable"
bad,"Working with this company is a success.There is opprotunity for advancement,excellent pay,great benefits.You learn to develop and practice great documentation skills.They are willing to work within your schedule."
bad,I didn't really enjoy my experience because the partners I worked along side with didn't show affection to their patients. I didn't get a chance to do anything hands-on I mainly watched.
bad,"Too much to do’, in too little time and a constant sense of ‘information overload’? The old ‘time management’ models are abstract, out-dated and don’t work."
bad,"The two engineers I worked with were unprofessional and all they did was argue with eachother on how to approach problem solutions."
bad,"Fun work place with great colleagues and superior"
bad,the staff was great and helpful its a great company to work for and they offer a lot of benefits for employees... Anyone would be excited to work there they pay well for customer service rep II.
bad,This was a fast paced environment which required self discipline and personal drive. With time and patience there was an ability to move up in the company and grow within the field.
bad,I worked only two days and they terminated me and that was not right. They give you no type of training. The majority of the people was not that friendly and the work environment was very noisy. I was told the assignment will last a year I really don't believe that this is one company that I will not recommend no one to work for.
bad,"Management and all the executives (with the exception to ONE person) works little to not at all. They outsource everything or hand the work to the middle management or lower management. However, none of the executives know how to do anything on their own, besides micromanage to keep you feeling worthless."
bad,Lack of direction and advancement based on who you know - not capability.
bad,This company does not provide the proper training or training materials in order for field service personnel to do their job correctly. They expect unreal hours and don't care if federal regulations are violated to get the job done. Not a good place to work.
bad,"I have met alot of great people here, this was a great company when it was Biosite but now it's officially... ALERE."
bad,Very bad culture managers in abbott are very bad non-cooperation is the key factor. They do not care for their team members.
bad,This place is constantly laying off and firing people for the most minute problems.  People are treated unfairly and the safety of people working here is compromised regularly by the engineering staff.
bad,"Most new employees are contractors and they do not give salary increases, and hire employees after you for more money, and don't care about how they treat contractors!"
bad,"To Whom This May Concern,"
bad,"This company is the worst I've ever worked for. They presented the PSA position as though it was part-time, but the truth was that it was prn but they expected you to work a consistent schedule. Then, less than six weeks after hiring me, they announced that the Cokumbus location was closing. The upper management never spoke to me when they were in the office (maybe they were embarrassed because of their unethical behavior.) Bottom line is Alere Health takes advantage of their employees. Any positive reviews I believe are not real."
bad,it was nice field  in  diagnostic department I was  covering AHS clinics + pharmacies  in AD and  alin
bad,I used to love what I do until I filed a complaint with my supervisor about a co-worker.  My work life is a living hell and my supervisor is useless like most of them there are very few that actually know what they are doing.  If you file a complaint you get the short end of it if you are injured they make your life miserable.  There is major nepotism going on here. So if you are thinking of joining this company run run really really fast and far away.
bad,Heavily micromanaged. Don't waste your license or degree here. This is a job just to pay bills not a career move!
bad,"Not a good place for contractors to work. Their managers micro manage you by standing behind you quietly, watching and listening to you and scaring the s--t out of you. They expect their employees to fix other employees mistakes which violate HIPAA laws and that is an acceptable work practice for Alere employees. 4 employees work one patient file in 4 different incorrect directions violating HIPAA rules by faxing or sending the patient's information to the wrong places and producing no results but dead documentation notes on a patient's file. This is not a professional DME PT INR provider, they specialize in unique, uneducated staff who spell ""THE"", ""HTE""."
bad,"I worked there for 18 months as a temp and my hard work was never ever recognized."
bad,There was nothing great to say about this lawfirm. It is not even worth me typing what i am now.
bad,This company is not good to work for i worked for them they do not care about there employees. They want you to work like a slave for a small amount of pay. There is nothing good about Abbott.
bad,The manager enjoyed gossiping and would pit the employees against each other. The team environment sucked. It was the worst company I worked for in my life.
bad,"I agree with everything said previously. Alere Home Monitoring in Livermore is NOT a place you should want to work. The claims department is a joke. Management likes to make up rules as they go, push you to the point of exhaustion and then sit and wonder why the whole department is going out on disability or quitting."
bad,I have been an employee at Alere for over a year and I'm so dissatisfied. Management is a joke and there is no communication at all. They will walk right pass you and not even utter a hello. They walk down the aisles yelling at you to pick up a call. They send out countless emails instead of fully training their employees and expect you to know whatever new process they decide to pull out their hat for that day. There are no talks of raises. Employees that have been there for 2+ years still haven't received a raise. There's no acknowledgment for going above and beyond your duties. Most of the people that work here love to snitch on one another. Most of the employees want out and are stuck due to the economy and job market.
bad,"Power mad, micromanaging supervisors; with this company it's quanity, NOT quality. Clients don't want to speak with you, mgrs send CONSTANT pestering emails & god forbid you take 2 minutes to ask your cube mate a question. I was well paid but Alere does NOTHING, & I mean NOTHING for their employees as far as appreciation goes. RUN, don't walk from this company!!!"
bad,"It's not a place for people with color unless you're cleaning there bathroom , taking out the garbage, cooking their food not a very friendly place I started my own business after working here"
bad,"The job itself was very interesting.  Unfortunately, though, it was met with an unpleasant culture including disrespectful managers.  Also, be prepared to work a lot of overtime, basically every weekend and evening, just to stay above water.  This is a highly micromanaged job, and there is no trust or recognition."
bad,"Abbott Clonmel- Very stressful and difficult place to work. I worked here for several years and only that it was on my front door I'd have moved within a week. Very pushy management, negativity and arrogance are rife and widely accepted as normal. I'd even say that bullying does not go unchecked and HR are nowhere to be seen."
bad,"It’s totally non professional behaviour of superiors.. even they not working for company, they working for there own extra income. They are not working for own profits. And not valuing basic workers who actually work for company profits but Compny not listing there complain."
bad,"empezar a responder los mail, desde las 9 de la mañana. reunion via skype con tus superiores. y controlar los gastos de la empresa"
bad,I worked for this company for 10 years built up good working relationships and learnt alot of good skills .When I became I'll with depression I was bullied by senior management IW and team managers JG and LH who made my job awkward for me I was then sacked for making a few mistakes This is a trend of Abbots and many people have had the same treatment which is also supported by a poor hr department people are afraid of speaking out in fear of losing there job
bad,"I'll preface this review by saying that I've heard wonderful things about other divisions at Abbott Laboratories, however, the Pediatric Nutrition Division is the one I'm reviewing. I've worked for multiple corporations and had colleagues with 20+ years experience in Corporate America, and Abbott's Pediatric Nutrition Division was the worst company any of us have ever worked for. From day 1, there was a culture of harassment and intimidation that bled from the top down. Despite multiple open cases with HR, employees were told that there's nothing HR could do for them. I've never been so degraded or verbally abused in my entire life and I have multiple colleagues that reported the same abuse. There is such a culture of fear even from employees who have been with the company for 10+ years. I was screamed at by my manager multiple times in close settings, harassed and intimated, and discriminated against for having a medical condition that caused me to take some sick days. "
bad,"I can't speak about the laboratory sites outside of Santa Rosa, CA because I did not work at them. My review is about the Santa Rosa site called Redwood Toxicology. I was a temporary employee so I got paid more than the company employees. I don't recommend working at the Santa Rosa site because they are understaffed and because of that they overwork you. I would always work 12+ hours. The most I have worked was 15 hours. Every shift is bad but the first and second shift is run a lot smoother. Graveyard shift is the worst because we aren't just understaffed with laboratory technicians, we are understaffed in every department especially the data entry department which is the most important department because we can't start our work until they are done with theirs. I would come in at 10pm and I won't start until 3:00am because I have to wait for the data entry department. In the morning shift, we were told to only do 3 batches, but I was doing 5 or 6 in the graveyard shift and management knows about this, but they do not care. Lister the manager is the worst because if you tell her about the issues that you are having, she acts like she doesn't care. I went to go talk to her about the problems on the graveyard shift, everyone warned me about her, but I did not believe them until I told her the problems we were having during the night, and she just told me that my work was easy, so I just quit. I can't believe she said our work is easy, but yet she does not want to show up during the weekend to help us out because she knows how chaotic the lab is. We have such a high turnover rate"
bad,"Abbott is not always about compliance, quality or ethical practices.  "
bad,"OK place to work apart from management , there a class apart , especially HR manager , pay is not great ,office staff think they are a different grade its nice to say hello Or thank you if someone holds the door opened"
bad,Severely lacking management. Unfair employee treatment. Biased and manipulative HR process. Poor IT system maintenance and security. Quid Pro Quo rampant.
bad,"poor culture, no upward mobility, corrupt management, no significant pay raises, expect work to consume your life.  Physicians and sales team comes first and other positions are treated poorly"
bad,"It high school all over. Violent workplace... unorganized don't have a clue what they are doing. It like working for crazy people, you will get a different answer to your question every other day."
bad,Management is horrible the managers spend so much time in regular employee's business they cant do there job.
bad,"select some amount of customers and focus on them,"
bad,"The company was a great place to work for until it became Alere and hired on alot of unfit managers, controlling VP's and controllers. The biggest problem I had was upper management. They had no respect for their employees, it was constant harassment with emails and they talk down to their employees. In my opinion, HR needs to evaluate the VP's, Controllers, Managers and Supervisors of the company. I've witnessed alot of great employees leaving the company because of that very reason."
bad,"Nurses do not tell all patients what company they actually work for. So called ""branded"" clients are insurance companies that do not want the insured patients to know who they are giving their personal health information to...very questionable practice. Management is terrible, inexperienced, and at times abusive. Patients are being sent in-home moniters and don't realize these moniters may be similar to ankle bracelets for the insurance companies. Company receives ""pharmacy benefit management"" data which tells them when and IF a patient fills prescriptions, how soon before insurance is denied for a patient who is not filling prescriptions. Insurance companies do not care if a patient has to make a choice between food and rent or paying for prescriptions."
bad,"sprawa jest już w sądzie...."
bad,"People have been leaving the company right and left, and the remaining employees are over-worked, stressed out, and unappreciated. They are treated as expendable."
bad,"Do not join if you have foreigner as your boss. HR policies are not employee friendly, no work life balance. single digit increments. Business requirements are not the priority for the organization, individual goals are important, keep business impact aside. No workshops, no outings etc."
bad,"Management is not educated, if you know some one in a higher position than you have a chance of advancement no matter how good you are and how hard you work. I was told. DONT MATTER WHAT YOU KNOW, IS WHO YOU KNOW. I have a college degree and didn't go any where only reveived harassment from 2 supervisors. No support only brings you down."
bad,I learned it is difficult to work on night shift when day shift control the department and does not communicate with night shift leaders. Night shift supervisor has been retiring for six years and left the supervisory responsabiltys to the team leaders.
bad,Horrible work environment.  Operators basic fortnightly €920 with shift rate . Bullying culture within management high turnover of staff . Massive amount of eastern Europeans who freely speak amongst themselves with no repercussions from management which causes friction.  Overtime is constantly being run on Saturdays chance to earn extra money if needed.  Long nights 4.20 to 1 am which is every second week . Monotonous work little station  rotation. Toothless hr team they will not help staff with any bullying complaints against upper management and supervisors. A  very nasty hostile environment is to be expected if u choose abbott clonmel . Also general morale is atrocious worst ive ever witnessed.extremely strict rules on holiday time . Expect not to receive a lot of time that u asked for
bad,"Si bien a nivel personal no tuve ningún problema con el laboratorio; veía situaciones que a mi entender  ya deberían ser subsanadas en un laboratorio con el nombre que lleva y siendo multinacional. Pésima organización administrativa y operativa por parte del laboratorio y planes de producción, generando complicaciones en vida diaria dentro del laboratorio"
bad,"This location is the most toxic environment you could be in. The anxiety has cause numerous people to take stress leave. They claim to be about quality and saving lives, bottom line is always money. Night shift's are invisible to managent. They treat their new employees horribly, because they've let go most senior members; some with 10, 15, 20 yrs experience,  and now hire contract employees and a fraction of the pay and ignore you. DO NOT WORK HERE IT! THEY SUCK OUT YOUR SOUL!"
bad,The workplace culture is backstabbing and no true goals.  Very little communication and no leadership.  The goals change and leadership changes the targets.
bad,No room for advancement. Low compensation and pto benefits. No communication throughout the whole building. Everybody is for self. Management talks about people and it will get back to you. Lack of spirit in the lab. The lab is backwards surprise they still have there certifications.
bad,"Over the last 2 years, the common theme around the the office is ""you never thought it could get worse but it does"".  Bringing in people from other Abbott sites to manage departments, yet they have no idea how to manage, lead or let alone understand the topic (example:production planning). The management that remains (not from other Abbott sites) have no back bone to stand up to do what is right for the employees. "
bad,"This company manages through a culture of fear and intimidation.  There is no ""dialogue.""  Or two-way communication.  It's simply, ""Do it this way or you'll get written up."" Turnover in my division has been excessive and how is that surprising? Everyone I know has either left for a better opportunity or they are currently interviewing - including myself."
bad,"Worked here for 1 year as contract employee.  Great first job out of college, but management kept changing (4 supervisors in 1 year), so it was difficult to advance projects."
bad,"This company has no morals! And HR is totally incompetent! They fire lots of people for no reason. I would not recommend to work at Abbott. One of their values is ""Caring"" - they don't care for people!"
bad,"If you are unemployed and are desperate for a job I would seriously ask you to think about working for this company. It is a large building , built with structural steel and glass, and it is within this building that the work is done. I learned that manners and common courtesy are foreign concepts amoung Irish people, and I learned that amoung factory workers there are a remarkable number of gosfords.The hardest part of the job was listening to the inane conversations about football or the filthy talk about s.. during eight hour shifts. Management were a total bunch of ticks, the most enjoyable memory of the job for me was the night a water pipe burst in the ceiling above the clean room and we all had to be sent home."
bad,no wonder it closed. management was awful we called members to force programs on them they did not want. We then would put them back in the system to call them again cause they thought they would change their mind in 3 months
bad,"Working at Alere was an experience. I got to work along side some very special types of people. First of all, the nurses all sit in the section with their noses tooted up in the air. They never speak. And when anything goes wrong, they blame the reps on the phone. And then there is upper management who worry about trying to date the reps on the phone rather than do their jobs. One of the higher ups transferred back to Atlanta from the Pompano location when he was finished running through everyone. Don't flirt with someone who the other one has their eye on, and think that you will keep your job."

bad,"*Low hourly pay compared to other manufacturing facilities!!"
bad,Terrible inhuman place. Be in the click or move on. Too much politics and back stabbing. Management is phony and inept. All mouth and no action.
bad,"This company are very tight penny pinchers. Lab staff are poorly paid here, equipment is very old and the IT is a joke!! Systems keep freezing/crashing and nothing ever seems to get done. Since the company was taken over by Alere it became more stressful, the workload increases with the same number of people and limited resources. "
bad,"Learned a lot about quality control, specifically learned about what it takes to meet certain specifications set by third parties. However, the chances of job advancement were practically nonexistent since there were too many times that hiring freezes occurred. Overall, this should be a pit stop on one's road to his/her career."
bad,"Strung along employees after taking over company. Eventually closed facility, but only ""Chicago HQ"" employees kept jobs and were transferred back. Many good people lost their jobs."

Tak się kończyła historia każdej znanej mi osoby która tam pracowała przez Adecco, niezależnie od tego jak przebiegło rozstanie."
bad,No one spoke English was hard to communicate.Got laid off with a one day notice. The job was good just not much in  Job security Learned how the test was  Assembled and set up. Do and don’t in assembling the test strips.
bad,Abbott is a terrible place to work.  One manager said he was going to suck everything that the employees had out of them.  Training was terrible and was constantly canceled.  High turn-over rate because people were treated poorly by management.  Refused to fill empty positions or to fire people that caused problems. Management then would write-up supervisors because errors were made or work wasn't completed.
bad,"As an example, I had 6 different managers from 2013-2019.  There is a re-organization of management often.  Most managers are not hired for their qualifications, but seem to be friends with current managers.  They rarely hire or promote from within.  They are driven by very poorly planned, unrealistic timelines and provide few resources to achieve these timelines"
bad,Not having personal life.Always have pressure from seniors..Also not get promotion take so many years more than 7-8.Inbetween that you missed so many good opportunities.Just seniours uses us for them .Also  ask us to put our pocket money to dump the stock in market.Need to do aduistment in money.
bad,"Employees are just cogs in the machine. It is expected that you give up personal obligations at the whims of management. Senior management is out of touch with middle management, but more importantly, the consumer. Executives would often make decisions that were directly contradictory to consumer and market data. A very frustrating experience."
bad,Management in Santa Ana behaved unethically and created a hostile work environment for most employees. The CEO while I was there was investigated for insider trading and securities fraud. They allowed people who worked there forever to behave however they wanted to because they had “put in their time”. So new people had to just ignore / excuse poor behavior.
bad,"Great and fun product to sell (new CGM).  Horrible leadership and communication between field sales and leadership is non existent.  Morale is so sad and low.  Bonuses for launching a product is the worst.  You will need a VERY large base if you want to survive.  Goal adjustments occur 6-8x's a year and after the fact (end of trimester)."
bad,If you want to find modern day slavery just come to Abbott Nutrition in Fairfield California.  Extremely long work days and up to 26 working days without a day off.  A very hostile work environment between management and the workers.  Sexism and racism is also abundant.  Management is constantly clashing with the permanent workers and the temporary workers are caught in the middle.  Management will hire people on a temp basis and the permanent workers wont train them properly and them blame it on management that they don't find good people. Constant turnover on all levels of the company.  Abbott bought this branch 10 years ago and has only made a profit one year so this place is slated for shut down. Good luck with this one just be aware you have been warned.
bad,"This site is held back by a few individuals who have been there from the beginning.  The only experience they have is with this company.  This becomes evident in the decision making process.  With time it becomes clear that they are not ready to become a world class manufacturing facility.  It is an OK place to work for a couple years but don't expect the ""plants"" to allow change, to do what's right and to be accountable.  Oh, mostly, don't expect to see any effective leadership here.  You've heard of ""The Founder's Dilemma"" but now that the founder is gone you just have clueless managers and a couple bad eggs stinking the place up.  That's some kind of dilemma, isn't it?"

bad,"compensation and respect are lacking, company denies sampling and makes the potential customer purchase evaluations materials, management never available for questions or support"
bad,A lot of egos in management and all the line leads act independently and make rules up as they go. A lot of singling out if you just want to go to work and collect your paycheck forget it
bad,"Alere was the most backstabbing work environment I've ever worked in. A lot of favoritism and negativity. They hire too many friends and relatives and they are the only ones getting promoted. The favorite people tell lies about others within the company to get ahead. It's disgraceful the way some people are treated at Alere."
bad,"Worked in PPG(""Analyst"") for about 14 months as a contractor. Was told that conversion would happen and it kept getting pushed back and pushed and pushed further. The people I worked with(other PPG analysts) were amazing coworkers, one of if not the best groups of people Ive worked with before. If you managed to be converted then the benefits and paid vacation were really good. Management was a different story. Rules changed weekly, if not daily or on some days, hour by hour, leading to miscommunication, especially when training new people. If you were placed on a project, you were typically working 10+ hour days. The turn over rate for people was incredibly high, losing AT LEAST 2 people a month basically. Don't expect recognition for staying beyond to finish something up. Expect to be doing some work from home as well. Don't expect to be converted quickly. Every single person who they terminated a contract for was told the day of by the contracting company that it was their last day and they needed to pack up. Nobody from Abbott management themselves would say anything. There was no exit interview.   They wouldn't even acknowledge it unless you bring it up yourself. It was always handled extremely unprofessionally from the Abbott management side. Hopefully that changes because its unprofessional and very rude. Treating people like people shouldn't be hard. And don't expect to have your mistakes be forgiven regardless of how much good work you've done. You weren't expected to be good, or amazing, or ok. You need to be perfect, which for humans, in an environment where communication"
bad,I was working as Device Safety/ Product Surveillance Analyst safety. I was working for few months as contactor. I had three Managers. None of them were helpful.I had difficulty to see them. They said that they were too busy.
bad,"This role is nothing but of glorified MR. Sales and Marketing has more value and respect. Some SPM reports to non medicos from sales background. no value for talent anybody can be promoted to senior level. This role is like spare part to sales representative s. In HO nobody knows u as ur always on field like MR. You are evaluated just like sales . Knowledge upgradation or skills enhancement is only for Medical advisor who are based in HO. MA has no ground reality and takes part in strategies. Some Indian pharma is better option compared to this, so do not waste your time here."

bad,"Enrollment department manager was horrible, she was not qualified for the position. Did not know how to motivate a team only criticize and threaten. Also played favorites and made it perfectly clear. Position was misrepresented, was told there was a great bonus structure when in reality it was very low and almost impossible to hit the set goals. Department was set up poorly, too many people in a small space, very hard to hear clients on phone when everyone was talking at the same time. Bad experience, glad to be gone from there."
bad,Massive corporations are not for me. Culture of the company is one of false morals and backstabbing coworkers trying to advance.
bad,"So Abbott would be a fantastic company with a fairly rewarding career...but extremely RACIST. Its REALLY Liberal and super hateful towards traditional Americans. They like you if you are gay, brown or a woman and you better not have traditional views. The culture is like middle school girls or a cult. Everyone is super fake (which is typical of corporate environments). Great 4 young scientists"
bad,"Do not work here. The owner give no cares about his employees. Well if your tall blonde and has had all types of enhancement surgeries. The other manager gets bullied at home so he bullies the women at work. The team leader has no professionalism at all and will call you out with that annoying voice.  STAY AWAY, DO NOT APPLY. They will treat you like a dog"
bad,"I was hired by a staffing company to work for Abbott. i had disclosed by disability with the staffing agency and asked that i have reasonable accommodations provided. No such accommodations were provided and instead they told me that i look ""fine"" and  ""don't have a disability"" and that i don't need the accommodations.  I tried working without the accommodations but i was never trained properly as i had spent the first two weeks just watching people and trying to learn from watching instead of a hands on step by step approach. When i actually began doing the work, my coworkers made fun and laughed at me and told me i was doing the work too slow when i was doing it as fast as i could. there was also multiple ways to pack a box and no clear direction on correct way to pack box, and it was confusing and overwhelming at times. Management did nothing to fix this and said that it is ""just how the coworkers are"" and that they were working on a training manual even though the manager who was making the training manual quit his own job a week before i left.  I even tried to get a job coach but was denied that as well."
bad,Équipe de travail non soudée manager très assistés sans respect pour la vie des autres
bad,Very little job stability with Abbott. great manager though. I would be very hesitant to pursue another position with Abbott based on how fast they are willing to lay off.
bad,"poor management, doesn't like to promote from within, no appreciation for dedicated workers, workload can't be accomplished, lack of clear goals. Management doesn't respond well to constructive criticism."
bad,Alere acquired the smaller company eScreen. eScreen had wonderful  business practices that favored the employee; encouraged each employee to give their best. Alere took over and flex time stopped and micro management took over. Very oppressive environment when I left.
bad,There is nothing much to review about this company. I disliked working here so much. I wish I did not have to work for this company in the beginning.
bad,"I was a contract Planning Manager at Abbott Nutrition  Singapore Pte Ltd. The Director , Amelia Tan that I reported was abusive and humiliate her employees very often. All her Managers, including me quit as well as her Supervisors. It was an environment where employees are harassed and nothing is right in her eyes and the Management is not doing anything to salvage the situation. Abbott Nutrition as a whole has a way too high turnover."
bad,"Horrible work environment. Employees constantly under pressure to perform, and warnings issued for the slightest reason, Very stressful environment to work in, Never met such an unhappy workforce in all my working career."
bad,"I'm typically not a review person, but was lead to write one to inform anyone considering employment at Abbott .  I was recruited to their Pediatric Nutrition Division after a successful career in the pharmaceutical industry.  Before I provide details on my experience, let me start by saying that in this division alone, nearly ten employees from Marketing and Market Research left to pursue other opportunities, in just one year (2014)."
bad,"No training "
bad,"El nivel de preparación que se tiene en Abbott es muy bueno, así como los medicamentos que tienen, sin embargo el sueldo base es bajo y las comisiones realmente muy por debajo de la media, incluso con laboratorio menos grandes que Abbott."
bad,A lot of politics and dishonest management. Too much gossip and not much work done. They are very dishonest when it comes to management and decisions that can affect the lives of workers (such as layoffs etc). Plenty of two-faced employees as well. Typical/stereotypical corporate environment like that of roman politics (the senate in specific) where everyone is trying to stab the other in the back in an attempt to grow or gain favor with higher management.
bad,"I think that Abbott  was a good place to work for it became ABBOTT,  which was ST. JUDE MED. , . When ABBOTT took over everything went out the door , example:no  professionalism , no insensitive,  upper management  attitude were highly BAD !!!"
bad,"even tough the manufacturation is supervised by the fda the lead and the manager treats people like slave ,no talking ,not laughing no seating it should be more modern and accomodate their employees since they have so manny years and lots of experience they can perform their job sitting and talk freely"
bad,"The Management promotes mediocrity, Working Environment has very high tension, Management is not consistent on decisions made upon repairs, scope of work & budget."
bad,"Continues to decline.  I previously contracted at SJM's Tech Center and now in 2018 it is even worse.  You may want to ask around before accepting any permanent offer at the old SJM locations.  Contracting is super easy cause the organization has rigid silos and a management hierarchy that discourages skipping levels.  If I was a permanent employee, I would get an ulcer."
bad,"When I first started there it was a great place to work. Then it was called Guidant, once Abbott took over that's when it all went down hill.  I liked the people I worked with however there were so many layoffs that the ones you liked were always gone the next day. I did learn multiple skills in the manufacturing world including inside a Clean room.  Learned multiple operations even one that only 30% of the people who tried finished."
bad,"The job was taxing physically, long hours with moving thousands of kilograms of product powder a day left little time for an individual to have a applicable work/life balance."
bad,"Great fresh out of college job but even then there are better starter jobs. They don’t seem to care about employees they way they should, Pay is meh but the flexible hours are great."
bad,Need to give people a chance for position  for good opportunity with better pay start from temp agency who bring they employees  and work hard as they do
bad,"¡Norma de la empresa!. La familia, ni conocidos puede trabajar. Y todos los contratos son para los familiares y amigos, los demás de la ETT, a barrer y limpiar, y se les enseña solo a los familiares. EMPRESA ENDOGAMICA. Los contratos indefinidos a las mujeres, son porque han pasado por el baño, el cual el servicio de mantenimiento, descubrió que estaba atascado de preservativos. Y los encargados, salen todos los viernes a tomarse algo con las compañeras por la noche, para ver cual se trabaja mejor el puesto de trabajo."
bad,Good networking opportunities and global work experiences. Work-life balance is a bit lacking. Not much room for flexibility in this business unit. Technical opportunities lacking.
bad,"Always busy.  Great benefits. Very stressful and a lot of pressure."
bad,"Extreme hierarchy, unable to be be flexible or accept new ideas.  Management is afraid of not hitting goals and unable to try new things.  Too concerned about how it looks NOW and not what it will provide LATER."
bad,The company was badly run and had a very closed culture where no body new was allowed to get into the inner circle. Thus hampering performance and growth.
bad,"Global reach for projects was impressive and challenging.  BUT...horrible PMO environment with abusive managers.  Did not pay for required overtime.  Turnover for PMs there is very high.  Work from home, even when ill, was not allowed."
bad,Management style is very push and old.  Not good for technical people. The company is very good at politics.  The company cannot even develop a simple products.
bad,Pile on a lot of work for contractors who gladly accept with the hope that they may be hired on full-time. I saw several people work extremely hard and stress until they came to the realization that they were not going to be hired on full-time. This company also made a good friend of mine train someone who had been a part of the outsourcing plan only to turn around and let her go from her position. Shame.
bad,"Products are great for patient outcomes and providing cutting edge support for both physicians and patients."
bad,"In particular, I developed my analytical skills greatly by working in the Chemistry laboratory where on a daily basis I tested raw materials and products to check whether they were in the specific limits to pass, using instruments such as the Infrared and Ultra-violet Spectroscopy, flame photometer, polarimeter, refractometer etc. I learned to follow complex procedures and used my own initiative to ensure reliable results of the highest quality. I also worked with research unit at different projects to reduce the waste cost of the manufacturing plant."
bad,Abbott was a great work experience it afforded me the opportunity to do the work I love and travel the world doing it.
bad,A regular day is fill with that  since of professionalism that makes a great company. Not only to work for but  the joy of knowing what you do effects people lives. Quality in the products they produce.
bad,"Abbott was a great company to work for. I enjoyed my co-workers and also the management team as well. My typical day at work was to process orders and assist internal and external clients. The hardest part of the job was when orders were over $50,000.00 I would have to have the Agent to approve and sometimes they were backed up with meetings and I was not able to get the orders processed as quickly as I would have liked. I learned how to balance the difficult orders and how to have my Agents assist me with getting the orders processed. The most enjoyable part of my job was being with my co-workers and also being able to assist my clients."
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had. They do not to train you but yet they will try and hold you accountable to what they do NOT tell you or train you on. I had a total of 5 supervisors in 2 years. The last was the absolute worst. Never spoke to me and even said a ""hello"" as management does see you as a human. You are a ""working machine"" and if you do not work fast enough-they do not want you. There is so much favoritism here (unlike I have ever seen before). The coldest culture to work in and if you are not a friend of a manager or one of the favored ones, you are set up to fail. The upper management does not have a clue what they are doing and not care about their employees what so ever. You are treated like a child, not allowed to speak to the person sitting next to you and you will be timed if you are in the bathroom for too long accused of taking a longer lunch. Nothing you do will satisfy management even if you finish all your work at the end of the day. I couldn't ever pay all my bills here cause the work you do does not equal the pay. We were promised a raise 2-3 times but they lie to their employees and have not plans on giving anyone a raise. I got sick literally from working here. I was belittled by Team leads who are sell-outs who do not have your back!) and made to feel like I was totally worthless. They also charge outrageous amounts of money for supplies to very elderly people and its soooooo sad."
bad,By enrolling employees in health improvement programs we were definitely doing work that benefited them and society at large
bad,The best part of this job is that you get to interact with wonderful lab staff and doctors and advise them on the procedure.  The benefits and time off are good.
bad,"Môi trường làm việc thoải mái, tiếp xúc khách hàng dễ dàng"
bad,A good place to acquire experience but not to stay longer with. A lot of politics. Management keeps changing constantly. Poor communication. Unable to advance if you are not related to the senior staff.
bad,"You can work very hard and do a good job and it means nothing to management. They promise you that one day you will get to be full time. Yeah right. Almost everyone who starts there is a ""temp"" and is treated as if you are a lower form of life. You get no benefits, no insurance, not even a free t-shirt when full time people get that. After two years you are required to take 30 days off for ""abbott tenure reset"" and apply for unemployment. This is so they don't have to give you benefits. Full time people get vacations days, sick days, a yearly bonus in November that people say is about a month's pay. not for temps though. They talk a good talk but in reality they don't care about you. you are a number."
bad,Toxic work environment therefore high turnover. The management does not take responsibility and you are screamed at and belittle. I have a bachelor degree and I consider myself smart. They destroyed my self esteem to the point that I was physically sick. I turned in my resignation.
bad,"Prior to some female managers, being hired by Alere, it was a pretty good place to work.  Female management that they hired was abusive verbally and at times even physical.  Human Resources did not advocate whatsoever for employees and took the side of management every time.  HR knew full well who was abusive and did absolutely nothing about it."
bad,"No job security"
bad,"Large company, reported to many groups.  Worked on a variety of projects.  Was a temporary employee with no signs of a permanent job.  Management was grueling, worked like a PhD laboratory, where none of the credit was given, but lots of work to be done."
bad,"Poor company culture. Non existent work-life balance, micro managers. Only good thing about working here is the share plan you can opt into after 2 years of employment."
bad,"Overall, the company has poor management from Human Resources down to mangers in the specific departments.  Favoritism is shown greatly and the characteristics shown by those who are qualified for management positions are overlooked by those who are liked most by management (which typically does not work out in the companies favor, because the individual ends up leaving for a position at a new company after accepting the position)."
bad,I took care of the sales force who used Treo phones. I had the oppertuneity to learn the functions of the Treo phones. Management was off site so not much to speak of.
bad,This was a temporary assignment at AV Santa Clara. Team members were very critical of the manager. There was always gossip whenever the management is not around. There were not sufficient tools for the candidate to succeed and the training experience was not satisfactory.
bad,Fast paced and you need to be resourceful with little help from management. Most of the people are friendly and are willing to you. you have to adapt to sudden schedule changes which include working weekends.
bad,"A typical day was long and stressful for everyone it seems but out of that we learn to be patient and we learn good ways to handle those stressful situations. The management and the workers are pretty much the same, working together and finding ways to improve upon each other. The only downfall to this job is the consumption of time from your personal life, therefore no one could get too much done outside of the job. The best part was being able to learn new things and make new friends with the employees."
bad,"Company with poor integrity, very poor communication, treats employees like they are robots and they own you and your free time, no consideration for the individual. Work load/Case Load too excessive,managers make unreasonable demands and are poorly informed. No way to get the job done in 40hrs/wk,much additional time needed on weekends to complete the weekly expectations (no overtime pay for this). Very top heavy with management, little regard for the front line case manager. Very demanding and stressful job, a company you can't trust, would not recommend it."
bad,A typical day at work would start from 8AM with minimal breaks due to the volume of tasks. I handle all tickets from all departments and all positions. There have been more than a few instance wherein I was asked to come in on weekends just to provide access to Utility.
bad,Worked under fan blowing cold air on top of my head & bright florescent lights. Your work is all telephonic and the work environment is not supportive
bad,here you wont be recognized for your hard work they just need numbers that you achieve within the time limit. if they will to remove you they will force you to resign the job
bad,"Good place to gain entry level experience and lean a robust quality system. There is little to no work life balance, management take orders from top down and execute without thought. You will be working tons of overtime."
bad,Did the work of someone else. Replaced them on contract. Did the work of another someone else. Got things done. Afterwards laid off. The second someone else not laid off even though I did the work.
bad,"They Cared about there numbers than employees life outside, working 6 days a week mandatory. It’s easy ok job but work with people who cares about you and your personal life outside"
bad,Alere treated me and other unfairly.  Managments don't care about good people and they play favoritism.  They like Asian people alot and they prefer hiring Asians.  I am not Asian and I have nothing agaisnt Asians but that is the reality at Alere.  I lost my job  because some Asian 21 years old girl didn't like me so she make lies and drama so I can get fired.  My boss listened to her and he fired me.  Not fair.
bad,Als werknemer moet je je geheel aanpassen aan de grillen van het Management. Flexibel zijn wordt al vermeldt in vacatures en wordt ook geeist! Persoonlijke opleiding en doorstroom mogelijk heden wordt wel gepreekt echter in de praktijk gebeurd dit niet!
bad,Too many projects to be completed in short time period. They changed their policies recently. Do  not have good work-life balance. Good thing is that they allow remote for the needy reasons.
bad,"Abbott bought eScreen in an acquisition and the merger of benefits, culture, compensation,  and values still hasn't transferred over.  The reward for completing your work is more work. Employees in each department stick together because upper level management only cares about the bottom line. There is no sick time so if you do get sick you're written up for it. Also not a good place if you have kids or want them because there is no flexibility.  You can only work from home if its convenient for the company."
bad,Use of contract workers to avoid paying benefits.Management is overly numbers driven leading to over working line personnel. Constant layoffs for Abbott employees.
bad,Was being able to complete a project and get recognized for the hard work. Having the opportunity to work remote a few times a month. Flexible hours depending on life events.
bad,abbott is a great company to work for but abbott tipp city is terrible. management is terrible raises are based on how well your liked not on job performance
bad,"The Abbott brand, is nothing but an illusion. What they say they value and what they actually value is completely different. Quality, safety, innovation, opportunity, loyalty is all trumped by one thing and that's their bottom line and maintaining the status quo. The more profits they make, greedier they get. They value their shareholders more than their own employees. They let go hard working dedicated veterans to hire unexperienced contractors for half the cost and if you are hired through an agency, you will be treated as third class. If you are night shift, you might as well be invisible. They do not value anyones opinion unless you are part of the management team or a highly educated engineer even if you do have the right answers. Half the management team is incompetent and only care about making themselves look good no matter who they have to throw under the bus. The other half have no choice but to follow what is asked of them and spend to much time defending the bad ones. They will never admit fault or take responsibility for their own actions. They like to start new projects but no one ever follows through anything. "
bad,"Company was a difficult place to work, constantly down-sizing and letting go the groups that conduct the work while retaining unnecessarily high levels of management"
bad,"Empresa em fase de desenvolvimento profissional, cultural."
bad,"Abbott was a decent place to work, But however it's not the most safest place to work. It's friendly for the most part. Being a machine Operator there you'll learn that Maintenance will become your bestfriend."
bad,"The stock was high when I left the company but has tumbled down in recent years.  Cutbacks in staff and transition of manufacturing overseas is all too common for ABT and its peers.  I don't believe the company will ever return to its golden years of the 70s, and 80s.  There needs to be a fresh culture turnaround but with the same CEO that will likely not occur."
bad,This is an incomplete list that may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.
bad,Abbott is a good company to work for.  They keep employees under contract though that can hurt for your job security.  employees under contract to do not get PTO or Benefits
bad,"Fast pace work environment, work life balance, patient focused, sales focused, strategic planning, strong emphasis of training, internal mentoring, process driven"
bad,"Some areas of the company are very good to work in, but it all depends on your management's competence.  There are the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Usually it's the typical complacency and maintain status quo, but other times it's a constant treadmill of unending tasks that end up being nothing but an exercise in futility.  There is a deadline for a big important task and everyone is scrambling, working 16 hour days for several months to deliver... the date comes to deliver and the VP who requested it says ""what is this?... I didn't ask for this..."""
bad,"Management does not care about our happiness or success.  There is not room for advancement, they do not promote from within, they only look outside the company"
bad,"Abbott tends to pay more favorable than some companies, but they work their employees to death.  "
bad,"Although Abbott - Nutrition division is cash rich company and a good pay master.. it is not worth joining it. No work , high internal politics .. old people 75 working after retire life.. job insecurity at its peak. In my tenure in Abbott.. from head office 65% attrition rate.. out of 44 person 23 left.. "
bad,"Not very exciting environment for working, lots of politics, no opportunities for growth , no tools provided for the job, no sense of direction, vision not shared by the leadership, lots of cost cutting measures to save money at ground level only"
bad,Abbott does not care about patient outcomes as much as they do the bottom line.  They use incentives and back room payments for their Neuromodualation targets by making high volume docs thought leaders and creating fake opportunities for payment.
bad,Engineering facilities site supervisors are excellent. Director of Facilities Engineering seems not to be interested in STEM degreed engineering females to join the local site for facilities management even though I have excellent references from R&D scientist and engineers on local site.
bad,"This was not just a job, it was a career.  Not rewarded for loyalty.  Poured my heart and life into helping build a company and still get eliminated upon the first round of job cuts."
bad,thomas a racist mexican . and a supervisor . they know when work is slow and there is no orders to fill they use that against you for your numbers to not show good .
bad,"Abbott hires based on nepotism not skillset and most of the leadership is totally hands off. Contractors do not get to speak or even see Human Resources. My boss rarely did work. He would sit in his office and play games on his phone. He would blame others for his lack of leadership. Too bad, their products have helped so many people and the staff overall is friendly."
bad,Plenty of other large med-tech companies are much better places to work....Far too great a focus on internal activities and initiatives.  Literally could make a career out of attending internal meetings!
bad,"New leadership has brought toxic environment.  Cut-throat, ruthless, the best is never enough.  Be prepared for an environment you have never seen before.  Organization growing, but not enough to satisfy leadership.  Daily firings, people leaving.  Pace of the workplace is not sustainable."
bad,"Rédiger et implanter la procédure de développement des emballages pharmaceutiques et former les employés concernés "
bad,This company could not get out of its own way and within six months of hiring my sales force they laid all of us off.  Management was a mess and the sales reps were treated horrible.
bad,"This place has no work life balance, some weeks I work 6 days a week on what is supposed to be 12 hour shifts that turn into 14 hours typically. This is due to the horrible management not hiring more people in order to fill the needed roles."
bad,"Not so much, the whole company, but more of just my manager. I was told my role would be one thing, but when I started working my role was very different and much less engaging than what was promised. They like to dangle promotions/conversions without ever giving them."
bad,"Pharma co. trying to operate as a device co. But don't know how to do it. Furthermore, they say one thing one week and then change their mind the next week. People are actually afraid to go out and work within the Neuro franchise cause of compliance."
bad,"Company is lost, has no product pipeline. Corporate culture looks good on paper, but not brought to life."
bad,"trabalho com atenção e responsabilidades.aprendir operar varias maquinas e tive varios conhecimentos na areia farmacêuticas,a direção e a gerência tinha um bom desempenho,tenho muitas abilidades e facilidades no relacoinamentos interpessoal e no trabalho em equipe,a parte mais   dificil do trabalho é o primeiro dia  que tudo e novo ,a parte mais agradável do trabalho é está trabalhando e conquistando seu objetivos ."
bad,Empresa extremamente familiar com poucas possibilidades de promoção
bad,"I am always skeptical of bad reviews as I assumed they were provided by bad employees who were fired or were disgruntled. I can tell you that the bad reviews regarding Alere are true.  As a former employee I can attest to the validity. "
bad,"Company treats temp hire employees like dirt.  Production runs are poorly planned and everything, including scheduling seems ""last minute""."
bad,"Little employee moral and limited work/life balance. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expectations of ""selling"" products that were already available to insurers. I found little enjoyment as I watched the highest turnover rate for a company."
bad,Constantly reorganizing and off shoring work. Managers are focused on their own survival and not engaged with employees. Promotions are based on personal relationships vs results.
bad,"Worked in the manufacturing area.  A majority of contract employees are lured in with the promise of conversion to a permanent role in the long term, but are dismissed over ridiculously-low tolerances for human error.  Human errors that are made more and more likely by 10-hour days and 50-60 hour weeks with minimal time for breaks, extremely limited access to water, and totally unsympathetic management.  "
bad,"I had a bad experience with people but company is not bad."
bad,Management is poor sometimes training is very poor at a coordinate Who You Are very biased the pay is not good. The supervisors friends of friends in the plant and if you are a friend of the supervisor then you get away with a lot of stuff management just looking from the outside looking in very few black management very Prejudice environment not a hard drive to work but the pay is very little
bad,"St Jude Medical acquired by Abbott, is a challenging place to work for, and I would recommend avoiding it if at all possible. Management seems only interested in profits, and less in patient safety than they should be."
bad,"Lots of hours.  Forced to stay over or come in early constantly.  Pay raise is nowhere near the inflation rate, company has taken compensation away to pay for infrastructure and common sense programs like class A, STOP and now the Shingo prize.  More vacation than most employers give, but you use most of it just to get a weekend off!  You get 10 paid holidays but the plant will work at least 8 of those!  Used to be a great place to work but now there’s high turnover due to debilitating management decisions that cause extremely low morale.  If you are a young, single person that wants to work as many hours as possible and be able to save a lot of money then Abbott is for you!  Everyone else...beware!!"
bad,"Management is not caring and partially nonexistent. Abbott does not care of how some managers and verbally abusive. Senior managers are never around, they are in another building and don't care."
bad,"Little to no room for job advancement. If you do get a promotion, it can take 3 or more months before you start your new position. Pay compares poorly to similar jobs in the area. Department supervisors are fine, but upper management does not listen to employee concerns and is unapproachable. Recent layoffs have only exacerbated under-staffing issues."
bad,"En esta empresa no valoraron nuestro trabajo ni el esfuerzo pagan poco viatico y no quisieron mejorar nunca las condiciones q nos tenían laborando de un momento a otro cerraron proyecto sin avisarnos."
bad,Layoffs are common. On site management is poor. Product pipeline and new product launches are sparse. Always playing keep-up with cGMP and was under a letter of warning from the FDA.
bad,Great company to work for depending on position and division you work within.  Management is not as great as it seems or invested in employees as they may make you feel.
bad,"Management Supports only those they want to retain. "
bad,"Management team has little to no experience in food manufactoring."
bad,El ambiente laboral es demasiado pésimo en la planta de Bogotá no hay equidad para todos hay algunos jefes y supervisoras que no valoran el trabajo ni motivan al operario
bad,"Definitely needs improvement. They're not willing to teach you anything, most skills you'll acquire are learned on your own. There aren't opportunities for advancement and when positions become available, they're given to outsiders."
bad,"I don't really know why my  contract with them was not continued management was not forth coming on this information.   I was a proficient, diligent worker meeting daily quotas so I am confused why  I am not still there. The only positive is  I gained more experience in the  accounts payable area. The job gave me exposure to an SAP."
bad,"Doors closed, openly competitive environment.  The only way to become part of the culture was to last through reorganizations and become part of the social culture before becoming part of the professional culture.  Oldies vs Newbies."
bad,No good this company had no real benefit package once people made money & years they turn around and fire them all... So sad what this company has done to many.
bad,"Stressful work environment, non existent work life balance. Extensive Travel requirements and long hours. High performance pressure and on the job learning."
bad,"The company likes to think they create a fair workplace by creating unnecessary projects to think you will be able to better yourselves within the company. In retro-spec, you are stuck within you departments if you are lucky to be converted. The usual and only way seen to be converted is when the department is severely short staffed and they are afraid you will leave.The typical reason people leave is the salary they pay. The company only pays  75% of the average pay rate of the typical position. Multiple ex-coworkers announced this to HR and they pleated ignorance. The company also like to manipulate data so that it passes and meet the quota, hence to multiple lawsuits and constant failing equipment."
bad,"This place is not where you want to work. They will hire you as a temp, treat you badly, probably not hire you full time and then fire you after a year. They make you take a 30 leave after you've been a contract worker for a year and they will find someone to replace you before you come back. If on the off chance you do get converted to a full time employee they will pay you 75% of the average for that job in San Diego. That is company policy."
bad,Management style was micro and it was not a good place to work. You were not encouraged to make improvements. Advancement was very hard if you were not white. I felt that the way people of color were treated was very unfair.
bad,Horrible management that does not hold employees accountable for their actions. When I worked there I witnessed a manager actually covering up mistakes by an employee who just happened to be her friend. Another employee was caught falsyfing his time card and did not even get a slap on the wrist. Others would get fired if they were caught doing these things. But these 2 were friends with the manager and senior manager. At Abbott the whites get away with murder and as long as u know someone you can do what you want without having to worry about getting fired or laid off. People that speak up are usually very good employees so they get laid off since it's difficult to fire them. Employee relations is a joke they always side with management.
bad,"Some great people to work with but there are a lot of clicks and its a very political environment. The old saying of ""It's not what you know but who you know"" is true at Abbott. My advice is to take your job and learn what you can so you can move on. Use your experience at Abbott as a spring board to advance your career elsewhere."
bad,Work hard to form allegiances and you can move up. Learned about politics. Whistle blowers are shunned to say the least. Breaks are awesome.
bad,"If you want to act and work like a conforming robot, then this is the place for you! Good Luck!  I worked so much overtime in this company for the 10 yrs. that I was there, not being able to see my children grow up and be with them. It wasn't worth it at all."
bad,People were really disrespectful here! Even though you would tell on them with upper management they did nothing about it!!!!
bad,"doesn't care about employees, only profit and production.  uses people to get product out the door.  forces people to live their jobs with no work life balance.  money isn't everything."
bad,"Challenging industry, vets are very cost conscious.The company is unstable with some of its products and if they will survive if new products don't take off. Loved working with animals."
bad,Decent company to gain some experience from. they seem to cut down on perks more and more every year
bad,"- Very routine work environment."
bad,ADC doesn't have a nice and healthy culture. In general not a good environment to work.
bad,Abbott Labs like most other large corporations do not care about the employees nor promoting growth and advancement. You are just a number and even worse they keep temps on board for multiple years never hiring them permantly nor giving them any benefits. Temps are treated like second class and they work harder than many of the old timer (Guidant) employees. The raises are lousy and percentage depends on how your manager or group lead wants to devide the percent amongs the group. Work and responsibility is piled on yet there are no promotions being implemented. Layoffs occur annually so empoyees that are the unlucky to stay take on the additional duties with out any compensentation. Really sad but a good opportunity to witness first hand at greedy corporate america! There are many nice
bad,Not very teamwork at all. Too much politics from Supervisors.
bad,Home visit schedule challenging and job was rewarding seeing the client progress toward her due date.
bad,I enjoyed my job and the people I personally worked with. However the management is a joke. They have no clue what is going on but yet think they know everything.
bad,"After 1 year of employement, my manager left a hissing, vindictive, nasty message on my voice mail telling me I was to slow and caused the whole team to suffer on Christmas. This message was left on Christmas afternoon when we couldnt leave early. Fat chance. This was during a time of a systems ""upgrade"" and my call center list for this day was 400+ calls (not) to human beings who, surprise, ""talk"". This was a terrible job fit for me owing to its 'piece work' focus and my challenge hearding chatty patients into a nice short time frame box.- brought back memories of my factory days before becoming a nurse. Uck. This was 10 years ago and .hopefully things have improved - in hind site - could I do it again..Id have played that voice mail for the whole staff and the labor board before I left although I was too shocked and timid to think of this then and erased it. I eventually wrote to the managers boss although never received a response."
bad,"Extensive experience investigating and resolving product quality, manufacturing process, while holding various responsibilities within the Quality organization. Recent responsibilities included to work as a Project Manager, Research & Development, Document Control environment, technical service and field service. Actions designed to improve training, training cost improvement and efficiencies. main responsibilities is to deliver results, reports from Training, RFC, CAPAs, and FDNs of products related to both Quality and Operations, special project (CIP, FMEA and Infinity Project).

Identifies sources of manufacturing defects and devises methods to reduce sources of variations and eliminated causes of defects. Experience implementing process improvement and cost improvement initiatives which includes: control charting, reducing acceptance sampling, trend charting, scrap analysis, CpK analysis, and tolerance and confidence reliability calculations."
bad,"The company was a fun place to work at over 9 years ago, however, when new management took place it was no longer a fun place. Alot of the managers/VP's need training on how to treat their employees. It is unfortunate because alot of good employees that have been with the company for a long time left for that very reason. Overall the co-workers were great and wonderful to work with."
bad,"Company as a whole was great to work for.  But unfortunately business needs always overtakes employees needs and the balance of that was never close, forced upon by poor management...no real process improvements, only band-aids and always about the low hanging fruit scraping the bottom of the barrel."
bad,"La empresa tiene cosas buenas. Sin embargo, la línea que tuve tenía muchos vacíos los directivos y las comunicaciones son erróneos con sus empleados. La carga y el acoso laboral es muy grande sin contar con bajo pago y la cantidad de cosas que hay por hacer."
bad,"Alere was nice to their employees,  positive work environment, and focus was on the patient.  I would recommend this company as a good employer with generous benefits"
bad,"Enjoyed the work, but education and training are lacking.  They pretty much throw you out there to figure things out on your own.  Little direction or support from management.  Compensation and benefits are decent, although I never received a review, feedback or a raise.  Would not go back if given the opportunity."
bad,"Incredibly poor culture — toxic. There’s a bully mentality. I simply resigned — life is too short. Those who believe they’re legends in their own minds, those who know-it-all, survive by feeding on each other. If you want to do important work in a pleasant environment, this isn’t the place. "
bad,"While I don't regret working here, it was a mistake to accept the offer. Very low pay for very stressful work. Lots of benefits but they don't mean much when they are ripped out of your already sad paycheck. Lots of good people were laid off, and honestly it's time to increase my job search. My plan was to wait it out until college, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen."
bad,"SVP of HR promotes and rewards his inner circle. His management technique is humiliation, so everyone who reports to him or aspires to report to him follows his lead."
bad,"When Abbott was Ross, you were like family and when they changed the name to Abbott you became a number. With that being said I have nothing good to say about Abbott. The management team treats the employees like they are not good enough. They would ask for your opinion but not consider them, Management says one thing and means the total opposite. Do not work in unsafe condition, but continue to run just put on PPE."
bad,I worked her for 17 years. I was laid off due to restructuring. In other words I was there too long and mad too much money. They get rid if their mos. experience operators just to save money. But the quality is effected in the cartridge making. Don’t waste your time or energy here. They will make I seem like a great place to work but will let you go with a blink of an eye. Part time people never get hired full time.
bad,"My direct supervisor is wonderful.  upper management is not very in tuned to what is going on with their employees which leads to decisions that need to be adjusted immediately.  there is also not recognition when it comes to employees going above and beyond what their current roles are.  Raises are also very, very small."
bad,I had very different experiences at Abbott Labs since I was a contractor and not an employee of Abbott Labs. I did find the tools given to employees to be extremely outdated. For example I was given a desk top computer...in the middle of Silicon Valley in 2014-2015! This kept me from working more efficiently and meant that many times things had to wait till I was in the office.
bad,"This was a great company at one time but just like most places in Eastern KY, when coal mining took a hit, things went sour for a lot of businesses.  this was one of the unlucky companies."
bad,"baja,mal ambiente en el desempeño del trabajo,nada de empatia con los trabajadores."
bad,"Abbott Labs, in general, is your typical corporate oriented company that requires maneuvering and being quick on your feet attitude get things done.  The company's emphasis is to cultivate the next leaders -- an example of this is the company's push for the PDP program.  With that said, company culture differs from division to divisions, some for the better than others."
bad,"The management here does not care about you! They only care about the bottom line and revenue. You can not have an opinion about anything.The training you receive is poor at best and once you are out on the floor, it resembles a sweatshop environment. Want to complain to HR? Forget it because the manager is best friends with them!"
bad,QA department temporary assignment. Ensuring employees followed GMPs. Basically a QA informant. Boring and friendless. Only skill needed was to tattle.
bad,"This is not a bad place to work for people that just want to come and do their job and go back home. The management is disconnected from it's employees and is not receptive to innovation. If you have an entrepreneurial drive, you'd be miserable here."
bad,"paid well, good benefits, good place to retire from.  able to cross train in different but similar areas.  downside, felt like management rewarded dishonesty"
bad,"no promotions  "
bad,"Friendly co-workers and supervisor, learning about monitoring Machines is a great challenged.  Great enviroment to work in.  Great place to work at."
bad,After 30 years I was let go without compensation after receiving ratings of Exceed Expectations during the past 5 years and getting the copany to the top 10 from 18th place
bad,"I worked for the company for 4 years, it was not easy to move up to a higher position."
bad,"Excelente productos a nivel farmacéutico, amplia zona de trabajo con bastantes días de viaje, no muy remunerado económicamente, aprendí hacer mas analista en la zona de trabajo, revisión de mas auditorias, lo que mas me gusto fue los medicamentos que trabaje."
bad,"I have been with this company for many years and though you get interesting and sometimes enjoyable work to do, career growth is limited in general. Grade promotion came with a job change to another division. There are people who have been in the same role and same grade level for a decade or more. Basically, little to no emphasis on career growth or people development. Management are generally good at managing the work but not really with people skills/development. The career growth path is not clear for many positions. Those who progress up typically have connections or play the political game very well or hop from division to division. Very few progress on meritocracy.  Those who are frustrated with no growth after many years either bury it in silence just to have a constant. predictable paycheck or leave. "
bad,"Everybody felt like the company just cared for the new technology they just acquired, not the people.  And then they showed it by having a series of layoffs - wave after wave.  Had to work in an environment of uncertainty, which is very stressful."
bad,"Our company is a great company to work, Work starts early 9 am with planning and achieving the planned things for the day. Learning is a continuous process learned not to stay long with single company,Love your job but not or company is what I learned. Great is the word Management first we have to manage ourselves,family in better then we are successful in the wonderful word Management.Once again great Management from Abbott. Great people, Personally believe in strength of the Team.Key Account managers were enjoying their job of doing camps and clinics.The hardest part of job is getting relocated to Deharadun. Learning and guiding the team every day in four basic words ASK,POEM,SWOT and SMARTER"
bad,Good company in into helath care. Very laid back and self motivated.
bad,"Almost 1/2 the QEs have left in the last several months of late 2011 and early 2012. This place is growing too fast and their is no control or vision. There is no work-life balance, no appreciation, merits suck 2-2.5%, promotions 5% if they even give any out, no money for training and development, the management team (especially in quality) is immature and innexperienced. They couldn't pay me enough to go back... oh and the pay there is pretty low and they cut bonuses year after year because of unrealistic goals. It is a very cut throat and backstabbing environment there. In terms of job security Abbott is like every other employer. They do layoffs but this site has been safe. Abbott has great benefits and a pension program if you survive there. Overall my advice is... Don't do it... especially the Menlo Park site."
bad,"After completing 3 years of successfull sales for Virology franchise,"
bad,No job clarity and only sales driven. Marketing initiatives are not respected
bad,Empresa altamente competitiva e grande compromisso com os números
bad,"Very poor management and no work life balance. Great pay and benefits, but you are just a number to them and they a quick to terminate people for small mistakes. Most people there are fun to work with, but don't trust everyone."
bad,"Het is fysiek zwaar werk, tilwerk en hoog stapelen op pallets."
bad,"Plus:"
bad,"Everything was market oriented.  The marketing department set the deadlines which were too short."
bad,"Departments are more interested in stabbing other department personnel in the back and plotting than in working together for the company good. They treat contract employees terribly and pay them even worse."
bad,Good people to work with. Very poor management. Very hiarchy oriented. Lots of problems for every solution. They hire a lot of contract workers since they don't really care about their front line employees. Let them go as needed after using their services. You are just a number.
bad,"Poor management , all senior level managers were let go after few months of my employment there and replaced with cut throat questionable competency leaders who were clueless about work we did and how its done on day to day basis.  "
bad,"No diversity and it is more about who you know to get ahead. Micromanages their employees and will work you to death for things that make no impact. it doesn't even have to do with nutrition, just sales and being better than competitors. no one really is friends in the company because they make such a competitive atmosphere. people only stay here for the benefits and the money."
bad,"This was an relatively older population who stayed in a position for their entire career. VERY quiet, staid and conventional environment! Great improvement opportunities."
bad,"safe through 9 layoffs, 10th layoff most were gone. sr leadership chose the good ole boys to stay on board. they did me a favor by laying me off I am better off"
bad,"I do my best at any given task or situation. I have been performing up till now and have no disappointed anyone. Just an advice, If you like work life balance, abbott is not for you. In fact, it's not for the faint hearted."
bad,"Not recommended, too much turnover in staff. Bosses don't understand what goes on under them but make decisions like they do. decent for fresh grads but move on ASAP."
bad,"Traditional old school company. Not much value on new ideas that go against company norms or politics. Politics trump doing the right thing, and decision making is incredibly slow and non-transparent."
bad,Very structured environment due to federal regulations. Frequent compliance training was required to ensure employees were up to date on all federal regulations and documented accordingly.
bad,Abbott nutrition is a great company and benefits but Tipp City on the other hand is a different story management is sorry only for management not for the hourly Associates they say it to you one voice one goal but that's not so all they can do is point fingers at the all the stuff that you do wrong they're all the time changed the rules if you like working for straight time  8 days straight in  material control good luck when I started it was time and a half and double time
bad,"A lot of people are leaving because the future of this company is unknown due to merging plans with another company. Staff is fairly friendly. The management is on their high horse, treats people poorly, shows no respect, extremly rude and often times very unprofessional. A lot of work is recycled from projects that were done years ago. No originally or creativity. Absolutely no room for growth."
bad,The pay and benefits are great and the key to making this job successful other then that poor leadership and lack of experience from the higher levels of management has been the struggle.
bad,This company had a habit of having a scapegoat on each tea that would be fired if the project failed.  The company pays very well...
bad,"its a good company but the working culture is not so good."
bad,"They are fighting a tough uphill battle to remain relevant in the fight to deliver 3rd party managed health care options (ie, health coaching, condition management) at a reasonable cost to the client."
bad,"Getting very political, you are either on the inside or you're not. Used to be a lot better place to work, seems like they want to hire younger people who will work for less."
bad,"Learning opportunity is good."
bad,The hardest part of the job.....quality checking on very high level..prob a 100 %
bad,"•	Provide on demand front line field service support to Abbott Architect customers."
bad,"Units wont cooperate together to get things done, no opportunity to grow, angry place."
bad,Same thing every day and all day.Job not difficult both management was a pain.
bad,"The hardest part of th job is all the sitting, being timed on everything you do and the job itself, it is not something for me."
bad,For 1st job only. It is although a very employee friendly but few grey areass can hold your progress. Sometimes they will give you irrational assignments which have no practical implications for the growth of the company.
bad,"Worked remotely, travelled weekly, difficult to get a hold of management or other headquarter help when needed. A couple of teambuilding activity/programs during the year."
bad,I only worked there shortly as I had moved and needed to relocate for my then once small daughter. It was dry time of position with plenty of repetitive tasks. The environment was cold and a lack of team spirit and support.
bad,I believe there was a strong lack in employee career advancement and growth within the company. Very little was done to encourage professional growth and the possibility of cross training for different roles. That would definitely make a huge positive impact.
bad,"The company invests heavily in training its employees, unfortunately, that ends at training. The management is never accessible, and when they are they pay little attention to recommendations. Overall it is a great place to work if you are right out of college."
bad,"Find that company overall does not encourage management to develop skills, just find faults.  Very little vacation and peak/valley bonus structure.  Has not been a good move."
bad,Working in a medical device is very interesting and learned lot about the medical device development process and requirements.
bad,"In Field Service, ideally someone ought to balance home and work life. At Abbott Labs, the mentality is that your work is your family. Although the company annual retreats were fun and rewarding, the constant phone calls from MGMT and their minions made the experience very stressful."
bad,"Poor Management/leadership"
bad,"Co workers were great, but management liked to pass blame, and promised lots of opportunity but never came through. Company shut down and missed a lot of pay checks for employees, still owes several."
bad,"It was a temporary assignment that lasted longer than expected. During this period I learned a lot. I am presently using a lot of the skills that I learned at this job. "
bad,"Não há reconhecimento profissional;"
bad,Hard work pays off. I whish I would have stayed in this position longer.
bad,"Lange Arbeitsstunden, viele interne Softwareprogramme, Management extrem profitorientiert und eiskalt im Umgang mit Kollegen, Arbeitsplatzkultur - Openofficeplan wie im Hühnerkäfig. Am schwierigsten ist der respektlose Umgang mit Mitarbeitern, am besten ist dass ich selbstständig arbeiten durfte."
bad,Work environment became fearful. quality department was well run. Understanding what your manager wants and needs was never well communicated even when clarifying questions were asked to ensure the purpose was understood. This caused confusionand caused goals to not be met.
bad,"Abbott Nutrition is in a turmoil, The management does not know what they are doing.  Also the company is only for young people who want to advance and are willing to relocate,"
bad,"Abbott Nutrition has fantastic workforce talent on board.  Unfortunately, sr leadership has a difficult time inspiring and developing its workforce. There is too much turnover at the Sr. Leadership level and not enough emphasis placed on establishing a strong strategic vision for the business."
bad,"Prós: O ambiente de trabalho é muito bom, possivelmente fará amigos para a vida inteira. Isso motiva a muitos retornarem para a empresa, portanto não é difícil ver casos de pessoas que já trabalharam duas ou três vezes lá."
bad,"There is no difference in between manager and low rank employee. Contribution of both are same,hence its a perfect example of open and good work culture."
bad,Company has changed a lot in management philosophy over the last 5 years.  Constant out-sourcing going on.  Moral is low.
bad,"Good for entry level only. Management seems to play favorites. The company have people that have been working for them for years, but this is not a good thing. They have developed a system that will not be disrupted and new people and ideas are often looked down upon."
bad,"Abbott is a great company to work for, but this job did not fit my personality."
bad,"Abbott is a large corporate company. There is greater job security than a start up but the benefits package, compensation and policies are lack luster compared to other tech companies."
bad,"It was great first experience for me to work in international company. As a fortune, I started my career with a great role of project management. Being at such position allows me to be structured, focusing on time-management and the result. I feel very comfortable to hold 20 + projects, but in the meantime my desire - to get more ownership of the project I lead. I do not like our workplace vibes (too stressed with irrational deadlines, but it does not prevent me to show results. I want to have more dynamic kind of work with high tangible impact on our lives."
bad,"It was a hard company to work for because of the changing Business Rules changing daily, sometimes twice a day. I had to deal with quite a bit of petty jealousy with co-workers."
bad,"The people are friendly here. The management is poor. It's recently acquired by Abbott Laboratories. Hopefully, a significant correction would be made fix some hidden issues."
bad,"Since working there as Guidant, I have been part of several successful technical programs; implementing projects innovative for their time. "
bad,"La experiencia que a uno le queda. y el buen conmpañerismo.un dia en el trabajo comienza con una organizacion de las tareas por parte del supervisor, el trabajo generalmente es unitario y personal, importante, con mucha responsabilidad y concentracion."
bad,Worked 12 hour days a lot. Projects not well scheduled/managed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the people. Most everyone walked around grumpy on a regular basis due to exhaustion. Excuses were found for employees treating each other poorly. Contractors/Consultants treated as second class citizens. Most enjoyable part of the job was the actual work-knowing the work was to create products that made a difference in peoples lives.
bad,"not supportive, not a good at setting up folks for career advancement, very top heavy with same managers playing musical chairs even though they were not successful ."
bad,Abbott was a great place to work.  It was very quiet and the Director that I supported traveled a lot.  I moved to another city and decided to find a more challenging position.
bad,"I had a difficult time, being hired to be on the maintenance team and really ended up being an operator. It really wasn't what I signed up to do. The leadership there was more about meeting goals at any cost it seemed at times. It was a very stressful job."
bad,Just ok. People and management tended to be old school. As a contractor I would not want to work there again. Manger in Clinical Research was egocentric and rude.
bad,I worked a few months for this company.  Employees were very cliquish.  Manager was wonderful to work for.  Employees made it difficult to be effective.
bad,medical manufacturing facility responsible for many medical supplies. Good overall work environment. Employees were thoroughly trained on all tasks. Pay at the time was not ideal
bad,The company is ceasing the recruitment of high skilled foreigners. Many support functions like Financial Management and IT have been outsourced to oversea. The problem is many on site requirements related to financial and IT analytics can't be answered efficiently. Local people work in an extremely non-efficient and luxuriously relax way.
bad,"There is so much red tape at this company it's very difficult to get things done. "
bad,"Cut-throat atmosphere makes working there nearly impossible.  Almost everyone there is a back-stabbing, lying, cheating, narcissistic employee/manager trying to make themselves look good to for a possible promotion which is impossible.  It's not about your work ethic and quality of your work.  It's not about what you know, but who you do.  The only way up is to be the best friend of some higher-up, pompous ""donkey."""
bad,"There was very little oversight and no micro-managing, which I preferred. However, as a contractor, I didn't really feel as a part of the ""Team"" in my group. Contractors were sort of like 2nd class citizens and treated differently than permanent employees."
bad,"I worked at Abbott about a year.   They offer a generous salary & benefits package and for the most part I liked the people I worked with very much.  However, there is no onboarding process in place and very little training was given to help acclimate to the ""Abbott way"" of doing things.  You're definitely expected to hit the ground running."
bad,"Growth promote leader doesn't know subject knowledge, even though behave smart enough. If any minor mistakes should denote to the concern person and get rid of it. But they didn't follow it. They tell to every colleagues and work place except concern person. I never tolerated criticism all time."
bad,Po rozdělení společnosti na Abbott a AbbVie již nemám relevantní informace.
bad,Our company was purchased by Alere.  The operations were moved from New Jersey
bad,"Good Company to work"
bad,Corporate politics kill the soul of the company and employees. Too many mergers and re-orgs. Savings are accomplished by reducing headcount rather than addressing poorly negotiated contracts with vendors and remediating technology costs.
bad,"Time Rent A car is very good for me i was dealing in rents costumer"
bad,"Abbott Laboratories is a nice Company, but they don't pay well in their production and manufacturing departments. There is no job security for temp-to-hire's in this company. I worked there for eight months as well, and was never approached for long term employment by any member of management. Like any job, I came to work on time, worked hard, had no problems with fellow co-workers, and I did what I was told to do everyday. However, I was never hired!"
bad,"Typical day at work was at my desk scanning documents into the system. "
good,"A typical day at work includes supporting and spearheading run, sustain and grow the business projects. Gave an opportunity to keep myself abreast with latest technology trends and scientific product advancement. Supportive management to make horizontal transformation and rotation plan. Challenge was doing the task first time right and exceeding the expectations of internal and external customers all the time and every time. Enjoyable part was involvement of management in giving support to build and burn, support trying new technology, tools which would eventually make a difference."
good,"It is more of a boos driven culture. The boss is the deciding factor. He can make or brake you. But on the other hand this is not a good sign for a organisation, the meritocracy should prevail"
good,TP is a work environment without music or windows. Work requires a lot of downtime and nothing to pass the time with. Feels more like a prison than a job.
good,"Production slowed and seven employees were laid off with no notice."
good,Alere is a good company for newly college graduates. It is hard to advance within the company and the pay is low compared to other labs in the area. Your workday is never consistent; one day you may get off on time and another day you may work 10 plus hours.
good,"Very nice work place loved job learned lots of new skills, Very bad language bearer between supervisors. Very nice kitchen staff and chefs.depending on where you work you are treated diffrent. unfortunately job assignment ended."
good,I was not trained well and I worked with negative people every day.
good,"Now Culture is not good at present,not bothered for the employee and family members."
good,"Never enforced English.  Had an overseer as a lead/manager-not management material at all. Many, many things were not taught.  Several weeks of reading SOPs that were never applicable, while no one on one with trainers."
good,"Management does not provide any sense of Direction, or vision to the employees, Senior management not accessible, lack of team environment, Bureaucracy, processes too complex and old fashioned, QMS is too complex to execute"
good,I was at Abbott a short period of time as a contractor. This was my very first corporate job. I was in retail management for many years but needed change. It was a very competitive place to work and required a lot of time to complete tasks but it was a great learning experience for me and opened doors to better opportunities for me. The company eventually relocated to Chicago.
good,The medical device is helping a lot of heart patients. The people that work at this company has a good heart the regular employee. Half of the company is made up of temporary employees.
good,"No acknowledgement of work when well done or when an employee went above and beyond for the job. Management listened to management and not employees. Very intolerant of issues outside work that might impact one's performance. Good people at the bottom of the work rung - hard workers and caring. Not just a job for them, but management was not open to positive change. Had to self-start most of my work without a mentor or guidance."
good,Very good money but the company is target and money driven to the extent that so many people are leaving with no chances given to advance your career.
good,"This was  a cold calling position for me but no sales, the product is offered through insurance at no cost to participants. I feel neutral about the company"
good,"There is many stress, working 7 days a week with no benefits and only the minimum payment, there's people that have been working like temporary workers for over 3 years with no health insurance and none benefits"
good,"A good place to encounter sales profile and growth in the medical sales domain and work in the exciting pharmaceutical industry. "
good,"Not great to work for current managers. Their is no structure. No more room to grow. No training provided. No information provided. No care to the employees. No work/life balance. "
good,"Enjoyed working there. Most enjoyable part of job was being able to work independently A day at work would include keying new hires into the system and what ever changes occurred with them: pay increases, name changes, unemployment claims,verification of employment."
good,No work life balance. Pay is less compare to other MNC. Managers calls even in off time. HR dept is sleeping... No feedback when leaving company.. Stressful. Work life..
good,I was first hired in the maternity dept. We could get as much overtime as possible. Then the company started going down. The CEO and CFO left unexpectedly.
good,"A company with a great products and some good employeers."
good,"While my team and hiring manager were excellent co-workers, my day-to-day supervisor was a relentless micro-manager that held way to many long meetings. The work was very interesting, and I enjoyed it. The schedule seemed to be poorly managed, with expectations and project objectives changing way too often to be productive. I would work for the company again, but not my top choice"
good,"A robot everyday doing the same thing. Only good side was the employees were friendly. Breaks are good, 2 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch break."
good,"Nice place to work. Very loooong hour days. Be prepared not to sleep much. Overall great company to work. If your desire is to make a lot of money, this is place."
good,"Not paid enough for the heavy workload forced on you. Managers can fire you for any reason(aside from discrimination) as per at will contract, they're rude and dismissive."
good,"I came into this job expecting to be hired in on first shift. Upon orientation I found out I would not be hired in, but could apply to some positions open, but they would all be off shift. I like their learning program. I do not like how my department always has to wait for things to be fixed and updated. My department also is not a permanent position."
good,Working here was only for a source of income only. Did not like the environment as it was very adversarial and not open to change.
good,Overall there is no room for advancement. I've put in for many job positions and nothing. I realize that I am stuck even when I get a position because my current position can hold me until they find a replacement. Otherwise great people but no job advancement.
good,"1.every day is very typical in abbott because every day you need new prescription."
good,"A typical day would be a 12-hour shift, using a machine to apply solution onto devices, placed in trays and put into ovens. Once trays are baked for designated time, they are taken out to cool down and put into storage."
good,company is good but management is not good.My co worker is best supporter in my life.
good,"I was hired into Abbott this last year (2012) through a temp agency called manpower, signed a two year contract as a temp there and just a few months later the Warehouse where I'm located is told that they are going to be outsourcing it to another company. It has now been three months since that news and they have yet to do anything. People are leaving and feeling very insecure, as do I! They say they will give a 60 day notice, but I honestly feel that they are just getting rid of the higher paid employees and then hiring in all contract workers for really cheap. My day to day work wasn't hard, but it consists of a lot of math and physical activity. It is stressful going in day in and day out and not knowing whether I will have a job the next day or not. The company isn't what they say. They are not ""A promise for life"" ..."
good,A good place to start your career. prepare marketing plans and train the sales force
good,"A typical work day includes doing 2 or more persons job, having long periods of downtime.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the morning exercises the team does."
good,"Abbott Labs is a great place to start your career and build a solid experience with such a huge company, different teams, and different cultures, the pay is not that good at the beginning though."
good,The jobs themselves at abbott are dull and tedious. The management are always on your back about figures which you can barely control. There is a gulfing divide between the office staff and thefactory workers...
good,Entry Level position working on multiple projects. Workload was fair. Easy to accomplish daily assignments. Small team that I was part of. Fairly laid back environment.
good,Learned many things but no room for advancement unfair pay and incentives. The people in manufacturing were awsome it was the upper management that needed the help.
good,"Management here is pretty clueless about what goes on day to day for an employee. My manager didn’t know how to help with projects and pretty much referred me to very general answers and or templates for advice and help. Also, very poor communication between management and employees. A lot of day to day issues were not addressed by management for days/ weeks. As a contractor management will definitely take advantage of that and you will be forced to work over time. Poor management, making poor choices and causing un nesscary stress."
good,"This is a brutal company to work for, If your face doesn't fit they will release you."
good,there seemed to be preference treatment for certain employees of different cultural backgrounds. Management was never nuetral or honest. Work culture was a downer.
good,"Do not work for Volt. They do not offer anything and they scam people out of pay."
good,"Abbott labs is a great place to work but there are so many factors that come into play in their hiring processes and the way they treat their employees vs their contractors. If you get a full-time job then you should keep it, otherwise..."
good,The company too fragmented and loosely managed with a different line of businesses not communicating with each other. Portfolio diversified too much where it sucks in the profitability and causes strain on business units that perform well
good,"I was a contractor at Abbott for 2 and 1/2 years.  During that time I was treated as a 2nd class citizen.  I could not participate in corporate events and I was ineligible for many of the contests.  I was not allowed to travel to full departmental meeting at other Abbott locations.  When these meetings happened, I was sitting alone in my workspace."
good,"Hmm, where to start after 12+ years with the company they outsource my job to McDonald rejects.   You are a # to Abbott nothing more and nothing less."
good,It was great in the beginning however as time pressed on the demands of the team I supported became unbearable which didn't allow for me to perform my own task and there was no overtime which contributed to the issue
good,"Nice coworkers but management was weak and unfriendly. No matter how hard you worked, you were not compensated and only people from within were put in advanced positions."
good,Good place if you work well independently...Unless you get hired in the door your chances of advancement are minimal unless you want to go to the line on 2nd or 3rd shift.  Or you know someone.
good,"The company has some truly great people but way too many levels of management and way too many little tyrants who don't want to change to meet the current concerns of the world."
good,"Large company, with a lot going on. However, doesn't seem to be the ideal work environment. Employees are stressed, and don't seem to be valued"
good,"A empresa oferece salários compatíveis com o mercado, porém você não tem vida social ."
good,"big company to work for. Management was okay, but some of the workers were shadie, so you need to watch out for."
good,7 1/2 hours in front of the computer. A few warriors in management that fight for junior level employees
good,Great place to launch your career in the healthcare industry.
good,"Used to be a fun place to work. Now it is miserable. Work you to death, very poor compensation."
good,"Typical day was 5:30am-4pm. "
good,"Pull all materials for production daily build schedule and make sure that its transacted to the system. replenish kanban in the clean room in timely manner to prevent line down situation. received incoming materials from the vendor and put away once finish inspection. shipped using fedex system, help out in other area like boxing when my work load is light. enter all sub assy and finish goods in the system."
good,I really don't have too much to say about this company. Good for single people or people that have grown jids like teenagers. Not so good for people with small kids.
good,Great people & excellent benefits. Workload is extensive and expectations are unreasonable. No room for advancement. I do however enjoy the people I work with.
good,"Many ongoing projects but insufficient resources to complete them well in a timely manner. There is not enough focus on employee career development, all development meetings are more progress updates for projects for the company."
good,Depending on your position in the company there's no chance for advancement. If you're hired as an operator you have no opportunity to move up in the company.
good,Security is tight getting into the facility. Most people stay away from your work but are in your business. Day to day tasks were sometimes unattainable. Managers really didn't understand the technology we were using so not much help was given.
good,"Little chance of advancement, no support from management and only basic computer skills needed. You alone were independent and responsible for you self and your work."
good,3 stars only because your experience may vary depending on location the company itself is great. They provide good benefits and decent pay. Work is simple just follow procedures and you should be fine. The only issue I have to say is management and the work culture. Management is crazy everything is always escalated either up or down but nothing really gets done. Personal only get held accountable if you are not in good graces with your leads this can make your workplace really stressful even if you are doing your job correctly it’s either your leads way or see yourself out. There is a lot of favoritism. This becomes an issue when you try to move up. Supervisor will always choose their favorites for new positions it’s really rare to see someone get promoted due to their hard work and effort. Work hours vary but in reality you have no balance. They always change the schedule last minute based on production demands. So don’t make too many plans. Overall good entry level start for people looking for a start.
good,"Watch ur back. Long hours, unpredictable schedule. No work/life balance. Long hours. Good pay, bonus and benefits. Vacation time and Paid sick leave is good. Opportunity for advancement if you play the role."
good,"Mikromanagement, inkompetentes Führungspersonal auf allen Hierachie-Eenen"
good,Employees are sometimes not appreciated. Unequal distribution of work load and changes regarding how one should work often causes disruption in otherwise streamlined routine.
good,"lack of trainings "
good,Once was a good company but the Nutrition business continues to RIF people to meet their profit margins.  Firings do not make the local paper because the organization keeps their releases under the state requirements.
good,the productivity is paramount to everything. I enjoyed the people but sometimes management did not treat you like a person. They just look at your productivity and they did not really care about the person.
good,Abbott have been instrumental in the development of a young person searching for industrial experience. The experience gathered from the company will stand to any individual moving on in their future careers.
good,"It was always a joy to go to work and assist others with technical and management issues.    The workplace culture is very supportive of employees, clients, etc... which reflects the impact on customers."
good,First day on the job co-worker told me that they hadn't Hired anyone in 5years and wouldn't be...I worked temp for a year begged then to o hire me they just laughed or straight walked away from me.
good,"Good co-workers, but management needs a change. They will micromanage and come at you over the smallest thing plus you will be a contracted forever, no room for growth."
good,"Abbott makes it very difficult to balance work and personal life. You must be willing to commit to 12hr days with short notice of Mandatory over time. Overtime is 4hrs. your day should not exceed 12hrs ."
good,"The Alpharetta, GA (AV division) office is truly ran poorly. There has been great talent that has come and go. I’ve never seen such highly eduacated, poor leadership. They truly do not care about the employees. Oh, and work life balance, forget about it. You will not go home until the job is done. I feel sorry for everyone in that office that stays to endure the   abusive behavior . The pay / benefits is excellent but you are going to need it after you are stressed out by this place. RUN!!!"
good,"All and all; St. Jude has an excellent base of employees out of the location which I worked for in Sunnyvale, California."
good,"Although Abbott is a very big company but its work culture is very bad , it may vary from division to division but in my division its the worst I had ever worked in MNC'S"
good,the people are great but job security is poor                                                                                                        .
good,Empresa que esta aún en proceso de integración de su metodo y normas.
good,Learned a great deal working on the international side of the business. Competitive place to work with great team members dedicated to providing excellent customer service to our international co-workers. Critical jobs being outsourced at the moment.
good,"I enjoy coaching .Guiding, encouraging subordinate to perform achieve and earn incentives.Develop customers."
good,"When i started in this company i saw management staff change so many times. Plus there's no more growing in this company i seen workers been here more that 7 years and still an temporary employee, and i saw new hire for six months that become permanent because is dad is the manager on that department"
good,Work life balance is not what they say it is in most areas.  Benefits are good.  The employee's are wonderful.  I've learned a lot here and have grown greatly in my career.
good,"Good benefits, awesome peers, fun job however, over the past few years new middle management in the dept I worked in turned very bad."
good,"Lately after management change, Abbott became unfair to employees and I believe they will divest their pharmaceutical business soon."
good,"This company provides with good compensation and benefits, however the work/life balance is not good. Must be willing to work overtime frequently, change shifts, departments, etc. The company and it's policies are constantly changing and management does what they can to work with the ever-changing environment, how ever it still falls short in making it's employees feel confortable. The company has a long road of  when it comes to improving/updating its processes, which can be very difficult for the employees."
good,"The best part about the job is getting to work with the Business Systems and being able to use your Analytical skills to resolve technical issues."
good,"Business is not growing making advancement difficult. Otherwise, good company.  A lot of red tape though makes innovation difficult."
good,problem of sigma it's family business and no multi-national policy.
good,"the overall company is good. I enjoyed working there but some managers lack insight on their team, and unwilling to change with the growing field so fell behind.  I learned a lot about helping to set up a work flow that would be successful in their environment, but was unable to have it applied to the team. hardest part of the job as any job is learning all the small differences between all the companies we support, and the most enjoyable part was the feel of accomplishment when you were able to help someone out of a hard situation."
good,"Wonderful group of people, great teamwork and workflow. We entered in all new vendor information and updated current vendors."
good,"the job itself is not bad at all, the work environment is clean and the workers are good, work load is even and fair, but there is no job security never knowing when there will be yet another mass layoff and there are no benefits or bonus' to speak of."
good,"A great place to work at for 1 year or 2 and then take your experience and get out."
good,I think salary and benefits of this company should be improved.
good,My coworkers are great and very knowledgeable.  This is a very interesting job and is a customer service person's ideal job.  However it was changed to a sales position without the sales bonuses or commissions and became challenging for those who were not interested in sales.
good,Its a routine everyday at work. if you don't have an initiative you will be stuck at a work station. Great training programs but never got to use it to excel through a different job title/possession because of lack of promotions and unfair evaluations. The hardest part of my job is not really getting any recognitions on the hard work n efforts that was put in to excel through the company. The best part of being at work is when I get asked to work with engineers for some RnD(research and development) work because I get to learn from well experienced technicians and engineer making the next generation product
good,"*most enjoyable part of the job: the targeted participants themselves, you get to share their excitement and joy about their pregnancy "
good,"Abbott es una excelente empresa a nivel mundial, desgraciadamente a nivel país aqui en México, tiene muchos procesos lentos y con perjuicios generalmente para los puestos más bajos, las prestaciones son buenas pero más que nada para empleados casados y con familia."
good,"I have been working here beyond the call of my duty, that's why my TL highly appreciate my loyalty to the organization and job. My TL and managers are great guys. They always help me whenever I have a problem, so, I have learned a lot of things from them which is going to be very useful in my future career. Nothing is hard for me, if I have the will to cope the difficulties, without problems we are not going to learn and grow. But one thing worth mention here is high work pressure, sometimes it's a seems hard. I love challenge, so, I feel happy as I have learned so much that's why I am enjoying my job. Co-workers are very co-operative, so enjoying work here."
good,"If you do, just make sure it's not in the Marketing Department.  The basic problem with Alere is that the company is really lacking innovation and it is having trouble keeping up with the Joneses. Granted, it is dependent upon which division you work in, but generally, you will feel like you're dead in the water. "
good,Training is conduct through reading and signing off protocols on Master Control software. No formal training is provided. Professionalism within company is lacking within low and middle tier employees. Majority of employees seem to be on the edge due to communication issues between various departments.
good,"good place to work, shifts are easy to plan around, training provided and easy to follow"
good,"I loved what I did and the people I worked closely with and my customers. I felt that management really listened to our suggestions and gave us the ability to make decisions without micromanaging. This made me want to work even harder and really make sure things were done timely and accurately. My staff were amazing and really put in 150% effort. They where always there for me when I needed the job done. This all changed when the last merger took place and the company was larger than the main company we were working for. The management from the other company took over the overall business, and the mentality of customer service went out the door. I was directly told by another manager from the other company that if the customers dont like it they can go somewhere else, well guess what happened, I found out that is exactly what they did. So said to hear this when the services we provided to the insurance susbcribers where so beneficial to them."
good,Very demanding 12 hour shift schedules stressful you are making parts that saves lives intricate quality assurance a must morale low
good,A typical day was anything but typical insomuch as work load.
good,My current position has showed me a new side of nursing. I have learned how to assess patients over the telephone. My co-workers are enjoyable. Without them it would be even more difficult to work my shift. The most difficult thing about my job for me is that it does not challenge me mentally nor does it allow me to spend much quality time with my family due to my shift being a mid-shift. I am a person who needs stimulation and do not feel like my current position provides mental stimulation.
good,Structure is setup as a work at home environment. Using the Avaya dialer system I make outbound calls to participants and also inbound calls for enrollment of Health and Wellness Prenatal program.
good,"Abbott is a huge company with many fields of work available to its employees."
good,Not much of a place to go if you want to use your head. Place will sure keep you busy. The management is definitely supportive along with the staff as well
good,"If you work several years, the pension program will benefit your retirement. The starting salary for new graduate usually is a bit lower than the market and industry."
good,U r work was tedious and stress full related to business module which the organization was running... And more over office politics was taking toll of the work. Culture good disturbing and more as unfriendly nature.
good,Worked here for 10+ years was brilliant at the start.Due to a great team & manager. Everything changed in the past few years.Toxic Environment don’t let the nice building fool you in late they have hired the most horrible head strong people..everyday there and was someone upset.
good,I have never seen such poor management as I have at this company. The front line leads can make calls on a employee's life that will and can forever change their life and not in a good way.
good,I was looking for an environment that would be more of a mentor ship and the environment was not. I found myself questioning everything I did while I was there to the point I didn't trust my own judgement.
good,Order fulfillment was the primary job for domestic and international customers. Products to be shipped are stored in -20 degree freezers and picked utilizing an antiquated ERP system. Management support for system improvement(s) were negligible.
good,"Abbott pays well, but there is no room for advancement and the majority of employees are contractors.  Upper management seems to do whatever they want without good explanation.  They also make promises to employees that they will be hired on and than there is no follow through.  The majority of the time you hear, ""it is not in the budget""."
good,"The work environment is clean. Most of the team members are good to work with but the management is absolutely terrible. Immature and ill-equipped people are promoted by the upper management because they all hangout together. There is no appropriation for hard work. Abbott has a policy for raises that goes like this. If you have 10 people, you have to have 3 high performers and 4 mid range(good  performers) and 3 needs improvement performers. It doesn't matter how you work because they have to pick 3 people to take the raises from to give it to the top 3 people. Merit raises dished out this way once a year. sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. They robe 3 good workers to give to good raises to 3 suck ups!  Very inconsistent application of Company policy. Suck ups thrive at Abbott."
good,"Management came off as unfair and favoring certain employees."
good,"Since Abbott acquired St. Jude Medical in January 2017, I did not have a lot of history with Abbott.  Abbott did a global ""RIF"" that impacted my HR team and myself in June of 2017.  Six months was my total tenure at Abbott.  My impressions were not very favorable during that time frame.  I was with St. Jude Medical the majority of my time and it was more culturally visceral and employee engaging, in my opinion."
good,Abbott Labs is overall a good company to work for. Management does not back up their employees al the time. Then company offered good benefits such as health insurance and  also has an indoor gym. Have a two week shut down at Christmas.  The management could use people skill seminars in order to deal with the employees needs. They are not flexible with the employees about family matters. One pro is the company offers classes fr the employees but not management
good,en general es buen trabajo pero tiene mala jefatura. no saben de liderazgo y eso evita que las personas opten a mejores puestos.
good,"Given duties of a janitor, no clear direction, managed poorly - just a big mess!  Given long list of duties with no clear way to report actual hours and then got complaints of overtime reporting.  High pay to admins and office workers, while laborers got peanuts.  Too much focus on ""Workers Com"" injuries instead of worrying about whether the worker was actual ok or not.  This particular site closed down and I'm sure is different at other sites."
good,"Work weeks were pretty easy (was in a Manager role, 3 years post MBA) - perhaps 30-40 hours of real work / week. Things are slow moving, and politics are central to success."
good,Before Abbott restructured it was a good company to work for.  My role was a capital sales specialist initially but then was changed to a hybrid Account Manager/Field Service tech.
good,Most production lines are under staffed. Keeping equipment running sometimes challenging. Along with quality checks. Pay raises are based on yearly evaluations by supervisor tends to be most popular gets best pay raises. I liked profit sharing check once a year 1st week of Dec.
good,This was a start-up company that relocated an arm of the business to Reno. It was a good company to work for but some of the management was a struggle to work with.
good,Poor guidance from upper management. Current manager is never available when needed.  Work/ life balance is non-existent.  They hire when they really need people and when everyone is stretched very thin.
good,A good ol boy culture that is at least 20 years behind the rest of the manufacturing world. People of color are treated differently and will be reprimanded if they speak out.
good,Abbott was a good place to gain experience but not a place to stay long term. Management is afraid of change and often resistant to innovation. Not recommended for long term employment.
good,"It's not so great place to work but is a stable, long term career, however it takes 2 years to get converted.  Quality is important but speed is also counts, the Supervisor there will push you until you meet the out come or target of the day."
good,"The company culture is very poor. Internal politics is so much that there is hardly any scope of growth for the freshers to grow."
good,"Abbott seems not to value leadership as a core skill or competency. Furthermore, the culture and attribute of caring for its employees is no longer practiced."
good,"Vision care is a great industry, lots of exciting times ahead but little upward mobility, management and culture are poor and need a lot of work.  HR is non-existent."
good,"Very slow in advancement. No one wants to take responsibility for failure.  A lot of ""Not"" my department or I do not know how!"
good,"great co-workers, front line leaders need way more training, sr. front line leaders need tons of training on how to run deparements, plant and operations managers great to work with ."
good,"Carrying out recalibration of feedpumps."
good,"Planejamento fundamental para atingir metas diárias de 13 visitas aos clientes e pontos de vendas visando alavancar negócios;"
good,"-I first check daily reminder from my calendar, completed various administrative duties as well, including drafting documents and emails, checking my calendar as well as my manager's.  filing and provide strong customer service and resolved customer issues. "
good,"Typical day work"
good,"Typical pharmaceutical sales job without the doctor visit part, distributor dominated industry, new venture in to OTC with long term view of increasing contribution to overall Abbott group business to 5% , hardest part is to get distributors aligned to the FMCG style of working and retaining a motivated team month on month."
good,Challenging and a workplace with lots of competitive individuals. Working in sales is exciting and thrilling. It makes you assertive and reach for your goals in a competitive way though salary is not that attractive it still gives me the passion to motivate myself in achieving sales quota for commission. I realize though that I still need to find job with higher pay.
good,"A lot of the IT positions are being outsourced now (Help desk, ITSM).  Many people have been there 20-30 years, but most new hires are contractors.  As is common, favorite managers escape the ax to move to new departments.  Early schedule - many people leave by 3:30pm."
good,This job has taught me the importance of clearly identifying needs and goals both within and between departments when organizations merge. Working with my team and getting to know others through the company's Toastmasters club has been the best part of my job.
good,"A typical day for me consists of scope work on current projects, tasks around the lab and conducting EIS experiments."
good,"The site had a lot of compliance challenges (lots of issues with basic GMP compliance. Always in a rush to get compliance tasks done but seldom concerned about taking the time to get things right the first time. Unrealistic timelines with same core of knowledgeable people assigned to projects; management by chaos. Employment instability (frequent lay offs, always waiting for the ax to fall). Too much dependence on temp workers that are not invested in company/quality. Many stressed out people. A lot of good people working there, interesting technology but getting a bit dated to very dated. Laid back culture."
good,"Nice Company"
good,"organize team activities, Calls and missions , tracking the sales and planning for marketing activities. roll play with the team to ensure about transferring right and correct massages."
good,"I'd would have to say my experience in Alere inc. was unfair for a whole 2 years of hard work, and remained a temporary employee, there for i had to make the decision to quit and move on to find better opportunities."
good,"i thought everyday is new for me i find new challenges and new scenerio daily when i came in office, faced difficulties, challenges, task, experiments and contests etc. Although my hardest part of my job was the strike day when i came through my foot atleast 4.5 kilometers during Year end in 2013, hopefully it was my enjoyable day also as well because that particular day i found my ability for handling the responsibilty of the particular situation"
good,During my time at Abbott I learned a great deal about working in a laboratory environment.  I developed an understanding of the demands of patient care from a laboratory perspective.  I worked in the field during the duration of my employment at Abbott.  I had solid support within my field team from my peers.
good,"i learned a lot here on customer relationship management , distribution management"
good,Management was hard to communicate with on all levels. There was no work-life balance but good benefits.
good,Company is in constant audit remediations. Culture is very heirarcal and there is a lot of passive aggressive tention built up between labs.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo bueno, comedor en planta con turnos rotativos"
good,"As an individual contributor I was required to be resourceful. I had to locate contacts, problem solve, be on my toes, fully understand the business and other areas responsibilities. "
good,Verry demanding.  Focus changes daily.  Every day is a fire drill.
good,"Manage Oracle migrations and upgrades."
good,"As i have mentioned in Review Summary I have learn't everything regarding Pioneering , Achieving , Caring and Enduring From Abbott .But present Management want to put everything on First Line they do not want to listen about District Problem . The Hardest part of My Job is that I have to listen for the matter for which I am not Directly Responsible . I enjoy meeting Different Customer with different Specialty and Developing Good Relation with them ."
good,"This was a great place to work when I started in 2007. Nice people, encouraging and caring management. If you worked hard you were compensated accordingly. Then late in 2011 and early 2012 things changed. The company decided to split apart and the leaders became overwhelmingly concerned with achieving the highest stock price and dominating the competition. The focus on safety, quality, customer service, and work life balance were all sacrificed in the name of corporate profits. They have since cut numerous experienced, high performing hourly employees."
good,Good Company offers good environment to work and work life balance
good,I am involved in product development in the diagnostics division. A typical day begins at 8 am and ends at 6 pm.
good,Management style is hierarchical. Publishers work well together as a team.
good,Very different job experance.
good,This was at one time a fabulous place to work. Now you are constantly worrying if your department is going to be the next to be laid off. There is very little advancement. I was actually told my priorities where not in the right place when I put family over working very long hours.
good,"While Abbott provides great compensation and benefits, it's core values lack integrity. Do not ever file a worker's compensation claim if you want to keep your job. Do not bother to go to Human Resources regarding discrimminatory practices. While they provide in service regarding policy and comformity with the law, it is not enforced in the workplace."
good,I worked on an assembly line. The pay was good and benefits. The work was boring. I worked second shift.
good,"12 hours shifts to prevent having to pay overtime. No home work life balance. Night shift was inexperienced and was full of new people, increased stress."
good,"They use mostly contractors to fill their positions. "
good,"Good people who were working under a system that had some bugs."
good,"Honestly this job was very misleading. They tell you you will be in R&D but the truth is you're just a glorified computer programmer. No physical bench work is done, and no actual experiments are done. This is a good job for people right out of college, but don't expect to use any of your class room knowledge or research knowledge/ skills at this job."
good,"Abbott là một mái nhà tốt cho tất cả mọi người mới bước chân vào nghệ trình dược viên, hoặc người đã có nhiều kinh nghiệm."
good,Financially minded and driven company that worked at a fast pace and delivered results every quarter. Company culture is heavily influenced by striving for excellence
good,Interessante esperienza che mi ha permesso di approfondire la mia conoscenza in ambito regolatorio ma finalizzata ad un progetto di durata troppo breve
good,Overall ok experience. Job was monotonous after awhile got bored. People are friendly and they feed you a bunch. Very fast paced and they expect a lot from you. Best time to work if you want to move up would be the later shifts.
good,I worked in an incredibly competitive industry within Abbott. The territory lacked team work. They compensate decently and benefits are good. It was hard to take PTO.
good,Didnt work for long. Would love to go back and work to experience the culture there. Did not regret my time at Abbott. It was an experience although it's a short time
good,"Abbott Laboratories is a good job to get your foot in the door. They are helpful and gives lots of support if needing assistance. "
good,"I've worked at worse places, and I have work at better. For a major corporation, it's not too bad. But its a huge corporation, so just be prepared for that kind of environment."
good,"As a contractor, they prefer to bring in new hires full time rather than promoting from within for similar positions. Very very bureaucratic in the way they handle the hirings, and I feel once you are contract, you stay contract. You do work with a life saving technology and get good exposure to different facets of the SDLC which is nice. Good resume fodder. Overall, not a bad place to work, if you are a permanent employee"
good,"I am not sure the management knew how to handle a quick expansion to generate revenue. The structures they put in place, especially in Africa, did not make sense to me."
good,"Very poor leadership.  Health benefits are good as well as discount on Abbott products.  Raises are very poor, maybe 2% per year.  There is no common sense by senior management in making business decisions."
good,High turnover rates for employees and management. I have been through 5 directors/acting directors in my time there. Fair benefits package and good work schedules.
good,"I was a contract worker covering for maternity leave.  Overall I think this is a great company if you can get full time salary.  However my review is based on being a contract worker."
good,"work creatively and efficiency as a typical day at work. Due to management, laid off is very common. Company will hire employees back, but as contractor with no benefits."
good,"very busy place to work, sometimes I'm stuck with these pieces waiting for the engineer to verify the problems it holding the work flow so i have to decide to put it aside to continue for the next assembly of parts thats the hardest part of the job i learned to be inpatient."
good,"Abbott employs talented, wonderful individuals who desire to make a difference in the quality of life for people around the world. The benefits are wonderful. The opportunities are endless."
good,The work environment was pleasant.  Lots of employees worried about job security and having departments shut down.  There were plenty layoffs during my contract.
good,"Abbott was the tough place to work with, one mistake and you are out, the manager was not helpful, have to figure out at your own, the manager was never interested who is working at its best so had tough time to be hired at full time employee,  No Medical benefits provided. no time off.no sick leave,"
good,"It was a serious work place, sometimes could be cut-throat. Helps you grow as an adult. Can be a harsh environment from time to time but it can also be a very nice work place, you can meet nice people."
good,"Empresa Multinacional, muitos benefícios e salário bom. Empresa cumpria com suas obrigações com os colaboradores. A parte mais difícil na empresa era a gerecia e o clima para se trabalhar. "
good,"Abbott has the potential to be a great and satisfying work environment.  The downside is that they do not base hiring or promotion opportunities based on your experience, knowledge, or ability.  Rather, it is based on internal relationships."
good,Having a manager you connect and get along with is key for success in any role.  There are opportunities for advancement and leadership if you choose this route
good,getting along with my co workers loving my everyday job day by day i've learned alot of things when im new to them. hardest part is when my co worker is off and i have to do extra work.
good,Abbott is not loyal to their emplyee they trend to fire people for no reason . I worked fo abbott for almost 3 year and i did not had good experience after my 3rd year my boss changed. and my dream jo  turned out to
good,Me abstenho de compartilhar informações sobre a empresa
good,Enjoy working there. Work for almost 5 years. Good place to learn QMS & documentation.good management & co-operative colleagues.  But job security is very less.
good,"I've worked in two different departments while employed here. The first was the best work experience that I've ever had. Great management, great team, motivated, devoted employees that supported each other and were happy to share their knowledge. The second was the opposite."
good,"Self start, consistent workflow. Inbound call center for maternal care accounts. Post Pardum depression checks and difficult pregnancy follow up. Coordinate  care for pregnant members and inform the member of additional benefits for prenatal care.  Managers are fair. Work place environment strict and fast pace. Back to back calls with very little time to clear a case.  Rewards system for team that have the best quality for the month encouraged healthy competition."
good,"Great job, very strict management, treat their employee badly, always making up rules to get people fired, management is barely there but have something bad to say about production team when in meeting. Overall great environment and CEO, thought me a lot about processing and molding machinery set-up. The tech were amazing at what they do and never complained when ask for help to fix a machine malfunction. There's a goal to be made everyday for each station and shift to calculate the production of the day, if you don't make your day you risking your employment."
good,Culture was a relaxed environment. If there was a budget to hire perm then i would have definitely stayed at this company. Met some great people here.
good,"Working in Abbott is very stressfull, very noisy, and a very fast paced environment, you should be very careful of what you are doing because you might get in to accident, watch out what to do and where to go."
good,"Recently Company outsourced most of the shared services function and continue to cut down permanent positions.  Rather hire a contractor than a permanent employee.  Several permanent employees working more than 10 hours a day, very stressful now a day.  "
good,lots of administrative work.  Micro Management  style .  company policies changed often and not communicated to field reps in a timely fashion.  No accountability form upper management for District Managers management style.  Refusal to take feedback from field reps.
good,was a little disappointed with the culture in the company. people have two faces at work and is hard to get a permanent position here. older employees do not look happy and they feel they are stuck there. no growth possible.
good,"This is an old school company. Companies in this industry tend to be still very slow to adapting work practices, benefits, and culture. It's very hierarchy based and the CEO has been around for 20 years. The people are very sensitive to be called out to be innovative or do anything differently than before."
good,"Abbott strives to be a great company to work for.  It is one of the few American companies left with defined retirement benefits."
good,The job was to operate machine as part of a production line. Attention to details was very important missing a step or not following a procedure will cause the items to be on hold and even unacceptable for public use.
good,"Great place for someone looking to advance quickly, must have a strong mind and firm shoulders or the work can consume you."
good,time is money and money is time..... production line were always down due to a major lack of training and incompetent individuals .. ended by closing shop..
good,"coworkers are awesome, but don't expect to ever get hired, Abbott care more about its numbers than its people. Abbot dosent hire many people they like to have big bonuses for higher up management and Execs"
good,The job is outbounf and you have quotas to meet but there is no incentives for meeting quotas. Don't care for management because they are not professional in terms of the policy. The management team makes determinations based on their own personal feelings or relationship regarding employees.
good,"Alere San Diego actively seeks new talent for their company, mostly in a medical device manufacturing environment. Days can either be loosely or strictly scheduled, depending on department. Advancement to upper management is static for most positions. A significant number of employees are hired on a contractor/temporary basis, and advancement to full time employee can often be a challenge."
good,This company is a good place to work for the those whose focus is earnings only. You can be swallowed up by internal rules and regulations and with so many goals to be achieved you are bound to trip up.
good,"•	Worked at call center for recall of baby food product"
good,"I worked in the call center and the average day is taking in-coming calls which can range from 50 to 80, answering emails and performing daily reports or projects assigned to you. I learned how to function and meet required goals through management. The work required lots of communication with co-workers, warehouses,sales and distributors. The hardest part of the job is being able to handle all different types of calls with only a certain amount of talk time allotted. I enjoyed the customer service side of my job such as helping out and at times getting critical medicals shipments out and delivered on time."
good,Typical day at work involved working at a certain part of the production line. I personally was trained on 7 different station so could of been assigned to any one of those 7. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Management was not very interactive with the line workers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and building new relationships.
good,"Alere provides an opportunity to learn about various state Medicaid programs. I have learned a great deal about how state Medicaid works and its provisions for pregnant women, as well as state medicaid policy and procedures.. Alere is a company that specializes in providing various services for pregnant women. These services include weekly injections for preterm labor and core pumps for at risk pregnant women. A typical day at Alere is pretty laid back except at months in, where the company has to reach monthly quotas for revenue. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful and provide a positive work environment. Management is okay, but could improve on employee shortages and strain placed on current employees who are not afforded time off due to those shortages.The hardest part of the job is meeting productivity quotas at the end of each month. With the high number of phone calls and emails that must be completed it becomes very challenging in getting cases completed by the end of the day. Overall, I have learned to do my job more efficiently and effectively which is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"learning about new technologies"
good,"Daily responsibilities consisted of data entry using Amber Road operating system to consolidate international air shipments which varied by country day to day.  Followed by establishing contact with freight forwarders who received Abbott freight and booked flights to destination. Responsible for shipment documentation to included Customs paperwork for each shipment. "
good,Company was changing from merger with another company.  Management did not understanding employee relations.
good,"Although the benefits and work life balance are good, the company is experiencing great change, which leaves many employees feeling insecure about their future at Abbott."
good,"Work life/balance can be better - work very long hours and busy"
good,"Busy and very detail oriented tasks. Great cafeteria. Large site."
good,"Abbott is a high stress, result oriented company.  However the attitudes and atmosphere have changed dramatically since the split into Abbott and Abvie.  Previously Abbott has been know for it’s science, health and nutritional expertise, a recent press release makes it sound like Abbott is an investment company. The new Abbott is still finding it's sea legs for the continued voyage forward."
good,Its good place to work but I want to grow in heirarchy as I have alredy spent 7 yrs into pharma field
good,"I was brought into Abbott in an interim capacity to manage their Managed Service Department as part of their Commercial department.  This involved managing their largest contract with Greater Glasgow & Clyde Healthcare Board and much travel to Glasgow.  Despite the complexities of the contract and the many third parties feeding into this contract I possess much experience in this area and was able to apply these to this situation."
good,Highly competitive work place. Some managers do not treat individuals fairly although individuals may excel in work.
good,"I started in a new department that was reviewing a high volume of expense data for State and Federal transparency reporting.  I had a lot to understand, review and analyze to ensure we reported our expenses accurately and to the reporting standards.  I have been able communicate to various departments and executive levels management.  Additionally, I was the direct contact to IT on implementation of a check request database program to collective gather data to assist with reporting.  I have trained over 300 employees as well as 7 members in my group on how to complete the reporting of data.  I learned so much like helpful excel functions to assist my audit, to presentational skills, to IT terminology, to project management and how various departments in a Medical Device company function. I was extremely challenged with a task that was new to the company and businesses Statewide.  It was so interesting to see such new reporting and facing the challenges head-on. I enjoyed working with so many employees and different departments."
good,I enjoyed the environment but due to budget cut backs they could not afford a trainer to come out and properly train me on their DevEx system. This caused slowdowns and my inability to perform many needed functions. There was no stability in this department which is why I left.
good,"They are great place to start, if you can tolerate the hours.  All new people are stuck on 3rd shift so there is no one with any experience if there is a problem.  No chance for advancement unless you are interested in management."
good,I felt institutionalized and funneled into a void of happiness. It was strangely depressing in Waukegan and on campus. Other than that I would say it's an excellent company that produces one of kind products.
good,"Fast paced, constantly changing direction. ""Thanks for what you did yesterday, but what have you done for me lately?"""
good,A empresa precisa amadurecer com relação a programas no gerenciamento de funcionários e visão de mercado.
good,"Abbott was once one of the best companies for which one could work. That has changed. It is no longer run the way it once was. In the new leaner economy, its management and executives have started working toward a leaner model but have not taken time to learn or understand why the company was once so great, its employees."
good,"the work was fine, the people were friendly. no benes because i was a contractor. but i was laid off after only 3 months of a six-month contract due to ""budget cuts"". i was the only one laid off, and i happened to be pregnant, which i had not known when i was hired. i was laid off after the end of a work week, while on my way home, by phone. that was two months ago, and i have still not been able to get them to return my personal items from my cubicle. i have been very disappointed in the way they have handled this. the work was not bad, but i definitely would not leave a good job to take one here. they don't seem to be very reliable."
good,I worked for my department for five years. Due to new merging my department soon became outsourced but I enjoy my entire staff. The company is very willing to assist their employee to transition into different roles within the company.
good,It wad a great learning experience i would recommend this job if anyone likes warehouse work and don't have an issues with body functions i just wish i could have stayed with the company longer it was a good part time job
good,"company is a  good company for what they are but contractors are treated somewhat unfairly,"
good,Overall a laid back and easy going atmosphere.  Working on medical devices is highly regulated so there tends to be a lot of delays in getting work done. You will never see the end of documentation.
good,"Over half of all employees at Abbott are labeled as ""contractors"" or ""temps"" despite working there for years, all to avoid providing benefits to their workers. A colleague of mine was converted to a full-time employee of the company only after 4 years in the same HR position; I've heard of people working as long as 7 years before conversion. It's an unfortunately common practice among corporations, but it's nonetheless a problem that needs to be addressed."
good,Stressful position with poor morality and little chances for advancement. Management is extremely poor at the higher levels. Salary and benefits were good.
good,"They have expectations that if you work there, then they own you. A lot of very fake management. You are just a number, they are very cold blooded and would put your family in the streets if it was gonna save a dollar."
good,They dont promote from within and if they do you have to be buddies with the supervisor. They give the good jobs on the line to there friends and buddies
good,"Ever since Alere changed to Abbott, things have changed drastically! we had a huge lay off and it affected us really bad where we was working 6 days a week, working during holidays, working over 100hrs (this was going on for 3 months). the pay was good cause they were offering double pay. It’s a good work environment, everyone is like a family... just wish they’ll pay us more especially for the OGs that’s been riding with the company during that stressful lay off."
good,"Great place to work if you’re a new grad looking to bolster your resume and work in a professional environment. However if you’re expecting to become anything more than a contract worker you may want to think again. They will keep renewing your 1 year contact indefinitely so they don’t have to pay for your benefits. If you want to become permanent or move up, expect to do a lot of brown nosing. Typically only a small percentage of the contract workers you work with will go permanent. And it doesn’t matter how good they are but rather how much brown nosing they do and office politics. Overall it’s a good company but don’t think of it as the end all of places to work. I would consider taking less pay somewhere else that offers benefits."
good,The product that we manufactured and distributed to hospitals is amazing and I am proud to be a part of that. The people that I worked with on a daily basis are great.
good,"They hire people from agencys just used them for watever work thier behind on, i work hard never absent learn everything thing they trained me in.. is a waste of time they trained u good n @ the end they dont hire u even if ur good in wat they trained u at waste of time"
good,Abbott does great things but it often comes with a cost.  Recent reduction in force has left most departments so poorly staffed that it is very difficult to conduct business day to day.  I once supported Abbott and their vision but that is not longer the case.  I wish them well.
good,"It's an ok company to work for the money is good."
good,The company has great benefits but culture is very cut throat and high stress.  Mangement is very tactical in approach and is shortsighted with vision
good,"Es una organizacion con procesos muy bien estructurados, se preocupa mucho por el aprendizaje del empleado"
good,"Abbott has a very strong race issue. They do offer clubs and organizations for diversity. However, outside of these hubs the day to day is lacks culture and diversity. Management has no idea what they're doing and cuts to entire sectors can happen over night. Essential staff can also be laid off at a moments notice. The only good thing about this job is that the pay is amazing. You will be stuck making good money for a job that will take you to an early grave."
good,"Despite sending us emails about how well the company has done each quarter, the layoffs continue."
good,"Clean room environment, very fast paste. Learned to operate multiple machines. Management was far. Workplace culture was as treated fairly. The hardest part of the job would be catching up on processing units when a machine is down/operator's work ethic."
good,The company has great benefits and really cares about employees. The overall company culture is healthy. This location has no job advancement and really toxic management.
good,"Overall, Abbott is a great place to work with great people and managers. As a medical device company, the managers and employees do well to make everyone feel included in day to day operations and offer plenty of work-life balance learning and opportunities."
good,"Difficulty in job advancement. Hiring process is insanely slow. No sign on bonuses or end of year bonuses unless you're in sales. Pretty good benefits, PTO, and sick days."
good,"Long days with poor management from directors on up. Unreal expectations on meeting deadlines, hard work rarely noticed or appreciated let alone acknowledged."
good,I work for this company through a temporary agency. I enjoyed my time working for this company. The environments was great the assignments and the people were good.
good,Layoff. No guarantee that they're going to keep everybody that they have on order that the hours will be the same or consistent as they used to be the work is hard but the job is good the pay is good
good,"High pressure job, not for the faint hearted. Management is very indecisive. Ofiice politicking is a very common practice to gain promotion in the company."
good,"There was a time that Abbott was known for never laying off, now everything is being sourced out.  The pay and benefits are good but the climate is very stressful.  Management has always been a problem at Abbott.  More of a ""good old boys club"" in the old days.  There was a time when Management, managed their employees and were there to encourage, and help them do their best.  Now it seems that its more of a dictatorship and it is my feeling that Management feel they are managers because they are smarter than everyone that works for them.  When I first started working at Abbott over 20 years ago, I was proud to work there and felt like I belong to a great company and felt like they cared about me and I wasn't just a number, therefore I was very loyal.  It's completely a different company with the existing CEO."
good,Alere has been through numerous acquisitions and name changes in the last several years. This contributes to the lack of any real identity or culture. It suffers from lack of processes and very segregated systems and departments. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. It has been a stable paycheck but offers little in the way of advancement.
good,"I work hard at this level,but my passion for this field is not permanent I will try hard for more better job on graduation level at any best firm or company."
good,It's a good place to work they pay well unlimited OT and the benefits are excellent. Although the 12 HR shifts can be a burden it is manageable. I would recommend Abbott as a company to work for
good,"there are lot of things to learn from abbott nutrition in terms of career growth, however life and work balance is less.still i recommend abbott for work place for a learning experience."
good,"Abbott was great to start out with as an entry level employee. Throughout the past five years though I have noticed they are resistant to change and do not do a great job at noticing and promoting talent."
good,"The job was production and was tedious, however, it offered many opportunities for advancement. The hours were midnight hours so you often felt drained because it was difficult to sleep during the day once you returned home from your shift"
good,Alere had a great culture despite issues with many products. Each company that was purchased by Alere had good products to start that seemed to get worse when Alere took over.
good,I only worked at the company for a short time period before being offered a position with a different company. It was very challenging working third shift. Coworkers were very friendly and made it easier to adjust to the schedule.
good,Great job work and life balance plus most of the employees are awesome people. Unfortunately the work process and technology is behind making the job stressful and sometimes unbearable.
good,"While the compensation was great, the expectations are somewhat unreasonable. There is no way to be a productive sales rep with all of the administrative work that is piled on the sales representatives. I would find myself working until midnight each night just to be able to complete all of the unnecessary administrative work that was asked of me."
good,"Abbott is a very productive organisation with focus on Goal,need to give more attention to the employees who works in ground level."
good,"-Positive Work experience but there was limited opportunities for advancement.  "
good,Abbott Immunology very transition in inception of new products. Broad portfolio of market segments without strategic territory analysis. Best served with reps who are niche to specialties and proven track record in subset.
good,"This was a great experience, I was able to learn so much and visit many place. The Clincal and Technical exposure was very professional. The hard part was the 24 hour contracts that were very demanding on all phases of life."
good,"I was hired to fill in for an employee that was on maturity leave, The management team did not give enough information on various projects. no chance for advancement"
good,"I am in a Neuropsychiatry division of Abbott India Ltd."
good,"I Am Attached With The Job of Medico Sales And Marketting. Where In One Side I Always Have To Be Updated About Marketting Scenarios, I Have To Know My Products,My Competitor Also, & On Other Sides Achieve My Target Month After Month."
good,"Accountable for sales growth of of diabetic monitors in territory, Market Share and RXs. Collaborated with Managed Care and Retail and Point of Care representatives."
good,Vooral  hectisch rond de pick-up tijden. Veel overwerk. Pick en pack werkzaamheden. Gewerkt met SAP systeem. Heftruckcertificaat behaald. Er gaan maandelijks mensen in en uit. Collega's kon ik het goed mee vinden. Werd vrijwel op alle plaatsen in magazijn ingezet. Allround magazijnmedewerker.
good,"Empresa muito dinâmica e busca respostas muito rápidas."
good,"Apesar de pouco tempo na empresa, pude aprender muito e dividir experiencias com colegas de trabalho."
good,"Horrible, micromanage? more like nanomanage. Great products and good technology. Abbott does not care about their employees. I miss  the Guidant days."
good,"1) Atendimento comercial das contas chave. Negociação de ações promocionais, positivação de produtos nas filiais, introdução no mix das redes dos novos produtos, desenvolvimento de planos de ação e etc.."

A solution-oriented change advocate, leveraging keen eye for detail to ensure the highest level of accuracy and strict adherence to all regulatory requirements, while successfully and smoothly initiating significant and innovative process improvements."
good,Not very encouraging when it comes to compensating hard working employees.
good,"Scientific and Challenging Environment:"
good,"•	Used TrackWise to generate the change control number and  manage the change control flow"
good,"Visiting Doctors, understanding their attitudes towards medical representatives of different companies, communicating effectively about your company's products and conducting RCPA for further analysis of doctors prescriptions."
good,"La tipica giornata di lavoro è: alzarsi la mattina, salire sull'automobile e girare per tutta la provincia per cercare di vendere i prodotti ai clienti."
good,very low salary for industry standards. good place to start career and move on to better paying companies.
good,"-Pick and ship health products to customers."
good,The company always welcomes innovative promotional activities
good,Coached and developed PSR for results
good,"But then, nowhere is a good place to work if you are a contractor. When I was employed there, they were under a perpetual hiring freeze, which seems to have not changed. They made a regular habit out of staffing the core of their operations (manufacturing, testing, the people who actually did all the work) exclusively with temps, only they would constantly use the cop out excuse that they were on a hiring freeze. It was not uncommon to hear the phrase ""I'm sorry, we can't give you full time this year, but maybe next year"" repeated ad infinitum, to the point that people were kept on contract with their wages frozen and without benefits for as much as four years. So don't expect any sort of advancement. Just another cheap, Chinese way of managing employees that should be illegal in this country. If you have room for a contact longer than three months and they're not replacing someone on leave, then you have room for a full time employee; no exceptions."
good,Good benefits. Good pay. No raises and no bonuses. No training.
good,"While other aspects of Abbott Nutrition seemed professional, the fact that different departments within the company seemed to not have any idea what was going on within the company at large, was very disappointing. Hiring new staff just before exiting the US Market is very unprofessional."
good,"Morning meeting at 6:00 a.m. to discuss days work. Some days construction, high paced work. Other days patch and repair of maintenance work, which in older buildings can be challenging."
good,Empresa inovadora con productos de alta tecnologia.
good,"Abbott is like any other place where research is being performed/handled. It's pretty intense, but like all places there are good and bad people. For the most part the people were pretty nice."
good,"I know most people say this about an organization they have worked for, but the best way to describe Alere North America is constant change! The organization is known for their acquisitions externally which causes constant change. Internally they are known for their constant restructuring and changes of reporting lines."
good,good company to work at.had oracle development role.had work life balance.Was cool since we could wear casuals
good,The work environment is pleasant however the managers there are a joke. The most incompetent people are the decision makers while the underlings bust their tails to make the managers look good. Then they lay off the best employees and keep the longest tenured ones.
good,"As an employer, Alere had a good health benefits and compensation package and worked with its employees when time was needed off for emergency/other reasons. They were also concerned enough about the relocation of our site to another state to let us know 8 months in advance so that we could prepare. However, there was a very large problem with communication amongst staff members and management. Any important decisions that were made affecting employees were usually discovered through third parties and no input from the employees was ever heeded. This lack of communication also deterred employees from being able to advance their careers as if positions were available, we were not well-informed about them."
good,"Er is veel verloop in dit bedrijf, waardoor je steeds weer met andere mensen moet communiceren."
good,Worked for St Jude Medical which was bought by Abbott about 2 years ago. Transition from one corporate vision to another brought challenges. Worksite experience varies greatly depending on job title.
good,"Great Consulting Project. Worked as member of global team charged with product life cycle rationalization activities.  In the end, project champion was severed and team disbanded."
good,"Enjoyable place to work with good people."
good,Everyday is always something new. Everything changes by the minute. Management is always changing. They never maintain the talents and skills of their personels regardless if its upper management or operators.
good,"It was great fun to work in the field, teaching personal and installing systems. Project management, great laboratory systems and remote diagnosis of the instruments was just great."
good,I learnt more about sales and counselling. The hardest part was also sales as it was the first time I was doing this kind of work apart from counselling and meal planning.
good,Abbot is a very good company to work for.  Their products make a positive impact on people's lives.  Plenty of opportunity to learn and grow within the company.
good,From a Macro perspective Abbott is a Fortune 500 Company that has a stellar reputation as an excellent employer. From a Micro perspective the Diabetes Division in Canada had its challenges. Most years the division didn't hits it's sales goals and targets  usually where adjusted down to try and retain talent (some years had an almost 50% turn over rate).
good,"there isnt really much to say that is that unusual or different compared to other companys to work for. you show up, get the work done and you go home."
good,"Never felt safe from being cut from the top. they lay people off and call it ""Reduction in Force"". The big idea is that they don't let you grow, but they don't let you be comfortable either."
good,Work here was good but there was not much room for moving up. Management was great and understanding but those that needed discipline were not and those did not need it were disciplined. Coworkers would make new guys do most of the work then turn in the work as their own. Overall I enjoyed working with management as they were very understanding but I hoped that our work was more appreciated.
good,Worked as consultant.  Great company and nice people.  I worked on various projects with numerous people and never had any issues to speak of.   Would consider going back under the right circumstances.
good,Great place to work.  Fun and fast paced.  Very good benefits with many holidays off and PTO.  Good people to work with.  Good management and leadership.
good,I Honestly think that the work place is a good environment the only thing I wouldn't like about is that their is no way to grow n move higher up in the business and the management isn't all that good it takes forever to get a raise almost every year we will get a raise so if we work a butt off we wont even be recognized for it honestly if it was to have a better management I wouldn't mind staying n more chances to grow into the business
good,I haven't worked for the company in  a while. They laid off my entire department without offer positions in other departments. they always hired for outside. No room to grow.

good,good place to work. good benefits and training. good products. very competitive amongst employees. corporate culture is positive. upper management not on same page as field reps.
good,"I joined Abbott as intern only so I rate it all items to three stars only. However, I am satisfied with my allowance and the work environment I had in Abbott."
good,"Abbott it a good company to work for, however there is little work/life balance and there can be a lot of corporate politics. My personal manager had a lot of people he was responsible for and I never felt like a priority."
good,Typical day at work it to get things done in a timely manner. It is a good place to work and there is more room for improvements. I'm new to this company so i have not gotten the full effect of Abbott culture. As i progress i'll be in better position to rank or rate this company.
good,"I can't comment on benefits since I was merely contracting there.  There are a lot of older people working there.  This can be a good thing for a company.  However, I found the employees around me who had a lot of years with Abbott were complacent and not professional.  Thus, the culture around me was not a good fit for my work ethic."
good,"It’s good company but some people they laid off ,because the company product they bringing in other country .thats why the company they less people to work"
good,Good growing company to work for. Worked only as a contractor. Love to work permanent full time as a employee. Offered good benefit. Great management to work with.
good,Managed the workload and received adequate support. The culture is extremely process driven. The typical day was spent working independently on multiple projects.
good,Work life balance is impossible to maintain here. Extensive pressure to sales team but training is very much influensive in career for future opportunities. Managers and HR is so strong for performers but increment process is not so smooth here to get.
good,"Over all good company to work and work culture is good. Learnt new things about the Trade activation, SFA and Sales for MT with the TOT."
good,"It was a fun working environment, have to have communication skills, ability to work at a certain pace, and able to get along with each other. Lack of calling workers back for work."
good,"Wat ik daar geleerd heb is orderpicking, wat ik heel graag doe. Dan ook nog final pack."

good,Abbott es una excelente compañía y ofrece buenos beneficios a sus colaboradores.
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part."
good,"My goal is too move to Round Rock Tx. Abbott only has a Sales dept. there. It's a good company. The benefits are good. St Jude Medical got bought out by Abbott so, it's still new to me."
good,I have not worked at Abbott in so long that I can not really remember much about their environment or culture.  I am sure so much has changed since I left
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Nothing special, typical large corporation culture with a lot of red-tape. Also, the organization has deep silos and generally provides very limited opportunities for growth and lateral movement."
good,"•	Promoted AndroGel 1.62% and Synthroid in the Richmond and Tidewater area of Virginia in the Metabolic division"
good,"The products we develop save and improve lives and that gives a sense of professional fulfillment. Projects overruns are typical and it requires stretching the team working long hours and weekends. The projects are executed by unqualified software project managers with lack of technical knowledge for planning, scheduling, and inter-group coordination."
good,This role doesn't involve sourcing or identifying niche talent. It is internal recruiting /coordinating that works with suppliers. The culture is very clean and laid back. I enjoyed working with Abbott.
good,Overall this is a solid company to work for.  A lot of transition in recent years but a good organization overall.  Culture is fast paced and enjoyed the time with the company.

good,This company has many levels of career advancements. Job duties are a bit difficult same tasks are being performed everyday. Fast paced working environment.
good,Most days were very busy with high call volume. I learned alot about the products that my department handled. Management could have been better at employee development. My coworkers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was when there were days we were short staffed with extremely high call volume. The most enjoyable part was the environment. The staff was excellent and we felt more like close friends rather than just coworkers.
good,Abbott Labs has a great working culture and environment which provides opportunities to excel. They offer the ability to learn and grow and to be challenged.
good,"Good people and place to work, hours are great, willing to work with you and your hours. Management is excellent everyone is willing to assist you when you looking for help."
good,"Strong Benefits some divisions still have a Pension.  Cross divisional opportunities exist and strong diversity, Stable company. Overall good company."
good,"Some contract employees have worked over 18 months without being hired by the Abbott Company. Moved around from building to building and differently work spaces, that has to be learned."
good,"A daily routine at work depending on the status you may run production all or majority of the 12 hour shift. In some cases the line could be down majority of the shift. You are on standby at least 3-4 out of the month that if we are fully staffed, I learned to verify immensely carefully Abbott is very strict about paper work! Management is like any other company you have some good and some not so good. The workplace culture is acceptable. The hardest part of the job is being called in on you day off. Days off!"
good,A good place to work until they shut down the division and laid us all off with no notice.  Decent severance package but that's about it.  Made some good friends there.
good,"Fair work/ Life balance. Good about adopting new technologies, they provide a quality work space and the people there are generally nice.They can be slow about adopting new technologies."

good,"Nice place to work as a contractor. Super far drive if you’re in the city. The management is well organized, which makes your work fairly straight forward depending on the department."
good,"It was not the position I wanted, but it served its purpose. Working for this company I learned how to deal with extremely negative co-workers. the most enjoyable part is talking to senior management."

good,"Projecting the use of both basic and rare commodities throughout the company without the knowledge of what or when line failures would occur, taking into consideration the restocking time and cost of carrying inventory. I learned A LOT about inventory management. Workplace culture was always stressed, and hours were long. The hardest part of my job was juggling the unscheduled withdrawals of material by R&D with the scheduled usage so as to not cause product outages. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with so many other departments - QA, Purchasing, Shipping/Warehousing, PAC, Filled Product Planners, Product VPs, R&D, etc."
good,Generally a good company in attractive categories across the majority of its divisions. Unclear longer-term strategy in some specific company areas leads to inconsistent performance and delivery of annual plans. Depending on which division or functional area that one works in this could have significant impact on one's total compensation.

good,"Pros include work/life balance, good workplace culture, peers welcoming and willing to teach, management rewards and inspires employees to better themselves as individuals"
good,the company is in the growth spree and the environment the company is ever changing the policies and the focus changes every year and the employee adhere to that. That has resulted in massive growth
good,Very stressful with poor pay. The manager on the post market team is very disconnected with the group. she has her favorites but does not seem to show any genuine interest in helping group.
good,"Typical day: Design products and processes and document"
good,"llegar hacer la limpieza, conozer a la gente , estar trabajado todo el dia"
good,The reason i gave it a low rating is because of personal issues being that the drive was to long over an hour the pay was low for industry standard and working overnights on the weekend gave me no life. but for Abbott as a service desk analyst it is a great way to get into this industry. it is a very good job to learn at and to grow a great skill set to be a valuable asset of any company. the job is quite nice and office work is always very relaxing the people are good and the environment is very calm.
good,Not enough advancement as the company soon was bought out and merged with a bigger company. All-in-all. It was an okay job for the time that I was there.
good,"Abbott Hematology hasn't released a new product in approximately 6 years. This made it a very challenging product development process with the majority of the people there not having any experience in product development. So everyday there are new learnings. "

good,Did not see the big picture.  Being a Teaching Institutional Manager we were not part of the sales process and were/are underpaid.  I hope J&J changes this structure
good,"Product was ill-defined, system engineering badly staffed. management structure couldn't overcome the limitations.  Development was split amongst two sites - very bad idea."
good,Very happy while I was there worked for Abbott. Most experience I had from Abbott technology and they manufacture life saver equipment save life therefore I am so happy what I learn and applied to my current job..

There was health education involved to help the client understand their health and note if Case Management would help them further.I felt the most enjoyable part of the job was I made a difference in the care a client could get.
good,Abbott as a company is typical of many large multinational organisations with both positive and negative elements in working there. Unfortunately circumstances prevent me from being more specific.
good,"When alere opened here in the Philippines, i am included in the first batch of employees. I enjoyed alere so much by that time because theres a lot of freebies, lunch is always free and bosses are approachable.."
good,"Desafiante ,  con grandes oportunidades, pero viviendo el choque cultural entre empresa americana y la adquisición de otra latinoamericana. Mucho estrés y clima laboral alterado, siento que probablemente en los años venideros esto debe mejorar."
good,"My co-workers and the management are nice and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a solid phase machine and doing the filter.

good,Alere used to have a Women & Children's division that provided home care services to women with pregnancy complications.  They have since sold that division.

good,"Willing to work with personal schedules"
good,"Working at Abbott is not hard, or straining at all. The problem is that company politics are out of control. Co-workers in my division for the most part get along with each other very well. The hardest part about the job is the large gap in pay despite doing the same job."
good,"Lots of activities and meetings help you to grow faster and learn new things."
good,"Enjoyed selling a service to improve nausea and vomiting in pregnant women by using micro infusion pump. "

good,"Main goal was remediation of FDA 483 observations. My task was reviewing the statistical underpinning of all in process and disposition sampling plans and how they aligned with the 510K claims for the product. It was a very interesting endeavor.

good,"I got my first experience launching a product at Abbott.  Omnicef was a new antibiotic.  I enjoyed meeting with multiple pediatricians and influencing them to prescribe this to their patients.  The results were fantastic, as I was able to open up my market, and then grow it quickly.  I did have other medications in my portfolio as well, which changed from time to time depending on the product mix of my team.  I did enjoy working with my co-workers, especially one counterpart who was an extremely hard worker.  I did find, however, that there was little oversight over some of my teammates, and I spent a good amount of time working to influence them to work harder.."

The people here are great, but moral is a little low due to the ever changing market, which affects the size of the work force."
good,"Great environment, good people, not too many opportunities to grow."
good,"Abbott is another typical corporation. If you have ever worked anywhere that thinks of employees as a number, uses old practices and technology to achieve unreasonable goals and had the fear of being laid off every two months than you have an idea of what it is like to work for this company."

good,"The management relies too much on the Human Resources Division. The HR Division is to concern about their diversified employment. Especially, when they ignored the employees who are age 50 and above. These employees can give the company dependable and loyal service in order for the company to achieve their goals. The HR would rather lay-off (or Position eliminated) these people instead of recognizing their efforts. They ignored their own rules when it comes to the over 50 age personnel and a lot of these people suffer for it!"
good,There is always a new opportunity to uncover. It's important to balance day to day with long term strategic thinking.

good,"Truly a valuable organization to work for. Focused on providing the best available technology to change patient care outcomes, and drive disease management in to a more proactive space. Training was fantastic, and designed to set territory managers up for success."
good,"There is a lot of favoritism and it is very clear to everyone who is not a favorite. work can be really slow, it can also be fast passed. co-workers will make you better about working here."
good,"If you're happy in a large, structured environment, Abbott is the place for you. Experiences vary depending on location and team you are a part of. Some upward mobility is available within the company. Work-Life balance is difficult. Very rewarding to see patients with successful results."
good,"I was a contractor at Abbot (JSG Services) as a site Fiber Optic Engineer. The work was easy but it often breached Contractor/Employee work rules, without any compensation. I was hired as a ""Technical Service"" provider but found myself being asked to do material purchasing and project planing as well as build out of various fiber plants. Due to the declining job security at Abbott (Abbott Park Illinois) there was always an air of ""Are we going to lose our jobs today"" type of feeling."
good,Je werkt in ploegendienst. Ik werkte op de verpakafdeling. Is via een uitzendbureau. Je werkt samen met andere collega.s. Om de  2 uur wissel je van plaats. Werk is eentonig. Was wel gezellig met mijn collega's.
good,"Was layed off with no notice, and runed me for a while, but I bounced back. They bought Vysis the co. I was at and they treated the people from Vysis like we were outcast and were lower then the Abbott hires."
good,"Moved around a lot and got a lot of experience. Some managers weren't the greatest and there was always some kind of internal drama with the people on the line. But I kept out of it. In the end, they sent production over seas and I was let go."
good,A good organization with new ventures into Healthcare but needs to give due importance to processes and flow of actions. People with creatives energies are not best fit. work life balance a tough ask. culture of the place is good in all departments except few. Management needs to take cognisance of some critical elements for further improvement and sustained growth.
good,They offer great job security with the amount of work that you have to do but the work can be very stressful due to very short deadline pressures. The work culture could improve as I never felt that I was a  part of a work family.
good,"Abbott has great benefits for its employees that are better than most (e.g., 401K and pension program, profit sharing, healthcare, a retail discount program, cafeterias that offer breakfast and lunch at a discount, and a credit union) and there are a lot of great people who work there, but its corporate culture is better suited for the 20th Century than the 21st unlike it’s spin-off Abbvie. One can walk through Abbott's HQ building at lunch time and tell who works at Abbott and who is from Abbie just based on attire and age. If Abbott is going to compete with 21st century corporate entities for talent, it will require a change at the helm. I’m sure Public Relations would say otherwise, but I see more retirements than on-boarding of young people."
good,The culture in the lab is friendly and cooperative. Safety is taken seriously. Direct management is incredibly flexible about hours when needed. Unfortunately the pay is not fair for the experience and education level that is desired for this position.
good,"process and approval laden culture. Little work/life balance. Promotions largely based on friendships, tenure or diversity requirements vs. performance, experience, skills. On a positive note,  people are friendly and helpful."
good,Lack of cohesiveness between departments and managers. Good entry into medical devices (LA) but lacks challenging work for most engineers. Would look elsewhere
good,it was a good place to work before the new owners. i loved making the pace makers. management is poor. enjoyed most of the people. the atmosphere was dreary because of poor leadership. i didnt find any of the jobs hard. i really enjoyed the work i done knowing it would save someones life.
good,"Need better Management for the people that works there. Great Company to work for can be stressful at time but normal have great benefit, good pay a good place to retire from ."
good,"The most enjoyable parts of the job are the great co-workers and the relaxed, friendly atmosphere.  The ratio of contract employees to direct hire employees is probably too high and can be a source of tension for some teams."
good,"Being a contractor at Abbott is a joke!!  I have been here for 2 & a half years.  They refused to give me a raise or hire me because they don't want to spend the money.  That's what it seems to be all about with this company.  Making a buck!!  They don't care about their employees.  I absolutely love my job, my boss & my co-workers.  I really hate to leave, but can't continue working a job with no benefits or pension!!"
good,"Good Company & Management"
good,"Enjoyable, fun, and motivated at work inspired by patients. Pays great with great benefits. I recommend this job to everybody. "
good,"If you are in a large location you have better opportunites for advancement.  In my experience small locations do not get the recongition and or opportunity to advance.  Salary is ok.  Benefits are great.  Great work life balance, but not great for career advancement if you are on the lower ranks."
good,"Als Maintenance Engineer heb ik veel geleerd op veel vlakken van de techniek. Voornamelijk Werktuigbouw, biochemie en erg veel bedrijfskunde met KPI's. Het lastigste was de roles en responsibilities goed in kaart brengen. deze was door een reorganisatie niet goed duidelijk. Het leukste van de baan was het contact met collega's en gezamenlijk"
good,"It is a great company. I started working here after graduating college with a BS in biology and the people are great. I feel like I am a part of a community. However, there is very little room for growth. It is very difficult to get hired as a full-time employee regardless of how much effort you put in or how good you are at your job. They like to hire contractors so they don't have to give any benefits and when the contracts expire, instead of hiring the contractor, they fire you and look for another."
good,"Prioritized unscheduled maintenance, schedule preventive maintenance and managed day to day activities of equipment maintenance technicians. Implemented and maintained effectiveness of quality system by ensuring quality/compliance of equipment and tooling. Supervised, trained and developed technicians. Developed department goals and objective for all assigned technician. Maintained personal records such as, work schedule, vacation schedule and leaves of employees."
good,I had to leave this job due to family obligations when they restructured and wanted me to travel.  I was promised no travel.  I enjoyed my employment there for the 5 months that I worked for them.
good,"Smartest people I've ever worked with. AV has fallen on hard times recently, making it a highly politicized environment. But many great years made it an overall terrific place to work."
good,"I currently write Post Market Customer Communication for all reported complaints.I work four days in office and 1 day remotely. I enjoy the overall atmosphere, although the work does not really challenge me on use the 17 years of skills that I have."
good,"I have been working in Abbott Pharmaceuticals for almost 3 years, and during this period a lot of things have changed. It is a good place for gaining on-hand experience in the field of finance and understanding of the pharmaceuticals industry. The people who work in the company are friendly and competent. Sadly, due to high turn-over rate, the borders of one's responsibility gets washed away, and you lose the scope of what is in your field of responsibility and what is not. Due to such constant change of people, you start to take on additional tasks in order to fullfill your duties which end up as overtime activities and lose the possibility to have ""Life-work Balance"". There is hardly any passing on of experience from colleague to colleague, and most of the time you have to learn on your own. Over the period that I have worked in Abbott, 4 of my direct managers have changed, so I had to always adapt to new styles of management."
good,"Not bad place, salary was ok, work-life balance sucked. No training whatsoever, expect to learn by your self. Co-workers were nice and easy to get along with."
good,"A very diverse group of people to work with. The work was very stressful but meaningful. "
good,Not a very good work life balance.  Very stable company with opportunities for advancement in multiple parts of the world.  Expect to work more than 40 hours
good,"room for improvement the management at the time I worked there was not balanced. emergency issue training would be ideal to its staff."
good,Generally good leadership who supports staff development and advancement. Compensation and benefits are solid. Challenging work environment due to widely varying technologies.
good,0 Job work life balance. company in constant state of flux. no current direction. not enough resources to complete jobs as required. Managers have no ability to hire anyone.
good,"One truly tough place to work.  Working hard rather than working smart.  However, the business is one that is needed and protected since the products are necessary for the healthcare system and everyone else has exited several key market areas due to low margins."
good,The job is a call center consisting of helping costumers troubleshoot the products the company produces. They offer a gym on site to use on your breaks or before or after work. The health benefits are good but costly. The job is stressful but can be rewarding.
good,"Too much outsourcing. Focus is mostly on saving a buck, but lose years of experience. Makes it very difficult for those who remain. Days are very long, and there is very little work/life balance. Easy to put in 50+ hrs/wk there."
good,"I like a company with a friendly atmosphere where people have open communication policy. Respect each others opinion and views. The people you are working with regardless of position, tenurity and age respect each and everyone. "
good,"loading and unloading product to and from remote operated robots or even ""drones"", or that would be how I would describe them.. A day to day would be gathering orders to load onto a trailer and receiving new materials to put away into inventory locations... I would say the hardest task of working for this company would be staying out of others way...Its very fast paced with a lot of employees all attempting to reach the same order goals as you.. The supervisors and employees with seniority did not hesitate to answer any questions or even help with loading orders.. Great company to work for!!!"
good,"As I was in the Nutrition industry, I appreciate all the training that was provided by the company. It is for us to ensure quality services to our clienteles."
good,"Long days..12 hours...very repetitive and boring after you learn your job.  Very clean environment, bland décor...good pay...extra cleaning work around FDA inspections.  "
good,"The culture is horrible."
good,"Research for Diabetes..."
good,"Working environment and people present a nice working environment."
good,Large company that has endured significant organizational change over the last few years.  Benefits are reasonable for a healthcare organization with a focus on work/life balance.
good,"Employees are encouraged to take ownership of tasks within their sphere of responsibilities, and that creates an entrepreneurial atmosphere. Work life balance is talked about, and press articles written, but the reality is somewhat different.  The people I worked with were great, and there is a real sense of team there."
good,"My time as work was spent working with members of different organizations to help them identify what went wrong (whether product-, process-, or human-related), why it happened, and how to correct the nonconformance so that it would not recur. "
good,Challenging position with nice coworkers. My experience at Abbott didn't end happily--my contract was cut short after being thrown under the bus by upper management.
good,"1. Get good recognition at market place."
good,KOS run by exec that had strong belief in work life balance and interacting with employees made for a great work environment.  High standards where a good challenge and a healthy team work attitude amoughts colleagues made work enjoyable.  Short lived since company was sold and closed down.
good,"1998 trat ich als Verkäufer diagnostischer Geräte in das Unternehmen ein. Zunächst übernahm ich die Betreuung eines eigenen Gebietes mit der Maßgabe, Laboratorien, Kliniken und Forschungsinstitute über die Produktpalette zu informieren. Ein Jahr später wurde ich zum ""Account Executive"" befördert. In dieser Funktion oblag mir die Kontaktpflege zu höheren administrativen Stellen, sowie den Entscheidungsträgern in Laboratorien und Universitäten. 1992 wurde ich zum ""District Sales Manager"" befördert. In dieser Funktion war ich für die mir zugeteilten Mitarbeiter, deren Verkaufsvorgaben, Training, Anleitung und Führung verantwortlich."
good,Compensation & Benefits are good.  Recent layoffs are concerning.
good,All shots called from Corporate Office. They don't understand the local reality.
good,its a nice company and maintaining good products in market.always company gives first preferace to costemers..abbott is a no 1 and leading pharmacuetical company in india.present in over 135 contries
good,"Was a good place to work. Learned a lot of use information from supervisors. Keeping everything and up to date. Making sure coverage available on all shifts, and production was taken care of."
good,"Abbott is my first job as i stepped in for pharma marketing, i learn a lot there"
good,Good company with benefit packages that are great for the employee. Organizations within this company vary in terms of management styles and group dynamics. There are some limited opportunities for advancement.
good,Develop company's sale is very difficult job but with the help of our managment and seniors my confidence build up and i tried my best and achieve goals with the help of us. My managment is very co-operative and help ful and also my co-workers. we work very frankly and helps each others at any critical situations.the hardest part of the job is to achieved target in any any how.
good,"Very nice company, people-oriented with strong family values, however, lack of benefits and good compensation."
good,"Everyday is something new; if I am not processing orders then I am working on resolving invoice discrepancies.  My department covers many different areas of spend and has a high volume of orders to be processed; I am the only one in my department that has the most knowledge of every area of spend."
good,"Learnt many things about"
good,"Alere is a good company to work for. They pay well with good benefits. I really enjoy the people I work with. They really make the job for me."
good,Team Concept within each division. A lot of turn over due to FDA recall.Award producers.
good,"Good stepping stone for other better paid medical device/pharma factories  elsewhere.Be prepared to work hard from the moment you clock in, very fast paced environment with high and sometimes unrealistic targets. Some great people working there and some great opportunities to work up the ladder if you do put the head down and work hard."
good,"Job stability, benefits, and job advancement opportunities are great but they come at a price. Work long hours, lots of overtime, and management that cares more about the outcomes then the employees doing the work."
good,Muy buena empresa trabaje 4 años fue un exelente aprendizaje le debo mucho a esta empresa
good,"It has been 12 years since I worked for Abbott so things have most likely changed."
good,môi trường làm việc tốtnhưng không ôn định. lương không phù hợp với công việc
good,"went in to work on the same thing everyday"
good,"Met enorm veel enthousiasme in 2003 begonnen bij Abbott Laboratories te Zwolle, leek allemaal mooi, goede arbeidsvoorwaarden en zelfs een gedragscode!"
good,"Abbott has a lot of great people to work with, both intellectually and  socially.  Senior management is very top/bottom line driven and does everything to meet annual goals"
good,"Abbott Laboratories is a wonderful place to work as a contractor. The management gives ample flexibility for those with family concerns or even animal concerns. However, they are also in abundance of contractors which makes it hard to be hired on full-time with benefits."
good,"It's My First Job its a good Company but the hourly is not right for the job that im doing i like the people working their and the job is okey for me, I have  a good experience working in this company."
good,"good company with very demanding expectations"
good,"Unfortunately, I was downsized from this organization due to expiration of product patents and lack of future pipeline.  If not for those reasons, I would have preferred to retire from this organization."
good,"Overall its a good company with advancements in all positions, I Solved Customer’s problems, I achieved a lot of experience, I liked the company and what they stood for"
good,"Empresa Multinacional da indústria farmacêutica com ótimos salários e benefícios, ambiente para aprendizado e desenvolvimento."
good,Abbott provides the tools but requires the individual to pursue advance opportunities.  The mentor program is very beneficial to identifying the needed experience to move up in the company.
good,"Abbott offers very good benefits to employees."
good,Pretty average company to work for. Benefits are really good but salary is average at best. Not a lot of room to move up directly but if you can move into different departments you can do OK.
good,management was lacking any leadership qualities but we were well taken care of. Benefits are great and the work pace is relatively relaxed. Due to FDA the work is very slow.
good,"The hardest part of the job was not knowing day to day if you would even have a job. There were alot of lay-offs and restructuring and because of that, many people were extremely stressed out. Especially those that had been with the company for decades."
good,a typical day was a usually a easy day. i learned a lot about heart devices and neuromodulation. i love the people and the management cause everyone is so friendly. the hardest part was the repetition of doing the same thing over and over with no job advancement.
good,"I was a contracted employee, not an actual Abbot employee. As an environmental specialist, I spent all of my time cleaning. Most of the people I worked with were good natured & did their jobs well."
good,Work life balance is good.  Work environment is friendly and management is mostly good.  Opportunities to advance are good as it's such a large company.
good,i like working on a fast pace clean environment and friendly co-workers during my working hours of my shift everday including overtime period at Alere INc.
good,A typical day of work would involve scheduling and planning the day to day activities. Learnt a lot of skill sets through training and seminars. Management was very accommodating to run your family and manage work/life balance. The hardest part of the job is to get vendors in on time and the most enjoyable part of the job was troubleshooting with instruments.
good,Desenvolvimento profissional e pressão (normal) da área financeira
good,peu ou pas  d'opportunités car absence de produits novateurs ou en développement
good,"A typical day is when there is no actual atmosphere for work and make a decision clear."
good,"Handling 3 districts and 12 distributors which consist of 22 sales men."
good,Typical day was a full work load and never-ending but eventually very rewarding. Management is very biased at times and promotions are given based on who you know; not always based on what you know.  The hardest part of the job was the work load and the most enjoyable were the people you work with.
good,"CO-workers were nice."
good,"I've had the opportunity to move up and learn a lot at Abbott.  Unfortunately, some of the roles feel more like something you ""survive"" instead of something where you feel like your career is being nurtured and cultivated. Some of the managers at Abbott are a complete nightmare to work with--and very frequently run amok for years or even decades on end with impunity.  Eliminating some of the dead weight would do this company some good. "
good,"Trabajo en linea con buenos compañeros"
good,My daily routine is to monitor the analysers that is allocated to me as well as supporting my co-workers with maintaining our instrument base. I learned to think on my feet and to adapt quickly. The long hours and standby is not so enjoyable but I do enjoy it when I solve a complex problem.
good,Benefits are very good. Mostly learning is on your own. Bad coworkers are very hard to work with. A lot of travel in field service. Management for service does not follow consistent patterns of good service to customers.
good,"A place to get widespread exposure and hone the skills to take up leadership roles within the organisation."
good,Responsible for maintaining Integration Hub infrastructure.  My manager was very patient and willing to teach.  I enjoy working with everyone from peers to business partners.
good,"Purchasing for high dollar capital projects.  "
good,"BEx & Demand Management are though separate functions, however are related to each other. BEx is Continuous Improvement by minimizing waste and increasing velocity of processes. Demand Management is a key position between Sales & Marketing and Operations. Demand coordinates the publishing of Approved Demand Statement (one number) i.e. Sales for the next 28 months which is the basis for the ERP. The whole organization then works to achieve sales on which decision is made by all stakeholders and Demand coordinates & facilitates with stakeholders in acheiving this number."
good,"Great place to work."
good,Very busy with many changes in the organization.  That is all I can think of to say.  Sorry
good,A great learning experience for the first real job. Money was good.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was providing high quality products for people who needed them. Abbott is a great company to work for. However the opportunity for advancement is limited and lacks management leadership roles. Human resources department is almost not existent. Even though they have an employee hotline, hardly anything gets resolved."
good,"Abbott is een groot, mooi en schoon bedrijf met leuke collega's."
good,"A typical day involves a lot of time on the computer, attending meetings in regards to scheduling, drafting e-mails, creating PowerPoints, tracking production and other metrics in Excel, as well as using proprietary software to monitor and report progress."
good,Very typical mid-west company
good,"A day at Abbott would be to put our equipment on and go into the work place with the medicine and pack the medications, box them up, palatalize them, inspect the labels and medication, and stock them. It can be very faced pace and you have to stand in one spot on your feet all day long and that was one of the hardest parts of the job. But it can also be teamwork which I enjoyed.,"
good,Very large company with lots of moving parts. Contractor work is paid well but not much direction. Worst on-boarding start ever. Lots of technical learning opportunities. Friendly.
good,"Alere was a highly motivated organization to acquire a broad range of point of care testing systems and assimilating them into a large combined organization."
good,"A very results oriented company, managers are interested in teaching their interns. The job security is not as great, no one is sure about the future of your career."
good,I was brought on to upgrade the security of an embedded Linux product that basically had none.   It was something the local leadership had sat on as a project for 2 years and only under pressure from the corporate office and the FDA was the work actually done on a very aggressive schedule.
good,"There is no autonomy of decision and it is completely one-sided. The bosses are understanding and colleagues are really great. The people in this company are really talented and a person can learn a lot from them. But, the management is poor and shaky."
good,Abbott is a large organization that feels that they have the best practices within the industry.  They are not always inclusive and don't leverage outside experiences.
good,"Em 17 anos e meio na empresa  fui promovido 4 vezes ."
good,"There is good work life balance but environment is little boring."
good,"This was a great first job, but I learned new things at a glacial pace. Constant layoffs and instability, morale was low but I had great colleagues. I knew I needed to get out of there ASAP though."
good,Fast paced environment with high turnover to meet customer demand while maintaining class A certification. Good benefits but job security is unsure due to broad customer base being in Europe for the diagnostics part of business.
good,"Excelente empresa para trabalhar, mas muito burocrática nos processos internos."
good,"When it comes to making number, I set out beyond to make the best even if we are short on operators, I manage to lead the line with the required goal at the end of the day."
good,"Great place to work but clean room environment wise, Supervisors and group leads treat people unfairly. Some Group leads can be rude and disrespectful. No opportunity to grow with company unless you are favored. Supervisors don't give everyone equal opportunity and chooses who they want to get promoted."
good,I was very lucky to work with a great HR team.  Our department worked together on a number of difficult projects and learned a lot of experience from this.
good,Environnement de travail rigoureux mais laissant place à l'adaptabilité selon la demande
good,"Aankomst om 7 am: alarm afzetten, controle op netheid in zalen, keukens, toiletten, liften, receptie, offices, tapijten,  First Aid room  en office supplies aangevuld zijn, kopieertoestellen voldoende papier hebben, ontbijt voor klanten op tijd is en in de juiste zaal, garages controleren. "
good,Good Place To Work Nice People And Working Conditions. I Would Recommend This Employer. Work Is Steady But not Overwhelming. The In House Software Is A Plus
good,"Having good work culture and Transparency"
good,a kind of work with focusing in product monitoring and gain some basic shelf merchandising with the head focusing in product promotion needed an info to co worker for new product and paperwork is more harder and harder in reporting and the good side of the job it has an outlet with small quantity of stock and many outlet to visit in one day.
good,"Abbott has excellent compensation and benefits, as well as good work/life balance. It is a VERY traditional corporate culture however; business casual every day and slow to implement change."
good,Sales is the continous field of experiances...I love my day to day job of new learnings and oportunities...Looking for important role in company to better exposer of my work and for my carriar.
good,"The culture is somewhat ""uptight"".  You get a sense of ""you better not or else"".  Just be your professional self, do what you have to do, smile.  System for training needs improvement.  For the most part it is relatively pleasant to work there."
good,"Complex case managers are expected to travel or open new cases 2 days per week and stay in the office 3 days per week.  All telephone calls are recorded so you can't work remotely while traveling those two days. You have to make phone calls from your desk top computer.  No laptops provided.   Work piles up and you have to fit 40 hours of desk work in those three days of office time.  This doesn't work for those that have families that need you in the evenings.  For those in Southern CA, you're territory is Santa Barbara to the Mexican border in San Diego County.  You end up hating travel days because you know that desk work is piling up.  Caseloads were very acute and the numbers in the high 30's.  Patients were only complex ones and needed lots of psych-social support and education."
good,"Its a good place to work,"
good,a great company. but not to much job security. but a high quality company.
good,Great place to work.Concerned about future though. No investment in R&D pretty much closed my area down. Management seems to be all about pleasing shareholders and acquisitions very little organic growth.
good,It was great place to work. good management. shift work. clean room. good training program. good canteen. team building skills. quick pace. quality is most important
good,"I work for Abbott Rapid Diagnostic and we are a small office."
good,Alere has been acquired and dissolved so there are no opportunities there.  I enjoyed my colleagues and my time there.  Once upon a time we played sports at lunch
good,This is not a bad place to work.  I mainly just did documentation that the product we made did not contain any hazardous materials and could obtain a CE mark so the product could be sold in European countries.
good,Progressed my career over a 19 year span.  Learned something new all the time.  Grew and developed people to maintain a progressive talent pool.  Compensated associates well.
good,Alere presents a new challenges each time we acquires a new company.  Implementing standards is what we work hard on maintaining thought out the company.  I love working with other departments on troubleshooting and resolving issues related to network connectivity.
good,great place to work minus the fact that they are always laying off employees.
good,"Great work environment"
good,"This is a great contract once you put aside the politics, The people are great and dedicated"
good,I am a good attitudes and team player. I have demonstrated teamwork and adaptability. I motive and learn within new training on new platforms. I am taking an Core Jobs Responsibilities. I am performing tasks and following the procedures. Feedback with co-workers. Helping with team members complete the daily tasks. I am sharing knowledge gained with peers from co-workers.
good,"it's a very relax environment and nice co-worker. The supervisor is very nice to everyone. The company usually provides good foods in the holiday. The only one issue is that the salary is low. Overall, if you want to work in the peaceful place, it will be the one. Otherwise, you shouldn't."
good,Rất thích với cách làm việc và môi trường cty Abbott
good,"Cubical was very small."
good,"A good company to work for with lot of facilities like 100% medical coverage, after retirement benefits and during service lot of trainings and opportunities to learn more."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of atomocal model making, 3 D printing, and Fluoroscopy imaging. I learned how to work with animal and human tissue preparation for physician testing, from my co-workers. I had a great supervisor, as she was constantly bringing on new challenges to help grow in my position. The hardest part of my job was the endless layoffs and watching team members let go. My most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with on a daily basis. I really enjoy keeping busy."
good,"Each day comes with it's share of rewards and challenges. The rewards come from those who appreciate your work and when you accomplish everything you want to for that day. The challenges are when goals and operational deadlines are in conflict and juggling which should be done first."
good,"Spend most of day sitting and answering phones on a headset.  Develop rapport with callers.  Help many people.  Some personalities are difficult, but most feel good about advice given."
good,since its no longer in operation this review is pointless and ridiculous since I haven't worked at Abbott since 2005.  Overall I was happy to work there but poor leadership at the regional level ruined my expieriance
good,nice place to work to work good benefits.  Management could be better
good,"Friendly coworkers, team based work environment, capable of being promoted, raises. The new management is terrible."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, retos profesionales, todos se comprometen con la idea y proyectos."
good,"I want better salary from other company     My job is not a typical job is a very nice job day to day I will met new new people and I like that job I want new opportunitie metro job is good opportunity for me, it is my dream job I want work at railway line so please  recommend to me please"
good,"Great company to work with. Superb benefits, Very challenging but rewarding environment. Career development is limited. Very interesting industry. Great profit sharing benefits."
good,This place will pay people with no education a lot of money to make products. However if you went to college to fix the issues they pay you less. The only way to move up is to move sites.
good,"Fast paced, professional environment where hiring managers respect the work recruiters do. Hiring managers see recruiting as valued business partners."
good,poor place to work in my opion they need to improve there scheduling and front line leads work and give better benefits to smaller employess that it for me
good,"good experience, but no job security and worked long hours with short notice.lacking parts and coworkers lacked experience and work habits. worked many weekends with short notice.40 hours were not guaranteed."
good,"Not very friendly place to work for, no good communication among team members. Management needs to be more adaptable to the upcoming new technology and changes."
good,work you butt off learn how to stay away from people that likes to gossip. Management was a joke! Paperwork was the hardens. I enjoyed my paid time off.
good,"Typical day was busy and full of new and exciting opportunities."
good,"While Abbott is a great company, it's important to realize that not all areas of a great company are run well. The GPO division has some serious dysfunction at the leadership levels."
good,I enjoyed working in the medical industry - several different products that were produced to ensure patients received the correct care for their illness.
good,Zolang je geen vaste aanstelling hebt ben je helaas een kostenpost en zijn alle mogelijkheden die de organisatie biedt niet voor je ter beschikking en verdampen alle mooie verhalen over opleiding en samen naar verbetering toe werken.
good,"I worked for Alere San Diego as a temp for a little over 3 months. We have to wear a gown, hair net, shoe covers, and gloves because we are producing medical diagnostic tests. At first I did not like it but with the help of good trainers, I got everything down. I was trained on 8 different machines and since I was a fast learner, I got certified on most of it within a week to a month. I loved the people that trained me. Besides basic operator duties, I asked one of my leads to teach me all that I am able to learn so he taught me how to count rejects after each production lot, how to make status tags with the correct information, and how to print labels. Not many people know how to do that so I'm glad I went out of my way to ask and was taught. For the most part, it was busy but there were days were it was very slow. Most of the people there were nice and I got along with mostly all of them. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with my coworkers. I got close to some of them on a personal level and there were always there for me for good advice and as a friend. My supervisor is really nice and understandable. I got laid off because of slow production which I believe is unfair for certain reasons but overall, Alere is a place that I would have loved to stay working at."
good,It's a ok place to work at. Very hard to move up here though. Some people have been here 10+ years and are in the same position. Plenty of overtime in some departments.
good,"IT is integral to company functioning, Respected and emphasized and an integral tool. Support staff was designed to supply support on a 24 hour basis for world wide clients."
good,This is one place I would love to work for again the head guy that ran second shift mairo he was the best if you wanted to learn and was willing to learn he would teach u
good,It was the first place that provided me an opportunity for IT experience  starting in 1984. I fell in love with the IT field an never looked back.  A great place for a first job and career advancement
good,"Need to hit the ground running every day. Overtime is a mandatory expectation with an end of day notification occurring regularly. "
good,"empresa focada em entregar o lucro para os acionistas, sem planos a longo prazo e sempre preocupada no cumprimento de metas."
good,"Great place to work if you are fresh out of high school and looking for steady stable work. But if you have a family and mortgage, or if your living by yourself anywhere in the bay area, the opportunities for growth and advancement are limited. The only way to move up without a formal degree,  you have to have been with the company 5+ years and have passed the contracted agencies and actually got hired permanent. Then there may be career advancement. Other than that, it was a great place to work and learn about medical device assemblies and manufacturing."
good,Upper management was a challenge. She lead by fear and it created low morale overall. I loved the diabetes market and the interaction with patients. The company overall okay.
good,"It pays good but the company runs 24/7 so very long hours are expected for work, meetings and training. On average you work 12.5 to 14 hours a day, 4 to 5 days a week. They continuously place people on call without pay or compensation. They don't respect your days off, always calling for more work. Very limited opportunities to grow or move. Management are not always held accountable for their actions or decisions and the production workers always pay the ultimate price by sacrificing their time off."
good,"This position is great for getting your foot in the door and gaining experience. Friendly environment with great benefits. If you are looking for an operations job, this may be the job for you."
good,I learned a lot about Abbott Diagnostics through celebrations and demonstrations of accomplishments in technology and health advancement.  Associates were friendly and knowledgeable and assisted me with finding my way around the five story building.
good,Plug and chug data entry.  Little opportunity for advancement.  Management seems to be working in a box; no independent thinking. Warning letters have forced a little movement.
good,"If you are working at AV in Temecula, you are worried every week about the next round of layoffs. People are too fearfull to say anything at work. Very little lunch discussion to coworkers in fear of a mole ratting you out to the boss."
good,I loved working for Abbott despite certain issues. it is a progressive and challenging company. Abbott supplies good training and the company is highly respected.
good,"It's busy. Expect to overwork yourself, people are pleasant and team work is strong but unless you're someone's kid or a manager's favorite plan on staying a contractor or finding a different job. "
good,Heel veel geleerd mijn tijdens mijn stage en de daarop volgende jaren als vaste medewerker van dit bedrijf.
good,"You learn a lot, but it's a hard driving and results oriented atmosphere that depending on the division you're hired in could be good or drive you insane. I've had fantastic experiences and i've also cried on the way home working till 2am in the office."
good,"Responsible to handle all aspects of the Sales process.  Sales calls, cold calls, customer care, capital sales, technical assistance.  Start up and installations along with consulting.  Worked with a great support team of specialists, marketing and R&D in a high profile market.  "
good,"This job has a lot of repetition, but the team made it enjoyable. The only problem was that the company hired a new manager who had been at Amazon and he wanted us to perform as if we were there, too. He treated us as if production were the most important part of the work. That is why I left."
good,"Sadly underpaid due to night shift having no difference from days, so no compensation for unsociable hours is available. Nice team, just need to get a little more support going and will be fantastic."
good,"Abbott pays well, but there is no way you will grow in this company. You can have the same position for years and years. They will make promises they won't keep. AVOID AT ALL COST!"
good,"I would go back but I would not at this time due to the nature of the business and location."
good,Overall a good place to work. The atmosphere was pleasant and most everyone you met had a smile on their faces. Most days kept you busy but not too overwhelmed.
good,"Management is poor, technical and scientific staff is great; work culture is difficult; limited growth opportunity; not a good place for women who look for leadership roles"
good,Great company to work for. Recently acquired St Jude Medical. Produces Class III Implantable device for the purpose of monitoring PA pressure to titrate medication.
good,"I really enjoyed this job. The place was so much fun to work at. I would have stayed there, but a better opportunity presented itself, so I had to move on."
good,"I worked as a paid intern, the job was good, I enjoyed applying my skills and learning new ones while at this job.  But, I knew when I graduated I would not be allowed to work at Abbott unless I found a permanent position.  They offered one at Illinois, but I could not accept one that far away."
good,Very stressful. Some mangers seem unnecessary. Too many useless meetings.  Cramped working conditions.  Engineering has a lot of talented people.  Nice cafeteria.
good,"geleerd hoe je met medicijnen om moet gaan."
good,Agency are always not that good with pays but jobs are provided. Some biaz in the office and in the working place. Can mingle with a lot of good friends.
good,"High paced and competitive environment that also requires constant team work. It's very difficult to obtain a permanent position, but once you have, benefits are great."
good,"Good Place to work as a permanent employee, for contracts it's very stress full work culture. All most all the work is extracted by contractors with too much of micro management."
good,"Great company with stellar benefits if you're a permanent employee, however I was a contractor and can say that there is very little room to advance going this route. The pay isn't that great unless you haggle with the recruiter from the very beginning for a better rate, before you actually take on the job itself. Once your contract is extended you can get a slight increase. Not much, just 20 to 30 cents depending on your management. Good atmosphere and good people for the most part."
good,The company provided the employees with good pay and benefits.  The employees were the best part and I learned a great deal about the industry during my tenure.
good,"Overall nice and the management need to motivate the team and first line leaders ."
good,"Abbott Labs was an intense job.  We had multiple sales targets, a plethora of required examinations on a quarterly basis and we had to work with multiple channel sale partners.  I did enjoy the time I was with Abbott.  I left to enhance my education to develop a strong understanding of risk management services as well as develop  stronger consultative selling skills.  "
good,"Co-workers are friendly, with multi-culture background. Small team in Canada but with great support from global peers located in Europe and America."
good,i always enjoy my work with my seniors and fulfill the commitment and always try to learn new things and find the new ways how to achieved my goals in time frame.
good,The environment is the Abbott way or the Highway.  If you don't do it there way you will not be there very long. Opportunity for advancement limited to who you know not what you know. Overall very professional and impressive from an outsider view of course. Good company to work for once you become an employee I am guessing? A lot of lead by example not let me help you do a better job.
good,"Abbott é um laboratório que presa muito pela qualidade dos medicamentos mas como no momento está passando por uma crise na Europa, aqui no Brasil pouco tem investido nos seu quadro de funcionários trabalhando com terceirizados."
good,"•	Won “In It to Win It” contest for successful launch while driving superior call activity for existing products."
good,the staffing for the maintenance crew is below what is needed to keep the factory running smoothly. the night shift is understaffed and it impacts the productivity. The mentoring program on paper is very good however it is not properly implemented and the social mentality of the factory staff is very negative toward temp workers.
good,"Being a multinational organisation, the environment was hugely deadline driven and highly stressful. There was not much time for fun but the employees were like a big happy family. The hardest part of my job was figuring out how the deadlines would be met with the limited resources that we had."
good,"Their was quite a bit of fleibility but  during the five months that i was there, I saw quite a bit of layoffs. "
good,"I am contracted by Quintiles to represent Abbvie. Abbott had done a great job in training, yet the recent changes and demand for administrative work has pulled me from being able to have a work/life balance. The environment has changed and there is little to no job security, not just with Abbvie, it is the industry in general."
good,"Alot of new policies coming down the road, that will change the culture of the plant."
good,Abbott excels in categories of benefits. Management could us some training in employee relations. Abbott offers a plethora of online training programs.
good,"Fun place to work, great colleagues... Management is poor, everyone is on contract as they do not want to pay benefits accrued with hiring fulltime. Overall great place to start up"
good,"They have good benefits and they provide appreciation events for their employees. "
good,"To much paper work, take lot of energy in non productive work, otherwise it process oriented company, need to reduce paper work, asprie to good place to work but local management play its own agenda"
good,"I have worked for Abbott since 12year ,now it's time to change for a better Carrier ,I have learned a lot from this company and from training team,now it's time to show my talents as a manager ,"
good,Company is really good place for work but management is too biased. Only that one grow who is masters in buttering his superiors. Especially in healthcare solutions dept
good,It's a good job but very political. You will work really hard and long hours but they pay you pretty well. There are a lot of bad managers but a few good ones. Job security is a bit of an issue depending on where you work. A bean counter mentality just like everywhere else.
good,"Company is very productive with lean team size and each individual is clear for their objective and goals. Also, the company has a very professional workplace where well organized and support respective teams."
good,I love working at Abbott I would have loved to stay at Abbott but certain people are Cut Throat and their out for theirselves No Remorse for other people's lives but the pay was great the hours were great..
good,fairly rigid culture of the way things need to be done.   follow details of every project in excruciating detail.  The people are great to work with and dedicated to doing a good job.
good,"They dont look up for the nonexempt employees needs, and the payment and raising are very poor. The company is excellent, but they gotta work with the benefits in salary with the nonexcent employees."
good,7 out of 10.  Day to day is positive but long term negative.  Management leaves something to be desired. Annual layoffs difficult to focus on long term viability. Rated individuals seemingly targeted off popularity and tenure.
good,"It's a good enough place to work. I don't think that upper management understands the repurcussions of some of their decisions. They don't understand what the rest of the workforce is having to endure, and how much time is wasted, using this tool to manage routing of documentation. It is the worst piece of software I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. So many steps involved, just to get the simplest thing through the process and published to the web."
good,Abbott was a great place to learn the industry and the people are amazing.  Compensation is not that high and the Hematology platform does not have a great reputation in the NW.
good,They make you work long hours up to 12 hours a day and they want you to work weekends.  The work is easy but long.  The commute was difficult.  They pay time and a half for overtime.
good,Decent place too work good people too work with typically pick pack forklift cherry picker load and unload trailers stock good lead personnel enjoyed job
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking for new assignments, reviewing all current assignments and then proceeding to complete the assignment.  At Abbott I have learned that attention to detail is key as medical device reporting contains patient information and everything must be checked to ensure accuracy.  The management there is really good.  Management is always prompt to reply to any questions that I may have and are always supportive.  The workplace culture is an office job and the hours are flexible so it offers a relaxing workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job for me is the commute as I have to drive an hour each way.  It is also difficult for me to sit down at my desk all day as I just want to get up and move around.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the flexible hours"
good,"Pro: Excellent place to work at"
good,"Good overall place to work. I've worked there for about 5 years. It's very clean and vacation benefits is good. My only complaint is their are individuals who don't work but can ""butter"" up their supervisors get recognition while other who put in much more effort don't seem to be noticed at all."
good,"The local leadership is excellent; always time to talk and help solve any issues. Environment is very relaxed and there is no compulsion to work a rigid schedule"
good,I was hired on a project that was expected to be a long term possible 6 month contract.  They hired me for this and the project was finished in 3 weeks.  They under estimated the project length.
good,"Overall I have had a great experience with this company. They put a lot of investment in education and training their employees. There are great products in the pipeline, future looks great"
good,"I enjoyed my time with FF School. A typical day would include teaching 3-6 lessons.I learned how to work with a group of kids. I created course curriculum, and class design.My co-workers were all amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better team."
good,"Promote our lines of nutrition products to Pediatric and O.B. doctors, also handle adult nutrition. "
good,"Abbott gave me the chance to learn DB2 for the mainframe and DB2 UDB along with MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle.  My co-workers were very supportive and always had time to answer questions or just chat for a moment or two."
good,I like to work at Abbott and stay for 3-1/2 years as a contractor and never have even 1hr sick.  People seem very nice but the atmosphere is very slow working place .  Co-workers are helpful but the hardest of the job is to have something to get approve due to red tape.
good,"Good Company to work for.  Good pay, good benefits, good overall.  The people are always willing to help. Job security is not what it used to be.  Its a wonderful place if you can stay."
good,"I drove a forklift bringing raw materials into the building. The building is kept very clean, temperature controlled, and safety is of top priority.  The company furnishes uniforms, and cleans them. there are 1st, 2nd and 3rd shifts, but few are Mon-Fri. It is typical to have rotating days off. The employees are friendly and easy to get along with, but the corporate attitude is oppressive and de-values workers. The benefits are great, but pay is low for this type of work, and raises are very small. It is a noisy environment- lots of machinery. It is critical to pay attention to detail, and not make mistakes with numbers and paperwork."
good,"I spent 13 years working in marketing for the company in Canada, France and UK. I had great career opportunities."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with everyone at Alere. In an IT environment with over 70 domains, I learned a lot to increase my breadth of knowledge in IT service. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people be successful with technology. The hardest part of the job was the challenge of working in a complex IT environment serving customers around the globe."
good,I enjoy the patient population and the flexibility of home care. I also love the opportunity to teach others about their care at home
good,"I worked as a QC Supervisor with 2 Leads and 26 analysts, managing them across 6 different areas."
good,"wonderful company"
good,"excellent products, but end of lifecycle(division at time of employment)"
good,"It can be very rewarding place to work at, the environment and ethics are very different from the head office. The head office is the place to work at, better environment and attitude from divisions."
good,"I Initiated quality improvement/cost reduction program resulting in monthly company savings of $10,000."
good,"It was Good to work with this company, I learned to be more efficient and active, understanding the business more and more ant take proactive actions, Management was good and focusing to clear points the daily business, the most hard part was during the submission day of the Plan because it is the results of long days hard working..."
good,"Managers are quite co-operative, gave decent opportunity to learn new things. I have gained a decent amount from knowledge from my colleagues, who are always ready to help each other."
good,"Being a brand ambassador i learned to manage time, being knowledgeable about the differences of a milk formula to a balance nutrition milk for adults and kids, how to deal with different kinds of people, and lastly having a challenging rule."
good,"-Alot of work has to be completed but managable"
good,Directors and senior management know everyone in the department and take the time to know individuals. The culture is inclusive and they constantly look for opportunities for employees to develop.
good,Solid company with a high ethical standard. Sufficient balance between work and life activities. Advancement opportunities between business divisions.
good,"I was given very little information about the jobs I was to be doing in the day to day. Then when I was not able to perform jobs correctly, I was reprimanded. I was given very little opportunity to grow correctly and efficiently, but the management there was always very kind. The kindness shown was insurmountable, yet the assistance to complete the job correctly was given so sparingly."
good,I was fairly working hard and smart with Abbott and loved the working culture of the company but I had left because they were paying on Third Party Payroll.
good,"Abbott is a fave paced competence company to work for. "
good,I enjoyed working at Abbott. The legal department did not turn out to be where i wanted to grow. The workplace culture was great. The company encourages growth and advancement within most departments. My job changed when there was a reconstruction of the legal department and the requirements for my position changed. The division counsel whom I reported to needed someone who could work with litigation matters. I was hired to support commercial legal. I was no longer able to meet the qualifications.
good,ik wist dat de baan maar voor 3 maanden was maar toch heb ik de baan aangenomen. Werkervaring is altijd goed en staat beter op je CV. Abbott was zeer leerzaam in die korte tijd en de collega's waren erg gezellig en behulpzaam
good,"Great company with a great mission. Whatever your role is at Abbott, the medical device products are groundbreaking and cutting-edge. The business takes care of their employees."
good,Fast paced environment. Plenty of cross-functional collaboration and project management. I spent the day leading MRB consults and driving disposition decisions for nonconforming product both at the AMD site and global affiliates. I enjoyed early morning calls from Taiwan or late conference calls from Germany. I learned to influence teams and manage complex projects. The hardest part of the job was the constant change in leadership and direction.
good,Je m'occupais de accueil physique et téléphonique ainsi faire des réservations pour le départ en avion et organiser des séminaires au sein de la société Abbott
good,Boa colaboração entre pares. Ambiente de trabalho agradável.
good,"Excellent place to work and learning on a daily basis."
good,Empresa multinacional de alto profesionalismo en sus equipos de trabajo
good,Good place to work. People are very friendly and you have a lot to learn. A lot of people /staff have worked here for years and that speaks very good about the company.
good,"Not sure at this time. Prototypical organization with limited mobility if you are not willing to move to Chicago. Has a strong culture, so if you were not a long time Abbott person, you will have a tough time adjusting."
good,"The Abbott I worked at I used to make the lead for the Pacers. It was a good job. Learned a lot about the product. A bit stressful, lots of work, constantly occupied."
good,This is a company I worked for Many years ago.  My review is based on historic information and should not be considered for analysis and comparison of other companies.
good,Abbott laboratories was a great place to work.  The pay was high but the job security was low.  There were constant layoffs causing fear and panic.  Some of the employees resigned due to layoffs and look for more stable work.
good,"Good company to work for. I was hired through Eastridge Workforce Solutions and as my first Manufacturing job, it was a good experience to have. If you like a laid back daily routine job this is this place for you."
good,"A Abbott como companhia global é excelente, valoriza as pessoas e se preocupa em impactar positivamente a vida das pessoas. "
good,"very productive, and fun place to work. There's a lot to learn but there's a good guiding team that steers you through the process. Management had a fair and balanced approach to solving problems. There is a sense of togetherness from the other workmates. The hardest part was to memorize a lot of procedures and paperwork in a short period of time. Enjoyable part is the reward given to the employees at the end of a stressful week by management."
good,"Good place to work. good management, innovative product . product training.  a place to learn something new. supportive management.good culture with good management."
good,"This position involved covering a large territory to promote pharmaceutical products to a variety of doctors especially internal medicine, pediatrics, and pain specialists.  I wish I would have stayed"
good,"It is a nice place to start life and grow."
good,πολύ καλό περιβαλλον εκείνη την εποχή αυτή τη στιγμή εχει παορροφηθεί απο την Mylan
good,"Great benefits, numerous trainings, no work life balance, good managers that wanted you to succeed, weekends and nights with little notice, lots of travel"
good,una empresa en transformación pasando de ser Synthesis a Abbott una compañía internacional con aspectos a mejorar.
good,"Enjoy working here on a 10 hour second shift, 4 days per week."
good,"Good Environment to learn and good processes are in place the only draw back is No time for family if you are in managerial role, incentives are there but on lower side. Acknowledgement of good work is rare and job pressure is huge,management is cumbersome."
good,Huge workforce and lot to learn. Robust sales team and one of the biggest Pharma companies.  more opportunities for lateral movement with in the company
good,Good place to work while getting started in pharmaceuticals.  Training was excellent and very tough.   Managers were forced to micro manage representatives.
good,Both are great companies to work for. AbbVie gives lots of opportunity for advancement. I enjoy working in the Payroll department. I have also held the Jr Financial Analyst position in Treasury for six years.
good,"Great company to work for, people are very aspiring and motivating.Learning and keeping up with the pace is the key to success.Good company culture which treats the employers as part of the family"
good,"Good Company with Unrealistic Goals. Would recommend to anyone that I work with. The company has some good perks, but it changes constantly in order to help the bottom line."
good,"Global company with ability to advance and relocate.  Company offers medical, dental, vision and life insurance.  Some positions allow you to work remotely."
good,"If you are looking for a secure career, this might be the place for you. Not a  great place for family life. Fast passed, physical job in processing.  I  enjoyed my job, but needed first shift."
good,"Very professional environment, excellent bebefits however the amount of hours that management expects employees to work exceeds whats normal. Worked more than 58 hours per week."
good,"Work was good, and whats given it much better is its environment, the people you work with were much non-toxic persons. But the regularization sucks even those who work 13 years still is on contractual"
good,"I was only a contractor for 7 years, but was always treated with respect and my work was valued. "
good,It was illustrative expirence of success where we got trained as an asset of organization which will get contuines appreciation from doctors and stack
good,"Alere was a great place to learn, grow, and to be a positive contributor within the organization. The most enjoyable part of this job was mentoring the team and providing opportunities for growth for other team members.   "
good,"Abbott has shifted their focus over the last 8 years. They are no longer quality driven. Management is pushed to propel employees and staff forward to meet deadlines when products and services are not in place. The Old Abbott has disappeared, the New Abbott is lackluster."
good,Abbott is solid growth company and is focused on achieving their quarterly goals and objectives.  Abbott is a good stock to purchase long term for your investment portfolio.
good,Position and brand recognition helped in my next career move. Significant lab work with FDA oversight forces personal accuracy and accountability. Good growth experience
good,This is a great company and culture to work with. The Organization is global and hence you would have the opportunity to work with global stake holders and provides you a great work exposure.
good,"Good place to work, fair opportunities for advancement and skill development, but poor leadership and constant uncertainty in the direction of the company help make a somewhat unstable and stressful work environment."
good,"My current role is challenging and rewarding.  I spend time in meetings, directing employees and managing my own projects.  My team is incredibly collaborative which is an environment I work toward establishing and maintaining."
good,This organization is customer and employee focused and has management concerned in promoting and engaging in the employee's career and professional growth.
good,"I consider lucky to work with the company, providing exceptional opportunity to learn new technologies. The managers have the flawless operation of where want the company to go. Definitely would recommend for starters looking to make a career in IT."
good,I enjoyed working for Abbott.  It had its ups and downs with certain managers they had.  At the end they finally got someone good.  We were a hard working group.  Most of us.  All in all I liked being there and I miss it.
good,"Fast paced environment in the field, but very slow Management reaction time.  They want to track sales on a daily level without fully understanding the business"
good,"I have been working at St. Jude/Abbott for over three years and what I like is how busy you stay. There are many technical issues that arise that you must know about in order to ensure proper and efficient functionality.As a result, there is also something new to learn and I like that. The teamwork is awesome as coworkers are always friendly and willing to work with you to help resolve issues."
good,You have to work hard but everyone there is very nice. I had a good time working there and learned several new things about anodes and cathodes. They expect a high level of professionalism from everyone.
good,Great working environment the only complaint is that management needs additional training.Some managers are not qualify . At times they would  second guess or go back on their own promise .
good,A empresa cumpre com as mais rigorosas exigências dos processos de fabricação.

good,Corporate structure and improvement plans allowed for opportunities for growth within the company.  The company allowed for cross site interaction and opportunities to learn and showcase your work.
good,The pay and work life balance were fair but it has a large company feel and can sometimes be difficult to get things done. Overall not a bad company to work for.
good,This company is quite top heavy. Managers and more managers. Overall a good place to work but very politically motivated. They are not afraid to tell you who to vote for.
good,"The people were fun and understanding to work with for the most part. The job was challenging but rewarding, the management teams can be helpful at times but also unrealistic at times."
good,"Territory Manager "
good,Decent pay and benefits.  Employee's are almost all very nice.  Lacking in managerial expertise. Next to ACE train. Scheduling when a new hire is okay

good,"Great products, wonderful people, and significant accomplishments.  A fun place to work and enjoy life.  Good work life balance with plenty of opportunities."
good,"Han sido 16 años maravillosos de trabajo, donde he disfrutado cada día con un equipo humano fantástico. Lamentablemente en estos días de globalización, la creación de centros compartidos, hay decisiones que toman las empresas que afectan a las personas negativamente."
good,ok workplace nice workplace and management. right now they are not hiring for perm posiiton only as temp. The workplace is clean and nice even the workplace.

good,good place to work &Management has also good but coming to managers not supportive No additional training programmes for carrier growth
good,"This division of Abbott has great benefits and perks. However, work life balance is almost non-existent. You are expected to fit a corporate mold that comes with very high expectations."
good,"I learned lot of things here in a very short period of time "
good,"I started my career with Abbott Laboratories Limited. I was fresh commerce graduate and all that I learnt about anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology along with communication skills was due to induction 45 days training program of Abbott. I aced the session and also became number one in my group regarding sales of my products."

good,Enjoyed my internship with Abbott and allowed me the opportunity to build on my strengths and work through my weaknesses.
good,"Possibilidade de aprendizado, criação e desenvolvimento."
good,Abbott is a great company to work for. Every day would be loaded with multiple challenges and situations to deal with. The company has an open door policy. The leadership team/senior management is extremely helpful and provide guidance as and when required. Abbott had a diversified workforce and the employees always worked in unity and as a team be it inter department or cross functional. It was a great learning experience as I gained a diversified exposure. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.

good,"Allows you to do your job with autonomy. Currently going through changes since the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, lots of lay offs and changes. Once acquisition is final, should be a great place to work."
good,"For those in the early stages or their careers, this is a good place to build a solid foundation and if you are willing to put in the sweat equity, also be promoted to higher levels."
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar. Tiene varios beneficios y provee servicios de retiro al empleado. Hay mucho compañerismo entre los empleados y se aprende mucho en la fabricación de productos médicos. No obstante, no se obtiene fácilmente una promoción, se tarda la conversión de empleado temporero a regular y tiene un rango de salario bajo en casi todos sus niveles."
good,"1. Poor management and political too much for Pleasanton site."
good,I found that the people I worked with were great.  I was a contractor so I got OT.  There were many manufacturing challenges that needed to be solved.  Either you liked it or you did not like it.
good,Good company.  People are good to work with mostly.  Opportunities for those that want to move and advance.  Benefits are good and company has vision for future.
good,"great work life balance"
good,"1- I Focused on the company individual Growth while employed there,"
good,"I had a number of jobs, mostly dealing with quality for a company that was owned by Abbott when I started.  Abbott spun off the hospital generics division and we became Hospira.  Next we were bought by Pfizer."
good,"Ao longo dos 15 meses que trabalhei na organização, tive a oportunidade de conhecer ótimas pessoas e profissionais de dedicados. A empresa preza pela diversidade e inclusão dos funcionários, não fazendo acepção de pessoas. O mundo precisa de empresas que trabalham para a inclusão e diversidade como a Abbott."
good,Was a company with very good culture and balance between work and family.  I feel like this is changing a lot and need more work driven and more after hours work.  Offers good salary but commission was also cut.  Need to have balance and now struggle to maintain this.
good,"Being a regulated business, there were basically policies for doing everything, so it took a while to become ""Abbottized"". But there was a great opportunity for variety of work assignments, and it felt good working for a company that was doing good things for people's health. The only downside was periodic layoffs."
good,"Great people and an overall great place to work. Again, as an employee you are set. As a contractor don't expect much. "
good,"A wonderful and progressive company to work for, management supports all individual rights and needs while working towards a common goal.    The compensation does not just include salary but also other benefits.  They also are quite generous with perks for the employees in order to keep morale at a positive level."
good,"Work life balance. "
good,"The wolkplace culture is OK and has declined over the years.  Still a good place to work, but a bit frustrating at times.  There is limited room for advancement unless you are in with the managers.  Longevity seems to be less valued than before."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Advance Security. The people were friendly, helpful, and make the workplace a pleasant place. Accuracy in your paperwork is key."
good,Writing SOP documents.
good,"Work with the developers, project managers, business users to address and collaborate the daily tasks, issues, and defects. The team collaborates daily to address ongoing issues."
good,"Productive workplace. Work related goals were met. "
good,"Cant say that I worked as an Abbott Employee but I worked as contractor there and was treated badly due to the fact that I was an ""outsider"""

good,"Abbott Nutrition has great benefits and great start off pay. Depending on the office you work in, the culture family oriented. Be warned, they are quite antiquated in their practices."
good,Was a very good working environment. Management and employees had a very good working relationship. Mutual support from all levels of management. Clear lines of communications. Very good training.
good,"I've only joined Alere recently but so far the environment is pleasant.  From the initial phone interview to the first day of work, everyone at Alere makes me feel welcome, comfortable and wanted.  The Talent Acquisition team is supportive, positive and has a great sense of humor.  Everyone works hard and cares for each other."
good,"Interesting place to work. Great colleagues & relaxed work culture."
good,"I worked as an Operator at Alere(2nd Shift) by contract through a temp agency. I learned to operate and got certified on the 8 machines on a manual assembly line. Majority of the people there were helpful especially my lead because I asked him to teach me other things that most operators do not know such as documentation. He offered to take his time to let me learn and do it on my own with him double checking. Not everyone there will be your friend but the people that trained me were all very nice. This job is very easy but some leads can put pressure on you but it is manageable. I disliked that this job does not have any room for promotion and supervisor is not around when it is busy to see the hard worker that I really am. She was only around when it got slow and there was nothing to do. Therefore, I got laid off while some other workers who do not work as well as me got to stay. There is always going to be drama and rumors but that did not stop me from working. Besides that, the people there are fun to be around. I loved that they have their own gym that the employees get to use before or after work. I honestly miss and love working at Alere. In my opinion, it is probably MY favorite company I have ever worked for and I really hope I get to come back!"
good,"Das selbstständige Arbeiten ist eines meiner Leidenschaft, und dies kann ich bei meinen jetztigen Arbeitgeber zu 80% ausleben.Planen, Organisieren, umsetzen"

good,"Overall the Abbott culture cannot be matched in corporate America, there was no direction in our little division therefore sales and marketing objectives were never met"
good,Good training and enjoyed working as part of a team.  Supportive management for the time I was there.  The hours fitted well with my work life balance and I received good on the job training for the production of diabetes testing packs.  The hardest part of the job was the insecurity of the temporary contract.
good,Good company but there is no portunity for professional growth. The culture is very good teamwork. The management are friendly people and listen to employees. Facilities are safe and orderly. The benefits are very good I do not complain but I need a change in my professional life.
good,Has a clear vision and supportive in implementing new systems which reduces the manual data maintenance. Overall a great place to work with proper work life balance.
good,"Best company to my career to build a better                  platform. "
good,"Bedrijf waar ik tot op heden 28 jaar werkzaam ben."
good,"Fast past under staffed Company Pays good but expect to earn every dollar. "
good,"Exigence et motivation"
good,"I love the culture and the people and what the company stands for. However, as someone who takes pride in doing their job and doing it well it seems that Alere doesn't offer those who go above and beyond what they are asked to do everyday anything more than those that come and do the bare minimum everyday. There is little incentive to grow or try to develop when promotions are given to people based on their time with the company and not their contribution."
good,"Healthy work environment that allow us to focus on how to optimize the outcomes, lovely colleagues who are talented to work in as cross functional team"
good,If you want to learn systems and processes then this is the ideal organisation. A lot of zonal power is vested on to the zbm. Good place to be into but there were certain issues related to immediate managers and top management
good,"Great corporation with good benefits, perks etc, though the environment is very stifling/ monotonous and Abbott likes to work its employees very hard."

good,"I really enjoyed my time at Abbott Laboratories, which was the catalyst for expanding my engineering ""toolbox"" and learning different aspects of the business."
good,"Super large R&D Division, numerous departments and groups, usually need some time to get used to. Nice people to work with. Best in class technology. Need improvement in IT support."
good,"A typical day for a designer is the usual-moving deadlines, changing priorities, changes in job-scope.  I learned that there is no typical day. Management was weak. Co-workers were exemplary team members for the most part.  Most difficult were the decisions by management without consultation from seasoned professionals on staff.  Most enjoyable were the challenges."
good,It is a great place to work here for the beginners. I have learned more about the measure of success for the project not just focusing on on time delivery and on budget completion.
good,"Employ friendly company, good work culture, but salary and benefits are not up to the mark.i learnt a lot majorly company is concentrating in science, Good trainers."
good,"Challenging and exciting place to work with excellent benefits."

Challenges in the past with the FDA impacted its leadership position in the US immunoassay market. Colleagues were very competitive and wanted to win in the market."
good,"I'm juggling numerous calls and tasks each day while making sales calls in my territory.  My territory covers a vast area and I'm in my car all day I work closely with obgyns, perinatologists, ob case managers from CMO's, triage nurses, hospital utilization managers, labor and delivery managers.  My goal is to drive referrals from physicians to our system of care.  Physicians call me when they need information about a patient on care or when they need my help getting them on our service.  This job has a lot of moving parts which is why I love the job.  I have a full day every day.  Never a dull moment with constant change.  FAST pace and I feel valued by my physicians.  I work independently and my manager counts on me to perform at a high level every month.  I work with an amazing group of colleagues who I respect and admire a great deal."

good,"Calling on tier A and B accounts. Doing Lunch and Learns and other educationals such as in-services in the surgical suite. Learned about the different fundementals of veterinary medicine and how each account is different. Enjoyed learning about anesthesia and it's relation to the animal anatomy. Management helped drive my success, and my relationship with my regional manager helped me grow both as an individual and a valuable representative for Abbott. Enjoyed working with a team that could share success to make us a strong region. The hardest part of the job was getting clear communication from upper management. As mentioned, the value of learning veterinary medicine and how it relates to the animal and their practice."
good,"The day start off  with email assignment to a particular campaign or job / work basket to work out of , face pace environment base of Sales and numbers "

good,"After the recent split of Abbott and AbbVie, Abbott is changing. It is finding to accomplish what is needed more acceptance of risk may be necessary than in the past. Everyone involved is working hard for the company to succeed and working as a team."
good,"I spent 20 years at Abbott Nutrition in a number of positions all had great things about them, The last few years was spent in Customer Service which was A/R , invoicing , taking calls which were order entry. Support to the Sales group. There was always different  jobs to do I would always be open to. Co-workers were great. I was sad when jobs were eliminated but I still keep in contact with most of the co-workers."
good,"There is a cafeteria on-site and they have free coffee every morning.  Mostly everyone is friendly and eager to help  when they can.  The upper management has Business reviews with all employees every quarter to keep everyone informed about the business objectives and  performance."
good,"I learned verification and validation.  I learned technical writing for investigations, deviations and CAPA's.  I learned regulations such as CFR, ICH and EU.

good,"Very fast paced job, quite stressful, very repetitive, there was very little line rotation. I did like the fact that I was building a product that was saving many lives and I did take great pride in that. My Supervisors were great people and I really enjoyed my co-workers.

Media coverage of 10th anniversary of Trading on the NASDAQ with CNBC. I learned how to work with cross functional teams throughout multiple company's and how to meet managements expectations. Met some of the most insightful people in the industry and have maintained those relationships even though some have moved on to other opportunities. Hardest part of the job was when I wasn't interacting with physicians, participants and just building spreadsheets, which were necessary, just not my favorite thing to do. Getting the opportunity to build a program that was going to streamline the business model and be a positive tool for the company."

Most of the individuals that work there are pleasant to work with, and I can say that products built at the site are made with quality."
good,"Great employer, and good pay. Corporate environment and values education. But it was hard to get in."
good,"I learned a tremendous amount about nutrition science, the healthcare profession and public affairs at Abbott Nutrition. This wealth of knowledge served me well during my 11 year tenure there. The tuition reimbursement program is top-notch. The hardest part of my job was lack of advancement over the years and being meaningfully recognized for successful campaigns and programs."
good,I worked under a terrific lab manager. I was patiently trained by a very personable chemist. I worked there as a contractor and the chances of transitioning full-time was almost impossible.
good,Face pace working environment. Rewarding and great sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. Great place to work and grow.
good,It was a great work place with excellent co-workers. Working in this place makes you want to go there everyday until management started outsourcing your work and then eventually your job after you trained your overseas partner.
good,"good place to wok, good team environments and also work on own is good. Pays wasnt great without over time. Great social aspect."
good,"Business casual to casual dress, coffee and tea on hand always, and fruit a couple of times a month, no set seating, updated equipment. Constant care to keep customer or client information secure, with coaching on a regular basis to help perform to standards or better. Co-workers really nice and supportive, management approachable and ""in the trenches"" with employees rather than partitioned off. In slow periods, chat via IM with co-workers was allowed, and portable neat hobby handiwork. There are quotas, which, if the data flow or computer updates bog down, can be difficult to surpass to any degree."

good,The work isn't difficult but can be repetitive. The culture could be improved. Management very much output focused. The salary is pretty good. Good prospects for advancement.
good,"Veel ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden geboden bij Abbott waar ik vervolgens veel aan gehad heb in de rest van loopbaan."

good,"The  management and staff are friendly, even though I was an agency staff worker I was treated equally to abbott staff.  Good work life balance within the work place."
good,One must learn how to have work life balance. Constant change to improve work life/company or organizational belief. Good benefits but hard to utilize it and PTO doesn't roll over. I wish since the company is so competitive it would've offered it's employees with competitive salary.
good,"Abbott has great benefits and opportunities to grow not only in the company but they support you financially to go to school , and they have an on-site gym"
good,"I interned at Abbott, previously known as St. Jude Medical, back in 2016 and I had a great time there. The co-workers I've worked with were amazing and very nice and approachable.

The people working there always had a smile and never brought any sort of bad problems into work. "

good,"The company I worked for for three years was recently acquired by Abbott.  We are in the process of being integrated into one of Abbott's business units.  Unfortunately, during this integration period, we have not yet received the strong management and leadership that Abbott is known for.  We still have non-Abbott managers that lack vision and marketing expertise.  I can make this claim because I have worked for Abbott in the past (as an account manager) and have experienced excellent management that contributed to personal and corporate growth, along with outstanding job satisfaction."
good,"They had a lot of perks, especially with food! They were all very nice, but you would have thought they geared more towards promoting a healthier lifestyle!"

good,"It has been an excellent experience for me to work with Abbott Diagnostics employees, managers and customers.  The work culture is one of respect and fairness.  I have enjoyed a lot of traveling time across the US and excellent training experiences. Unfortunately the amount of available work has dramatically decreased during the year 2017.  I am the mother of a child with special needs and my goal at this point is to have a job that would dive me the chance to make a living but also to have time for my child."

good,"I started with St Jude Medical 2 years ago, and they were purchased by Abbott Labs this year.  I like that Abbott is keeping the SJM culture intact for the most part.  I wish they did more new product development, but I understand why they don't."
good,"In my 25 year career with Abbott, I was able to learn many things, self direct my career, and enjoyed a positive corporate experience.   As a part of the facilities maintenance group, I was able to work on many projects with minimal supervision, and the benefits were great!  I would have stayed a few more years, but with the decision in 2016 by management to outsource our entire department, I decided instead to take an early retirement, and to try working for myself full time."

good,Abbott is best known for their Pharmaceuticals but also have a large presence in the diagnostic market.  Training was very extensive with daily exams.  Videotaped presentations were required.  The overall training was 26 weeks with time at Abbott Park and time in the field with a trainer.  You did not re[port to the hiring manager until training was completed.  You reported to the field trainer until you graduated.  The culture was very strong as you would expect from 100yr old company.  There were many cultural attributed developed in training such as role playing influencing decision making and over all presentation skills..
good,"Worked doing shipping and receiving. I would have small tasks to do as well day to day, so I never really knew what to expect. If you like sitting in a cube all day this is it!"
good,"Abbott provides some of the most innovative technology and advanced laboratory instrumentation. The clinical chemistry and immunoassay devices are second to none. Hematology leaves a bit to be desired, but the new technology on the horizon should make Abbott competitive again. The management for the district level is somewhat weak and has no ability to stand up to demanding customers. The benefits were great and the pay was reasonable, though lower than the national average for medical device service personnel."
good,"Worked for a contractor so few opportunities for advancement in the department I was in. Demanding work in a somewhat hectic environment, but the people there are great."

good,Working for Abbott laboratories is a rewarding experience with a lot of challenges. Team work as essential in a field service environment. My only complaint is they need to hire more people to accommodate the customer and the other employees. Overtime is essentially required and work life balance is a big concern.
good,Abbott India is one of the few Multinationals which still believe in Work/life balance. The overall work culture is very good and it focuses on scientific product selling.

I often listened to clinical calls and reviewed patient records (charts) to evaluate and provide feedback to the clinical staff. I created and maintained all clinical and non-clinical processes and trained the nurses and non-clinical staff on the content and the program. I worked with various departments (IT, Operations, Clinical, Enrollment, Reporting, Client Management, etc.) to run a major health plan account."

good,"Awesome company to work for!  They are going through some growing pains and have recently split off the pharmaceutical group into a new company called Abbvie.  The best part of the job is being able to educate healthcare providers in a way that helps their patients.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with mandatory paperwork and assessments while trying to move product.  Most co-workers are excellent, but you can always get a bad egg in the bunch.  The training is phenomenal and really prepares you for the field."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of working together with other members of a team to meet goals and obligations that are faced on a daily basis, while keeping safety at the forefront of everything I do. I have learned that one of the most important things is team work. People all need to get along and work together for the benefit of the company and for your own future as well. Management plays an important role in the day to day operation of the establishment. There is a lot of good communication between management and employees. My co-workers are like my 2nd line of defense I would expect them to look out for my well being and vice versa. The hardest part of the job would be trying to find that work family balance. The most enjoyable part would be knowing that the things we do actually save lives and helps people young and old to promote better health. "

good,I only worked there as a temp for the summer but it was a really great place to work. I learned a lot about how big businesses work which was nice since I was fresh out of college when I worked there. The people were very nice and friendly. My managers tried to make our boring data entry job more fun by having special lunches and themed days for us. It was refreshing.
good,"Overall, good company to work for. However, outsourcing and downsizing has made it difficult to move up in the company in recent years, and job security is non-existant. Products manufactured by Abbott are best in the industry, and company's growth/financial results are consistently better than similar companies in the medical device sector."
good,"I was responsible for 6-12 manufacturing technicians within an aseptic filling environment. To assist and collaborate with my team members to ensure complete and effective adherence of all FDA policies as well as all other governing regualtions and SOP's in the production of biologics.

good,Abbott prides itself on work life balance. It is a fast pace work environment with good managerial support. Advancement in career is most likely if the hard work is put in.

good,"I enjoy the work with Abbott India ltd., It was very nice learning experience, culture was so good, enjoyable part of the job is to meet top class doctors and discuss scientific data."
good,Your ability to function in the group is totally dependent on word written requests from technicians and design engineers.  Not a lot of emphasis is put on face to face interaction due to all departments spread out around metro area.  Position paid ok though regardless and others in the group were always willing to support your needs.
good,"Good place to work, glad I had the opportunity, I would work there again. Friendly staff, fair management, good benefits, wellness time is encouraged.  Culture is good."
good,"Has a positive work culture depending on the team you work for"

good,My co-workers were like family. Many of us worked together for about 8-10 years. I enjoyed my team because we continued to challenge each other to bring out the best in us.
good,"Worked with a variety of different stakeholders. "
good,My only grief about the company is you need medical knowledge for a technical role.  I was able to troubleshoot the proprietary equipment with ease.  I just could not troubleshoot the patients medical questions
good,"Good work/life balance.  Unstressful, Also great coworkers and company events that were involved in outside of work.  Company didnt last in area with toxicology part."
good,"There were a natural resistance to consider IT as a strategic partner to the business, probably coming out of pass experiences."

good,"environment is good overall management is good very good place to learning but there is a problem there is no vacancy for internees, the management should look into this matter."
good,Abbott Laboratories was a good place to work if you wanted to advance your career. It had many opportunities for advancement. It had great benefits. It also has a lot of programs to help you family.
good,Abbott had a lot of different departments and stations to learn. I was in DES and learned most of the stations. Management was good depending on who you manager is. The culture was great as well so many different people to learn from. The hardest part was when people were getting laid-off. They did not bother to warn us. The most enjoyable was all the different people you get to meet and of course the bonuses.
good,"There were 2 environments I worked in 1) research development and 2) operations development.   Initially I worked on improving the Abbott analytical guidelines involved with statistics.  I very much enjoyed working with the small team I was with.  There was apparent upper management conflict going on with the oversight of the research development at the time."
good,Typical day included calling on customers and giving them clinical reasons to use my product. I tool satisfaction in knowing that my product improved patient's lives.
good,"Entreprise agréable, culture d'entreprise ""à l'américaine"" avec ses avantages mais aussi ses défauts..."
good,"I like to work in there  but they did not hire permanent from 2001, "

The people were very helpful whenever I had a question. It was a very relaxed atmosphere but did demand excellent work.

good,"Working for Abbott is a great place to start your career! The people and projects you get to work with will be a benefit to your career. Personally, this place can be permanent residency for anyone looking for some stability. In addition, their product line is extensive and they have several sites all over the world. So opportunities exist!"
good,"Working at Alere was a positive experience for me, I learned a lot about working in a lab environment, how to handle issues in a lab setting, and overall how to work with other lab members as a team."

good,"Great benefit and compensation"
good,"Abbott can be an excellent employer or a difficult employer, depending on the manager. The culture is decidedly corporate and, having been in a variety of departments over the years, most employees are considred highly expendable, but with a good manager, and there are many good managers there, the experience can be very positive. With a poor manager, however, the experience will be a nightmare."
good,"Great company to work for, good pipeline and great colleages"
good,"Abbott Vascular is one of the best by far when it comes to colleague interaction. The job can contain a lot of learning and everybody is always helpful when you are in need of information. Abbott drive a strict and robust work place which entails you to be efficient, determined and ambitious. With the help of my colleagues, we have successfully overcome production obstacles on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. I've built up excellent interpersonal skills because of communicating with support staff, supervisors and managers.You aspect you may find difficult is that you may have to move station at any moment which can make it difficult to your routine but knowing it is the best decision for the whole line makes it worth while."

good,"Abbott's culture is wonderful.  Family, work, life balance is driven from the top down.  Management was wonderful.  You are always given the opportunities for advancement in your role.  Your counterparts were more like family members.  Product portfolio was always the best in their therapeutic field. Hard work, dedication and commitment were always rewarded."
good,"Company went through growing pains, but changed the culture for the better."
good,"I don't want to talk about it if you don't mind please. but the truth is, Alere was a good place to work and for retirement has good benefit, vacation and the only problem is the pay was not fair."
good,"Good place to work, various jobs to learn. Overtime  is available."
good,"As a research and development engineer, my work is usually challenging the new and unsolved problems to develop and validate the next generation prototype product. My typical working day is divided between lab research work and report/presentation preparation. Management team in the R&D department is supportive for research efforts and necessary capital investments. Relationship among colleagues within the department is usually good and relaxed. However, like many established companies, the organization could benefit from being more adaptive and more open to adopting innovative ideas."
good,"Abbott is a great place to work looking to retire and embark on mew adventure, working in lab beginning and raw material testing and final release.computer base LIMs ,Microsoft word and SAP"

good,"Abbott its a good company to work for. "
good,"I was a contracted intern engineer on a project to assist in building a medical device. Although the job description was fairly fluid, I very much appreciated that our goals were firmly defined. This allowed me and my fellow interns to plan our own days so that we could complete all tasks assigned and present them to upper management effectively and in the manner desired by our Supervisor."
good,"Work at Abbott as Talent Acquisition Specialist was very fulfilling and challenging.Learned and developed as a professional in the company.Got acknowledged and awarded for the hiring support to business,"
good,"Ambiente de trabalho agradável e desafiador, facilitando aos colaboradores mostrar suas competências e capacidade individual. Boa empresa para aqueles que confiam em sua capacidade individual."
good,"Mass hiring of contractors for multi-year project work with few full-time conversions because purchasing St. Jude's laid siege to department budgets.  I was not converted and mostly restricted to 40 hours a week while salaried employees worked double that.  Compensation and benefits, including a pension (!) kept senior employees in line, though some retired earlier than planned.  Great co-workers and managers doing great work, but current situation is difficult for everyone."
good,"Empresa excelente, trabalho em equipe muito valorizado"
good,"Een fijne stimulerende financieele werkomgeving waarin je zelf je dagindeling mag bepalen. Dit met dien verstande dat er toch wel een behoorlijk aantal vaste duedates door het amerikaans moederbedrijf staan gedefinieerd."
good,Very focused on goals and timelines; I learned how to stay within the lines and pay attention to feedback; management operated with very little imagination or creativity; the culture was very regimented and old economy style organizational style; the hardest part of the job was not to look for new ways to do the job. The best thing about the job was finding growth opportunity throughout the Company.
good,"Very decent pace day for the most part. You do get a lot of down time so the job is perfect if you're in school. For the most part you start early in the day and finish around 330-4pm so you do have a life after work,"
good,"The work is not difficult, but is compressed to meet weekly/monthly deadlines.  Management communicates expectations well, but may not always grasp the impact of what they are requesting. Being a medical device company, they provide adequate time and facilities to workout and understand a balance between work and family."
good,Abbott Labs is a very large operation running 24 hours 7 days a week.  It is very fast paced with many moving parts and employees.  This type of operation can be very stressful at time with a lot of politics.  It was a nice environment to work in with many good people.
good,"ABBOTT is best company. And I will do my best in this company. But I some better so I see another best job. When my post is better, selary is better and another."
good,"Originally from the company acquired by Abbott. The working environment and culture in my department were good. however, personal growth became in a stall and I found out that my salary was very low in comparison to my colleagues, which discouraged me so badly."
good,"Typical day at work was repetitive, but manageable. The pay outweighed the work, meaning that you make more than the work requires from you to complete."
good,Great place to work for if you like working 12hr. shifts. Benefits are second to none.  The people and the atmosphere are both of high class.  One of the best places Ive ever worked.
good,"Business oriented, stresses quality and productivity, hardest part of the job is that it can be somewhat stressful due to having to meet deadlines, etc.  Abbott offers great benefits."
good,A lot of good organizational development and coaching experience.  I enjoyed the work environment and the peers.  It is a company that has a lot of rules that they want followed.

good,"A ""typical day"" depends on what area you are hired to. There are two areas that I know of, Plant and Division. I was assigned to Plant side so I was able to see the area where the products are made. Abbott is big on safety, safety, safety (you are more likely to be fired for safety violation than poor work skills) as they should be since there are danger risk areas everywhere in the Plant. Forklifts, tall stacks of heavy ingredients and moving machinery are only some of the dangers. The environment encourages an attitude of teamwork with everyone around, even if not in your immediate work area. Much of the work is time/quality-sensitive so while working with and depending on other individuals can help with the overall ""team"" feel to the place, it could also hurt because of high stress situations. If everyone does there part the outcome is good overall.  "

Onder moeilijke omstandigheden (onzekerheid over de voortzetting van de afdeling)  toch geprobeerd om het gezellig en positief  te houden. Ik heb veel geleerd over diabetici en de mensen die er mee te maken hebben.... en dat het een nare ziekte is.  Directie was vooral afwezig voor de afdeling. Leiding was ver te zoeken en eigenlijk kwam het allemaal neer op de medewerkers die heel hard hun best hebben gedaan om er wat van te maken en zo de afdeling viable te maken.  Het moeilijkste was om zonder leiding, zonder vergaderingen, gemotiveerd te blijven.  Het leukste van de baan was de contact met de collega's maar vooral het contact met de pati""enten en dat men iets in hun leven kon betekenen om het toch een beetje beter te maken."

Overtime was expected, and the work environment could be very stressful with a number of buzzers going off in the lab at any given time. This isn't supposed to be the norm there, but is an environment that employees must endure from time to time. Because we were launching a new instrument, this environment existed for the entire two years I worked there. Management was OK overall, but the extreme expectations from above their level tended to weigh down on the entire group."

They split into two companies, Vascular and a Pharmaceutical/Bio-Tech, ABBVIE.
