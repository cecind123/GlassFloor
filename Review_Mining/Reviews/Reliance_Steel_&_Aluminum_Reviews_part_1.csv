rating,review
bad,I would give Reliance a zero if I could. I only worked there for two weeks but it was by far the worst two weeks of my career thus far. I got cut by metal repeatedly as did a number of my co workers and nobody really seemed to want to do anything about it.
bad,Very dysfunctional company.  People in leadership positions who did not have the relevant degrees or experience.  I was treated very poorly by quite a few people that I worked with.  I would not recommend this company to others.
bad,"You can camp here and no one will notice. No career advancement. Boring work. If you work here, you will become a master of faking happiness at work. This is a travel machine, go to any company subsidiary, they are still using fax machines, back to the 80's."
bad,"Reliance was a great place to work, the company itself is fantastic however my last manager was awful.  Most of the people are wonderful and the office has a great energy."
bad,"The Steel and Aluminum supply industry in the US is trapped decades in the past.  The main points that garner respect are length of employment and attendance.  You should not expect to be heard as a participant with new ideas until you have worked a minimum of 10 years in this company.  I was hired to bring my high speed industry growth experience to this company.  However, my experience in succession planning, 5S, creating key performance indicators to monitor processes and move towards lean manufacturing are routinely met with the theory that it is best to stay with the methods that have brought you this far."
good,A good company to learn corporate procedures and policies. Not much direction from senior leadership. Not much chance for advancement.  Retention rate seemed low for talented employees.
good,"It was fun working there. I was there for over 12 years, and enjoyed it. The people and culture are diverse.  It was a pleasure to help the end-user on a daily basis."
good,"A day at reliance is tough day in day out... Once you learn how to use hand held cranes, machinery it gets a little better to take on a load.  Management was okay while I didn't have to interact with them as much as other jobs.  The hardest part of the day was loading flat bed trucks with the steel that is ordered by outside companies.  Most enjoyable part was the hour break and talking to co-workers.  I learned a lot about customer service and that there can be no mistakes with an order/shipments, because you can lose clients."
good,Generally speaking Reliance is a good place to work.  Vacation as a new hire is not negotiable which is difficult as a tenured candidate.  Corporate being out of state is often challenging.
good,"Not very good hours, management care more about the customer then the employee needs, fair work if you can stick it out. Did enjoy the work but management was very irritating."
good,"This is the best place I have worked so far.. Salary and benefits were great. Co-workers were great and it was nice. Work and Life balance was good and had a great IT team,"
good,Good place to work. Very professional. Benefits are fair. Pay scale and advancement is limited. Co. provides up to date equipment and is openminded when it comes to new equipment. A variety of work projects occur throughout the year making this an interesting place to work. When I left Reliance I said this was possibly the best job I would ever have. So far it is.
good,"Overall, Reliance Steel & Alluminum Company as a whole is a great company to work for. Much of the employees have been with the company for 30 years plus! The morale in the subdidaries is almost non existent. With 3 years in the HR department I learned that most if the employees felt their job was in constant jeopardy. A typical day at work was spent looking over your shoulder and wondering what you will be accussed of next. That was the hardest part of the job. Other then that, the work pace is extremely busy. You always have lots to do to occupy your time, which makes the work day fly by! The company offers great health benefits, they offer a 401k contribution match and give employees shares after a certain length of employment."
good,"My typical work day at Reliance consists of managing a team of professional that provide exceptional support to our customer base.  I manage SLA, build customer relationships, identify opporunities for improvement and review new software that will enhance out performance."
good,Work environment is uncontrolled. No heat or air conditioning. The lunch room and bathroom facilities in the warehouse are in very poor condition and need to be redone.
good,Every day was interesting and most of the time i enjoyed the work loads. The people and atmosphere were great. I would recommend this work to a friend.
good,Nice working environment but they have high expectations. Well compensated for quality work. Obvious favorites tend to get most of the attention. Tremendous growth opportunities.
good,Team oriented environment that offers employees to work with cutting edge technology which allows a learning environment
good,"Reliance is a great company to work for, they take pride in their integrity and the well being of their employees.  The company honestly believes in doing the right thing and being firm, fair and consistent with their employees."
good,"Energetic, dynamic atmosphere.  Willing to take risks to improve processes. Safety was always #1.  Friendly people willing to help each other to get things done."
good,Great place to work .Number one company in the world with amazing benefits. Only negative is old school mentality but that seems to be changing. Lots of room to grow!
good,"It was a good place to work.  The technical help desk team was very helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  The work culture there was very friendly."
good,I really like working at Reliance Steel and Aluminium as it is a good place to work and grow. Managers are great too. Good colleagues and great work environment.
good,"This company was great to work for as a single person. We were on the road 70% of the year, which for me was great. It was awesome to travel to places I never would have thought of to go to on vacation. By doing so, I witnessed how people in other states live, their culture.  It was fantastic."
good,"Realiance is a Fortune 400 Company that has an extremely solid reputation in the business community.  It is well managed and provides opportunities for advancement, education, training and growth.  "
good,Very productive environment with healthy competition. Cares about people and helps balance both professional and personal life. Helped me advance in my career by providing training in new technologies.
good,"Good opportunities"
good,Best job I have ever had. People are wonderful to work with. I started out on March 14th of 2017 as a temp to hire. I realized quickly that this is would a great company to work for.
good,"A typical day for me starts by pulling BOLS first thing in the morning and verifying they have all of their required paperwork as well as making sure the scheduled material is actually on the trucks before they leave for daily delivery. It also includes Interacting with many different trucking companies, brokers and railroads to coordinate receiving and negotiating shipping rates. The afternoon brings on a different set of duties that include preparing the schedule for the next days deliveries and routing the trucks for an efficient delivery route. Overall a great place to work with some of the industries best employees. There are a lot of long term employees and everyone interacts very well with each other including management."
good,"We all have a job in which in hindsight we would have never left.  This is a company that had everything an employee would desire,  Great bosses and people to work with.  I should never left."
good,"Learn something new everyday"
good,Enjoyed working for Reliance Steel/Fox Metals.  Great atmosphere. Family environment with awesome people to work with.
good,"I answered phones, greeted customers, mail delivery, petty cash.  Delivered faxes, daily deposit, invoicing and billing. Customer service, reconciled accounts, aided in the warehouse when short handed.  Payroll, new hire training."
good,"â€¢	Answered all incoming calls"
good,Being in charge of my own area and given the responsibilities i was given and performing well. People therare great and we all helped eachother.
good,"I worked here for 13 years until my unfortunate lay off in 2008."
good,"As purchasing manager, I managed a team of five people. I loved the designing & implementation of programs and processes which enabled our devision to rank #1 of the 113 divisions in the corporation. Very supportive managment."
