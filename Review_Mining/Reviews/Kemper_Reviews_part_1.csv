bad,"Run Fast and don’t look back. This company has no integrity or morals and doesn’t care about the employees! They will lie to you, and the communication from upper management is HORRIBLE!!! This company only cares about making money. The turnover rate is ridiculous. I would not recommend this company to a dog!!!"
bad,The training is joke. Extremely stressful work environment. Workload is unmanageable and management is out of touch with how overwhelming the workload is on the claims floor. High turnover of claims staff.
bad,"This was the worst job EVER!"
bad,"New Management was brought in a few years ago and have not improved the company.  Perhaps the stock price and their bonuses are higher, but that is it."
bad,"The employees are given way more than they can handle the work load is unrealistic. Upper Management does not care, middle Management is expected to work as many hours as it takes to get the job done."
bad,"First day of training I started noticing many issues. Training was odd, and consisted of mostly shadowing veteran employees. After 3 months of employment I needed some changes with my work schedule due to personal issues. After multiple requests, my manager refused to help me and just gave me the run around. Also noticed alot of favoritism. So I quit."
bad,"I did not like working at Kemper. Too much of an office atmosphere, to much stress. Sweat shop feeling with too much micromanagement. I would not recommend this company"
bad,"This company is a hot mess!  Senior leaders are flat out dishonest and there is zero respect or concerns for employees!  I worked here for 10 years in their Dallas location and watched the new CEO and his leaders turn this once great company into the worst place to work in America.  Layoffs every quarter, low to zero merit increases and senior leadership with ZERO integrity!!!  Stay far away from this company no matter how much they offer you.  Do yourself a favor and trust me it is not worth it!!!"
bad,"A typical day at work as a Claims Adjuster was non stop stress to meet unreasonable metrics. You receive your own full load of claims to work and be audited on, but on top of that in the name of customer service you spend the majority of your day answering calls for adjusters who are more often than not on the phone with one of your customers not so sure what is going on in the file. So the circle keeps spinning around. You actually wind up hanging up on customers or leaving them on hold in order for your phone stats to meet goal."
bad,"I have been in the insurance industry for over 20 years.  Kemper was the third company I have worked at. I am highly regarded in the insurance claims industry.  Kemper’s upper management does not care about their employees. The expectations are unrealistic. Business is poorly managed. Policy count is out of control and they insure the bottom of the barrel. Claim count is through the roof. They are so desperate for employees that they put unqualified people in positions, including management . They do not counsel under performers  and the high performers are not recognized. They’ve handed out 1% raises for the past three years despite how you have performed.  It was the  unhealthiest environment I have ever worked in."
bad,"Overworked, stressful, lots of turnover. Would not recommend this company to anyone. It appears Kemper is closing the office and slowly pushing people out the door."
bad,This Company has the worse Management  and HR Dept.  Once your in a position for a certain amount of years they will not advance you to new career opportunities within Company.. HR does nothing to help employees.
bad,"I worked in the Dayton ohio office, which is run by part time preacher ,who is the biggest snake oil salesman I ever worked for.he lied every day about product and leads.selling people a cash indemnity policy and telling them its health insurance.i don't know how he still has a license.they give you year old leads and try to tell you there brand new leads.run as fast as you can from here."
bad,"At the beginning all was well. It's a very busy environment, which is excepted in claims, but all Kemper cares about is numbers. Customers and employees are the least of their concerns, I experienced it directly and I have never worked at such a selfish company in all my years. We (a training class) were told that we would get a raise after 6 months. When the time came we were told we had to wait another month due to our start day on claims rather than our actual hire date. The raise was unbelievably disappointing and evident that no matter how great you were, effort and quality went unnoticed. "
bad,"This company uses you until you are burned out and soulless. You are over worked and under paid. I enjoy the friends I have there, but I see the same treatment with them. If you are in the inner circle you are golden, otherwise you are nothing but a number."
bad,Kemper needs to put the same time and energy into the United Insurance Company's offices as it does the offices for Kemper.
bad,"Management often confrontational, rude, and at times threatening.  Quick to blame lower level employees when not given requirements.  Managers often find it in their best interest to not give you requirements.  Management doesn't encourage growth.  Management always micro manages.  Poor pay.  Too much politics.  This job was even worse than what I described."
bad,Kemper does not care about its workers. The pay is horrible. The overtime is ridiculous. Management is very unprofessional. Often didn't get lunch or any breaks. No appreciation at all. Lots of favoritism and preferential treatment.
bad,Mortgage brokerage. Best for self motivated people. Lots of industry up's and down's. If looking for stability this is not the place.
bad,"Rude, tried to work with them, was accepted to a nursing program and well it was not very nice, unless they needed something. I gave a months notice and they didn't do much for my client. I even gave up some of my own time to help my client out."
bad,"Kemper acquired our company in 2018. Work has been a nightmare ever since. 60-80 hour work weeks. Calling people in to work on their vacations for test environment code without compensation or even reimbursement of their time off. Expected to work nights and weekends. Changes are made without communication. Teams are regularly understaffed, and expected to do 3x more work than the team has capacity to handle. Recently, the company failed to pay it's employees on time (4 days late getting a paycheck this last pay period). As for corporate culture, we were told that corporate culture was our responsibility to create here at our office. They took away our holiday bonuses, our benefits are worse than ever, and we take home less money because those benefits cost us more. All complaints are simply met with the response ""that's just how big companies operate."""
bad,"While under the employ of Kemper, TA’s had access to 1 sourcing tool provided by the company. All other tools were generated using free resources established by the recruiter. When I arrived, 2 previous recruiters resigned-One got a job with a competitor, no process for New Hires and clueless, immature leadership. The culture is HORRIBLE! Leadership are bullies and the pay is below industry standard.  Candidates use this and other positions in the company as a meantime, in between time, transition opportunity. From what I gathered, current managers had no leadership experience and needed the title on their resume OR were unable to avoid layoffs, performance standards in previous roles. Its generally a sad environment, you can cut the negative energy with a knife. Positions with this company should be a last resort. Like everyone else who leaves, the experience I obtained in their chaotic, unorganized cluster of a mess, I will take to a more reputable organization with integrity and loyalty."
bad,This place is bad I mean really bad. They will throw a lot of money at you to get you in the door but once you’re there they will work you to death. The stress is overwhelming in the claims department. As they’re trying to get you in the door they will be nice to your face but once you’re there and through training all H**l breaks loose.  My manager was allowed to talk to you anyway they felt and get away with it. Speaking to HR about it does you no good. There’s a lot of new people there at the company trying to fix issues and there’s a lot of them. But they are driving people to work 10 to 12 hour days and in my position just to keep up I work six and seven days a week sometime . I could write a book on how bad this places and all the things that go on there. First off they don’t care about their insurance at all it’s all about making money and saving the company money along with not doing the right thing. So if you’re desperate for a job and you want to paycheck this will work but the turnover rate is very high. If you apply to them and you except the job just remember what you read in this post because you’re find out it’s all through.
bad,Horrible horrible horrible . Management does not care about employees. No work/life balance. Overtime is expected weekly in order to keep up with heavy unmanageable workload
bad,"Stressful environment, no good work life balance. There is a lot of turnover and managers are not clear about conveying the conditions of the working environment. There are lay offs that are unexpected."
bad,Do not work for this company. Management will lie in the interview to get you in. Short breaks for longs days. Micromanagement with unrealistic expectations. Unprofessional work environment. Horrible training.
bad,"Every year it got worse, as the management came up with stupid ideas to improve the company. How about focus on keeping customers and not trying to rip them off. How about caring about you employees that are loyal, instead of laying people off every 18 months. The best day of my life was when I was laid off. I now have a better job, and realize now how poorly I was treated by Kemper."
bad,Typical day would be start early leave late. Work a lot of claims sometimes too much. You were in a team so you share claims which makes it hard to work on your own
bad,"I was the executive secretary for a up and coming female manger of Kemper Insurance.  I learned that you need to be happy in your job, and your boss.  The management was strict and cut throat.  The workplace was not structured.  The hardest part of the job was the commute. The most enjoyable was the pay."
bad,Do you want a lfe? Do you want mgt to recognize your growth and worth? Do you want a company and team that supports you?  If you answered yes to any of those questions  Kemper is not for you.  My director  judged you on hours spent in your seat not work performed.   She worked 100 hours a week so everyone else had to do so as well to be considered proficient.   I was also salaried and a business analyst and expected to be on call 24/7...for what a requirements emergency?  She constant threw my salary in my face (Which was low) and even called me on Christmas day with something to do when I got back in the office...uh email anyone?  My team was difficult  since we were all pitted against one another.   I am a manager now at another company and put in fewer hours and have much less stress....run...
bad,"Not a good company to work for. Management yells at you and calls you names. Pressure is too much, unrealistic goals, people cheating and sleeping with customers."
bad,"It use to be a great place to work while in Jacksonville, once I transferred here to Dallas this past Feburary things has gone down hill. Typical day now is processing 1099 no chance for grouth in this department for me. That's one of the things that make this job hard. I have no complaints about co-workers."
bad,"A typical day at work was most of the time loud at times during the day. Those in charge walking around making request at the principal's office which was the head manager's office. They did not consistenly reach their goals and made in one month what the bigger insurance companies made in a week. As with any job you want to learn as much as you can for your own personal and professional growth. I learned a lot and therefore, I have no regrets. As for management they were the most unprofessional I have ever worked for and I have learned a lot from them. I understand exactly what human resources role is for a company, which the representative we have did not look professional and she did not act that way as well. None, the less, I learned a lot of good, bad and evil that happens no matter where you go. The most surprising thing that I got from this company and management is that they are willing to do whatever they can to save their company money. That means they will lie, cover up, retaliate, bully and again lie to cover themselves. I pulled my insurance coverage from them as well as I did not like what they stood for as a company and management within a company. They lacked the basic skills to motivate their employees, which was sad. It was a position, I was passing through and will graduate with my degree July 2013. My position is within the Health care Management and through their lack of professionalism within management, they have given me an idea of how I do not want to be."
bad,"Not an ideal if you like structure, process and company that cares.I wouldnt recommend to anyone .Will not advance your career at all. Management doesn’t care."
bad,"Top management doesn't care about anyone but lining their pockets. They care even less about their insureds, so employees can't do their jobs properly."
bad,Management is horrible. if you aren't like you never advance no matter your skills. No support. hostile work environment   can't get ahead with work flow. Not enough staff
bad,"Good company to get your feet wet in the insurance business, but run afterwards.The management does not value their employees. They sweep a lot of things under the rug for their managers including harrassment."
bad,"The coworkers were great but my first day everyone was complaining it should've been a sign of how the job would be. Some managers are nice as people but no guidance they don't set you up to succeed at all, it's way too much work and not enough employees and no understanding from management that something needs to change. Impossible to provide good customer service when you have to work 12 hour days to get everything done yet they don't like too much OT. It has potential but overall not employee friendly, they don't care about they're employees or the customers, they say since they are nonstandard it doesn't matter. No growth opportunities."
bad,"The job in itself is actually very enjoyable and simple. However, supervisors refuse to assist when needed, and belittle and embarrass you when you make a mistake after asking for assistance numerous times to avoid errors. Little to no quality reviews. The ones selected to monitor calls grade on how they think the call should be handled without any set standards to follow. Very difficult to manage personal and business life as they often deny request for time off even with very reasonable notice and refuse to work with you in tough situations. Don't plan family vacations unless you are ready to request it a year in advance and even then there is little chances of actually getting the time off. Yet management comes and goes as they please"
bad,Experience with the company was varied. It has been a very interesting experience over the past few years getting to observe the restructuring process.
bad,No comment.  Management is clueless.  They are always in meetings or are huddled together talking.  Some like there position but most do not but just go with the flow.
bad,"Please save yourself years of regret and do not work for kemper!!  It used to be alliance united, which was great but then kemper took over and they ruined it!  They do not care about their employees, including making a lot of them sick due to in office remodel and failure to protect them.   There are no bonuses, you might get a 1% raise, and the morale sucks."
bad,"This is the most unprofessional, disorganized organization I’ve ever worked for. Zero training so you’re not set up for success. The technology is like stepping back in time, it’s so outdated and behind what other carriers have. Very high turnover so you’re always taking nightmare reassignments. Very angry customers because everything is so slow here that you can never meet people’s expectations (think: a month to get a payment approved). Highest level of stress and lowest level of satisfaction I’ve ever had at a job. I couldn’t even last a year, and saw numerous other adjusters also leave in that time. Literally any other job would be better than working here."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work for this company.  They bought my previous company four years ago, which was an amazing, wonderful company to work for at that time.  Kemper came in and completely changed it for the worse.  They overwork their claims adjusters and stress them to the point that they leave.  They have layoffs continuously so everyone feels on eggshells and nervous all the time.  Upper management does not care how long you have been at the company or how great of a worker you are, they will lay you off without even thinking twice, and not even offer you another position.  I have seen them lay off some of the best employees that any company would love to have, and keep the worst ones around.  They need to revamp how they run their company because they will continue to lose valuable employees and have a poor reputation.  No one will want to work for them, or recommend them to others if they continue treating their staff this way.  Please do not apply to work here, you will regret it!"
bad,Use to enjoy working there for 16 years. Kemper was good and reputable company couple years ago but it is going down and people are leaving or getting let go all over the company. No job security!
bad,"Stay away from this company.  Does not adapt to change- on any level- well.  Does not invest in IT or system upgrades.  Sytems/platforms that should be integrated for a better experience for the employees and clients are not.  Lack of system integration leads to high level of frustration among employess and irate calls from clients. "
bad,"The pay was great, the health benefits were horrible. Management was unorofessional and no training provided. I have never been so unhappy at a Company. The Company has no morals or ethical standards."
bad,It’s a waste of time applying for Kemper as they just purchased the Infinity Insurance which is ran by poor management. Poor treatment of employees and retaliation is normal everyday life there. They only promote you when they feel like it. You can never voice your opinion or make a suggestion either they take your idea and make it their own and never acknowledge you or you’ll have a target on your back until they find a reason to fire you. The South Florida offices are a revolving door.
bad,Managent doesn’t believe in training. The Vice President of the company loves to come and tell the employees how much the company overall has made but only gives 12 cent raises. Go somewhere where management will actually value their employees
bad,"The managers are NOT real managers anybody can do they job, they choose favorites talk bad about you, it's middle school all over again. they don't know how to talk  to their employees, let alone run things the place is raggedy every body that worked there has quit don't waste your time or life fakiest people you'll meet"
bad,The company is old fashioned and slow to react to business climate. I have found that a lot of people are not qualified to perform their functions. Not enough HR oversight of management processes.
bad,This is a very stressful work environment. This is because of management in my department. The Life claims department is not a good department to work for.
bad,"Stay away if you value a healthy culture, team-building, team -work, care, and a focus on helping you development your career. The culture is very toxic."
bad,Kemper insurance takes your personal life away your always working to insure you meet your weekly quota's. Very competitive environment a family oriented person YOU SHOULD BE SINGLE AND NO CHILDREN IF DOING THIS JOB. They hold you liable for pre exsisting accounts if the client decides to drop insurance and it comes out of my pay if its not covered by a new client.
bad,Very cliquey. High work load. Two faced. Cheats pay. Cannot get straight answers. No consistency. Most supervisors act like they’re still in high school. I am unsure of the Kemper side but the Alliance United (AU) side is a joke.
bad,"I didnt like this job at all, the manager was lazy, the staff was lazy, and the way the building staff treated you was wrong. I don't recommend this company to anyone because for everything you do you don't get paid hardly anything. Go to any other building and you can make double the money. The only plus was the health benefits, sad to say i only made $8-9.00  for this position."
bad,"Extremely unprofessional place"
bad,"This is the most unprofessional, disorganized organization I’ve ever worked for. Zero training so you’re not set up for success. The technology is like stepping back in time, it’s so outdated and behind what other carriers have. Very high turnover. Very angry customers because everything is so slow here that you can never meet people’s expectations Highest level of stress and lowest level of satisfaction I’ve ever had at a job. I couldn’t even last a year due to the stress from the manager who was a vulgar mouthed bully to me and his agents. He lied to customers all the time and put them (and agents) down as soon as he hung up the phone with them. The office was always cluttered full of his personal belongings like furniture, toys from home, lots of tech. equipment, and stacks of paper everywhere, that it was so hard to get around in the office to clean it. Literally any other job would be better than working here."
bad,"A typical day at work would involve receiving new assignments and working this work-load as soon as possible, in order to start diary log during the course of the day,  Learned how to work as fast as possible, in order to maintain the diary system on a daily basis.  Management would listen in on our phone calls and micro-manage by walking around and advising what we had not completed at that time period of the day.  The hardest part of job was meeting up to the management's daily expectations.  The workplace culture is one of fear of the unknown. In essence, what more could you have done to complete one more work project.  The most enjoyable part of the job is obtaining a compliment, any compliment,"
bad,Minimal training for initial duties - but not enough for what the position actually entailed.  Position was actually much more than a Customer Service Clerk - was actually Office Manager duties with not enough pay.
bad,Management should have learned from prior years of poor choices and undermining employees concerns.  It hasn't and thus they are in a position that is not ideal.
bad,"I have been with the company for a while, Senior Level Management doesn't have a clue, there is no work life balance. It is very hard to advance and the benefits are getting worse each year."
bad,A lot of turnover. People leave because of the shifts required and the long wait to get an earlier shift. Job and personal life balance is difficult. The work can be simpler and less stessful if you didn't have to be scored on everything.  One day off during the week and mandatory Saturdays.
bad,The work week is only 37.5 hours so when there's more work to process instead of making overtime available throughout the week they wait until mid week most times and make it mandatory with almost no notice. The compensation for the amount and intensity of work isn't worth it
bad,Management is rude they have no filter and use a lot of slang and disrespect words when they try to mentor. System are outdated computer are slow at start up and they will hold that against you.
bad,"Kemper could be a great company, but your experience highly depends on what area you are in. There are some wonderful, hard-working people at Kemper, but the the senior leadership and next level of management do not care about employees. The workplace culture is toxic and there is not good work-life balance. I typically work 50-60 hours/week and get calls and emails that are expected to be addressed while on PTO.  Many employees are in the same boat and they seem worn out, distrustful and unhappy.  The management seems to figure things out as they go and do not have a clear strategic plan. There are not company hosted holiday parties, happy hours or other collaborative events.  There are not cost of living raises or large bonuses - if you want a raise you have to show you exceed expectations, meeting expectations will give you 0-2% raise. If you want to work long hours and gain experience, Kemper is a great stepping stone. Just don't get stuck!"
bad,"The company is not a good company to work for"
bad,Gain some experience and move on. I guarantee you will regret working at this company. They do not care about their employees. Management is the worst ive seen in my working career. Turnover is EXTREMELY high
bad,Kemper is going through structural changes and needs a better sense of where the company is going. Everybody is over worked and under paid and management does not have the training skills that people prefers.
bad,Top mamagement seemed to have a good handle on what a run-off company needs to do. The middle management didn't get the word. They thoughjt they were still running the old Kemper.To rigid at one moment and sloppy the next. Many people were out of their depth and many programs were run badly by people outside of the company without proper oversite. My assigned work was interesting and I certainly wasn't overloaded.
bad,"Very aggressive. But company is operating in under served market made up of poor, illiterate people. Where they can make more money without much competition. Not very good impression overall."
bad,"The company was difficult, due to the culture of the environment and leadership. Unprofessional in some circumstances, gossip around the work environment"
bad,"I worked for Kemper Mortgage on a commission only basis.  This, unfortunately, did not provide a steady income until after being very established in the company.  I did not get a chance to do that because the company dissolved overnight and fired all employees the next day without warning."
bad,Learned a lot of new technologies. Specifical the integration of mid-range UNIx systems into a mainframe environment. Implemented the Tivoli system management tools.
bad,"Kemper has recently merged with Infinity, a nonstandard insurer, and have decided to handle claims their way. Experienced employees are being RIF’d and being replaced with new hires in Montgomery, AL. "
bad,Stressful environment.  Managers micromanage and/or continually change procedures. Not open to suggestions from new or current employees    More concerned about shareholders. Little concern about policyholders and/or employees. Huge turnover. Poor communication between management and staff.
bad,Not enough employees to do the amount of work; always stressed. With the high volume of phone calls and claims it is too much to handle. You must be a individual that can remain calm in order to do this work.
bad,"Job duties were change to Underwriter / Customer Service . Take 65 to 80 calls per day from Insurance Agents from Agency's on Underwriters questions on Auto policies qualifications and process new changes . Add vehicles,  drivers , etc. Explain Billing to agents and customers , Make adjustment to Billing system, AS400. Its a Dos program that doesn't process changes and payments on real time. It  overcharges or cancels policies  or suspend by error."
bad,A typical day is spent in a cubicle working on a computer to analyze legal invoices. The hardest part of the job is monotony and poor management. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to leave the work at the office at the end of the day. I've gained an appreciation for billing compliance and its impact to insurers and legal service providers.
bad,Coworkers are great.  Multiple staff reductions in important areas.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done and all your calls returned.
bad,"They will hire you only to let you go!  Waste of time. They are shutting down the Jacksonville office except for IT.  No stability. People are let go every day. Walk on eggshells every single day. Not worth the stress.  Find a more secure position. No communication from upper management.  Everything is a secret, therefore, rumors abound!"
bad,"Kemper is a company that unfortunately is now only concerned about making the almighty dollar. They are not concerned about the employees that help them get to where they are. Kemper used to be a company that treated all their employees like family. They cared about their employes and made the company a good place to work. They get rid of employees who are productive and who try to make the company better by making suggestions for smoother operations. Instead, they hire consultants at a higher rate than they pay their employees who know nothing about the business nor do they care about it. They have hired several senior VP's at very high salaries while laying off the workers who are the ones working to help management look good."
bad,The job was busy and changing all the time. Alot of the employees were very nosey and extremely disrespectful. The pay and benefits were pretty good. The worst thing was that if you were close to retirement they were quick to get rid of you
bad,The environment is great!  The work load is a lot.  No advancement in the company and no bonuses.  I’m stressed out by so many phone calls.  Management doesn’t know what they are doing and they don’t follow up on their promises.
bad,"Don't bother. It used to be great. New upper management sucks. Training is lax. People at the bottom are cool, but not the uppers. I don't recommend it."
bad,At Kemper the job can be easier than management makes it. The management team has at least 15 priorties that have to be met on a daily bases. They are not willing to train or give advice on how employees can meet expectations. This is a stressful environment and it is hard to remain focused. They expect employees to work overtime with no pay and have not mentioned any annual raises. I got my annual review at the end of Feb and was told I would hear more about my raise later. It is now June and I have yet to hear anything. Please do not choose to work for Kemper unless it is your last resort.
bad,"Enjoy getting laid off in four years when they finally decide to do a true runoff. Otherwise, pretty good experience here."
bad,"Kemper, was a great place to work. So many transitions,. When changes are made, upper management doesn't relay the info until a mistake is being corrected. The new information is discovered not relayed as it should. Lack of merit, and performance increases. Moral is low. Understaffed. Lack of organization."
bad,"I really like my manger and my team but the company itself has a lot of growing  they are aiming to be a top company but have not advanced in maternity, disability, and other basic things. They do not offer work from him in claims and the dress code is strict."
bad,"They pay less for trainees instead of paying a little more to get experienced adjusters.  So many can't handle the volume & quit which is puts a greater workload on the restremaining.There is the Domino effect"
good,"Start at 8:00am and stop around 6:00pm, ongoing training, management needs training with regard to property claims, hardest part is trying to get the work completed in an 8 hour day."
good,"In the world of Auto Liability claims its a hard company to work for. They are wanting 16 hour work to be done in 8 hours. Unrealistic goals. "
good,If you are not part of a click then you are shunned. Management in the oregon office  leaves something to be desired.  Maybe this is the reason the doors are closing.
good,Stay away from the Dallas commercial department. The department is set up for failure. The manager will do everything to make himself look good at your expense.
good,AFter setting up company. Kemper pulled the plug on the project
good,"The work environment when I first started working at Kemper was very positive and then the management changed and it went downhill from there and the culture turned into a negative one.  They did have a message that they wanted people's feedback but if you gave constructive feedback in a positive way or recommendations for improvement of processes they did not want to hear it. It is very much a ""management by intimidation"" mentality.  Basically, just do what I say and shut up.  Which is sad because the people that work there are really hard workers and good people, it is just the management that is bad."
good,"While the ending was not sweet, the beginning was. Kemper provided it's employees with the opportunity to grow as individuals and work wise. The employees were great, made several long lasting friendships."
good,"Company wide changes are occurring, positions being eliminated, employees being let go with minimal warning and minimal communication to the remaining employees.  Workload is heavy as a result.  Manageable depending on your manager.  Leaning more toward a call center environment.  Perhaps the current changes will lead to a better overall environment, or at least that appears to be the goal."
good,I really do not wish to write anything in regard to Kemper.  It was an environment that I am best not associated with.  I am glad to be free to pursue new opportunities.
good,"Kemper is always hiring due to more work than employees. However, if you are doing your job that requires about 45-60 hours per week at no extra pay, job security."
good,"Typical call center, others pay more. Spectrum, etc but it’s a job.  The healthcare benefits after the merger became expensive.  It used to Infinity and the culture was great well in the customer service side but claims leadership is a joke, and The HR guy in Mcallen needs to be investigated. He protects his friends. A few  employees were let go because a group of girls bragged about that getting sups, managers fired."
good,KEMPER has been struggling with their claims process. There is resistance to change from management and management often fails to take responsibility.
good,"8-10 system to work iin and they do not work. Company invest too much money in a system and now won’t admit it was a mistake "
good,I enjoyed my time here bit it has it moments. when you think there need =s to be more training from more qualified staff members and employees. I would recommend them to other people.
good,"Don’t take this job, if you don’t have a back up plan. It would be great if the assessment test took place within the “hiring process” that way you aren’t completely out of a job.. they seem as if they are hiring employees left and right because they know the turn over rate is terrible. People seem to come and go at this company because of the exams they make you take, and of course the work load after you’re in. It’s not as professional as it seems and to be honest thus company is a joke. Iwouldnt waste my time here find something more rewarding."
good,"The Birmingham office has a really good culture for creating great software using an almost agile outlook. The upper management is worse, but the people at Birmingham do a good job of mitigating it as much as possible. Not the best compensation, but still got some good people that are good to work with."
good,"A typical days work is to come into the office do your turn-ins. Plan and schedule a days work mainly looking for sales and a few collections. Serving policy holders. I learned a lot of things mostly by trial and error on my own but walked away with a great knowledge of the industry. The culture in the office was okay on a good day everyone is happy on a bad  day everyone is very stressed and possibly grumpy. The hardest part to the job was the amount of driving and how it takes a toll on your car and obviously finding sales is always a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom of driving alone all day,"
good,Kemper was a solid company. Although the work may be monotonous initially the learning of the core task of the job are riveting. Work load fluctuates on your work pace.
good,"Kemper is trying to change its culture of siloed workers, but is stuck with long time employees unable or unwilling to innovate and management unable or unwilling to invest in the kinds of real change needed to turn things around in terms of updated technology that meet the demands of the current industry standard."
good,The local claims office was small and everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs.  After the office closed a few employees remained and reported remotely to a different manager.  It was a difficult transition and there was no longer any feelings of comraderie.
good,"Kemper have good benefits and decent pay,  but most managers are workaholic and they expect you to be the same way, so if you do the 40 hours you are getting paid for...under their eyes you are lazy.  Some managers don't have family around therefore they have no understanding of what work-life balance means or having kids sick. Most people dress very unprofessional and talk even worse. No chances of advancement if you are not part of the favorite people. Not everyone is treated fairly and surprisingly HR does not do anything about it. No sick time, all you have is pto but you can't use it unless you already accrued it. Since there is no team spirit,  you will teach yourself everything and you will become a professional in whatever you need to learn."
good,Local management conveyed a sense of value for staff and corporate management provided ample training and support programs.  Management also recognized employees with leadership potential.  Leadership staff was included in local management meetings.  Kemper was in a constant state of change due to corporate decisions involving sales of company subsidiaries and acquisitions.  There was a constant underlying sense of insecurity due to frequent downsizing moves and office closures.    
good,Reduction in Force is never popular among RIF'ed employees!
good,"It gave me great joy to help people out with getting a loan for their business or home, or just a simple refi, so that they can save money."
good,No I think it's a unique experience that depends on the leadership you fall under. Be mindful of your stage prescence and those that you interact with.
good,"They give you more work than they give you hours to reasonably complete what they ask you to accomplish."
good,Layoff employees every quarter. Fellow employees were wonderful.  However management was very incompetent .  There was always news about possible layoffs.
good,"With high turnover in management, environment was stressful and unpredictable. Lower management was great. Co-workers great.   High turnover, good employees go elsewhere."
good,"The company has spent the past 6 years converting 5 different insurance carriers into one conglomerate.  Growth has not been good, several mistakes were made by acquiring the most recent company and hurt the company financially."
good,"Beginning as clerical supervisor, and then progressing into claims, found claims very interesting, every file was different. Was in commercial unit handling large national accounts.   "
good,I liked my supervisor and everyone on team was cooperative and dedicated. Upper managmetn in Chicago blew up a great team in Dallas and created unnecessary layoffs.
good,"I was shown how to get in their system and then did the billing for a staff member who was out on leave. Then I sat with a staff member to show me the payroll process. After working the billing end, I learned a shortcut when having to print the staffs time sheets to distribute for each job that was done. The trainer was not interested in learning a new and more efficient way. I then learned how to do an audit. The jobs were already billed out and paid and so finding mistakes on parts and labor that were not added and then I was told it was too late to submit an adjusted claim."
good,Excellent for a new agen or experienced agent!$😍😍 The people were great and the knowledge was epidemic. Customers that I met were wonderful and very caring.
good,"The management, work environment are good. Nice building with a deli. The hardest part of the job, unless you know and have experience in the duties required, is not enough training. There maybe one or two sessions of training and that's all. Not letting the employee stay at a particular subject long enough to learn it before introducing another step in the process. Some people need a little more training than others. While some have the proper tools to work with, they may not be willing to share or help someone who is struggling, I have found this to be true in other companies also. Other than not getting the proper training this is a great place to work."
good,Taking on two smaller companies in such a short time caused a culture where employees did not know what to expect day to day or whom to seek guidance as there was such high turn over and no one left who knew the systems.
good,this was a nice company but they went out of buisess years ago. there is no reason to review them but this will not let me pass the screen iwthout putting something in this area.
good,"Kemper Preferred was a great office to work in, low turn over, excellent results."
good,"The coworkers are great and you get to dress casual to work everyday. Management is very understanding if emergencies come up and you need to either come in late, leave early or take the day off."
good,Kemper is a solid company that has been around for a long time.  Its business results are improving and its stock price has gone up. It has a good diversification of products and markets.
good,"I did not work here, it was a client of my former company. It was unfaithful and has chosen our competitor for better business outcome, but eventually fell in a pit,"
good,"I really loved working for the company, the agents, underwriting team, but unfortunately the company went insolvent.  I really can't comment any further."
good,Not the place to work if have lack of experience in the insurance industry.  Very hard to advance and in order to do so it's very competitive.  High paced and very stressful.
good,"Sold insurance products for life and renter's. I learned a lot, but it was hard living on commission based income. The training was very challenging."
good,was a great organization until it got too big.  HR Team was awesome and hard working.  HR Leadership was great.  Company is no longer in existence.
good,"Customer service oriented.  Intake of claims from policyholders and agents.  Assessing liability, monitoring auto repairs, handling medical bills and settlement of subrogation from other carriers."
good,"Salary is comparable to industry standards."
good,Company was very pleasant to work for until Corporate decided to cut staffing. As an agent and manager I was willing to give 110%. With no courtesy or prior notice the company will terminate a position with absolutely no regard to that persons welfare.
good,"•	Traveled to Missouri and Illinois district agencies to train employees."
good,Flexibility. Some processes in claims handling  that aren't efficient.
good,"A typical day at work is spent developing others to reach their goals and to become successful. Developing others can be challenging and very rewarding. Motivating people to do and understanding that all should be treated fair but different. My co-workers respect and appreciate my assistance. The hardest part of the job will be moving on to a different position within another company, so that I may continue to prosper. The most important part of the job is watching people develop to the best of their abilities."
good,"Good management team and wonderful co workers.  Supported insurance customers and agents via phone.  "
good,"Learned alot at this company, great coworkers, difficult to move up however."
good,"No advancement at all!!! fun co-workers, very poor management (depending on the department).. Each work day is the same, nothing new or exciting."
good,"The Head Company of Kemper decided to consolidate due to low revenues on one of there businesses - Kemper Direct. Unfortunately, despite great advancements in technology for Kemper Direct, low revenues & high insurance claims due to catastrophes forced mass lay-offs & scheduled closure of the company."
good,The company had absolutely no loyalty to its employees. They just moved out of Maryland without any consideration for its employees.
good,They were a great company to work for until they went out of business and then sold the company to Broadspire
good,"Some claims adjusters may find the job rewarding ,the pay is good and the people are nice ,but the job details were not a good fit for me as you are responsible for other adjusters work"
good,"A normal day working at Kemper includes being on phone for 6 hours  and 2 hours emailing customers. It was fast pace work environment. One think I enjoy about working for kemper, was flexibility on when employee report in for work. Kemper had an open door policy that let you employee determine your lunch hour."
good,"I am unsure about the direction of the company."
good,"All new management has turned company around; hard working and eager to continue improving company image and name.  Lots of new faces, company moving to new headquarters after 28 years."
good,"The office was closed in 2004,  no longer in business.  All employees were laid off.  Unsure if they ever reopened that branch after closing the doors."
good,"Great boss, flexible schedule. There are months that pay is low and referrals are down but there are also great months with wonderful pay."
good,"Besides the good pay and great benefits, you work your butt off to be passed over for promotion after promotion due to no good reason except what appeared to be favoritism or racism. Conflicts between employees were rarely resolved in a professional manner and with very little assistance from management. A lot of overtime spent there, and very little recognition. the more you do the more is thrown at you."
good,Good benefits. Management does not keep employees in the loop.
good,Left to go to Kemper for more money and better position but left to go back to Claims Management because they treated their employees so much better.. Pay was better but not worth the hassle of each day.
good,"Flexible with hours, but took away ability to work from home. Large turnover with field representatives, so makes inside adjuster's jobs harder. Still in state of change with new management coming from various other carriers and trying to figure out the company's identity."
good,"Have loved the new contract, compensation and benefits are really worth it, flexible hours, can feel like the owner of your own business, managers can be a problem."
good,"Good job but stressful and poor management. There was a large reduction in force, so hopefully management has improved. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"Support was very structured and disciplined in methods. This allowed me to learn systems administration and server support. It was a very enjoyable place to work for and learn from. Eventually, Kemper became the company known as Broadspire."
good,It is a very strenuous workload and the only hours available are from 10 AM to 7 PM. They offer very little overtime so it's hard to keep up with the workload at times.
good,Company has a great work life balance . Since working here the company has been pretty solid and the people really are sociable and knowledgeable of the subject matter. I just wish the training was better.
good,"While change in of itself is neither good nor bad, you can have it in amounts that are too little or too much. Currently, Kemper is undergoing a great deal of change in their IT departments. It is never boring or dull and there is plenty to be done. For my part, there are projects to be maintained, communications to be sent, meetings to be held, production support issues to be resolved, and when I can squeeze it in process improvements to be made. I enjoy the challenge of the multiple facets of my current position, though I don't care for the periodic micro-management that occurs."
good,"a typical day consisted of answering heavy phone lines and placing either homeowner's claims or car accident claims. Each one was different and interesting. Culture was amazing, I met so many helpful and wonderful people."
good,Very fluid organization with strong commitment to succeed.  Many new leaders make alignment and communication difficult at times.  Individuals are afforded plenty of opportunity to learn and grow but efforts are not always aligned or recognized.
good,"Not only did the Folsom Office have the most outstanding view of any other office in the Company the people who worked there took pride in what they did. We strived to provide exceptional customer service and deliver on the commitments made to our customers, agents and to the shareholders. Results oriented with a ""can do"" attitude."
good,Responsibilities involvd over-seeing a persnal injuy department/unit that was responsible for catestrophic claim handling in MI and directly invlved in the MI MCCA claim handling. I also assigned claims to various adjusters depnding on level of experience for various States.
good,It's been a good place to work with great people. Was able to learn and grow with the company.
good,Department head was very pleasant to work with.  Co-workers most times worked as a team to get the job done and to meet any deadline.  Outstanding company benefits.
good,"You have file ownership and usually you work 10-7 since most claims are from the state of California, but if you are licensed, then you start to get claims from other states."
good,"Working at Kemper, the people are great, but management is lost. The amount executive turnover is scary. They implement processes without consideration to their bottom line, and wonder why there are soo many complaints. They had a good system of handling claims, but they decided to start over. I am so glad I left when I did. The amount of stress there is tragic."
good,Quantity over quality is stressed each day/ hour.  Trying to go paperless so there is no flow chart for new positions.  Everyone will answer a questions differently.
good,Overall had enjoyed my 16 years at Kemper.  Unfortunately the company was dismantled and I was out of a job.
good,Good overall company to work for.  They value your personal time and allow for medical visits and family situations.  The promotional opportunities are very limited.
good,Company became insolvent after rating dropped from an A down to a C within a year due to negative cash flow and insufficient dollars to pay claims.  They may have reconstituted themselves in some capacity since insolvency but it's a different operation now.
good,"Bad management caused their rating to drop to a B and nobody wants to write business with a B rated company.  They went out of biz.  Before that, they were great to work for."
good,"Working for Kemper was a good experience.  As a smaller company, you had closer ties to management and more visibility.  It was over a good experience."
good,"In this position I learned about Workers Compensation, Automobile,and General Liability insurnace policis.  I typed poicies, ademdums, and insurance cards for clients and handled all correspondence."
good,Insurance sales is a very competitive environment. People don't value the policy as they should. It is hard to make a living when your salary is dependent on someone else.
good,"Typical Insurance company with high turn over. Tons of office politics, but you can find a friendly group after networking with your coworkers. I would probably not work for them again."
good,"A good place to work I only wish I could have worked there longer. I was a Quality Control Inspector. Inspecting parts and Pull testing parts to meet spec. I also filed test reports with purchase orders to establish traceability. A typical day included filing, testing parts and pull testing straps and thread in so that they met spec."
good,"My work at the Home Office has been challenging, but overall, a somewhat positive experience. An excellent place to work for a short to medium term. Only self motivated candidates will have the chance to move and advance."
good,Good company. Very stressful work environment because of the nature of the business. The company is going through a lot of contract and management changes at the present time. Stability seems to be in question.
good,Good place to work.  Business is changing rapidly.  Goals change every year.  Workload is heavy.  Other companies have been purchased and integrating the companies together is in process.
good,"Great management , lots of parking. "
good,"I worked for Kemper Insurance company for 19 years. I started out as a Casualty Policy Rater moved up to a Policy typist II and III."
good,In my work place we learn about teamwork and coming together as a team.Time management helps you with your organizational skills.
good,Great employees and Home Office Environment. Very employee focused until it went out of business in 2003.  Making a comeback in the Insurance industry.
good,Very fast paced company. Learned alot in a short amount of time. Unfortunately company was out-sourced
good, 
good,"My direct supervisor is a true definition of a leader.  I am very fortunate to work with an experienced leader who freely gives direction when needed but trusts you will get the job done.  The centralization of claims offices is creating change and opportunity.  With this, it is also creating an increase in pending's which effects customer service and expected goals to decline.  While our office (Syracuse, NY) works in a team environment, the hardest part is the volume.  With that, we have experienced adjusters that have worked here for 15 plus years so there is a maturity that brings the office together almost like a family during the times of increase to get the job done."
good,Kemper was a good company when I worked there as I got to work with many talented individuals. the workplace culture was very relaxed and even though we had a lot of work to do we were never unduly pressured
good,"work is fast paced as you have to close files, but not stressful"
good,Work about 8 hours per day. Many changes within the company due to relatively new executive management. The company continues to grow which makes for an exciting environment.
good,"Go to my desk and start. Worked with incoming calls to review, modify and accept payments for their insurance. "
good,"good people, good attitudes. Even in times of stress the supervisors still would talk to their team as people with respect. Proper backing, and providing the proper equipment to remotely complete the task at hand."
good,Handled all lines of coverage for property and casualty claims and was successfully promoted after six months from Claims Representative I.
good,Kemper requires a lot of their insurance employees but the management tries their best to assist their employees in their work. Pay in other areas is not always competitive and turn over can be high due to daily work demand.
good,Working claims isn't a glorious job but you learned how to deal with many types of people with the goal to have a good outcome for everyone. We worked hard to get good results and had some fun along the way.
good,"Everyday in the Legal Department you have to find ways to think like a owner. Some days it is a challenge, but I love challenge. I love to learn different type of task. The hardest part of my job is that I need to learn how to take lunch breaks."
good,A middle tier insurance company. It offers great benefits. This includes paid for continuing education via The Institutes as well as Web CE. The company is in the midst of a long overdue overhaul of its systems and products. Great supportive staff .
good,I loved working for this company. The only reason I left was there was no room for growth. In the 13 years I worked for Kemper there was only 1 management position which opened up locally. There was more room for growth if you were able to move.
good,Enjoyed my time here. My experience is worth its weight in gold. Great IT team environment. Was tasked with skills I still use today.
good,answering phone calls from insured assisting in changes or questions on insurance policies. Great team. Loved helping people.
good,"This company went out of business back in 2003/2004.  All employees were provided with a documented career path during the job performance evaluation process.  I was able to advance from a temp to Ops manager.  During this process, I was able to acquire and develop various skills from premium rating to loss evaluation and underwriting."
good,"The company has been very good to me.  Constant change makes the job interesting, however management has went in a direction to reduce the companies size which has taken the opportunity for advancement.  Salary far below industries average."
good,"This was a small ""family"" unit and we helped each other out and went out of the way to be there personally for each other. I learned how to track PC usage and bill the departments accordingly."
good,Kemper was a great company when I came there in 1997 but the new management and bad judgment put the company at risk and everyone lost in the end…  Extremely bad asbestoses Judicator in California help to drive Kemper out of business...
good,I liked working for this company but I needed to move on from this company because I had a another offer for another job.
good,"My experience with Kemper was great.  I am simply looking for more opportunities to advance.."
good,"Good working place to work. Laid back but busy."
good,Becoming a medical assistant was a lifelong passion for me because I got chance to help people and work in a fast paced exciting environment with pride.
good,Kemper Insurance was truly home away from home.  It was such a great place to work.  Everyone got along great and helped each other succeed.  Kemper is one company that I would return to without hesitation.
good,"The best co workers, very team oriented. Benefits are good. Management is very accessible.Location can be difficult at high traffic times; undergoing expansion construction."
good,"- answer phones, open mail, filing"
good,I enjoyed working at this company and we had a good group of underwriters.  What happen is they were a mutual company and there rating fell below A and lost a number of accounts.
good,"Good, challenging work with good supervision & good promotional opportunities. Good flexible hours. Satisfying work that made good use of my technical abilities and allowed me to participate in my part time position as Chief of the Long Grove Fire Protection District."
good,Approachable Management in a fast-paced environment with future opportunities of promotion after working a year in your current role.  Daily meetings with the team on the productivity numbers and areas of improvement.
good,"Kemper was a good place to work, professional great co-workers."
good,Kemper Insurance Company as an actual entity no longer exists. Filed bankruptcy in 2003. I enjoyed working there for many years as Assistant Underwriter. I loved my work.
good,Always working on claims and there was plenty of training courses to assist you in learning the industry so you can further your carrier. opportunities are available for growth.
good,It was a good place to work. I am looking for something else because this job is based off of commissions and that was hard for me. I had to go house to house selling and collecting.
good,"There are some good opportunities to work here. Learned a lot on the  project management process, especially on risk management and proactive planning."
good,Ik ben assistent keurmeester dit houdt in het keuren van kippen.
good,Kemper was a great company to work for. I learned alot and was promoted numerous times.
good,I will soon celebrate my 7 year anniversary with Kemper and hope to be here many more years.  I have worked for fortune 500 companies and small entrepreneurial companies reporting to the owner.  For me Kemper is in that sweet spot where it is large enough that you feel you have a real company around you and yet small enough that you can see how your individual contribution moves the company forward.
good,I truly enjoyed working at Kemper. I learned a lot about insurance for cars and boats. I got promoted to a lead clerk for umbrellas which was fun to learn and to put in. I made good money at Kemper. If they would not have closed our department I would still be there working.
good,"Work is specifically associated with auditing incoming independent auto appraisals, as well as claims handling. Supervisors are directly connected with their employees. The work environment is fun and productive."
good,I had not been in the job force for too many years.  I showed a lot of enthusiasm and desire for learning.  I learned a lot; the company provided me with much opportunity and got my career rolling.
good,"A typical day at work is going through emails, payment reviews, and listening to voicemail."
good,Great company to work for. Advancement opportunities. Company was very team oriented and that made the work place enjoyable.\
good,"We had excellent Managers, and they were very supportive and involved but not micro managers. "
good,"Management gave us responsibility and encouraged individual learning and growth, but developers still offered insight and industry knowledge to better our software"
good,I was able to learn a lot as a claims adjuster with this company. I was able to work independently and learn a lot about insurance. Its a good start to your career.
good,Was a good company with great supervisors and managers. Just could make end-meet with what i made at the time. Got behind on bills cause of slow down and had to provide for my family.
good,Most typically days consist of providing customer service to Insured's and 3rd party claimants through claims handling.
good,A typical day required inputing claims into the computer from claimants who had become hurt or disabled on their jobs and sending out claimants weekly checks in a timely manner. I trained and supervised staff members. The hardest part of the job was when you got a call from a disgruntled claimant because they hadn't received their weekly check.
good,"The customer service industry can always be an issue when dealing with disgruntled policy holders. At Kemper, the company gives you the tools and training necessary to succeed at your job. They are very patient to make sure training is not rushed. You also become licensed in the field of property and casualty insurance which is a wonderful resume addition."
good,"We have a busy Policy Typist Department"
good,"The job was relatively easy to do, but it was tedious.  There was always something new to learn, and you had to be swift enough to keep up."
good,"Day to day job was almost a routine at the same time very challenging it was never a moment of routine almost like robotic boring routine, very systematic and lovely work space that made everything easy and a best place to work in from the warmth of Dallas people to the amenities at work."
good,"- I always had to update employee records"
good,My team was excellent I worked in Product Management which was with great team mates and highly knowledgeable people.I was very proud to work at Kemper.
good,the people here were friendly and for a while where my job family. some people there are rude and maybe there is drama there but i didnt get involved with any of that. i just did my job and did my best.
good,As an administrator my position is amazing I appreciate my fellow co-workers they help immensely to help better yourself in the company. I appreciated how nice and helpful my staff was and is.
good,This company is no longer around as it was transitioned into another company. It was a very good company when it was in operation. Kemper was transitioned into Broadspire some years ago
good,Kemper was a great company with outstanding products and people.
good,dont pay enough and it could be years till you get raise you can learn how to do everything in the place and allthough they give you praise for your great work they do not give raises
good,"Last Manager and Supervisor were great, seasoned employees and with Kemper for some time; family came first then the job, co-workers were great too...."
good,"When I worked at Kemper, I started out in the mailroom.   I then moved to the Coding Department.  While working in Coding, I had an opportunity to do some overtime for the HPR Department.   I was told off the record that they had a position coming up for a typist.  I accepted.  About 6 months later I was offered a position as an Underwriter Assistant, which was later renamed to Technical Specialist."
good,"Working with case managers was a new and pleasant experience for me. it was also a challenge, dealing with 9 different personalities. i was comfortable though, having worked in the medical field and dealing with different physicians at any given time. i enjoyed my time at Kemper, while adding new experiences to my resume."
good,Solid company with hard-working employees that was forced to dissolve due to financial backing difficulties.
good,hardest part of kemper was knowing that the company was no longer there.  I liked the people and learned a lot working in the computer room.

good,"A typical day was to go see your customers and get their payments and make new contacts with other customers I learned how to manage my time and give good,quality service. The management team was always helping you to advance if you wanted to. It was a great place to work in you must have a sense of humor and a thick skin to not let people being negative get you down.The hardest part about the job was getting customers to pay on time. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people!"
good,"Kemper is a great place to work. I was given the oppurtunity to move from spreadsheet contractor all the way to a higher level analyst administrating multiple platforms from SharePoint to Microsoft Project Server. I learned a lot about business process, including SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle), waterfall, and agile methodologies."
good,I joined Kemper in June 2019 although the company is going through growing pains. It's the perfect place to grow and learn more about my career. I like my team the collaboration with my co-workers is amazing.
good,"Decent job easy job.show up do what your routine and no body or supervisor micromanage as long as you do your job."
good,The medical payment department is a great place to work in. We help customers in the process and also handle a portion of a claim that can be traumatic for some. It builds integrity for an employee and you learn what not to do.
good,"It is honestly the best place to work, and I would rather not have to leave, and I may not leave still.  I am just moving 2 hours away, and will need remote work accommodations."
good,Kemper has been a great place to work.  They offer a great work/life balance and pretty positive atmosphere.  They seem to be a growing company that will be around for the long haul.
good,Supported an office of 300 and 200 remote. The experience learned within this position has carried throughout my career.
good,"Identified and resolved technical problems and issues with assigned hardware, software and work processes.  Learned about DRP, Tivoli, Software packaging, change control procedures, project management.  Management was real good, had a lot of meetings and maybe some were not necessary but what I found down the road is that Kemper IT really had things figured out and under control.  Hardest part of the job was learning a lot of new software/products that were on such a higher level than what I was previously use to, citrix, Tivoli, etc.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the great work environment and great benefits, learned a lot of new technologies, short drive to work, good compensation."
good,Wonderful company to work for good support and teamwork. Co-workers fantastic people.
good,"Kemper is a financially strong insurance company that is growing.  It is a great place for a stable and secure career filled with advancement opportunities.  The company is growing rapidly and in litigation 2 teams were added in 2019.  In Phoenix, we are like a family.  Our goals are clear and attainable and the workload is reasonable for work/life balance.    Compensation is comparable with the market and the company has a stock sharing plan."
good,"Processed over 100 emails daily regarding work comp, general liability, property, and commercial auto claims. Would transcribe statements and get file's in order for adjusters for trial."
good,"Kemper was one of the top three insurance companies at the time of my hire, with offices across the country and around the world.  I started in an entry level clerical position and advanced based on merit, job performance and work ethic. Unfortunately, this company no longer exists except for a small personal lines operation and claims office."
good,This job involves phone calls and attendance in office setting
good,Great job. Enjoyed learning more about workers compensation.

good,Love the company and the people I work with. Insurance adjuster dealing auto accidents. Fast track department in the Charlotte North Carolina area currently
good,During my time there there was a lot of turnover my exposure as an adjuster was amazing I wouldn’t be where I am today if it was not for Kemper. They taught me so much more than I ever thought I was gonna learn from policy to the different types of claims and how to proceed. Wonderful staff very efficient they get the job done
good,I worked at Kemper for 27 years working from home for the last 9 years approximately.  It was an excellent place to work.  Management did not micro-manage but were always available if needed for any reason.
good,"I had a good experience working for Kemper. The benefits were awesome, if you sell a lot your pay check is great, but on the other hand if you lapse policies your pay check is affected. Also, must have your own dependable vehicle, and you are not compensated for any expenses."
good,Promotion given within the company along with bonus. Enjoyed working for the company. Management hands off as long as you do your job. Workplace culture is laid back.
good,"Easy paced work place"
good,"start at 7am  stop at ??, it was fun working there so there was not a fix hour to leave, at least for me."
good,"This is a non standard company, the benefits are good for a being a small yet growing company. It has it's up's and Downs but that's 1 of the things that you have to weigh out anywhere that you go. I have nothing bad to say about the company because I understand that it is in transition. I came in at a good time I'm able to see the company grow and I want to grow with the company"

If you are looking for a stress-free, stable job, then look no further! Apply! I love it here! You typically get a half hour (unpaid) lunch, and two breaks, (paid). You can take an hour for lunch if you work an extra half hour. Very flexible schedule!"
