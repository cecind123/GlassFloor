good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
bad,"No rehire, terrible place to work for, never being recognized for your work, never learn anything new on the job, and not enough pay to put up with things in the work place. No heat no air, mandatory Saturdays and mandatory overtime no exceptions. 2 10min breaks and 1 20min lunch and high turn over rate."
bad,"If you want to be part of a company that expects you to be a lemming and fall in line, step right up! Blindly go along with everything Worthington does, even if it’s a paycut disguised as a positive, and you’ll be in management in no time. Listen to them preach work life balance, but then have opportunities/promotions withheld since you have to leave at 5:00, because you have a family. Listen to workplace inclusion mantras ad nauseam, yet watch people be groomed for positions, never being afforded a shot at the opportunity. Listen to them boast of workplace flexibility and then, not so subtly, make it known that workplace flexibility is there on paper, but that it’s discouraged to actually take advantage of. Read about how they operate on “the Golden Rule” and then watch as the opposite of that philosophy is put in place. Sit back and take blame from team leads that desperately cannot bear to fail in front of managers, so the blame for team lead level mistakes gets placed on you. Would you like to dispute that these issues are your fault? Too bad, because your team manager is never around and ONLY communicates with the team lead. So if you have an issue with the team lead that needs discussed, too bad! Openly communicate to your team lead that you need support, receive response that “you always have my support”, at no point actually receive any support. Watch as people who are not good leaders get placed into leadership positions, which then destroys the morale of the team that they “lead”. Ask to apply to other positions within the company as a last ditch effort before completely"
bad,"I did maintenance on pickle line changing out roller bars , was in charge of all chemicals pertaining to pickling line, acid and costic soda. Also had to test in lab setting, titrations of chemicals to configure the amounts of acid , rust and ph levels that were required to clean rolls of steal . Also wrote the safety procedures for loading and unloading of various chemicals. Was in charge of DI water system."
bad,"This place puts you in a class for two weeks to learn just all the paper work and groups who have to join or you won't work there. Then they put however many is in the class on the floor with a guy they call a training Buddy, But how is one guy going to show a group how stuff is supposed to be done?This job is bogus!"
bad,The only way you can advance at worthington is if you have a friend or relative in a higher position i have been passed up numerous times for people way less qualified to preform said work horable leadership on all shifts not sure how this place is still in business
bad,They work you 90 hours a week without any time off to replenish. They tell you stuff one day then change their minds the next day. They dont treat you right.
bad,Management is a joke the lie to the employees almost on a hourly basis they have no clue what to do the area manager is completely stupid and the HR is incompetent
bad,"Terrible management, most team leaders or group leaders walking around not doing anything, you have to ask for permission to go to the bathroom, pay is terrible for the work you do, raises are terrible and rarely happen, to work here you might as well be a human robot, your nothing to them, its a revolving door with how many people come to work and leave. They do anything they can to make sure you dont receive profit sharing, work 60 hours a week, if not your mandated to, only 3 20 minute breaks, the place is miserable, i highly recommend not working for worthington."
bad,"Learned how to weld here. Weld trainer and never present. Company was taken over by idiots. And to get bonuses, or pay increases you had to be buddy buddy with an employee council, not the managers."
bad,"Kiss butts and  femailes; you will be moving up.  "
bad,managment is very bad and threating their employees so much racism using other people cannot use restroom without their permision using employees force to do work
bad,"I went to work at 5 am and worked until 6 pm. I was promised profit sharing but never saw it. The touted ""Our Philosophy"" is not followed. Retaliation is alive and well. The culture is horrible. I would not recommend this company to anyone especially anyone who wants to work in a plant, especially a plant that is an acquisition and outside of Ohio as corporate which is in Ohio seems to thinks everyone outside of Ohio is lacking is brain capacity. There is no room for advancement- they only believe in lateral moves."
bad,"Typically a day was interesting,somewhat challenging. Iearned with this company,due reviews check out the back ground before determining an job offer. In the beginning management was, seemed to be in control and balanced,within the first six months management gave announcement company were closing. Not had chancereally to have insight on culture. Hardest part excepting the job not knowing in beginning company were closing. The hours and rotation were satisfying."
bad,I wouldn't  work  there again  very  rude and disrespectful. .no twam work just leave u hanging on the line hot and racist  place to work .wouldn't  recommend  any one
bad,"Out of touch management, rotating shifts, 2 weeks then go next shift 1,2,3. Low pay bad benefits."
bad,"Not only was this facility poorly managed, there were times employees were told not to cash our paychecks till the following week. The facility was rented and the owners came into the facility at one point demanding money due to the fact that the CEO had not paid rent in months. Was asked to preform questionable duties simply because the Doctor or PA was too ""busy"" to do it (aka i would rather sit in my office and eat something while you don't get a lunch because I'm making you do my job). Staff did not abide by any HIPAA regulations. "
bad,If your are a skilled tradesmen and know your craft this is not the place for you. You will be surrounded around people who actually have no skill trade at all in fact they are grandfathered in by family members who have retired from here. Now the workers that are there now sit back and wait for an actual tradesmen to work their job. They overwork them to make a quota then fire them
bad,"Had to band steel coils so that they would not come undone. They were a very fast paced plant slitting steel coils down. Some of the steel was very hard to bend, due to the thickness of the steel. Had to use an overhead crane to move some of the steel coils around and to band them."
bad,"Management does not care about the employees.  Safety is preached as the #1 priority but if a shipment is going to be late then they don’t care about safety.  The company claims that everyone is family, but the majority of people only care about themselves and will stab you in the back the first chance they get."
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
bad,"Just a BIG sweat box. Monkeys can run this place better. Currently hold 3 welding certs and was told I'm unqualified to tack weld...""mind blown"". My advice just stay away. All they care about is their numbers.  No room for advancement."
bad,"The Columbus facilities may be great places to work, but the Monroe location is not! Swing shift, low wages, pretty much a sweat shop. Co-workers would throw you under the bus in a second. One of the worst jobs I ever had, and I have worked in manufacturing over 30 years. Steer clear of Worthington in Monroe, Oh."
bad,"I worked at Worthington and during my employment at the factory I was promised to be trained on welding. Never was taught. If you wasnt related to the Hr lady or a manager, or supervisor you get booted from your job until there friends or family dont want to do that job anymore then you get placed back doing your job. You have no advancement in this facility if you aren't related to or a long time friend of management. Small facility had no training when I got hired. They showed me how to load fixutares one time and then walked away the person I was working with got to throw temper tantrums until he got his way due to being related to the lady in Hr. Horrible place to work."
bad,"Place sucks, bunch of liars, jack loves you, dont waste your time, constantly laying off, free training to take and make better money is the only plus to the place."
bad,"bad management, machines always down, too much overtime, employees create conflict. "
bad,Work was not bad but company often did not live up to promises.  The maintenance department was forced to work 12 days on 2 days off I did this for over 2 years.  When hired was told that this would only be for 3 or 4 months but was permanent.  Became grueling on mind and body.
bad,"Worked to the bone with a terrible attendance policy, I am not happy with the policies and guidelines of the company, and look forward to bringing my skills to a better environment"
bad,"A company revolving around a central core of lifelong loyalists, a loyalty to the deceased founder that borders on a cult-like, hara-kiri level of obsession. Everyone else revolves around the outside looking in.  Their OSU loyalties are particularly revolting, particularly given none of them could have achieved admission minus their parents having had the money to donate the $$ necessary to build a new building on campus!"
bad,"This plant is being treated like the red headed step child. When I started it was Worthington steel. now we are Worthington cabs. They have stripped away everything that other Worthington plants get. No incentive, No bonuses, No HR in plant, No Management. They have placed people in areas that have no knowledge and or lack of experience. No support. lack of tools for job/ or none! We have a fork-truck that we have been using that the emergency brake does not work for well over a month. As they are aware of it and will do nothing about it!"
bad,Crazy hours make it hard to keep your family. On top of that alot of men in management are sleeping with married women on the floor and destroy there family lives. I've seen three marriages lost do to this.
bad,"This used to be a good company to work for. Current management has ruined this company. They only care about themselves and helping out their ""buddies"" which is completely against policy and culture."
bad,If you like being micromanaged and treated like a little kid then this will be a great job for you. The money is good but unfortunately there is no culture left in the plant. They say they run the plants by the golden rule but that is far from the truth.
bad,"When I was hired I was told occasionally voluntary overtime. No, it’s mandatory OT 10 hr days, 13 days in a row. 1 day off then you do it all over again. I was told I would be driving forklift for my primary job duty. I am not doing anything In that job description. It’s definitely not for someone with a young family. They preach safety but constantly have incidents, not doing anything to correct the problem."
bad,"This place is very hard on your body, The management suck's also . You only get 20 minutes for lunch. A typical day at work is looking on the computer to see what job's are coming up next so you can make set-up's for the next customer."
bad,"This job is decent for a single person. If you have a family its not the best. They hire you in on day shift and train you up just to make you go to the 3rd shift which is from 10:30 at night to 6:30 in the morning. Only 1 20 minute break for an 8 hour shift. The pay is decent and the people are OK, but managers horrible. They want the best work and best product but only pay competitive wageswages."
bad,when i first started working i thought i would live to have been there for a while but on the other hand. i worked there for all most a year then i had to leave.
bad,Pay is good benefits are good. But management is a joke. People who are wanting to become management to fix the problems don't get the chance. They already have who they want picked out for a management job. All they are looking for is a yes man. They say we are a profit sharing company but the Columbus facility gets all our profits. If you like being let down every profit sharing quarter then this is the place for you. Many have left the facility do to management or lack of compensation of your work abilities. Favorites of management get what they want and get away with what they want.
bad,"The typical day would start out with a meeting, to work safe, and to do your best. I learned to have more patients with others, working with people that  accept you instead of juging you, the management was very friendly, if  you had a problem you could talk with them.My coworkers were friendly. sometimes we enjoyed the oldies station together. We always got done in a greatly manner.  The hardest part was figuring out if you had enough parts and enough materials to run for the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was you could always laugh when you and your coworkers are joking around, they would include you."
bad,Company moral is pathetic. No advancement opportunity unless you are a favorite. They only promote lazy people who do not know anything about the job.
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
bad,Management was very hard to please and work for. I dedicated 4 years of quality work. They are very unpleasant to work for. 
bad,I worked at Worthington for a little over a year. The supervisors knew nothing about the machines or material. Management showed favoritism in their employees. There is no room for advancement and the benefits suck. The HR assistant didn’t like no woman that looked better than her so she wouldn’t hire females. I would only work here temporarily until I found something better.
bad,"No money at 90 days ."
bad,If you don't mind working 70 hour weeks and an HR team that messes up information and won't own up to it. I enjoyed the other employees but anyone higher up was not about a team or wanting to help.
bad,"Worthington,great company good morals,Wooster facility is not the place to be for a good future they play by there on rules though corporate isn't aware of it they tend to shield the truth very untrustworthy management at this facility if you want a good job go elsewhere not Wooster plant !!!!!!"
bad,Union shop but most employees side with management lack of updated equipment and very few supervisors who actually do there job underpaid for the type of work that is performed
bad,"Love the people on the floor. Management is untrustworthy and dishonest. It's never the most qualified person awarded a promotion. It's always awarded to the least qualified but, the one getting the promo is usually always a friend or relative of some one in upper management. I look for the place to go under or be sold. Cabs has never been profitable since Worthington Industries took over. The health insurance  is a joke. You pay full price for all dr. Visits and all prescriptions until a $1000 deductible for single people, and $3000 for the family plan. If you dont participate in the wellness prgram, you're charged an extra $40, and the same if your spouse is covered. Worthington Industries also charges you for everything as well. You may earn a goid hourly rate but, after all the deductions, you're not really makin $"
bad,Management lies. No room for advancement. Real welders do not work here as it's all automated and a slow moving monkey could do the job. The layoff constantly also.
bad,"management Is terrible,  the older employees get away with working less , taking longer breaks.  too much chatter about rumors. not enough togetherness or team work. cant trust management to actually look out for you. they aren't honest about everything far their needs for employment which is why they have a turn over rate. management operates without including the council which is a joke. nobody is actually clear on how to advance and be successful,  it's a lot of paper work and not enough action. it's most definitely not a place for anyone black. its very few blacks that work there. in my opinion that place needs better leadership"
bad,"H.R. & Management is cut throat & lie"
bad,"The company is made up of really good hard working high performing people.  However, senior leaders are extremly weak and disfuctional.  Not the same company it once was!"
bad,"-Too many meetings, too little time to actually work"
bad,"The management preaches safety but causes unsafe situations.  Required to run multiple machines at the same time, with no hilo support.  So you have to load unload package and put away finished lifts. "
bad,"The way management and employees treat each other is horrid. They live by”my word against yours”. You are not allowed to have more then one 5 minute bathroom break otherwise you will be pulled aside and talked to by the lead. Employees that report any sort of harassment or bullying is soon to find them selves fired for “other” reasons. Doctors notes don’t mean anything to the company, you will get written up if you don’t make it to your shift dying or not. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Human Resources actively ignore employees concerns about anything."
bad,"No communication from management . Most people there do bare minimum. Management doesn’t listen to there employees. Upper management changes to often. So there is no sustainable leadership, they usually only around for a year or two."
bad,Co- workers and work great. 1 person in management had been solid. Hardest part Bi weekly pay sucks. Benefits not great. In order to survive your living in the plant.
bad,"-Decent Pay"
bad,"As an assembler you will be putting things together until each hour you rotate to a new station.  While this helps for avoiding cor pol tunnel on your hands, it wont help your sanity."
bad,The pace of the jobs were very demanding. The work environment is not very good at this time. The management is stressed and it is flowing down to the employees.
bad,"Stressful,no chance for advancement, no training, everyone there acts like they are miserable very unhappy environment, Some really good people to work with"
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
bad,"Training is very poor for supervisors with other ones not giving you the information to succeed. Does not stick with the company philosophy when treating employees on the floor decent. "
bad,"Would be a better place to work if they didn't operate on 12 hour shifts. Over half my life is spent at work, which has made it hard to balance my personal life. I work nights so I work 6pm to 6am, I get home around 7 and sleep until 2 or 3 which leaves me 2-3 hours to spend with my family. They lack good leadership and management, on an average night I see my immediate managers maybe 3 times. Without a degree which they are slowly starting to require for crew managers, it takes 10+ years to advance."
bad,"If you like feeling like you could lose your job at any minute in a hostile workplace where complacency is rewarded and shop floor employees who were promoted into IT guide best practices instead of trained professionals, this is the place for you. People who try to change status quo and make things better are told that they aren't following the ""Philosophy,"" which is only applied to certain situations within IT and not across the board like they'd want you to believe. Endless meetings that could have been an email, zero consistency for performance reviews from one to the next or between peers, and improperly delegated tasks from people who aren't your manager are some of the many things that you can expect to look forward to at your time at WI. However, they do pay well, work life balance is great, and as long as you can fly under the radar for 30 years, you can retire from the company with a pension. Self motivators or go-getters need not apply."
bad,"While at Worthington Industries, I was always treated poorly by both the coworkers and management. They made promises they did not keep on multiple occasions and would tell me that it was my own fault."
bad,"Hired with promise of promotions, but continuously hire from the outside."
bad,"Overall the jobs I did was not stressful and some of my co-workers was a joy to work with. I never went home tired, my jobs was very enjoyable and I learned a lot."
bad,employee training not good expect a lot out of employees right away without helping them to learn no patience with employees wanting to learn don't like to teach employees skills
bad,"Very difficult if not impossible for women to advance within the Steel Business Unit.  Only a handful of female managers and 1 female director within the entire BU. Leadership roles are handed out to the frat club and not interviewed for.  Most of the ""leaders"" of the organization are actually managers not leaders.  I only know 1 leader within the BU that actually tries to grow and develop his people.  Most are administrative managers that just care about their staff getting day to day activities completed."
bad,"The money is good but it is a hard place to work. very physical and fast paced. a lot of mandatory overtime. I am all for a good paying job and all but 7 days a week for the last year is a bit much,"
bad,People did not have a take ownership attitude and employees did as they please . There were action taken if you did not perform and management had no clue what was going on .
good,"The human resource manager in pomona is racist, but if you are of spanish decent you'll be ok. They work you hard, and you won't have a lot of time for your family."
good,Prefer not to answer at this time . I need to fill a bunch of characters to go on to the next step. So.ths is not going to be useful to anyone at this
good,"This facility is horrible stay away, you have no life when you work here average work hours per week is around 60 to 70 hours per week. Management is incompetent leads dont even know their own areas that they are supposed to watch over, some leads harass you because you are a woman or talking to women. Injuries do not get reported to upper management they sometimes force people to have lunch at your 6th hour which is illegal!!! I've seen a lot of hard good working people leave because of management stay away."
good,People are encouraged to report all sorts of thing but doing so can result in dismal if under probationary period. Employees under probationary period need to be very careful of what is said to whom or risk their postion.
good,"Couldn’t keep up with parts demand, expectations for the amount of resources was unrealistic. Management knew nothing of the product we were building."
good,"Tense environment, learned traffic management, OSHA regulations, fair management, pace of  work place, OSHA compliance; experience Japanese very good."
good,"Very disorganized company that has a recurrent problem with late orders."
good,They work employees to death and really only care about numbers. They work the employees 13 days straight a lot and only give them a day or 2 off.  Not enough time for family.
good,No way to move up unless you are a Corporate person.  Also the we are told that we can only have 70% of the pay until we as Cabs become profitable. There are too many overhead people as well.
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,This was once one of the best companies in the country to work for until the founder retired and handed the keys to his son.  Everything went down hill from that point. People started leaving in massive amounts and the company thought this was a great thing because they could hire people for less money.  They did not understand that the people leaving had the knowledge to keep them profitable.  It quickly turned into a company that is looking for ways to save money instead of how to make it..  While there is nothing wrong with saving money the idea is to MAKE it.
good,"Good company, but no advance opportunity and not very diverse. I wouldn't refer anyone to work here long term. High Turnover rate also."
good,Was a great place to work. Slow growth advance from floor to machines. Better pay for skill but no growth or advanements in management...
good,Worthington is a good place for someone just starting their career to go for experience.  They are behind the times but are working towards a bright future.
good,the place stinks. good money management needs redone. ive been there six years and have been stuck on thirds for five of them. you only move up if you are friends with management
good,Worthington Industries was very fast paced and the people were very good to get along with. If it had not closed down I'd still be there. the job was nearly 10 minutes away
good,"the work place is decent. the people working out on the floor really do give it their all but management takes advantage of that. they work the guys half to death, running them through their breaks and then expect them to be happy. they tend to keep the bad workers because they are someone's relative and get rid of the good workers because they stated an opinion about one of the bad workers. The metrics of the facility seems to be the workers against the front office workers. the people in the front office think they are helping when implementing a new piece of equipment and then in turn take one guy and make him have to do three jobs when the original job they already were doing, was hard enough as is."
good,The managers don't stand up for their workers. There is a lack of training for new hires and there is a lot of finger pointing done. Document everything you do.
good,This job is a lot of over time and working weekends. Co workers are willing to help you and train you. The hardest part about this job is dealing with management about personal issues. But this is a good job to work at.
good,I accepted a position with Worthington Industries directly out of college. They did a good job utilizing the knowledge that I gained at school while teaching me about their industry and products. The people were great and always quick to help and teach. My position was located in South West Kansas which was less than ideal as there is not much going on in the area. I have moved back home to Minnesota since leaving my position
good,"The company is not a bad one to work for. Most the people are pretty good people, but, the few that are very negative and not team players does have its affect as time goes on."
good,You got through a lot to get on there. And you stay broke for almost a month waiting on the first paycheck. Plus having to buy boots. Some people work very very hard. And others do not. Which is terrible and makes the hard workers burned out. Beware if you get hired for production they will throw you anywhere they want. And if you don't like it there's the door. Very unsafe.
good,"At Worthington industries, we worked for long hours for very little chances of advancement or any compensations. The overtime wasn't a problem because i actually enjoyed the extra money. the problem was working 10-14 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week and never making a profit."
good,"Management isn't bad but, the co-workers are awful. Learned 6S. I like that they work with you on days off, great benefits and vacation time. No opportunity to advance unless you up and move."
good,It was great but it has gone downhill with the decline in the oil market. 3 lay offs in the past 13 months. Organization and communication are lacking. Supervisor is not a nice person to work for but he keeps his boss convinced he is the best.
good,If you’re young and would like to get started in the light manufacturing industry then this place is for you but if you’re past 40 then stay away. Between the steel toe shoes and the favoritisms in the company you won’t last long.
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Good pay for the work. Can be demanding at times to make sure the work is completed on time, but then again a lot of companies are like this in order to be successful."
good,"Line leaders seem to excuse the idea that you have a life outside of work and need time to handle that. Also, for upper levels, the pay really doesn't compensate for the time you spend doing your job."
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,Long work weeks and coupled with accompanying longer work days. Seemed to make most people their crabby. Along with alot of last minute scheduling changes
good,It's an overall good company to work for other and few issues. Such as a few bad apples of employees that ruin the day to day life. Most of the management team is a positive role model foe the employees but Somethings fall through the cracks.
good,Starts with morning meeting followed by assignments for the day. It could consist of outages to work orders. Also we preform varies times of privative maintenance.
good,"I really enjoyed working here.  Excellent culture, but the compensation was not anything to write home about.  During my time, profit sharing was a key part of the compensation structure, but the company failed to turn a profit during my time there.  Thus, the compensation was lacking.  I gained some excellent experience, and the company treated me well.  There has been some restructuring since I left, so I don't know how the culture is at this time."
good,Misleading in interview process about overtime. On 90 day probation and a lot is asked of you in that 90 days with no guarantee of being hired full time.
good,I went in worked and went home. I preformed my job as well as I could as well as I could but when I had to spend some time in the hospital they decided I wasn't working out.
good,"At one time it use to be a great company to work for. Cheap benefits, and profit sharing. Always a loom of the doors could close tomorrow. Use to be a family environment not like that anymore people only lookout for themselves, and will stab you in the back in a heartbeat."
good,There was frequent Lay Off risk. There was poor management. There was poor to no ventilation for welders.  The pay was comparable to other companies in the area.  The work was steady until poor economy in 2006 and poor management.
good,I didn't mind working here but the factory life just isn't for me
good,"The Company operates 7 days a week."
good,Swing shift work
good,"It was a good place to work for,everybody worked together to get the job done"
good,Company is willing to train and start working on customer projects. Work environment is ok. There is a lot to lean in Engineering materials and work with customers.
good,"The different divisions act as autonomous work places so they are not all the same.  Many acquisitions, mergers and some selling off of divisions occur"
good,Management was not doing a good job with scheduling.  We were working all the time to try to make impossible deadlines...Missing parts. Long hours..Try to make the best of it if you can..NO PROFIT SHARING!! THEY LYING TO YOU!!
good,"company seems to take care of you, unless you ask what the next step is in your career then no one has answers. youre constatly on their case to make sure your raise is in order as well as vacation time. if you dont bring it up to them, no one does anything about it. if you want to stay a laborer until people get laid off or quit, this is the job for you. but youll most likely stay a laborer until you quit or get laid off. no one has any answers for you or at least they just dont want to tell you. some new hires will start with a sign on bonus with no experience and will advance past you. no experience new hires will get paid more than you. they might not last long. but keep up your training and always learn, and youll be fine."
good,Very heavy  work  load. Not accommodations. Supervisor was so rude to people. Temps were treated differently.  Research jobs before accepting an offer.
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,"Coworkers for the most part were great to work with. The job was hard at first and is very fast paced, and on a typical day went by slow due to lot of repeation."
good,Plant closed in September due to slow orders coming in from the customers. There or different assembly lines that operate because of the different customer businesses.
good,Was a nice place to work. They are moving to Indiana. I did enjoy working with everyone. Forklift part of the job was my talent.
good,I am graetful for the opportunity to work with this company. I was able to utilize my skills as a fast learner and became a great leader in completing various task.
good,"I maintained machinery for production while using teamwork skills, I hate that the company is closing this plant therefore forcing me to find another job."
good,Cutting steel to customer specs. Must be able to work by yourself.
good,"Worthington Steel is a nice place to work. Management is always willing to help as were my coworkers. Here team work is a big part of the job. More than anything, here I leaned to work as safe as possible, due to the danger level."
good,This job was very labor entensive. It require strength and motor skills to building propane tanks.
good,"Left for a change in work career."
good,I worked there a long time and what was most gratifying were the people I worked with.  They had great character and work ethic.  Willing to take on new opportunites and tasks.
good,difficult and unpleasant people to work with.  Why would a large profitable company look the other way on this type of culture?  This is not just one workers humble opinion.
good,"Good company.  States they promote work life balance, but this isn't necessarily so.  Long hours, and they are slow to fill open positions within the company.  Often we lack the staffing necessary to complete day to day tasks."
good,Do you like to pick and choose who they put where when or based on favorites if they like you you get all the easy jobs and they don't have to do nothing
good,"Learned a lot."
good,"Benefits and pay in this job are far above average and working at Worthington seems like a dream job. The big catch is that you are guaranteed to work 48 hours every week and depending on demand, they will increase OT to fulfill the quota. The company is a steel based company so there is always a need for overtime. If you can handle making life your work, this is a job for you."
good,"A great family friendly company to work for.  If you are looking for daily challenges, this is the place for you.  There are so many places of opportunity to make a difference, it is hard to choose and stay focused."
good,somewhat old school methods of approach but lots of experienced people
good,Decent place to work. Very bother environment inside the warehouse. Would not want to go back to working there. Not paid very good. Management not very helpful
good,Setting Dies for an automotive press operation.Robots fed the materials from press to press.
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,was a very good place to work just could have used a little more help from the other team members as far as training goes it takes several weeks to train for this job
good,"Ordered the steel for special projects. "
good,I am currently spending my days trying to find some thing to do. Work is slow in the automation department.
good,They have an ISO 9001:2015 certification.  Quality Management Systems in place but there is always room for improvement as in any company.  Great people to work with.
good,Worthington changed from an employee focus organization based on strong foundation to a stock holder / number based organization.  Needed to get back to the foundation of the organization.
good,"Great company to work for once you can get hired permanently, I work there almost 2 years and they did not hire any permnant people during that time. Held this for when I could find permanent work"
good,Good place to work but work/life balance is bad. You work a lot of mandatory overtime. Management is ok at times but you don't always have a say in your development
good,Welding on various piping and pressure vessels. I have learned quite a bit while working there I am now certified in 2 types of 6G and 2g spray for the company. Not much faith in the management It seems the place is going downhill from my point of view tho I could be wrong. There is a lot of good workers there all around great people.  Everything there is pretty simple tho some of the jobs welding inside of 24 inch vessels is pretty tough. I enjoy welding on coil pipes it gives me a challenge and makes me feel fulfilled at the end of the day.
good,"Working at Worthington wasn't that bad,we had a fair break time and we got paid a decent amount of money, but there was little room for advancement and the culture wasn't so good."
good,The work place culture is amazing. Everyone is very helpful.  The company is very clean and efficient. The payrate is competitive. I will definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a great place to work at. This is the place.
good,I enjoy many details of being employed by this company. The management team has been promoted within and lacks outside experience and or knowledge of other operating companies. The lack of manufacturing experience is to their management teams detriment.
good,They just don't no how to treat people and don't care anything about the people working there just numbers. They would walk out hard working people that they hired becausethey were not able to keep up.
good,Overall its a pretty good company to work for.  Company does actually care about there employees.  The worst part about the job is having to rotate night and day shifts.
good,Worthington Steel industries paid very well with great benefits. The only down sides were no being able to advance until someone was fired or quit. The most taxing thing about the job is swing shifts. They take a toll on your health and schedule. Every two weeks you have to swing shifts.
good,"Worthington as a whole is a great company, however less focus and care was given to the smaller, satellite businesses. More effort should have been made to find the right people for the positions and remove those which were not adding to final cause and path forward."
good,It was a tough job that taught me that I could do any work that you put inf runt of me so long as it would be fair and not sexes and not what you just.
good,"hard work but gets pay good "
good,"A nice typical day at work was ever one in there corners doing there jobs. I learned working there, that you can do any and everything you put your mind to. Management was pretty awesome. The hardest part of the job was having to work 2 stations when someone was out.  Most enjoyable part was knowing you have a set time to get off."
good,"Worthington is a good company to work for,plenty of work and decent pay. Friendly environment, and the upper management listen to the people who work on the floor. They have good incentives and the paid vacation is fair."
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,Had a great time working for this company and learned all the concepts of what factory life is like.  It was timely and organized and I would recommend this job to other friends.
good,Decent work environment with goals set on customer satisfaction.  Ability to perform with minimal supervision.  Conveniently located in a nice area.
good,I successfully completed various projects including the classification of drawings and machine schematics. Daily activities were fairly consistent and involved a project where I was almost solely self-supervised. I was also around the general maintenance team very often learning and assisting wherever possible.
good,For the time i worked at Worthington i have learn many diffenert ways of welding and i enjoy working there. Also the people dat were working with me was some workers to be working around...
good,Developed statistical analyst of different metals and heat treatment variations. Great teammates to work with
good,Worthington had just acquired the company I work for I so far I have nothing bad to say about them. The reason I am seeking employment else were is because of the winters in the state I live in
good,"Worthington Industries is as safe a place as you will find in the steel industry. They provided me with excellent growth and knowledge during my career there. The whole company was based in teamwork and cooperation, which allowed me to have great success."
good,"Had a blast learning and contributing. Safety is a main priority there. If your lucky enough to get into the company, the benifits are a plus."
good,I worked at Worthington Steel 24 years. I worked in maint.for 2 yrs. production for 10 yrs. and tool crib for 12 yrs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with other employees.
good,"It was a decent place to work. They didn't keep a promise to me on teaching me how to weld though and that upset me a little bit. The medical, 401k, and benefits were great though."
good,"Some of the nicest people I've ever worked with!   Management is in turmoil and has been for ~2 years with constant change.  That change can be a healthy thing for a company, and I don't fault them for making changes where needed, but the change takes a toll on the workforce that must readjust with each new management set."
good,"Worthington is a great place to work for, especially for someone who is just starting their work career. They demand strict work practices and are very high on safety."
good,"A day at work could be fast paced and exciting, working as a team to meet/exceed production goals. The team works really well together to contribute to the goal. The biggest challenge is maintenance to the line and the most enjoyable part is coming up with a solution and working through it to get/keep the line running."
good,Worthington Steel is a division of Worthington Industries.  Worthington has several divisions in many different locations.  Most of these locations is in the Midwest and northeast.
good,"Worthington did a good job of training employees. Typical day at work was managing customer accounts from raw material to final delivery. I learned how to earn and ask for more money. Management at corporate was fine, but different at the local plant level. Most enjoyable part of the job was the colleagues. Worthington did focus on health care and built a gym on site."
good,This is a well respected organization with many long time employees. Worthington has always treated employees with respect.
good,Good people but pay is not the best. This company is well respected around the central Ohio area.
good,If your looking for a non-union job( why)this for you. While I worked there(Porter) we tried to get the union in and Worthington successfully ‘busted’ it. The lower pay and little advancement will continue as long as they keep the unions out. I was unhappy working there because I was just a number. Employees were pent against one another through peer reviews. Totally unfair. Someone else trying to get ahead of you or holding a grudge give you bad peer reviews keeping you from the maximum meager raise. Lots of people were maxed out on there pay scales for years. Not a bright future
good,I worked there as a welder temporarily. I honestly liked how things was ran there. It was a clean and safe work environment. Most employees are cool to work with and management was also. How you was treated all depends on how you worked. If you done your job and done it in a timely manner then no one bothered you. I got laid off due to loss of contracts. And they wanted me to move to South Dakota but I honestly couldn’t afford to move 1800 miles. So it’s all good I’d recommend them. And would work for them again.
good,"work was based on the automotive market, in particular power steering drives. The environment was upbeat and fast paced, most people got along just fine."
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,Fortune 500 company plenty of room for growth at times it's hard to find a work life balance but they also have alot of customer demand due to there suppliers
good,only flaw was that the company moved to Indiana. Had steady work for awhile then died out at the end. Wish the Company didn't have to move.
good,"it was hot hard and very greasy oily heavy work but we all worked hard pay good gave us training iwas sent to other plants and classes cpr ,first aid,defibulator ,fall protection first responder,high lift electrical trainging, excel classes,plc training ect"
good,The company took time to train new employees. An employee could move up in the company with a little effort.
good,Not a bad place to work. I am just looking for more in my career. Want to be able to advance and I am not able to do that. It is very fast paced work and very physically demanding.
good,"Monday through Friday"
good,The pay was decent and the jobs are pretty simple.  The most difficult part is the pace and stress of the job.  Some people work really hard and some people don't do much of anything.
good,"Worthington Industries is a fair place to work.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good fair job with decent wages, and also anyone who doesn't have a problem with hard work."
good,it was decent till i got laid off. the oil prices dropped and so did the would. i would recommend this job to other people. the best part of the day was going home
good,Worthington provides alot of opportunity and benefit to hard workers. Good company to work for all-in-all....
good,The advantage to Worthington is that the management gives you the ability to make decisions to satisfy the customer and are willing to help you follow through doing so. My co-workers were never to busy to lend a hand and were always willing to set aside what they were working on to help.
good,"Worthington Industries, especially facilities in the central Ohio area, are fantastic places to work that value their employees and truly follow the golden rule while also prioritizing creating value for their shareholders. Specific facilities within the company though do stray away from the people centered culture Worthington has built, but overall a great company to work for."
good,"All around, just a great place to work. Friendly environment makes a big difference in work place. Safety first and always think, plan,and act. If you see something, say something. If you don't know,  ask. These are just a fraction of the mind set credentials I have just being employed here."
good,"Good atmosphere with tight schedules."
good,"It's a Good place to work at any level."
good,Quality group is focused on ensuring that manufacturing systems and measurements are in place to make a great product.
good,"WI-Delta has good safety and quality oriented culture.  The leadership is committed to safety, quality and productivity.  The shop floor work is not climate controlled and there is high turnover due to the industrial nature of the work"
good,"Started off as an operator learned all the machines .Got into lower management ,And really enjoyed my job working on the floor and in the office. Dealing with the truckers in shipping."
good,"company provided us with all the essential and tools to perform our daily task, had a projected daily target to be accomplish at the end of the day,stressful but fun environment"
good,I liked worthington industries but I wanted to get back into truck driving cdl a.  I left only because of trucking.  I was offered a job at new england motor freight.
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,"I would like to have stayed but i had to relocate. The people are fun and vary helpful, the work load was not bad at all if i had a problem or a question they were right there to help. Some even offered a ride even tho I had one and I was going to Utica. That just shows how they help out fellow employees, so yes I would recommend them to anyone who's looking for a fun place to work also a respectable place but you must do your work well and everything will fall into place."
good,This was a great place to work other then them moving to another state. they had a lot of opportunities but they failed when the new management came. No one knew what there were doing so they closed shop and moved.
good,Worthington Industries as a whole was a great company to work for. Corporate needs to take a close eye at there Salt Lake facility. The management at the facility chased off several employees with extensive knowledge of the industry and product.
good,Great company to work for.   Lack of Work/life balance.   Working at WS has showed me the way companies should be run.  WS is very good at protecting their employee's with safety programs and PPE.  Management seems to feel they are Elite/better than the people working under them.
good,"This job was my first taste in the steel industry and I wouldn't change it for the world. My day started out with management handing me the information required to get my job done as a rolling mill operator. I went through ""in house material"" at the beginning of the shift to load the machine and had a helper package the material and weigh it for delivery."
good,Typical 8-5 working as main artery between customer and Worthington
good,"Productive and fun place to work, and flexible work schedules for professionals."
good,"Understanding management,flexible attendance program,you will work at least work you 40 hours a week,and room for advancement. It is a good place to work"
good,The company believes in the golden rule treat others as you want to be treated and they live up to it as a company. Updating facility with a work out room and nicer break rooms. Great team to work with.
good,"Worthington Industries has several opportunities available for all walks of life, but one aspect common across all of these opportunities is the culture. Worthington is known for their philosophy and putting people first, and as a company, I feel they do a good job of doing just that."
good,I was there for over 20 years and they helped me raise a family and have a comfortable life. You could grow if you wanted to and the training was outstanding.
good,"Good place, good people who are always prepared to work.  Theres opportunity for advancement and theres alot of motivation involved. Fun and professional enviroment."
good,Worthington Steel (Worthington Industries) was a great company to work for.  The employees were given a lot of autonomy and empowered to make good decisions.  The benefits were great and the people are fun and hard working.
good,"Transitional training and  resource development coaching and training is helping to build a world class company."
good,"Great company....they really value people...pay is average.  Despite the production challenges, I enjoy going to work every day.  The benefits are good."
good,"I enjoyed my job with Worthington Industries (Palmer Tank).  With oil and natural gas prices falling, so did demand.  The company was forced to ""right size"" the company.  In that, they had to let 90 of us go."
good,Great company to work for culture centered around the people who work for the company
good,"Let me start off with Worthington Industries (WI) being a wonderful place to work. It has absolutely wonderful policies for both hourly employees (who are actually on what they call ""salary plan"") and salaried employees. There's a wonderful culture there, and everyone is treated so well. The Golden Rule is actually one of WI's policies. "
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Worthington Steel was the positive atmosphere. Everyone worked as a team. The hardest part was working the summer while operating cutting the steel.
good,"Had a bad year. Lost two grandparents, diagnosed with diabetis. They worked with me as much as they could. Feel it was more on the professional level and not personal."
good,"5-3:30 depending on what got screwed up that day, sometime we were their till about 8 at night.  Managment is terrible, they would tell you one thing one and then tell you the complete opposite the next day and then deny they ever said it. They said they cared about you but it was obvious they didn’t, I was at work more then I was at home. Favoritism is pretty bad there, cooperate doesn’t even have a clue because management puts on happy faces when they come around, they need welders bad but they lose them faster then they can hire them."
good,"good company, good people. You learn a lot. good benefit. I suggest this company for anybody. Felt like working in a familly oriented environment. It is the place to be."
good,the logistics female manager is awesome. I think her name is kim. she is so nice. she's the reason I got the job offer. anything I needed she was there to assist.
good,WSP Taylor is a great place to work. The good people and management listens very well. It just takes a while for changes to happen but they do happen in this plant and the people are very good to work with you are basically family when you work there
good,consist of making small parts for all trailers. I learned how to fit and cut to adjust. Manger is very helpful and considerate. were very helpful. learning all the different small parts .Complete my process with out help.
good,There was always something new to learn on a daly basis. There was a great group of people to work with and we always pulled together to get the jobs done.
good,"Group lead 18 people daily. Did daily turn-ins for production"
good,"In six sigma project, I have managed a team of four six sigma green belt candidates to work for Worthington Steel, conducting analysis for their extremely high late release rate in transportation department. We were able to sort and summarize key variables from their complex database. By following the six sigma DMAIC process, we provided three solutions including a redesign of information exchange screen used by transportation department to communicate with sales department and one control mechanism to decrease and control their late release ratio. I am proud of the fact that our clients valued our contributions. Because of those experiences, I was able to develop my leadership skills and obtained a deep understanding of the importance of communication and collaboration, especially in a well diversified team."
good,"Work with various steel sheet sizes. Consistently enforced safe work practices in compliance with OSHA. Great relationship building with co-workers and upper management. Efficiently completed maintenance logs daily. Went over and above job description duties in preventative maintenance on machines. Assisted cut-to-length operator as needed. "
good,"Worthington Industries is a Fortune 500 company that is full of opportunities to advance and self improve with college reimbursement, onsite medical facility, and gym."
good,A very good place to learn about manufacturing industry. I learned a lot about safe work practices and efficiency when it comes to productivity.
good,"I have really enjoyed working here at Worthington industries.  I haven´t worked here long but I´ve really enjoyed my time.  I do some routine work, but I also have a great deal of freedom to create new processes to the way I do things as well as opportunities to solve problems and think critically.  I got along really well with everyone there.  At every job, there always seems to be that one person that is just very unpleasant and difficult to deal with.  Not at this one.  I spent a lot of time thinking about how it seemed too good to be true.  It turns out it was because a few days ago they announced that our facility is closing.  I would have been quite happy to stay there for several years provided that I would have had the opportunity for growth in that time.  Unfortunately, though it´s back to the old job search again."
good,"Worthington is a great company to work for, You can walk into it with having very low experience and walk out a pro. Worthington teaches you how to work safe and smart, everyone is friendly and it becomes a wonderful place to work for, as long as you are being productive and safe you will be treated fairly. Wortington steel is definitely a company that you wouldn't regret working for."
good,"I once operated behind the 20 inch steering wheel, and this time Im here to stay..."
good,I love working here.. benefits are amazing as well as the quarterly profit sharing.  Close family atmosphere among the employees.  High level of stress and very fast paced.  Must have dedication to work here.
good,"Amazing benefits for the amount of work requested from you, you rotate shifts every month so you aren’t stuck on a shift that might hinder a family schedule outside of work . Plenty of opportunities for movement within the company between the factory and cooperate."
good,While working at Worthington I learned that management works its way down and can influence production rates. I also learned that the culture of the work play can greatly increase the overall effectiveness of the production team. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job would be seeing the work you put in being implemented on the production floor.
good,Worthington stands behind their philosophy and truly cares about there employees. They want to see each employee grow as a individual and grow with the company. I can see why Worthington is a Fortune 500 company.
good,Glad to had a chance to work hear good management do your job and go home don’t have to deal with nonsense hear they are quick to fix things when they need fixed all in all a good place to work
good,"Good place to work if your not lazy... I walk over 6 miles a day while operating the crane in receiving. Good benefits. Its a ok place to work, just stay out the way...."
good,Worthington was a great company to work for. I'm always interested in learning something. The people were great as well. And we also had great benefits.
good,"I loved working there, even though half the people on the paint line where actually rude and huge drama starters, I mainly kept to myself. The days went by pretty fast, there wasn't really much overtime when I was there. I would love to go back there if I had the chance!!! definitely a great place to work. Oh the main bad thing is you have to wear a jacket every day all day for the first 90 days even in the burning hot weather!!!"
good,"They are more than willing to train you if you need the training, and once you are trained they will pay you for it, downfall is you work alot in maintenance, 12days on 2 days off and i need more time with my family than that, it would be different if i were able to get on first shift rather soon but nobody is ever certain of when the next job posting will be up for a first shift position"
good,job sites are hot and humid. compensation is more than fair. coworkers are friendly and very helpful. i enjoyed the camaraderie
good,"Worthington""s culture follows the golden rule.  It is never satisfied with the status quo.  It does not fear change management.  Every discipline is motivated to get better through profit sharing and bonus structure"
good,set up and clean up. welding different parts together to make tanks. most of my co works were great people. management was great the first four years and not so great the last year i worked there because of new management the was hired on that did not even know how weld.
good,always had a good working environment loved the people I worked with enjoyed coming to work. I learned something new every day.
good,"Great schedule plenty of off hours while still getting overtime. Excellent training. Lots of company events i. e. cookouts."
good,Was a great job I worked 7-12 hr shifts for a few months my checks were so nice and then when I need off they worked with me. A great company and over times 2x pay so really paid off made a boat load of money.
good,"drive forklift, take steel off a wooden skid and place on metal skid and take to shipping. take overhead crane and load 50 to 70,000 lbs. of coiled steel and load on the back of machine. set in a booth and inspect steel as it went by. I really enjoyed inspecting and driving forklift, and I really enjoyed working with everyone there"
good,"The cookouts were very fun and I enjoyed it. I like the environment, I also like the shift. The hardest part of the job was the packing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the labeling."
good,"It is a rewarding job and hard work does not go unnoticed. They treat people great. They give proper training needed to do the job, they practice strong safety laws, and line leads are easy to talk to and very understanding and caring."
good,This is a place where you opinion counts and decisions are made off of your feedback. They look out for their employees. It is hot in the summer though.
good,"Great Company to work for, great culture, good benefits, great balance between personal time and work, good management, Had an awesome internship experience."
good,I fee as if the management staff is a great group of people to work with they are reasonable and understanding. My co-workers are exceptional individuals.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Worthington Industries.  I spent 3 years with the company, 2 of which were spent overseas managing multi-million dollar housing projects.  "
good,Learned how to do things i never thought i would learn how to do. They were willing to teach u how do do whatever the task was and it was always something new and exciting. Great company.
good,"By far one of the best companies I’ve worked for. They genuinely care about their employees. "
good,"The culture is great. The pay is great. The leadership is active. The work aint easy but its rewarding. The company rewards input and listens to the ""boots on the ground""."
good,"-Worthington Industries, Inc. leads with safety, abides by the 'Golden Rule', and expects an honest days work for an honest days pay."
good,"Had the job been a better fit for me, I would have stayed at Worthington Industries.  They care about their people.  They have benefits that go ""above and beyond"" what most companies have.  I learned a lot about pulling metrics as well as working corporate customer service there. They have a great training team, and the training there was very organized and managed well.  The hardest part of the job for me was balancing the heavy workload when it was a job in which I had very little background.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people there. Part of the company's philosophy was ""The Golden Rule"", and it was followed very closely. The culture was that of a very friendly, helpful group of people who loved their jobs, and were very sociable to their coworkers."
good,People there are energetic and have good sense of communication.
good,"a typical day at work starting on what was ordered out to do, then following and finding things to do until time to get off of work. co workers were easy to get along with for the most part. hardest part of the job would be the computers im more of a hands on guy. loved the over time and weekend hours."
good,Hard work that payed off with great compensation and plenty of oppurtunities for advancement and treated employees with tremendous respect.
good,"One of the most important things about Worthington Industries' workplace is the people that they hire. Everyone is so friendly and inviting, this is definitely a company that will push you to be better in the workplace and challenge you in different ways, but they are a successful company for a reason. Would 100% recommend working for Worthington Industries."
good,great learning experience in the industrial great people respectable manager and works with you and helps understanding the company policy . Management was great teachers and works side by side .The hardest thing of the job way rotating shifts and
good,Worthington Industries is a great place to work. They treat their people with respect and dignity. Pay is what you put in you will get out. Management and Production Supervisors work with their people in times of need.
good,I get there at 6am and work till 2:30pm. It is a very fun and fast paced environment to work! I love the free coffee in the mornings! The supervisors are very nice and easy to work with
good,"This Company is a wonderful company to work for because the people make the difference.  We are such a great team working toward doing the one thing we all wat in life to success as an individual and to be part of a Company that is succeeding, making money for itself and it's shareholders!"
good,"A typical day at work for me at Worthington Industries being incharge of orientation for new employees. Before the new employees can go through orientation I enter their background check and make sure that i check new employee records.  I make sure that two other test results come back before they can start at Worthington. I collect the new employee paper work and identifications for the I-9. I also set up interviews with the HR Respresentative at Worthington, I  update all new employee information and all new applications."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work.  I had plenty of training and everyone was very helpful and making me feel welcomed. The only way I would leave is if I find a position in my home town of Jackson, MS.  I keep my resume out there because I would like to move back to home to be near my family."
good,I really enjoy working for Worthington Industries. Benefits are great and management is fair. I’m looking forward to advancing my career here. Profit sharing a plus.
good,the management was great and it was a wonderful place to work. The night shift team really works well together. If the equipment was newer that I think the company would have better results.
good,"Worthington in Paducah is honestly a great place. The people in both management and your coworkers are all friendly and fun to be around. The company offers excellent benefits and pay. While not really hard work, it is very repetitive. They make sure to move you around though so you don't get tired or wore out on one job. The only downfall of the plant is that it is hot in the summer."
good,"Honestly my time with Worthington was great.  No hard feelings towards them.  In the future, if I moved back to Columbus, Ohio, I would def try to get a job there."
good,"It is an excellent company with great culture. Tough industry, highly competitive market. The company is well diversified within the industry however the market is impacted by macroeconomics like tarif and imports."

good,Worthington Industries is a small family fund raising business.  The owners made you feel like family and was always willing to do whatever it took to make the day a success.
