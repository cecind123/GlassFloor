rating,review
bad,Awful management. They have a us vs them mentality and it is horrible. The customer base is bad and I have been screamed at over 2 cents price difference. Management is not helpful and coworkers are gossips and backstabers. Not recommended.
bad,I was not a fan of working at Big Lots . But your experience may not be like mine . I was not there for long becuuse I wadnt getting enough hours and the pay wasnt enough
bad,"Avoid at all cost!  Company does not value it's workers at all.  Because of that, and the disrespectful attitude of the store manager the culture and morale are terrible.  Employees call off daily, no call no show and even walk off on lunch and keep a job.  You will be saddled with an unreasonable amount of work while other managers sit around and do nothing because it's ""your department"".  The store is underperforming in a big way because teamwork is non-existent."
bad,"Over worked,under paid ,the hours aren't good,management doesn't help outall they do is stand around and complain... You kill yourself and so u der paid for your work you do.."
bad,This place had too many managers and all didnt do their jobs efficiently. I hated going into work because of some of the un-professional management that big lots had in their leadership structure.
bad,The management was unprofessional and the new management is worse than the last. Poor customer service and  you can't go to them for anything including items they sell in the store.
bad,Don't do it place suck I wouldn't work there for nothingno benefits people come in and steal place just not a good place to work at find somewhere else
bad,What a load of rubbish that place was. Managers were bellends as well. Shouting at me doesn’t make me work any faster when there is nowhere to put anything that comes of the truck
bad,"I spent 6 months with the company "
bad,"Got a new store manager and he immediately started picking his favorites and immediately put a target on any associates of color , aful managment on store level and aful district management way to stuck up , store was a mess at all times , people were never scheduled when needed just a sloppy place to work."
bad,"I've never had a job before this one where employees were treated as insignificant.  Low pay and few hours makes it impossible to make ends meet, in most cases not even worth it for a second income. Store managers have their favorites and can get by with whatever they want without being disciplined."
bad,I need to be paid back for my time and gas going to the fake interviews that I never had. The entire company seems to be unprofessional they gave me the run around for 2 days
bad,This was the worst job ever poor management over work and under pay never get help or answers to any questions you need answered the hours suck I just hate the management team
bad,"Day management is awful, Night Manager is better. Pay is subpar. Overall one of the worst places I've ever worked.  They don't care about the customer. Don't work here."
bad,"Big lots themselves do not care about the employees. If you had a sudden emergency, death etc, you would get a mark against you. Their j+ board belongs in high school and brings that high school experience in the workplace. People get mad when you do good. Doesn't care about expired items. LOTS of drama. People cared more about what others were saying about another more than doing their job."
bad,i was judged due to my sexuality i was mad fun of bullied and was fired due to my mental health tbh the management was horrible and favorited a lot of the other employees
bad,"I spent a year with Big Lots as a furniture sales person, and ended up leaving due to the fact that they began hiring new people at a higher pay than what I was given, who were doing significantly less work than I. I built furniture, loaded it out for customers, created my own CRM with regulars and would properly organize with them to ensure a sale. I was harassed by a higher up who was only in our store for a month, and when I went to corporate about it, they gave me a 2 dollar raise and then took it away after 1 month. I do not recommend working for this company unless you want to feel belittled and betrayed."
bad,"To many people their lying, playing favorites, have issues. Over work for little pay. Been yelled at for someone else wrong doing. Too many people would rather play mind games instead of work. Grave yard shift was terrible for me every single day because of the people."
bad,"During a typical day, you can expect other associates to talk about you behind your back and criticize your work. Managers were inconsistent when it came to the guidelines for returns and helping out customers and associates. Your hours are also inconsistent and will get cut frequently, EX: you could have a 16 hour week and the next only have 8 hours. Associates stole all the time and were never terminated or even talked to. Also, if there was any sort of family/life emergency, they don't care and will cut your hours and talk poorly about you afterward and hold it against you. Also, don't expect to get paid a lot because only managers get full-time hours. In conclusion, just DO NOT waste your time working here."
bad,Managers are childish. They do not care about you as a person. They are extremely far from flexible. They are not educated and seem more like elementary school kids with disabilities.
bad,Wouldn't work for this company ever again. You get hurt because of the company lack of safety and you have surgery. They try to take your position away and put you in a lower position and then try to lie to workers comp until they get caught in their own lie and have to pay up now. They are very disrespectful and the district manager will try to make you lie for them to have someone terminated it's a bad company stay away.
bad,"Management is rude you work hard the pay is not good and the hours worked does not provide the employee with a living wage.  Employees are expected to  unload trucks shelf merchandise, help customers, use cash register during the course of one day."
bad,I worked there for over a year. The management was creepy. They said they would help me figure out how to do my job better then proceeded to keep writing me up without me knowing.
bad,"Corporate knew how unsafe west coast trucks were for years there was emails, calls, texts about these trucks. They did nothing at all. Until I got hurt .I got crushed by product coming off truck. And they just didn't care. I have a permanent ankle injury that can't be fixed. So I cannot ever work a full time job again. But they still don't care. They wont help me or anyone in this situation."
bad,The worse management I have ever had. All three of them are horrible - not only do they play favorites but they’re incredibly rude and have no respect for their employees. Coworker in another other department acted like she was a manager - yet I was the one in trouble for “disrespecting” her!! Do not expect more than 10 hours a week either. The pay was decent but not worth the abuse.
bad,Does not pay you what you are worth instead they will threaten your job daily even for things that are not under your control. Hostile work environment. Nothing you or anyone else does is ever good enough
bad,"A typical day starts with your manager harping about rewards sign-ups and threatening to cut your hours if you don't get them. The problem with this at st. peters location there aren't enough customers to ask to get one. The manager also goes making sexist remarks about every woman who steps foot into the store. As for the store itself, it is the most boring place I have ever worked. A busy day there is about four customers in the store at once, otherwise, you're just fronting product someone else has already fronted."
bad,"Upon my hire, the company previous CEO just retired. In that same year the company acquired a new CEO which means Restructure. I was given a store what we would consider a problem store all around. From the employees to the sales. Which is exactly my strengths. I was left alone to fend for myself. NOT a problem. I partnered with my peers for the majority of my questions. I believe most of my success came from my previous reporting manager, constant feedback and positive reinforcement. I got the complete opposite here at big lots. 8 months later they laid off all the execs including my reporting manager. 4 months later they would lay off many SM. Needless to say, my experience wasn't the best but I believe most of it was timing. I think the company has losts is value in taking care of ""your people"", meaning your associates, emphasizing on work-life balance is a true deciding factor on how well your associate will work for you.  The company will give you a payroll to operate the building with a task of two weeks of payroll combined into one. Impossible. So passionate, and loyal associate would work off the clock to help get the job done. The payroll given is impossible to effectively run and operate the building, so you find yourself working an average of 60hrs/week and doing most of the work because the hours provided to you cant afford to pay your hourly employees."
bad,Company doesn't  care you only work 8- 15 hrs a week and they expect you to be able to get everything done in 4 hrs (stocking) poor management  favoritism is a big thing no inventory control corporate sends whatever  knowing theres no hrs or room to put on floor you only advance if you are a a suck up its not based on your work ethic management  beats you down
bad,"They keep substandard employees out of desperation,  no call no shows, you still have your job,  come to work CLEARLY high on something, you still have your job, zero accountability for associates.  It's shocking what people can get away with at Big lots.  If you are good,  they take advantage of and wear you down to nothing.  Not worth it."
bad,I didn't like working here the management was wack! I didn't like the hours. Definitely need to start at the head and work its way down. No support from the top.
bad,Systemic racial profiling. Poor leadership by all levels of management. Very disingenuous staffing and management.. Not diverse on any levels of management.
bad,"They are top heavy. Rasict don't have good leadership, liars. Management steals and blame employee. They play favorites. They will violate federal regulations and will black Ball you."
bad,"Old equipment used to unload trucks, software is extremely outdated. Never fully staffed, minimum pay and 10 cent raises. Three hour shifts to hourly employees (even tho the minimum standard is four) They don't update warehouse and sales floor specs to be able to receive shipments safely. The District mgrs rarely speak to hourly associates and never ask questions when the store is in distress."
bad,I would not recommend this place. Management is terrible and petty. They work you you super hard for very little pay. They do NOT take care of employees at all.
bad,There's no organization or communication. The company can't figure out what it's doing. It took them months to fire a manager who was 2 hours late repeatedly and hid his whole shift but fired the one who worked because he made more money.
bad,"The most hours seem to be given to new hires. If you are flexible with your schedule, they will consistently schedule you nights on weekends, which means closing and cleaning the bathrooms. Sorry, I am not paid enough to clean feces from the bathroom stalls. Employees call out all the time and are never disciplined for it. Absolutely NO chance for advancement. The managers spend all their time on their phones so they sure don't know who is doing a good job and who isn't. Most co-workers so sloppy work and never get corrected for it. The place is a mass."
bad,"Racists managers, cooperate not supportive to employees. Turn over is extremely high. Nasty restrooms, out dated food. Expectations for the pay don’t match"
bad,"My job is relatively easy for the most part. A majority of the customers that shop at Big Lots are quite easy to work with and I've rarely had to deal with genuinely frustrating people while behind the register. However, I do have an issue with the management. I feel as though my managers do not give me enough credit for the things I do well, and spend too much time chastising me for not getting as many reward sign ups, despite my considerable performance on most other fronts. This has resulted in my hours being severely cut down on multiple occasions, despite the fact that most of my former co-workers have quit since I've been hired, and I'm one of few that has stayed for over a year at my location. Despite my continued loyalty to this job and my best efforts going into my duties my best qualities and triumphs seem to go unnoticed in favor of my weakest area being turned into what defines me in my manager's eyes and as a result I cannot realistically see myself ever moving any further in life through this position."
bad,"My Big Lots is the lowest grossing location in the entire state, and manages that status every single year. I know this because the store manager would mention this, repeatedly."
bad,They didnt train their managers are rude and disrespectful and made me cry yelled at me because i didnt know how to do whatthey wanted me to do and i was not trained. So i did not go back
bad,I was hired by a big lots store in Durham NC and was supposed to start work only to call and find out they had new management and was told someone would reach out to me about starting and never heard from them and everytime I leave a message for management no one calls me back.
bad,"Working at Big Lots was not my greatest employment experience, However I grateful for the motivated co-working that surrounded me to be productive on a daily basis."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. If the manager doesn't like you, you will only receive 4 hours per week. Definitely not worth it to work here. Don't waste your time"
bad,"Nothing good to say. Company probably be closing stores soon. Every year they keep losing money"
bad,The job sucks the staff are rude the job overall is a waste of time they accuse you of stuff you didnt do i wouldnt recmmond the job to anybody at all
bad,"Management is well unorganized, hours are terrible. Never appreciate for the hard work you do especially in a terrible environment. The company does not care about you or what you do for it."
bad,Lack of employee appreciation and benefits. Poor business ethics. Lack of appropriate training and staffing. Employee injuries due to lack of staffing in regards to receiving freight and unloading product.
bad,"Horrible place to work at, management treat you unfairly, too much favoritism.. Not professional at all. And never havehours to distribute.. Don't work at the one in cutlerbay.. Seriously"
bad,Management does not appreciate the hard workers. Too much favoritism. Have to beg to come in on off days just to get more than 10 paid hours a week. LOTS of favoritism!!!!!!
bad,"For management, Biglots rarely hires from within. They do a terrible job of training newly hired managers for 2 weeks in another state before they throw them in a store and expect them to run it. What ends up happening is the true qualified person that's been there longer gets passed up for promotion and has to help in the training of the person that walks in to their promotion. Did I mention you get paid more if you get hired from out of the company.  "
bad,Way to stressful! I live on my own with 2 jobs. Had to get another job to pay bills. Cause i can barely get food n gas with what i make at big lots with only 9hrs.
bad,"If you’re desperate then go ahead, otherwise look elsewhere. Not worth it, management is awful. Worst retail job I’ve ever worked. Miserable environment."
bad,"Managers were not nice, one of them is racist and another is a condecending egotistical jerk. Youre lucky if you get more than 20 hours a week here. There are no benefits, you get treated like replaceable trash, it's gets so boring you feel yourself die inside a little bit."
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. All managers do is lift furniture and work in furniture. DISHONEST MANAGERS and UPPER MANAGEMENT. Push product that is terrible and falls apart and breaks. NO work life balance. Schedule is given on Saturday for Sunday so you can’t plan anything. No weekends off, you get one a month as a manager but you don’t because another Manager needs it off or it is friends and family or seasonal time where you loose them. Worked in a store with NO restrooms for 6 weeks. Back room leaks water and mold everywhere, filthy stores. No training and I’f you get a raise it a very poor raise. Some  raises were as low as $.08.... that’s not a typo. If the store manager liked you your raise would be $.50. The targeting of employees is shameful, if the Manager did not like you they got rid of you and talked about you behind your back and everyone knew who was getting terminated before the actual employee did. Really it is the most terrible and unethical place I have ever worked for and I am so glad to be gone. You really have to ask yourself if you cry before going to work and have anxiety attacks then it’s not for you, and It was not. I can’t stand lies, tricks and discrimination and that’s what Big Lots portrayed while I was there. I sincerely recommend taking what I said to heart because it is all true."
bad,I worked at biglots for about a year and it was horrible the assistant manager made fun of my my weight and when i told the store manager he told me that because there was not one who heard of what had happend he could not to anything and told me to get over it
bad,They made me do everything! From cleaning the parking lot to cleaning the break room. On the first day someone pooped in the store. So gross. Dumb hours even worse managers.
bad,"most of the time you stand around and dont expect to ever really get more than 20 hours without open availability, the company is going downhill due to greed"
bad,Not a good work place. Rude employees. They don't care if you have a family and children. Its all about them. They had rats in the warehouse. Just not a good work place.
bad,"They only hire part-time, so you'll be lucky if you get 20 hrs a week. They might give you 25 hrs one week and the next week 10 hrs. They expect a lot of work from you, which is fine, but they don't reward the people who actually do their jobs, but at the same time will keep people on who don't do their jobs at all. The management treats you like you're garbage, and the possibility of being fired is constantly held over your head. Customers treat you like you're stupid, and will tell you that to your face. And no matter how hard you work for this company, they will not promote you. They won't even call you back if you put in for a promotion. They will hire from outside the company. And they will mess around when it comes to promised promotions. Don't expect to be treated well by this company and don't expect to be able to move up in this company. Honestly, just don't even bother applying to this company. They will treat you worse than the customers."
bad,Big lots it the worst work experience I’ve ever had. It took them a month to finally paid and when they did finally pay me the amount was way lower than the amount of hours i worked. Also they made me do all the work even jobs I wasn’t suppose to be doing
bad,Poor district manager who has no clue of how to run a retail store. When an issue is brought up it is ignored and never resolved. DM relies on store managers because he does not know how to do his job.
bad,"Just don’t do it. Don’t waste your time. Company is trash and you get nothing out of it. If you want a job where you can make some gas money, if that, but want to work hard for it, do it I guess. To each is own."
bad,The job was a night mare. all they have to do is get rid of the   manager. I was sexually harassed.  and then let go because i don't know how to play never again.
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had, the managers have favoritism and don’t treat certain employees properly, more like slave workers. The place is extremely filthy, when I worked there I would deep clean the staff break room and two days later it would be dirty again. There were roaches inside the store and the break room. I don’t ever recommend working here. The employees would constantly gossip and start rumors. I would cry when I had to go to work because of how horrible this place was. Please don’t work here"
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. They literally only gave me 4 hours a week when they even gave me hours. I went on 3 months with no hours at all. Then they only decided to give me 4 hours for 1 week because I filed for unemployment benefits. Then after being unable to work those 4 hours due to a flat tire I had to get fixed, they fired me with no word, just stopped sending me a schedule. I only found out because I tried logging in to check my schedule and it wouldn't let me. They had no grounds to fire me, there were no other issues other then not being able to work that 1 day the decided to give me. The pay is also unfair, it's not based on your experience, and they give the hours to people who are hired AFTER you. Also, if your mystery shopper score is too low they threaten you to try and improve your score. Training is pathetic, there is little to none. I wouldn't recommend this job to even a high school student needing extra cash. I didn't even make enough to put gas in my car to get to and from. Favoritism is definitely played on here. At least in the Salem, VA store."
bad,"a typical day at work was just unloading the truck "
bad,"Half of the managers are extremely rude and treat employees with no respect, the hours are sparce and and the amount of painstaking work, especially if you work on truck or in furniture, is not worth the minimal pay. Definitely not the job for you if you have bills to pay and also wanna eat, beacuse you wont be able to and the managers dont care. You're hours get cut and its highly frowned upon if you have a sick day and are only granted 3 sick days/ leave earlys in a 6 month period. Barely any chance for advancement and if you get hurt on the job they're more likely to let you go rather than keep you on if you need special requirements or have restricted work instructions. There are alot of rude customers and theres a good chance you'll get cussed out while working here. Whether it be by the customers or the managers."
bad,"I was responsible for a lot of organization and doing price checks if an item had no sticker.  Closing up and restocking as needed, but they were not very good with training. It was an easy job, the hardest part was having the steel nerves to handle potential shoplift incidents."
bad,Big Lots does not care about its individual employees and the job is terrible. The store I worked at was in a terrible neighborhood and we were provided no security.
bad,"I worked at Big Lots for just shy of 2 years. As an assistant Team lead if service ...I truly enjoyed being able to service my customers . On 4-1-19 , I gave my notice to resign as I had been offered a more lucrative position with another company. I saw the store through inventory , and friends and family event , and some new hire training and worked until the day before my onboarding with my new company . Seeing what a loss it was going to be , I asked to stay on part time to help . At the time of my resignation , I had 80 hours vacation and 48 hours sick time accrued . I was told I would be paid out for my vacation but would loose my sick time. I was also told there would be a change in my hourly rate due to the change in status  . I did ask to take a week vacation to have some time to get my affairs in order before starting my new job and was denied . By the time I was to be part time ...my 80 hours vacation was decreased to 16.94 hours because vacation is accrued at 1.54 hours weekly and the fiscal doesn’t start until Feb. FINE !!!!! In addition , Big lots was VERY quick to put through my change in pay rate so as to pay out my now minimal vacation time at a $10 per hour difference than it had been accrued . Part time associates do not accrue  vacation time and the handbook CLEARLY states that full time employees with a change in status to part time should be eligible to take vacation . When HR was contacted , she talked circles , explaining that vacation couldn’t be accommodated due to the needs of the business.??? Keep in mind that I saw us through all the important events"
bad,"When hired I was told I would be getting 25-30 hours a week but only worked 8-12 hours a week; Was told we had to sale their credit cards to every customer but if they wanted one, they could apply for it online instead of us harassing the customer; Trained by outdated videos but lack of training when it came to hands on the cash register!!  If new employee made a mistake,one of the Managers would confront them in front of customers and yell at them instead of taking them into an office!!  Company had their own mystery shopper and she always got a couple of the employees mixed up!!  One time thought it was me that took care of her but told them to look at the schedule because I wasn't even working that day!!  Wanted me to work with the H1N1 flu because Management didn't feel like working for a couple of hours when another employee was scheduled to work!! Told them there was no way I was going to be responsible for making customers ill and proceeded on badgering me until I walked out the door while telling them this was the last straw...I'm done with them and the business!!  The main Manager lied to unemployment and told them I was still working there when I hadn't for over three weeks!!"
bad,"New management sucks bad. Takes forever to get hired on and they will find any reason to let you go. Long hours with little appreciation..if you have a family, DO NOT APPLY"
bad,The manager was incredibly LAZY. She would constantly try to place blame on others and never own up to her own issues. It was nothing but drama my entire time there.
bad,"I loved my job at first. The people were nice, work was easy. Then the assistant manager started talking bad about another employee, at first I was shocked. I thought she was supposed to be a professional? Then they tell you that you only have 12 hours next week. I applied for full time. One week I might have 12 hours, the next I would have 29, then 15, then 24. Hours were all over the place and I was always scheduled at time I stated I could not work. In the system I reported I was unavailable at these times and I spoke to the store manager about it because he made the schedules. The assistant manager would come to work at act like she was mad at me for weeks at a time and wouldn’t let me take breaks because she was mad. It’s hard to work when your boss who usually comes in and tells you everything, is suddenly mad and acts like you don’t exist. Then one of the employees told me that the store manager was calling me Gertrude. He said “I really hate giving Gertrude 30 hours this week” and I never went back. First of all, my hours being all over the place was already bull. Now I know he was deliberately trying to cut my hours down AND talking bad about me. And he’s the one in charge? I’d understand if he was a 15 year old kid, not a 50 year old boss. Both managers are very childish and unprofessional and I’m soooo glad I left!"
bad,"This wouldn't be a bad job if the managers didint absolutely suck, they play favorites so at the end of the night when u finished your work and u think your ready to clean up your not. While other people are clocking off if u ask me us as a unit should clock on together as well as clock off together work as a team to get it done not one over the other we all wanna go home at some point I dont recommend anyone to work here but if u wanted to get treated unfair have at it it's not for me"
bad,"I worked there 3 years, advanced quickly because of high turn over rate of management positions. I worked my butt off, had amazing sales and hit every goal given to me only to be treated like dirt. I wasnt the only one.  Many of my associates were talked down to, yelled at,treated as if we were something that would be scraped off your shoe by the store manager. Dm's and Rm's didn't care how you were being treated as long as job was done. The company is typical big corporate America.  Get as much as you can for the least amount as possible. Was never given enough payroll to complete the weeks tasks, but were still expected to produce.  As a female all Male managers were paid more than I was in the same job position. Extremely stressful job, there was 0 work/life balance.  I would never recommend for anyone to work there."
bad,not allowed to ask for help when lifting. unappriciative managers. lead manager has favortism for hired friends and gives them the hours and will cut yours to make it happen.
bad,"A day here want's to make you go home and rethink you're life,when they have you do something you do that and nothing else,you can't even more out of of your one spot/station without getting yelled at.I learned 100% NOTHING from this company,other then how they really treat employee's.The hardest part was actually trying to think of the proper way to leave and as for enjoyment?Is that a joke?There is no joy working for this company,my advice is to STAY AWAY!"
bad,"too many captains and too much pride , manager he was bad , no respect and lazy , but I did like one person there she was so helpful and so kind and always had a smile"
bad,This place I will never work for them ever again management is terrible never have stuff done on time lack of employment it was very bad turn over probably never be fix dock work u will hate the most trust me don't work there
bad,"The Ruskin Big Lots was full of unprofessional employees. None of which could manage a stable manager to place scheduling on shifts. Over staffed, and unorganized."
bad,"I was a seasonal employee and my child got sick with Hands Foot and Mouth disease, which then I also contracted the Hands foot and mouth, so I had to miss work in order to heal because it is highly contagious. They said they couldn’t “keep” me and transform me into a regular employee so rather than being understanding to the situation, they let me go. I wasn’t fired, just not kept on the crew due to being seasonal and missing work for my sick child."
bad,The company is not doing well and is struggling to find its footing.  The new CEO makes aburpt announcements through email with no warning that demoralize the team.
bad,Excellent hours around Christmas as soon as the season is over they cut you down to under 15 hours a week. Instead of rewarding loyal and consistent employees with work hours after a long season they downgrade you to a schedule not worth your time. Micromanagement at its best with little room to excel
bad,Big lots pays 9.50 an hour The mannagers are nice but they lie to you when you get hired. And they pidlde around and put youre schedule in cup and keep mixing it up. it varies every week. they want something for nothing.
bad,"This is not a place I'd recommend. If you step up into a different position they restart when you would get your raise this happened to me twice I lost out on my anniversary raises and then it wasn't working out because I was left with myself and one other associate and had to cover furniture department, stock, reset plan-o-gram, do cash office duties, as well as take deliveries all while not leaving associate alone at register."
bad,"At my short time at this Big Lots location, I never felt that my job was secure, or that my labor was appreciated. They started me off with about 25 hours per week...I didn't like it but that's all they would offer anyone applying. I figured this is part time and I couldn't find anything else at the time. Then they cut my hours down to 17 hours per week. That wasn't enough for them, then they cut my hours to 4 hours a week. Just long enough to unload the merchandise from the truck since no one else wanted to do it. Soon I was having to actually pay money to go to work for those few hours since I drove a truck and the gas cost more than I was earning. "
bad,"They treat you like a disposable work salve , manager doesn't know anything and relies on his employees to provide him with the answers he should have known before taking the job.They don't hire within the company at all.They are not flexible hours at all."
bad,"this store is falling apart at the seams. the list of cons about working for this place is insanely long so here it is."
bad,It was a ok job. It was a slow paced job. Hourly pay wasn't the best plus hours that were given werent the best. Didn't give me the option for flexible hours.
bad,Management didn't know how to manage or run the store whatsoever .They always had an attitude and always had favorites . they would always have me do the same thing all the time and they didnt believe in me
bad,"Way to fast past for the environment, some of the staff was very rude. No one ever seemed happy, it was not busy at all. The bathrooms need to be cleaned."
bad,"Told the store manager that her truck crew was not good enough to work truck and a week later the right ups started. I asked to step down and instead was fired. I worked for 2 years with no write ups. Was to,d I was to transfer to another store and never made it out of there."
bad,"My fellow co-workers were nice, my management were not. My manager's were very rude and not caring of personal issues, i felt very uncomfortable working there."
bad,They need new managment and to pay people on time making sure they recieve all of thier money they need to get more clear about what it is that is wanted to work there. Also they need to make sure they arent misplacing people who move a hundred plus mattresses for them money
bad,"Many of the company's other stores are likely better than this location. The store mgr in was the worst mgr I've ever worked for in over 20 years of retail. The mgr's apathy(& unhappiness) was the source of all the store's problems: hostile work environment created by long-term coworker & the store mgr as well--when mgr was approached about the coworker -by more than 1 person- NOTHING done, NOTHING changed. Rate of pay for stocking inadequate; Strength & stamina required to unload once to twice weekly (18 wheeler truck) fully packed shipments is considerable- it took 4-6 people an average of 5-6 hours to complete, occasionally took over 8 hours & never less than 4. Overall, it was an every-man-for-himself environment; The asst mgrs were nice but overworked by a checked-out boss. Good work going unnoticed & being labeled by your mistakes was the norm."
bad,"Min wage to start. Limited training. want the best people, but pay the least possible. Benefits are unaffordable. Good for a starter job. Don't expect pay vs service."
bad,"Big Lots in my town was nice to work for. Until the resent manger she was very unprofessional and cut throat. Co-workers was a blast to work with very nice people. Big Lots way of scheduling was unprofessional, What job send out schedules on a Saturday? They could've have done a lot better"
bad,Management was so poor it was the only thing i couldnt bear. I had a manager at my location tell me I was a waste of a paycheck for assisting my co worker as we had a team player meeting the day before. Quit that very day. Im not a punching bag.
bad,This is the most poor most managed retail store I have ever worked for there is no time management hard to get flexible hours but usually hire people part-time so on a five-hour shift they will expect you to do work as if you was working a full-time shift very poor management at the New Milford ct store will never recommend a friend to apply for that store
bad,It is cut throat and if your a threat to anyone's position you will be chopped immediately. But I don't think that is for the whole company just the Albuquerque market.
bad,"Workplace culture is very poor.  Work schedule allows for no life balance, horrible hours and pay. Poor operation procedures and constant employee turnover."
bad,"Murray Big Lots does not care about your loyalty or how hard you work. Even if you provide decent store numbers, you will not get hours unless the store manager likes you. New hires and current employees come and go constantly. Store is always a mess."
bad,it was a busy store at times.. just not enough hours to make a decent pay check..i liked most of my coworkers an I liked the discount we got frm there.. most of the customers were really friendly
bad,You have to get a second job to cover the hours you don't get at Big Lots! At Big Lots you might one to three days out of week to work. You pay any bills or get food for your house.
bad,Work/ personal life not focus of Big Lots. Big Lots is only focused on customers. Managers don't receive compensation for work and tasks assigned. Always low on staffing
bad,Bull  hours even when you bust you're butt at work everyday and they say you're there best worker but not consistent with the hours you deserve. It sucked but the customers loved me and of course my coworkers loved me because I was the hardest worker there I was they tall black slave
bad,Big lots again is just for kids who wants to have a little bit of money in there pockets and maybe for any college student who need financial help with tuition and or school books
bad,Store was a great place to work until poor management took over and was rude lied and took hours away. Job was easy  co workers at the time got alone now the store stays a mess and not recovered workers in the store now are rude and not friendly
bad,"I resigned this position within the first 30 days.  I was originally hired to work and manage the furniture department.  The manager went on a 2 week vacation after I started, and the assistant manager failed to train me so I could manage the furniture department floor."
bad,"I enjoyed it for a while they hired me while I was 6 months pregnant , as it went to be time I got induced I had only worked for 3 months , they said I hadn’t worked long enough for an FMLA so they considered me a call off and fired me"
bad,"You are given multiple task, unreasonable goals to achieve during the day, the management conflicted with each other, majority of workers and employees were hateful to each other, and a lot of cleaning was to be done. "
bad,I loved the job in the beginning but once the store starting running the manager would do things. She would tell ppl what to do that they should not be doing
bad,"Store is super slow, so they only have one cashier per shift. They give you 8-20 hours a week, 20 is for the most liked workers. Half the workers that do get a lot of hours, don’t do anything. The store manager is a rude person. By far the worst place I’ve worked."
bad,If management was more kind and gave you raises when you deserved it it would be a better place i did a little of everything I stocked unload the truck I was a cashier and I trained people only making 7.25 a hour
bad,"I wished I'd never applied with Big Lots, they didn't give me enough hrs or training to do anything to get hrs. Even most of the workers agreed with me on that."
bad,"The store manager is 2 faced she plays coworkers and managers against each other. Only some of us actually worked while her ""pets"" just followed her around. The district manager is no better he does absolutely nothing no matter how many complaints they get."
bad,Big lots is one of the worse companies I ever worked for. Would not recomend.the loss preventon look more at employee than the shop lifters.I think they need to look at loss prevention more.
bad,"Some weeks you have up to 30 hours, some weeks you get only 5. The truck almost never comes on time. Management gives all work to 10% of people and lets the others do as they please. They also do not let you use your sick time even when you are actually sick. Worst job I've had."
bad,"Terrible place to work when they brought in a guy from walmart, surrounded by people who put their work off on you and expect you to still do your job."
bad,There is not much to say when it come to this place. You would have to be there to understand and see how the policy works for everyone not just some..
bad,"poor management and lazy employees do not go well together. Managers don't care what anyone does and don't do there own jobs, rather have other associates do the job for them and they take the credit for it, constant people not calling into work if they cannot come into work that day and management does not care."
bad,no hours  barley any work to do poor manager skiils the store is not up to part having a new cashier sweep the floor instead of learning the store and what to do when the store opens
bad,It has the potential to be a relaxed part-time job but I think due to past management the job atmosphere is horrible. I don't know how things are now but they weren't very good years back.
bad,no mangement to teach you how to properly work at the store. hourly rate is not ideal for a carrer type path. cost of living is too high too work at big lots.. no raise and payed every too weeks to unload a trailer with everything thrown in to it. no pallets no room in warehouse section
bad,"I was severely underpaid and was doing everything in the store other than managing. I would unload trucks and sort items. I would stock the items, work as a cashier and run furniture sales. Was offered a $0.25 raise during the time I was there. Did not enjoy working there and I did learn sales and customer service."
bad,They never know what's going on and they are cut throat and lie to benefit who ever telling the lie will throw u under the bus.. and Will not make the employees work and the managers sit on there butt's and do nothing but blame other's
bad,"The job was good It was easy"
bad,"Its an alright place to work depending on the job function that you have. Most of the managers are pretty cool, its been a few years since I've been in one, some have closed."
bad,Started out a place I loved to work at. After a while I had a problem with management. I had really planned on being there for a long time. Never got my break when I was supposed to.
bad,"I just couldn'ttake it anymore. It is extremely stressful, I'm never treated with respect, my job is never appreciated, also it's been a mess in management since I walked through the doors 6 months ago. It needs a lot of help the ATLM needs to be fired, I feel nothing is ever done about situations that take place there or never taken seriously, staff always insufficient as well. I was lied to. Horrible place to work, no work/ life balance at all."
bad,"Big Lots in Ruskin, FL, is not the place to work. They hire too many people all at once, and once training is over, they let you go. It's a waste of time really."
bad,"The store where I worked was literally infested with mice.  The warehouse was unsafe and managed so poorly that I considered it to be unsafe working conditions. All of the ladders for staff use on the job were wobbly.  I managed the furniture dept.  At least three times I unwrapped furniture (new/wrapped in plastic) to take and put out on the sales floor but was unable to do so, as when I unwrapped the furniture it literally rained down mouse feces onto the warehouse floor.  Mice were living in the furniture for sale. The store manager was aware of these conditions but did nothing.  I would walk past shelves that had food for sale and see mouse feces all over the shelving.  They have a policy of never giving full-time staff 40 hours per week.  The most they offer is 36-38 hours a week, so essentially taking a full-time job with them will be a pay cut for most people.  While  on the sales floor it was not unusual to see mice scurrying about in the aisles.  The work schedule was never delivered more than one week out for full-time staff, so you can never plan a life.  They deny requests for days off even if you have asked months in advance, all at the whim of the store manager.  When I spoke with employees from other stores about how poorly the warehouse was managed and the terrible working conditions, they indicated it is the same for all warehouses throughout the company.  Upper management is anti-union  and has  no interest in hearing from their employees because they know the working conditions are poor.  They are a representative of ""Right to Work"" corporate management. "
bad,The employees they hire here and all young and not really there to work. They don't appreciate anything you do for them. And they don't appreciate the hours you put in away from your family to help the company there was a day I came in at 6 worked in the store til 6pm then put up advertising signs that same day until 1130pm not paid for after 6pm and never! Went home or received any thanks
bad,Management has no idea what they are doing. It creates a toxic environment for employees. Fight culture and nobody seems to know what they're doing. This is no way to run a business.
bad,Big Lots does not provide the necessary staff to make its locations successful. Feedback is given in personal terms.  I was not told that I would be loading furniture when I was hired.
bad,"I would never recommend some one working there , this company is unprofessional and unorganized. Also they sell out dated food . The managers are very nasty and"
bad,Do not work for them they are mean and they will not be friendly at all I do not recommend noone to them... I move to have something BETTER...........
bad,"I am a people person, I work better alone, but if i have to team up with people Im okay with working people. There are some that cant work and talk and same time. I start a task and try to complete my task before my shift is over. Sometime I will start another task or help next associate complete their task. Ive learned some new jobs and performances that i never had a chance to do from previous jobs. Ive worked for Biglots in the past years ago.."
bad,"It's a very draining job, working with customers all day who realize its a discount store and argue with you about a price wanting it even cheaper. Managers play favorites. Customers are very mean. Job does not give a rip about you and i swear to god even their own company. I would never recomend I wouldnt even recomend shopping there. And another thing about the favorites.. if their favorite person comes in late they dont care but if you need to leave and that fav person comes in late and you complain you get in trouble."
bad,"I've been there for almost 6 years, and I never gotten a real raised ,have every excuse not too and people there doesn't do any team work, hours just unstable but after all I'd stayed and customers loves me!  I need a better stable hour job."
bad,big lots is a bad place to work the managers aren't there for the employees and will fire with out cause the place is always a mess and doesn't care for having time off with your family
bad,Big lots is not a bad company to work for. Just the management they put inside the stores are terrible. They make it a hostile working environment....
bad,Absolutely the most unorganized workplace I have ever had the misfortune to call an employer. They have total disregard for scheduling and will give no notice upon any changes to staff members schedule.
bad,"Working at big lots is stressful and theres no room for advancement. The pay is very low for the amount of work ypure require to do, also it depends on the deparment"
bad,"Manager was very unpleasant did not like working at BIG LOTS, Manager was very meaning assistant manager belittled her employees very often ,Very stressful to work with. Very little hours were given , even though you worked hard .I did not like the managers would discipline employees in front of customers and in front of co-workers.Manager and assistant manager very unprofessional ."
bad,Horrible new manager. Did not care for employees. Was very stressful environment no values or core culture. Manager did not appreciate or acknowledge hard working team
bad,turnover is great and very poor pay for hourly and some management. As a manager you really have to negotiate pay at hire time. Afterwards it is too late.
bad,"Was an okay place to work, as far as having employment is concerned; however, certain  job responsibilities were not worth the pay. Expected to move heavy furniture and throw out your back on a daily basis for poor wages dependent on department assigned."
bad,"This place has no real structure, management is lost, supervisor can't be bothered, cashier's out of control, favorites picked, and given more hours, different rules everyday for different people"
bad,"Managers are not on top of the store. They disappear often and you have to call them multiple times when you need help. I get about 4 hours per week with less than $9/hr while new hires get $9/hr on the spot and more hours for not even doing proper work as they are given little training. "
bad,Worst job I've had. Managers are rude every time u speak to em. They aren't cooperative to any sort of emergency. You never get any sort of leeway towards anything you do.
bad,The store was dirty and the people were rude and not happy to train. They closed the store by me and tehy did not make sure you had a job at the new store
bad,I wouldnt recommend this company to anyone. There is no room to move ahead. There is no upper management support they only care about furniture sales and not the employees. No customer service training and you Will be stuck in the same spot for years. They don't pay at all and the raise is 10to 30 cent a year.
bad,"Cleaning, stocking and supplying designated facility areas (dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning ceiling vents, restroom cleaning etc) Performing and documenting routine inspection and maintenance activities. Carry out heavy cleaning tasks and special projects"
bad,"Worst Place to work out , Stressful work , nobody wants to work, unacceptable management , no one wants to work here , everyone quits and doesnt do there job"
bad,"No direction, management is awful. The work isn’t terrible but man the people you report to are lost and rude. Never in my life has a supervisor aggressively hit my desk just to ask me a question about “training. “"
bad,"A few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. Some of the employees there work hard to make the store a productive and profitable place that is appealing to the consumer. Other employees and management seem to be there just to get a check and to see how little they can do that day or how much they can delegate the lower associates. The employees who did care about their job would end up picking up the slack of those that did not. The good employees often got promised promotions to keep them there, because most would leave for a better place of employment. These are some of the reasons there is such a high turnover rate."
bad,"Store General Manager simply bullies employees. HR department turns a blind eye despite repeated notifications, even from other managers. Store employees too afraid for their jobs to take needed legal action."
bad,As far as retail jobs go this one is a tough one for first timers. the management isnt really present and leaves the store throughout the day only to return at closing time. lack of communication between employees and management was the ultimate reason for me leaving
bad,i hated quitting this job it was a nice quiet at your own pace job that you could really help the customers even though it was just temporary  work and seasonal
bad,it wasn't like other jobs you barley do work there and its not that fun. it was boring and it was to much mess at that job and it was to much going on
bad,"I was getting mistreated at the first location in Huntington beach, ao I then transferred to the one in fountain valley cause it was closer to were I live, to then get treated even worst at that location, which caused me to eventually quit cause I couldn't take the treatment I was getting, I have health disabilities which they knew bout but still kept having me do stuff that was a huge strain & problem for my health disabilities, there were so many times where I almost hurt myself cause they had me do more physical & heavy lifting as if they didn't care if I got hurt, they always picked favorites, & many people including some managers were staight lazy & didn't do much while on the clock"
bad,as long as you kissed rear end you could get and do anything you wanted. would not take care of the people that did a good job. would not be considered for advancement unless they liked you.
bad,"Customer service, resolving customer issues to ensure customer satisfaction.   Assemble and move furniture. Provide assistance to cashiers when there was a large number of customers."
bad,The work isn't hard but they don't pay enough and transferring to another store you'll be out of work for weeks. I'd find another job opportunity besides here.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job.Was went I leaved the job.The hardest part of the job .Was not fight back went I was hit.Workplace culture evil.Management was worst.What I learned is    law in force  is worst.A typical day at work was   a test of my self-control.
bad,Sorry Company to work for.  Extremely racist.  Overworked and extremely underpaid.  You are just an expendable number to the company.  They have no interest in helping people advance.  Everyone is just out for themselves.
bad,"During the three years I worked there, i was told that I was in charge of the scheduling and ordering for the furniture department.However, when I submitted my orders and schedules, i was always being ""second guessed"" by the department manager. I ended up having to tell her that if I did not think I could handle the job, I would leave it. Not a great place to work."
bad,The management changed 4 times in the span of 7 months. Very unprofessional and overall a toxic work environment. The managers talked about employees in the break room.
bad,It's not a bad place to work if you just need a paycheck whilst looking for a better job. Just don't expect to go anywhere within the company as they do not advance current employees. They choose to get people off the street with no DC experience. A manager in training program would be beneficial. Even then it's rare that salary positions open and why would it. Hourly is expected to meet the production demands of an under staffed warehouse while supervisors bs with one another or play on their computers. It's all about the bottom line with this company. Seems to be the only way they can stay competitive with other companies.
bad,"I could hear 2 co-workers 5 aisles away from me talking aloud about me and when I walked up in to their conversation about me, they didn't stop and just kept talking and started laughing. I had to get the Manager on Duty about it."
bad,"Even though your told upfront that you will be getting about 29 hours a week, I found that I never made more than 24 hours on most weeks; schedule was never consistent.  When you requested days off, you almost never get them even with early notice.  Weekends were never rotated; for example I only had 3 Saturdays off in 7 Months of working there. Most days your scheduled to work you work as little as 4 hours (thats about $32.00 after tax when getting $8.00/hour). The store manager at that location had a habit of ignoring associate calls to service desk when manager was needed, would also stay locked in office unless corporate members were visiting.  During the Holidays corporate also ""strongly"" pushes workers to get 3 customers to sign up for store credit card {MANDATORY} daily or store management could face write-ups. Just over all my personal experience was not great but the weekly income and associate discount were my only plus' for working at ""The land of great deals!""."
bad,"Management would always put off their duties then last minute pass it off to a lower employee so it became their fault. Raises were nonexistent. The pay scale wasn't balanced with the amount of work getting done. EX: People unloading a truck or moving heavy furniture around all day made the same pay as someone that stood behind register all day, usually $8.25 an hour. While the managers would just sit in the back office doing nothing making $20+ an hour."
bad,Horrible Company To Work For I Was With The Company For Almost 6 Years Before I QUIT. Extreme Lack Of Hours. I Went Through 6 Different Store Managers & Many Different ASM As Well. Do NOT WORL HERE They Expect You To Live & Survive Off Of 4 Hours Or 12 Hours A Week. All Depends On Which Managements They Hire!
bad,"unstaffing and low pay of warehouse employees, I did unloading and loading. Lifting heavy frieght by myself. Overworked and underpaid! Find a Real job"
bad,"I have tried my best and did all that I could, it was overwhelming and very stressful. There were times that I went home in tears, I was hardly getting any hours, they kept cutting my hours and I was only making $6 an hour, I was 19 at the time and I wanted to do more for myself, but I wasn't getting anywhere."
bad,It is the most unorganized place to work!! The management is absolutely the worst! Very unfriendly and could care less about your home life and if you have kids to take care of you really don't wan to work there!
bad,"The store is not well kept, especially the back room which literally has items stacked atop one - another in some dodgy attempt at organization.The general manager at the local Milledgeville Big Lots is a tyrannical bully whom smokes in his office causing a foul odor and health liability for all of the workers and customers to endure in the break room and furniture floor. Unbelievable unprofessionalism is an understatement as the manager has had multiple disputes with numerous workers and customers. Emitting barrages of foul language which inevitably drove them away from a store they work at and frequent.Including two of his past assistant managers, one of which is now running a much more successful Big Lots."
bad,"I was not respected and worked there for over two years providing above and beyond customer service but the management is prejudice and negative, so never a pay raise."
bad,"Management created hostile work environment, promised a certain schedule and certain salary amount, company does not want you to further your education, overworked and underpaid, will expect one person to lift up to 350lbs, not 50 like the job description states, does not offer protective gear to move furniture, will not allow other team members to help load customer furniture, worst company to work for, previous store management was later terminated for intern theft and arrested at the store."
bad,"-THE WORST MANAGEMENT!!"
bad,they treat there employees horrible if your a bigger person the mangers talk about how gross u are that your worthless and cant do nothing right because you are fat
bad,They promised me 20 hours per week and $9 per hour. I was lucky if I got one 5 hour shift per week and they only paid me $8. Besides managent being incompetent.
bad,"I worked here for 6 months the managers all have poor attitudes. "
bad,"Barely got any hours and when I did it was only 4 hours that day. Management was very sexiest and only rude to the women. The manager of the store constantly followed me around and stared at. I felt very uncomfortable and unsafe working here. Plus the only benefit was the discount and it was for already cheap stuff. I would suggest working for a better company. Even Walmart is better to their employees, never though any company could be worse than Walmart but after working here they are worse."
bad,"i wouldn't recommend working here to anyone, they will fire you because they didn't train you correctly! although the people were nice to you job its self sucked!"
bad,hours were horrible worked four hours a day. pay was horrible only 8.50 a hour managers were very rude to their customers and employees. very unsafe enviroment was robbed at the store. dangerous out side at night was left to wait out side alone at night.
bad,horrible to customers and they don't value their employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the caddy managers and their lack to properly manage and handle associates.
bad,"This company does not care about their employees.  The sales numbers are all that matters.  The Grayling store is so mismanaged, none of the employees knew if they were coming or going.  With the current manager, it was more like a singles bar rather than a place of business."
bad,"The company is a complete joke.  There is no structure, no organization, no employee training, and no attempt to maintain their buildings.  Managers routinely play favorites with employees and routinely ignore safety and health hazards for as long as they can."
bad,HR will not support you this company sucks do not work for them ! I'm not going into detail just do not quit your job to work for Big Lots you are over worked and under paid
bad,"Loved my job when I was doing what I was hired for and before management completely changed hands.  Then it went down hill because you see I refused to buddy up with new crew and come in to work to my job not hang out with friends. "
bad,Pay is not enough for everything they want you too do. Its not a great job when managers come in to work with attitudes and they act like we slept with then last night. They need better managers.
bad,"This company talks a good game, but it is a terrible company to work for!!! The management staff is required to fulfill a huge list of management duties per day, but they run their stores with so few employees that the managers are waiting on customers, running registers, answering phones, taking out furniture pickups, training new associates, and whatever else is going on.... It is a thankless job where you are scrutinized for every little thing! Managers are offered little support and training, but expected to be perfect. Managers along with the employees are expected to work very very hard for very little pay. The stores are open every holiday except Christmas day. On Christmas eve they are open until 10pm, among other holidays they extend their hours not shorten them, so do not expect to have a life outside of work. Managers are expected to unload furniture trucks, warehouse trucks, and haul out sofas, sectionals, mattresses, bedroom sets etc. that have been purchased no matter what time of day and whether they have enough help to do so."
bad,Management treats employees with absolute disrespect. Other employees follow along and treat each other with disrespect. There is no proper training at all.
bad,Got paid minimum wage while breaking down heavy boxes and toting them from one place to another and stocking them. Manager was a total pest and so annoying to deal with. Made job very hard.
bad,The workplace is decent. The management is unfair and will not stand behind the workers. The pay is poor and the hours are shabby. The merchandise is cheap and the management is untrustworthy.
bad,"The store Management will make sure to make you time in work miserable, stressful with nonsense directions, poor communication skills, insensitive attitude,  a lot of unrealistic expectation, for example something that takes 4 hours to be done, would be expected to be done in 1 hour. if you disappoint management you would be getting 8 to 10 hours per week, if you try to explain why some things are not getting done, you would be told that you feedback not needed, if you complaint about Management the District M-O-B  they would open an investigation about your job performance."
bad,"I worked as a cashier most of the time, would greet and offer my help to the costumers. Very slow and boring. Not to many other people I worked with took there job serious. Very annoying."
bad,I work on the cash register. I provide assistants to customer. I also work in the furniture department. I recovery items back to there station. I help out other team members other team member helps me out. The management team are very helpful.
bad,"Managers talk about each other and employees act like they are managers. I hated it , Oh and the customer are the worst too change prices on EVERYTHING don't come to shop if your going to do that. Often times i felt like i was secruity"
bad,Well i only worked 2 or 3 days out of a week so i couldn't learn that much and the mangers were every rude and couldn't tell me if i was down something wrong they went behind my back made up linings about me and all i wanted to was work and learn new stuff !
bad,come in and pick up where the manager before you left off and finish that task they where doing. make sure truck is 100% done within 2 days of receiving it.
bad,Terrible place to work. Management is horrible and most of them are lazy. The store is a disaster and employees are messy. The pay is nonexistent and the hours are bad.
bad,They have work 4 hr shifts like you are a teenager...assistant manager kiss manager butt...they talk to you any kind of way job sucks. They don't appreciate their workers
bad,This place was horrible to work for. Favoritism was played all through that store. No chance for anyone new to move up. Brought people in they have no experience in managing and take positions that people who have been working there for years were more than qualified to have
bad,"Working for this company was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. I began working for Big Lots as a senior in high school. Six months after graduating, I was promoted to DTS Lead. WORST position in the building. They do not pay you for the amount of work you complete. The higher up management displays large amounts of favoritism towards specific associates. Most part time people are underpaid for what they are required to do. There are so many safety hazards at the store I worked for. When the district manager and AAPL would do safety walks, they would notice things that needed to be fixed, but would go months without even attempting to fix them. Upper management had a bad habit of gossiping about other associates and not honoring the open door policy. All vendors I dealt with refused to speak with the store manager...when all issues were brought to the district managers attention, they were turned around as if they were all the DTS teams fault. I would not recommend working for Big Lots EVER. Even if it was a last resort, I would NEVER go back. If you are smart.....AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST!!!!"
bad,"Didn't give enough hours.."
bad,"long hours, disrespectful upper management low pay, poor culture, no appreciation, general manager is the biggest jerk around and has no idea what he is doing out of touch with the store level"
bad,"stressful, unorganized, inconsistent hours, management was lazy, rude, and unhelpful"
bad,Was the worst job I ever had. They don't care how hard you work all they cared about was gossip. The managers had no clue what they were doing and people quit all the time due to how rude managers are.
bad,One of the worst jobs I ever had. You broke your back constantly while the mangers just sat on their butts. The associates were over worked and under paid. There were times I had to practically run an entire department myself because the mangers wouldn't. The general manager was the worst. She used the good workers. No opportunity to grow.
bad,"horrible operations management and direction"
bad,Big Lots is a horrible place to work. The pay is lower than every other company. The hours are terrible and you can't get your schedule until a day before the next week begins.
bad,I worked here so long because I got comfortable they did not pay enough I worked maybe 3 days out the week I love the staff and the days when we get free lunch
bad,"Worse place i ever worked. No communication between the higher management.give no payroll to help, asked for everything to get done with limited amount of support"
bad,"management sits on the display furniture in the back of the store. Employees are always late and late clocking out for work. There are no benefits. The scheduling was not consistent."
bad,"Working at big lots isn't a bad time if you're bored. If you legitimately need money, you should try to find a different job. You have to work there for a long time before you get put on as full time."
bad,Not the greatest place for upward movement. Management lacked communication skills and mere manners. New hires are not trained correctly and the managers don't care.
bad,"The managers were never on the same page, they fought with each other in front of customers. They reprimanded employees publically instead of talking to them I'm a civil manner about their issues.  The hours were inconsistent and there was favoritism. On top of all of that, they transferred me from register to the furniture department which doubled my work load. I was promised a raise that never came. Save yourself the headache."
bad,"Scheduling sucked there, i would go in on a Friday morning and not know if i worked that next day until the end of my shift, HORRIBLE management, told them what my availability was before they hired me which they didn't have to hire me but still did and DID NOT work with what I needed off, always had me scheduled on my non available days. Pay sucked too, I had previous retail experience for 3 years and they started me off at minimum wage and a new hire was being paid more than me. Would not go back to this company!"
bad,"management gives preferences and can lower your hours depending on how much staff likes you. Is very stressing and cashiers always call in. The currently manager is rude and will not come when a cashier needs his assistance at the service desk. Management are asked to come in on their days off, and when an associate needs help in the store they consistently say that they are not supposed to be here because they were scheduled off and we are to leave them alone, so he or she can do their projects."
bad,one of the worst places i have ever worked. no communication. everybody in management dumps on each other and never pulled together. when i first started it seemed great. but it was all a lie. no equality. no honesty. i hated working there.
bad,"Management is bad you have that one managers that you don't like but yet they still the managers knowing that the person is the problem. Lack of communication in the store it every man for themselves. You get paid weekly but I recommend this job if you  a retiree or need a part-time job. No fulltime unless you have been there long enough. I'm just thinking about leaving because its not worth it. The hours is not set. You can make your own schedule but it has a to be approved by the store manages and you not guarantee to always have your days off that you requested. They sometimes work around your schedule. To much drama in big lots. Job not worth it if you live across town its not worth going To big lots for 3 hours or 4 hours. Like they really give you 3-4 a day and you only get 8hours a day on weekend or if someone calls off. They never keep employees because I guess to much work and not enough pay. ""You working or you hardly working"". I should be making @less $9.60 an hour I have experienced in retail for 7 years now and they started me off at 9. I'm just thinking about quiting. They never have enough employees. Im always working or either taking someone else's shift because they called off. As long as I've been working for big lots I have never called off or been late. I feel like giving up and working somewhere. I need higher pay for them little hours and burning gas from across time. When I have off days I have to come in my off days like really they need to hire enough people and stop holding back on labor. Because you killing the ones that work there.like you over working"
bad,work was unloading trucks all day and stocking the store. i learned merchandising  also about product knowledge. the management was very motivating as this job was very hard they always helped and did what they could to help the workflow
bad,"The pay is really low, with me working a full time already my pay from big lots would be like 70 a week which was not worth all the stuff that came with the job. the people there were cool but one supervisor was the worst and i just couldn't deal with that . they need better management as far as a new supervisor but they mainly hire children so i guess you get what you get with that. plus i was hired as stock but always was on the registers smh"
bad,"Poor Management, minimal hours besides when there was a sale, the food was mostly all about to expire , not much training in blocking / stocking even though the ladies that worked there and the management were super picky about it"
bad,"Unloading trucks, you never know if something is going to fall on you because of improper packing of products on the truck. Impossible to trust upper management - their promises were never realized. The management made everyone on edge and you couldn't trust them!"
bad,They want to work you a lot and just really don't payout enough they make all the money while you stuck in a hot truck slaving away either sweating or freezing you know they making good money they the managers
bad,"Disrespectful management, disrespectful co workers, unstable work environment, cleaniness leaves much to be desired and low level workers were treated poorly"
bad,Retail jobs are always offer varies schedule but it is very hard when you need stable schedule while you have family or life you may need to take care of.
bad,"The 4:00am Arrival Time Was Difficult."
bad,"Terrible work ethic, poor management and weren't compliant with home and work schedule. Not all products had a price available"
bad,Low pay no hours and management is unprofessional. Especially the store Manager. I say no more. Schedule changes daily and if you are not available all hours you will not get hours for the week.
bad,"pay is 8.25 ,no raise within 12 months, no advancement, all manual labor, unloading 3.000 peace tucks at 4AM and 6AM,  moving furniture by your self even when the box clearly shows to people to lift 200 pound boxes. and doing carry outs to customers vehicles threw small isle WAYS trying not to knock stuff over. product is always in the wrong spot, rude and lazy employees, filthy restrooms, so much shoplifting. if you dont mind not being able to go to the bathroom at work because no one had ever cleaned it, doing a lot of manual labor, being constanlyt disrespected, or you just love $200 dollars a week for waking up at 3 am and working 27 hours, or if you love complete losers as your supriors going on power trips because they have been there for 10 years. its like being the smartest kid on the short buss, i dont know how the manager still has a job"
bad,"4:00am until 10:00am ot enough hours to live off of. I learned how to be patient, work in a fast paste environment. I loved my coworkers great people, management wasn't so nice. The hardest part was unloading trucks and seeing a 125 check each week. Being promised one thing and getting another once you get hired."
bad,the store i worked at was really bad it was the south ogden store in utah. what made it so bad is everyone tried to be the boss of you the store manager did nothing when complaints were made. he also played favoritism with the people he liked giving them all the hours. he was more concerned about being friends with the stocking crew and treating the floor associates and cashiers like dirt. there were no real perks about working there other than a 20 % discount for employees.
bad,Managers are very rude to there own employees treat them with no respect over all big lots corona is just not a good place to work at.
bad,i enjoyed my co workers but the store manager that i worked for was very rude and chose not to take the time to understand personal/family issues.
bad,"Previous employee, I was drug tested for no valid reason, lied to several times & gave 3 different reasons at three different times to why I was fired, the three reasons were being unproductive when the same manager was just walking around with the other manager talking about non work related topics, when I was coming from break, going back to work. Second was customer complaining which no customer complained about me cause I knew most of our customers & third was for walking off which they're using as an excuse for them having no valid reason to drug test me & all their lying they been doing. All the other coworkers act completely suspicious when I walked in there. I feel completely ashamed for working for this piece of trash company & will never be going to another big lots in my life."
bad,this job doesn't pay anything! a waste of time!!! and no hours! was seasonal! I wouldn't work here again the working here isn't fun! they boss you around and not enough pay to even work for
bad,Under paid act like you are a slave. Management gossip about co-workers.always have expired foods on shelf. Also want you to tape up open food. Store is nasty co-worker getting hurt on trucks and will not go to the clinic to get check due to their urine will come back dirty.
bad,Was not trained right . Hours always got cut. Mangers did not wamt to help . You get tossed around in areas your not trained in. Then get told you are gonna get let go .
bad,"Terrible, they want you to have open availability ,only to schedule you for a 4 hour shift once a week. Why bother with open availability, its a waste of time. No real guidance from management"
bad,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the customers they were the best part of the job!! I loved being a cashier. it was just hard working for a manager who didn't like me and treated me as if I wasn't a good worker, I came early I covered shifts when needed but still felt like he didn't appreciate me being there. I went above and beyond and never got much appreciation from him."
bad,It was alot of hard work and the general manager sean p terry was the meaniest manager that ive ever worked for i didnt like working there i would never go back to work there because they didnt train me right
bad,I big lots is a terrible place to work I feel I wasted my time with the company and they were never willing to train anyone. Terrible store manager who bullied others that's why the store feel apart. No team management.
bad,I was a Dock to Stock Manager and asst manager if you are looking for full time forget it. BigLots AKA Pick n Save is worst place to work. I would not advise any one to work here that play faves and use you till you are broken and toss you away and throw you under the bus. this is the Redding ca store 4310 do not work there.
bad,The people/crew were awesome. Would do anything for anyone. Corporate was horrible. Corporate was constantly changing their Company Statement and we didn't know what direction to go in.
bad,"I have worked for BIG LOTS for 10 months now. It has to be the worst place to work. The management plays favorites. It doesn't matter how dependable and reliable employee you are they will cut your hours to 4 or 8 per week and give new employees 25 to 30 hours. And when you try and talk to store manager she lies and says there hours were cut. Which is a lie because her favorites all have 22 to 28 hours every week, not to mention they all call in sick and late or even pull a NO CALL NO SHOW AND STILL ARE EMPLOYED"
bad,The job constantly gave me problems with the work schedule clashing with my school schedule. The work hours were never consistent and the work environment was always negative.
bad,The store manager was very mean and hatefull.management worked you like a dog for minimum wage very poor hours.my father passed away and I didn't even get brevement pay.lot of retaliation the store manager would use the schedule as a retaliation tool.i was part time and they worked me full Time hours with no benefits worked there six years and when I quit I was only making 8.20 a hour.
bad,"Lied about pay increases, managers hide in the office, make new workers do the difficult work. Workers would no call no show frequently"
bad,"Don't tell the management anything unless you can handle discrimination at work.  They do not work with your schedule.  The two female managers are complete nightmares, and that's me being nice.  They play favorites.  The environment is trash with trashy people walking in to shop.  They have guys there who hit on you and call the place asking for your number.  Their female workers make you feel very uncomfortable by telling you all their personal matters."
bad,"A typical day at work is either busy or it is not it just depends on the day."
bad,never want to work her again not the best place very sketchily place money comes up missing not only the register but from the mangers safe which associates have not way to get too
bad,Terrible. Took it just to pay bills. I am very sorry for people forced to have to work this job as their main source of income
bad,Unloading the trucks. Stocking the store. I got instructions from 3 different managers. No one was ever on the same page. Getting treated unfairly than others. Managers never kept their word. ALWAYS drama. So glad I found employment elsewhere.
bad,Not a great place to work no staff no payroll no life or time it was god awful would not work there. save you sanity and don't work there
bad,"While I enjoy working in the store, the hours they give you is very limited and management is neither fair or concerned with employees.  "
bad,"Worst retail job i have worked to date. Corporate is a very hands off and management doesn't want to do anything more than they have to. Management doesn't know how to relay employee's concerns up the chain to corporate and to me the business should just be run by robots because they expect you to follow to a ""T"" exact scripts when communicating with customers."
bad,"under paid , terrible hours , no such thing as full time employment , poor leadership , with little to no chance for advancement , they do however make endless empty promises"
bad,Don't share info with associates I've been threaten and do has my family I've been passed over for raise and my job duties cut back and they won't let me go and I can't find other jobs that will take me. Management always change they care about dollar open 24/7 for thanksgiving come on shows u they don't care about anything besides money cheap
bad,"A typical day at work: There is always something going on customers are always looking for things that no one carries "
bad,"Terrible place to work.The store is VERY unorganized, associates just put merchandise wherever they please. You don't get enough hours; that is because they are always hiring people and cutting peoples hours. Breaks and lunches are extremely short. When it rains, the store floods. Associates do not come in to work like they are suppose to. Managers make you stay longer than what you are scheduled for. The assistant manager knows more than the store manager; he has no idea where he is at most the time."
bad,lots of customers great food all ways foot ball base ball or any game we had it. Ive learned  that i will never work in a bar in my life again and don't trust people that work in the bar. my mangers where out of hand they where not at all good mangers they where lazy and drunks. nothing was hard about this job and noting was enjoyably either.
bad,"The all-around environment in Big Lots feels stagnant and forced at the same time. Management expects you to put in 4-6 hours of work in 1-3 hours (especially if you are unloading a truck). They try to give their employees minimal time, and hire more employees to fill in the blanks. "
bad,"I have worked here and other locations for sometime, the dynamic in all locations is the same all members of management and team are treated with disrespect constantly. Management is expected to work as if they were associates, unload freight trucks, required to load and unload over 75 pds. of furniture alone without any help, basically you are not allowed to manage a store like other brick and mortar retailers.  Stock rooms have pallets of food and are infested with rats very unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Company has high turn over rate with management and associates due to not caring about employee retention. District Manager is a joke, and unprofessional with all associates including managers. Loss Prevention is non-exsistant and when you try and call it takes weeks to get a call back from LP. Company is unstructured and very behind from other retailers. The ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY to work for as management."
bad,I tried so hard to work there for as long as I did but nothing ever changed. Everyone was mean and noone was a good teacher. I learned everything on my own and made everything up as I went all while keeping my head down and trying not to get yelled at for smiling wrong or blinking
bad,"Greet customers entering and departing the store. Answer all incoming high volume calls. Go over guest orders and retrieve the guest order in a timely manner. Assisted guest in cash, credit, return, and exchange transactions. Walked the sales floor while recovering each designated department. Process merchandise in the backroom to fill the sales floor for the guest. Go over with co-workers or new hires about customer service sales, scores, and any revisions needed. Process a cashier report and tidy up the front end and calculate my register till amount. Tidy up the front end, sales floor and restrooms."
bad,"The management at this company is horrible, mostly on the corporate end.  I have had several bad experiences with my district manager being rude to employees and generally not caring about them.  Big lots want their employees to work 2, 4 hour shifts a week. most of the employees in my store take the bus and traveling like that for a measly 4 hours is causing them to lose time. I transferred between stores at one point and it took 2 whole months to get put in the new stores system. My paycheck was not keyed in one week, which i didnt get paid, and  then AGAIN the very next week. Big lots DOES NOT have it together on the corporate end."
bad,"bigots has great opportunity's"
bad,"I worked for big lots on central and ridge for eight months. The motto of big lots is to hire management from with in. That is the biggest lie in the company. Managers in this store have no idea how to do any of their jobs. Nothing gets done by managers and the very last minute they would force a associate to get it done. The store manager treats everyone as if she is to good to explain anything or help customers the correct way. She would ask us to work extra hours a week and i didnt see that pay for two -three weeks after.  She owes me more than 45 hours which 15 were supposed to be over time. As management they are not allowed to buy marked down items . The store manager will mark down products and buy them her self. She stores things in her office and the stock room until the weekend the employees get 30% off. She shows the employees no respect. She also threatens your job if you dont drop anything your doing to go into work when she messes up the time sheet. She gives herself the days she wants off but even if you give her a three week notice she still puts you on for the hours you cant work. This job is not worth the stress of having todo more than you were hired for. To never have time with your family cause the store manager is inconsiderate of any one but her self. Upper management is a joke. Nothing like having a bunch of incompetent ""professionals"" running a company. They want the store to have a million things done by the end of the week. But they do not give the stores enough hours.  Or better yet maybe they can hire a store manager that actually knows what she"
bad,Worst job of my life the management sucked and nothing was ever done right. This job was not prioritized one bit and it was some new drama everyday
bad,"Had an interview, received a second one.  Received a call to reschedule for another day for me to show up and wait for 30 minutes to be told that the person that was suppose to interview me forgot about me.  I drove 40 minutes in rush hour traffic to get there ten minutes early and there not competent enough to remember they have a second interview with someone they already rescheduled once?  Shows a lot about management and the company in general.  If you interview with this company bring this up so it doesn't happen to you."
bad,I was worked way to much for way to little. At times I was left with some manager responsibilities on top of my regular CSS duties. there wasn't a problem until I asked for a raise and the managers just lead me on.
bad,"Everyone is different,this job was not for me. I needed a job and fast so I took it without even having an interview. they had my resume and hired me over the phone. The moment I walked into my first day of work I knew it wouldn't last. 3 weeks after I started, I asked the manager what should I do if I wanted to quit. She said to put in my 2 weeks notice and then I would have 2 weeks to find a new job. I laughed and said I'm not quitting right now, I was just asking because after August28th I might not be able to continue working. That's as far as that conversation went. Immediately after that I was taken off the schedule. When I called the manager she said they didn't have any work for me and to call every week so I could get my schedule. After 3 weeks of that I went into the store to find out what was really going on, the boss of my manager said I told her I was quitting.   The people here were very immature and talked about everyone behind there backs. I should have done more research and took more time to find a job I would fit into a little better so in part its my fault too."
bad,District Manager is very mean and unprofessional towards employees.
bad,"Everyone worked PT, no lunch breaks, hired as cashier/stocker-mostly stocked, made to unload merchandise out of trucks which was not in my job description."
bad,Got bronchitis due to the way they made me clean. Cleaned residential homes.
bad,No respect for employees or their time . Schedules not posted until day before. Complete chaos and ever changing priorities. Disrespect to staff is acceptable to this employer
bad,Very Busy and No breaks.On my Feet for 7 hours. My boss was as bright and only care about the workers in the front.And they couldnt get my name right.
bad,Worked like a slave.short breaks bad place to work power bonus is a scam
bad,overall dissatisfied with this company. the corporate office needs a lot of work. these people are very disorganized
bad,Too much to do.  Not enough help.  New CEO is clueless.  Low pay. Open every holiday. Long hours
bad,this by far was the worst job i have ever had bad pay bad management and poor scheduling
bad,"no advancement, horrible place to work. Its a job for high schoolers"
bad,"I strongly advise against working for this company, They do no take care of their employees, they will never take responsibility for their own actions, but will instead blame it on others to walk away clean. They offer terrible pay for a manager and no consideration for an outside life."
bad,do not work there they don't treat there employees right they always change things don't give enough hours
bad,Not enough hours to have part timers get more than 3 hours of workper week.  Store manager is a lier...
bad,it was alright when i first start but towards the end no one want to help you
bad,"A typical day at Biglots is ongoing consumers from all across the city, varies from irate customers to satisfied customers. Senior Management hardly ever communicate with middle management. 20% of  Co-workers at Biglots has lack of customer service skills or just do not use their abilities. What I have learned about the job is that some people or just unhappy no matter how much you may try putting so much fourth in effort to make them feel secure.I enjoy the most is getting to know people from different walks of life. The hardest part is letting a customer know that we do not have the product that seek out for. I also like that I stay 3-5 minutes away from the store."
bad,"a typical day for me was i was cashering at the service desk which is only supposed to be for cashiers are are CSS's which is sorta like the head cashier, i would do returns, answer phones, put re shop up. what i learned was no matter how hard you worked at big lots, unless you knew the right people you were not going to advance into a higher position, the management when i worked there was terrible, a great person, but not a very good manager. co workers were not very good either except a few, they would always leave the cashier station and go outside or go in the back. the hardest part was doing other people's jobs and not getting paid what they was, and doing all the work and not advancing into a higher position, the most enjoyable part was the customers that i meet i developed a great relationship with some people that came in there and they always asked for me."
bad,"I began working normal hours for the first week to two weeks however after my initial training I was put in receiving and worked only 1 day a week beginning with an 8 hour shift but my hours were reduced to seven in a half, then seven and six in a half until finally ending at six hours."
bad,overworked and such long hours... also meet a lot of new people
bad,"As a former employee of big lots, it saddens me to say that..... oh wait im not sad. Im happy! I'm very happy I left that place. nothing but high school he said she said about everybody. All the managers make you do three to five different things all at once and only give you an hour or so to do it. The district managers don't care about the employees that were there for quite some time, ALL I repeat ALL new hires get 25+ hours a week while the hardworking employees that have been working there for a little while get the shaft when it comes to hours. If a big lots is hiring in your area and you can find a better job DO SO! if not. Sorry kids, your in for a rough ride"
bad,"a great company for children in school. i really did enjoyed my experience with this company, but has decided to move forward to a better future."
bad,I was overworked and underpaid and didn't get the opportunity to advance in the company.
bad,A typical day at work for Big Lots were a nice quick day. Always on your feet. The management acted as if they were kids gossiping in the work place. My co-workers were always nice. The hardest part about working at Big Lots were having pride in your work especially when you see your managers not caring.
bad,Big Lots was difficult to work at due to the lack of flexibility with my college schedule.
bad,"Big lots started an intern program that is a joke.  I warn all people appplying for assistant management to really ask questions and review the company.  the physical work and waste of productivity with this company is a joke.  unloading a semi truck on a manual rolling system with 2 employees and an assistant manager, pricing by hand(no pricing gun) and stocking in a 24 hour company guideline is crazy. complaining to hr and dm goes right back to store"
bad,"Big Lots was your everyday typical retail store job. This job was extremely boring and nerve racking, all the co-workers did all day was smile in eachothers face and talk about eachother behind their backs because of this I wouldn't talk to anyone but managers even though they were part of the he say she say drama and the customers if I was working day shift we never had set schedueles and normally I wouldn't have taken such a nasty job but job hunting was getting harder and harder and he manager let me know she only wanted us for the black friday sale and redecorating the store for christmas so it kinda sucked to know that the job was going to be so short."
bad,No infrastructure
bad,"The current manager is uncommunicative, moody, and will walk off in the middle of a sentence. He treats employees as if they are not there. He is rude, and unkind to employees as well as to customers. When I was asked by a customer to report him to corporate I was fired within the following month."
bad,This was my first job and my beginning of disappointment I was given the promise that i would stay here under the word of a Full Time Position. But Reduced to a Temp position.
bad,Management needs alot of work at this store {The Manager needed more training before taking over this store}
bad,"Very low pay with high responsibility, sparatic hours and scheduling."
bad,"Nice company, jus not stable enough for a career. The hours various from week. Nice job for ah college student."
bad,"I do not ask for much, but a little politeness and a friendly orientation to a new employee is all I expect. I worked the overnight stock job from midnight to 6 am, and my supervisor, abbreviated M. greets me with a grouchy demeanor. That is okay, but when I have to run all around the store to ask for more work to do, and to not be shown how to properly do something in the beginning, and telling me that I'm not working fast enough, I need to get through 25 boxes an hour (but it all depends on what is in each box, 40 little toys or 3 large toys) that have to be tagged, it really gets to me. I do not want to generalize, I just had a bad experience with a supervisor."
bad,i was a cashier but didnt get enough hours. Its an ok company to work for if you could get paid more and more hours.
bad,worked there for over 6 years.started out cashier and stocker and unloading trucks once week so spent most of week putting up freight.got torun on register alot also.then got permoted to merchandiser which i reworked isles and rebuilt endcaps just reworked departments.also was cashierwhen needed.
bad,"management was really bad a lot of fighting with each other, which was not good for us employees to see and talking behind each others backs and telling the employee's about there personal problems."
bad,Productive and a great place to work and grown. I learned how to be a leader and how to work and respect my co works at all time no matter what. What I like the most that u can grow and learn difference things to better yourself.
bad,"I would rather not comment. the hardest part of the job was not enough hours.Why would you hire a person to work P-time 1 day a week, and say there is no more hours for them to work and then you bring on new employees for the same time frame."
bad,heavy lifting getting all the product conveyed strive for success
bad,"Big lots was the worst place I have ever worked at in my life. Management is Snotty, You couldn't ask a question without Getting a mean Snotty Remark back. Inventory Had Unbelievably Horrible Numbers."
bad,This was a great place to work if you not in it for the money. The sale experiences I got did help me along the way but this was not the best job for me
bad,"This company from top to bottom has no direction and passion. Training is none existent. Upper management has no care for store level employees. "
bad,Big lots sucks they nickle and dime you give you poor hours and miss treat you don't pay you what youre worth. They make you do all the managers work. Big lots you suck.
bad,"Every person on the staff here is confused and dazed. No one understands how to run a retail store. Schedule is always out late, work week starts sunday and the schedule is out saturday at 6 pm."
bad,"Do not consider big lots a place to work!!! The worst retail place to work at ever! For starts the pay sucks they give you little bit of hours you’ll only probably work one, two out of the week maybe three if your lucky and they only schedule you more hours when it’s convenient for them or when the store busy for holidays. Some of Management there sucks treating there employees horrible(well certain ones bad and harassing them). Don’t waste your time applying."
bad,"They have you run a skeleton crew and expect managers to make up the work , hours aloted for associate s was bare and your not paid what your worth..."
bad,"I was hired in as the furniture department manager.  I managed nothing because everything I attempted to do per corporate was overturned the store manager. She singled me out regularly.  I trained at one store which was incredible, however, when I came back from my in depth training, I was told that at that location, “we don’t do things like that,” even though it was corporate mandated.  While I did enjoy my time working there, I did not enjoy working for that particular manager."
bad,"Clean area, handle packaged, tape boxes close show up to work on time and communicate any complications on site, take your lunch on time and return on time"
bad,"The hours are not enough to pay any bills, they don’t give employees enough hours. There a lot of favorites with in the store. No room for advancement, it’s good if your a child living at home with your parents but as an adult your bills will not be paid. Some weeks you will get anywhere from 4-8 hours other weeks you can get 12-17 hours it’s never Constance every week it’s different."
bad,Hand down the worst management team ( SM and up). They work you to the bone and never provide relief in any form. There is also no advancement Opportunity unless you are a long term member of the team( part of the click).
bad,Company is a joke. Management only likes kiss butt.   Former manager before was a big joke. Hired pretty girls so he could look and flirt with them. And would curse you if you did something wrong.
bad,"I would not like to say anything about it,"
bad,"Working at Big Lots was a nightmare. Firstly I was hired when the store leader was out of state, I had NO training what so ever. They let me watch another employee ring up a customer once and left me alone in the front end. I got yelled at on my first day because no one told me I was responsible for answering the main store phone even though the manager sat in the office right beside the phone. I was yelled at my a manager for not knowing how to print tickets when no one had showed me, she even yelled at me in front of our customers. This was the worse job I have ever had, all they did was belittle me and treat me like I was dumb."
bad,"I’ve been a manager here for 6+ years, employee for 10, and this place is going downhill. Completely unsafe, completely underpaid, no room for advancement. They require internal employees to take “new hire personality assessment tests” in order to be promoted. But then they still hire outside of the company. They are extremely outdated in their technology and never fix anything that needs fixed and would rather portray themselves as  upscale and raise their prices to compete with amazon and Walmart which they never will. Store of the future will be the nail in the coffin"
bad,This job is one of the most cutthroat places I've ever worked at. I would sit and listen to management make the schedule and only give certain associates four hours a week because they didn't like them.
bad,They let management get away with anything . They pick and choose who they like.  Some store managers sit back while everyone else does the job. Hire quality people not just warm bodies. And be consistent when writing someone up. Management get away sitting in the office . The store manager especially
bad,"Semi big store but bigger stores drown us out so we’re expected to pick up the slack. 12 hours a week maximum if your not a suck up, half of the managers are great the other half shows favoritism or just don’t work period. Schedules are “randomly generated” based of off your availability."
bad,This place is toxic. No one knows or cares what is going on. The store manager makes the schedule and bases it on what he needs and does not care about anyone else.
bad,Managers ARE AWFUL!! Employees are so scared to speak up about how they’re mistreated and spoke to by management due to retaliation. In one week 6 people quit because of the work environment at this store. They talk down to you as if they’re better than you and treat you like absolute trash.
bad,"Lack of training, equipment also not working, management that is fighting each other, and pitting associates against each other. Hours and break weren't as promised."
bad,Work you like dogs would not recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemies. Hours are all over the place do not have the proper equipment to work with just horrible
bad,"There was no training involved upon employment. Time was spent watching videos then being thrown onto the retail floor and registers. within my first month over half of the employees were either fired or quit and I was promoted to lead cashier, without title or pay. They gave me keys to the store and never told me what key went to what."
bad,"Extremely unstructured workplace. Extremely disorganized planning. Reactive rather than proactive management. If your an hourly employees and work over your sheduled time out, you cannot punch out and management will short you on time you actually worked. Cannot really make personal plans for the following week because they post the following weeks schedule late Friday. The workweek runs Sunday through Saturday so you don't know if you're going to working on Sunday until late Friday. Aweful work life balance. And if you get a raise expect 10 to 20 cents per year. Needless to say, the store is always understaffed because they cannot keep employees for all the reasons listed above."
bad,"Pros: Negotiable schedules, good interaction with customers, employee discounts, and cheap prices on items"
bad,Can only work a max of 29 hours with a pay of 8.50 maybe. Can't get any overtime except maybe the holidays. only good thing is a 20% discount. Managers don't even show up on time.
bad,You were overloaded with tasks and you didn't often get help if you struggled. the hardest part of the job would have to be when you have to stock and lift a whole bunch of things by yourself. The fun part was when I did the cashier position and got to talk to people.
bad,Corporate needs to pay their employees better wages that deserve it . Increase the minimum wage and knowledge does his do their best to help the company grow
bad,When I worked their the management was awful and didn't know what they were doing. I was hired to be a cashier and then they decided to switch my job to night stocker even when I told them I can't do it because of back problems. Unorganized and slow paced. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone
bad,What I liked about BIG LOTS was that it had great deals for customers. My coworkers were hard to get along with and it was difficult for me to communicate with my co-workers.
bad,"Hire you with high unrealistic expectations.  The current turnover rate at the store I am currently in is 125%.  Additionally, get ready to be run over by a bus at any given moment.  The company have many shortfalls, but the imagery of the stores and the overtime are the only advantages (though limited on the overtime).  Management does punch a clock, but they expect salary type outcomes."
bad,Company made assurances that were not honored. Leadership not in tune with stores or associates. Corporate failed to conduct proper investigations into employeesituations
bad,"Pretty good environment and very easy job. I had a good experience working at Big Lots, other than the fact that my Male coworkers made me feel uncomfortable. Customers were nice, and closing the store was very easy!"
bad,"This was a thank-less, grueling job. The only way to move up was to be friends with the right people and talk bad about everyone else. There is no structure or rhyme or reason for anything anyone does. There was rules but no one followed or enforced them. Any time a manager would try to enforce the rules other manager would just make fun of them making the day to day work life stressful to say the least. I would not recommend anyone work here ever."
bad,this job is meant for kids out of high school who need extra money in their pockets.. taking that job seriously would be a joke.. you were treated poorly given minimum hours for a lot of the hard work that i did. given no raise for a year that i worked there.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at big lots but me doing what I had to do coming to work to handle my business made it worth while. The managers were very mean and disrespectful. I feel as he should have been fired, and also the empoyee's was very hateful that I worked there job better then them at a early time."
bad,"lots of standing, certain managers complained 24/7 and didnt know what they were doing most of the time. good job for a highschooler, thats about it"
bad,"treat their management staff poorly, felt more like a highly paid stocker than part of a management team. district mgr will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat."
bad,"A typical day is very stressful with very little payroll to run the store properly."
bad,"see resume . long hours, because of no upper support. I learned nothing. the hardest part of the job was having to go in everyday."
bad,"I just quit the Parkersburg wv Big Lots 186 in southside Parkersburg I worked very very hard love my customers but poorest management I have ever seen. Very distrubing that management and some employees can act and talk to other employees the way they due. Talking like customers coming in there were welfare trash .Never worked in such a negative place in my life. I was once a manager in a store in our local mall and we wanted to be know as a friendly place to shop and a place customers wanted to come back to . I cant understand why these people work there they hate their jobs and hate customers and let employees talk to other employees like their anamils. WHERE ARE BIG LOTS CORPORATE PEOPLE, This place is a embarassing place to work. GO IN AS A UNDERCOVER AND BE READY TO BE IN SHOCK!!!!!!!!!! Im thankfull i got out of there you are what you eat as they say and i ate all the hate i could till i walked out. Could be a great place to work , they said i was the happest person they ever saw. I didnt feel like that the day i left . Very Very HAPPY to be set FREE!!!!! thanks"
bad,"You generally do your own thing and it can be nice to complete tasks, but have to be prepared for rushes and or store issues."
bad,"Former employee, management is rude and doesn't respect any of their employees, talks down on employees, hours suck, pay sucks, new company policy changes are horrible, HORRIBLE place, especially store 383 Vinton, Virginia."
bad,No matter the situation the leaders are the problem. They pulled every available hour out of the store and expect 3/4 members of management to operate and perform every job role.
bad,"I will never work there again. It's the company it's the people who run it they make it hard for to advance they show favoritism you cant trust the supervisor, or gm, or the director, the only people you can trust is the people in corporate."
bad,"Too much drama. People are hard to get along with. Raises are a joke, maybe 5 cents a year. Great place to learn cashiering.  Pay is too low. Would be ok if pay was better and you had a set department to work in."
bad,"poor management they talk safety but have no idea what safety is, and  no training and no employee appreciation dirty and very dangerous very poor working conditions"
bad,"I got injured on the job and had to take leave. I was given greif over it, and was temporarily let go of. I was not told that I was a seasonal, and was let go as a seasonal, rather than the full time position I applied for."
bad,"This was a fun part-time job, but I feel that the management team was lacking.  A team is suppose to rely on management but there was no management team around to delegate tasks or assist throughout the course of a shift."
bad,All you really need to know is that everyone is always looking out for themselves first... very cut throat for close out retail ... and once they know how much you're willing to do for what you currently make then get used to doing it. Yearly evals and raises of less than half a dollar. No matter how hard you worked... and they try to make it more appealing with bonuses... that NEVER HAPPEN
bad,"The Good:  Some managers are excellent. Some associates you work with are wonderful and will be lifelong friends. The discount is nice. If you're a part-time associate with availability restraints, it's ideal, because you can basically dictate when you're able to work--no guarantee of those hours, but at least you have that freedom. Good exercise, decent pay for management, and you learn a lot about customer service and merchandising."
bad,"This was the worst company I have worked for hands down, the entire work load is put onto assistant management with very little help from store managers. Only part time workers unless management and you will not get any hours unless management likes you. Solely a metric based company with employees encouraged with falsifying information to meet said metrics.   The only positive is the employee discount on furniture"
bad,"Worked there for 1.5 weeks last year and it was hard work, but not too bad...I returned a year later for part time work, worked one day, everything went well. Was on my way in for day 2 and was told to never return because my application was marked as ""never worked for the company before"" when I had in fact helped with the remodel for a week the prior year. While I don't recall marking that on the application,  I apologized for the typo and considering I was a wonderful employee and had zero issues at all, you would think the manager would have relayed to corporate that it was simply an oversight. NOPE, just a dont come back as if I were a criminal!! NEVER recommend this place....seems pretty racist...and no support from management."
bad,Company is going through a transition period with new management.  This has lead to fast paced changes to staffing and way the company operates.  There are great leaders at the company.
bad,"A typical day at big lots dc is normally a living nightmare most of the supervisors yell, curse, and try to embarrass you and talk to people like they’re kids and you can report it and nothing happens,I would  never recommend this job to anyone unless you’re desperate for money."
bad,Management expects you to work your butt off for minimum wage.  You will never get any positive feedback or praise from them.  They only knitpick and get off on barking at you in front of customers.  Management is a total joke.  Never been so disrespected in my life by 20 something yr old jokes of Managerohumanhumansbeingsexcuses of human beings.
bad,This is the type of job that pays you the bare minimum they can pay you for example minimum wage is 11.10 that’s exactly what they pay you here but want you to work like your getting paid more. If you have any issues with a manger or say a favorite of a manager they will cut your hrs. For example you discuss something with a coworker and they tell the manager you then get dropped to 1-2 days a week and they keep you like that until you get sick of it and quit. What’s also an issue is people can come to work high and nothing be said but yet you come in like that you getting fired ASAP there is zero respect for new workers unless you become a favor by the raise your treated like scum
bad,"They give you guides that cannot be followed and write you up when they aren't done exactly correct,  but will immediately terminate you if you change them for not following approved company policies. "
bad,BE READY. This is not it sis. Cleaning bathrooms and working with people. It's not worth the money. Honestly as a employee in general this job nasty. The job is a lie forreal.
bad,"The hours were terrible, and the work made no sense. They didn’t want overstock but they didn’t want you to put things in the wrong spot and yet we were told to make room somewhere and put it out.. okay"
bad,"A place to start after high school or going to college nothing to live off of. Overload of merchandise on trucks, management sucks, low pay, low hours, no room for growth."
bad,If you have more than one kid or a spouse that even has a semi weak immune system don't work here. They don't accept doctor noted for sick days.  Also if your a female don't work furniture because all you'll get told is that loading furniture isn't a job you should be allowed to do
bad,I just feel they could have done so much better with this company. I was there ever since I was 18 and it really hurt to see how they treat their employees.
bad,"look like a junk shop, lack of management, lack of control, employees fighting, not clean, old computers, no internet, manager not knowing how to open a locker"
bad,"Cut throat environment among various managers. It’s every man for himself. Middle school type environment with tattling and playing the blame game. Scheduling for managers is pitiful. You get your schedule at the last minute every week, so forget about making plans. Was approved to have my birthday off, but still was put on the schedule anyway. Company has lots of policies, but if you try to enforce them you will likely receive discipline for it. Tons of heavy lifting every day. 300 pound sofas and tables. If you ask someone for help, you are made fun of. Workload for managers is ridiculous with the low payroll help that you have. This company sets its managers up for failure. Most stressful job you could imagine. Unheard of turnover rate. Ridiculous.  Run like the wind from this place."
bad,I was an assistant team lead. The districmanager made entire management staff they were losers and could be fired at any time. Finally pushed store leader out. Replacement came in and started clearing out old staff. This is no way to live
bad,I worked here for a short time when I moved out of my hometown. The management here honestly did not care for their employees and it showed. The store was always very messy and not organized to correct standards. You could be scheduled a shift randomly out of nowhere and be expected to show up. It was not a pleasant job for me from start to finish. I would never work here again.
bad,"I cant say because I need my job!  I have no more to say so please let me continue in what I was doing, there has been no error here.  Thank you for your time."
bad,big lot is a stressful job...the production system is strewed up....i think if u have to pick so many cartons in a certain amount of time why should you be made to keep up a production
bad,Getting Bullied by your DM and made to feel terrible about your job sums up this company. I have learned working in many retail environments that this is rock bottom.
bad,"As a manager, you get no time off. You work seven days a week 12 hour days and the job you do is never good enough. It is a company that does not care about its people they are only looking at the bottom line."
bad,"Hard work for little pay, bad work environment,  unfriendly staff,  hours are not  flexible,  hours a week very,  Poor management,  High price benefits"
bad,You go in clock in and get ready for the day. run the cash register or put away items customers didn't want. manager ride your back all day long with little pay.
bad,a typical day at work always started out pulled into the office with something that was done wrong and it was my fault even if i was off on the day the issue arised
bad,"Worst manger to work with very rude to the people that work and shop there very slow in doing things work there for over a year no raise very stressful cause of the one manager always dirty, the back room is a joke so many  violations  unsafe"
bad,"All pt associates with no clear  path to be full time get prompted.only 4 to 18 hours a week for pt that are struggling  to paybills.the next week schedule is put up till the last day before  the new one starts. Never can plan your life for the next week."
bad,"Given the amount of time and dedication I put forth with this company, it was easy to leave with a better offer at more pay in an entry level position.  Unclear direction, high standards with poor training and equipment, no care for personal life.  Grind you until they spit you out because they can always find someone new."
bad,great place to work just lack of concern from upper management.work load was intense and always ever changing throughout the store on a given day you could reset the entire store doing pog's
bad,The company at the corporate level is using an outdated business model. They replace all the seasoned workers with new ones that work for less pay. But don't know their butt from a hole in the ground. They do some shady deals and if you end up with damaged merchandise they will give you a discount and talk you out of bringing it back to fix it. All employees are assumed lazy and the customer is always right to the point they will gladly return stolen merchandise to avoid any kind of customer complaint.
bad,terrible terrible place to work at the management didnt really help the place was unorganized no real direction wasnt really much progression not very bright coworkers
bad,"There was a lack of training, and leadership. Workplace culture was horrible and there was no open door policy. Typical day at work was just getting through. Company isnt organized."
bad,"I worked the San Pablo Ca Big Lots, off the bat it felt unfriendly by associates and the managers acted like they could care less about you as a person, but wanted you to be their work horse."
bad,"The associates I worked with were very friendly, but the manager was a terror. The manager would reprimand employees in front of customers impeding their ability to care for the customers. Would take naps in the office."
bad,"Big Lots was a very stressful job. There is no workplace/life balance."
bad,"It wouldn't be such a bad place to work if management wasn't constantly breathing down your neck, waiting for you to make a mistake. The store hemorrhages employees (especially floor associates and cashiers) because no one likes working there. Associates get berated at the slightest provocation. Floor associates are expected to be able to recover the entire store in less than two hours, which is impossible if you do your job correctly and remove damaged or expired items. You get in more trouble if you take your time and do it right than if you just ignore the items that are supposed to be removed. Cashiers are expected to ticket merchandise, recover the front end, checkout customers, clean shelves, answer the phone, and greet every single customer all while keeping a smile on their face and a song in their heart.  If you can't do all those things at once, you get written up. I actually got written up for being sad one day. It's very difficult to smile when your boss gives you backhanded insults all the time. One of the managers is so terrible, he made a floor associate cry more than once. People dread finding out that he's the manager on duty. I've had customers come up to me and tell me that I shouldn't have to put up with the way he acts and I should get a new job. I'm really glad I don't work there anymore. Most of the managers were okay and my coworkers were fine, but two of the managers made it impossible to work there. If you plan on working at the Salisbury Big Lots, don't plan to work there very long. You will probably quit or get fired within the first six months."
bad,"I work at the Big Lots! In New Braunfels, Texas store 1154. I love the employees that I work with, but the Management sucks. We had a manager that listened and cared about his employees. Then there were 2 managers that were bitter because they were passed over for the manager position. They didn't do anything to help him make the store better. They set him up to fail. Once they let the manager go the other 2 stepped up to make themselves look good. These 2 snakes will eventually go after one another.  So steer clear."
bad,Understaffed very understaffed as an Assistant Store Manager you are expected to do everything. Company is very old fashioned and even the computers/registers are so outdated you'll spend most of your time rebooting registers and selling furniture.
bad,Company policy and benefits need a overhaul. People cannot afford to be sick or injured foe any amount of time without loss of a job. Even long term employees can get fired due to there terrible policies.
bad,"This place can be a Pain in the butt"
bad,"Upper management should support more on their Store and Assistant Managers who are there supporting and doing all the jobs for them to make the store successful and be there for them all the time.  To keep the moral on the associates.  Sometimes a simple recognition on the associates working for them is all it needs to acknowledge and not taking them for granted.  Promote people who deserve to be promoted and not political (buddy buddy).  On the 3 years I have worked in this company, most of the store managers have been seriously ill from working their butt."
bad,"This company is more disorganized and chaotic than most, and typically blames its management and employees for its system and operational failures.This promotes an ""us against them"" attitude when it comes to corporate management and somewhat results in a more cohesive staff at the store level, however, this is short lived as employees are encouraged to turn on each other in a effort to save their own much needed employment.  You will routinely be called on to more than you could ever accomplish given the staff and payroll restrictions, and then be held accountable for your shortcomings.  I would recommend this company only for those who appreciate the value of the goods sold and the 20% employee discount."
bad,"Unfair employee treatment, if your not buddy buddy with management YOU WILL LOSE YOUR JOB!  Low wages,over worked,building is rampad with flies from out dated food..rats n mice run freely....I was suspended from my job jus from hear say...management was buddy with employe so you kno how that goes...don't do it to your self find some place else to work"
bad,Management is clueless and the company refuses to allot sufficient hours.
bad,"Unrealistic expectations sent down from district level, never having enough store hours to get work done, company does not train employees to be successful,  as a store manager I had no ability to price shop, typical day at work started at 5 am and did not leave until 6 at night while only getting paid for 40 hours a week, my most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect to my associates individually."
bad,"The employees were nice and the concept was great but the district manager was ridiculous. She thought that the store should be merchandised like a Target when there was no telling what came in, how much and good luck making it all fit with no planograms. There was not enough payroll to give employees more than 12 hours a week. Wasn't so much the company, but the district manager, marketing manager and RVP could learn by managing a store for a full day and accomplishing their ridiculous expectations on the minimun payroll they alotted. Stay away! The pay isn't worth the amount of hours they expect you to work."
bad,worst career move i ever made was to go to work for big lots. i would never recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"This company has absolutely no regard for it's employees or management. Managers are glorified key holders that are consistently held accountable as stockers/recovery associates rather than being a manager. If you should accept a position with this company as a manager, be prepared to spend 10% of your time actually managing and 90% of your time being an overpaid stocker, cashier, janitor, cart attendant, and floor associate. They allocate just enough payroll to process a truck once a week, run 1 register a day for a 6 hour period, 2 people to recover the store nightly, and the manager on duty fills in everywhere else. If you're lucky you will have an associate in the furniture department for a few hours a day to help out. Applying managers be wary, the DM and store managers are unofficial members of the ""good ole boy"" club. The company tries to copy another retailers policy of open door however this policy fails miserably and HR is nothing more than a rubber stamp. If managing retail is your chosen career path, then heed this warning and stay as far away from this company as possible."
bad,"No hours no appreciation company is more about reward cards  credit card sign ups . Manager more concerned being number one in contest , even a charity  contest it's not about the "
bad,"This is the kind of place that doesn't seem to attract the best and the brightest. If you are a hard worker you will be taken advantage of. If you ask one employee if a second employee was in today, that will be taken as you complaining about another employee and the manager will chew you out. Very low pay, hardly any growth opportunity. Apply only if desperate."
bad,"Wack  job no hours ."
bad,"Limited hours, limited resources. Freight processing is insane. Put away and stocking even worse. Expired, damaged pallets of food throughout warehouse. Horrible work environment. If you like to move and unload furniture trucks by yourself while your the only person in the store except cashier, this is the job for you."
bad,"Started out normal but after a few months I begin to see that hours, promotions and job tasks were decided by management's personal feelings and opinions about you rather than the work ethic."
bad,Loved the job up until the time they closed the doors of a store that had been open for over 15 years.  Good company overall to work for lots of great people to work with.
bad,"Store expectations and standards were set very high, which I do agree with. However not having enough staff at any given shift, put responsibilities on the assistant management team."
bad,"Work  constantly , micromanaged constantly , on feet all day .."
bad,It's a fun place to work but just don't have enough hours and company keeps hiring so hours get cut most of the time. Plus no benefits offered except managers
bad,The manager was racist and a bigot. Absolutely poor service. They were rude to customers and would snake them out of discount sales. The pay was okay but if the manager didn't like you he'd make sure everyone knew
bad,"From receiving to stocking shelves, the rails, ladders, carts, and pallet jacks often are not in working order much less safe to use. The district manager was too cheap to fix the issues when brought up by manager."
bad,not a very fun place to work. would not recomend it to anyone.I was ther 7 years and had 6 district managers and 7 store managers . the turnover is super high..
bad,"Bad managers, they talk bad about all the employees on the sales floor like they are still in high school. Don't trust any employees besides the store manager"
bad,"Worse job I ever had, micro-management, culture is poor, glad to leave. Poorly organized, no support, does not let you do your job. Would not recommend this particular location to my worse enemy."
bad,"Big lots isnt a place i would refer someone to work at because big lots screws people over when you are working especially on your hours, they promise you 40 hours at least and you barely break 30 hours a week"
bad,I didn't really enjoy working my there that much it wasn't a good place to grow in the company the pay wasn't good the hours we're terrible I wouldn't go back
bad,Gives you so many hour a week for payroll and expect the management to finish all task with the hours. It's impossible. No overtime even if you don't finish the project. DM is always on top of you to finish the projects. If you do it wrong you get yelled for it. They don't training you at all they just put you in and expect you to succeed.
bad,"There were days that I enjoyed working there and then there were days you didn't want to be there at all. They treated employees as if they are thieves, and it's an unfair workplace. I like my hours they consisted of mostly 4a.m. to about noon 3-4 days a week"
bad,company doesn't pay much or give good benefits and they keep the store open constantly and communication sucks company is very greedy and selfish not a fun place to work
bad,First off the pay was bad..... Not $400.00 every two weeks bad but worst. I got paid $45 to $150.00 dollars a week. that's about 350.00 a month correct me if I'm wrong and that's if I was lucky enough to get all $150.00 for every week. I got paid nothing! I was unable to buy anything or pay any bills to be honest my money went to paying bills. When I first started working there I thought the low pay was how we started off then it would pick up. I was worng! When I first started working there they had me on the register. They didn't train me properly (This was my first job) So I wasn't sure how things worked or what I was suppose to do. I was put on stock for awhile but I was taken off soon after. Then I was thrown on fronting and faceing. They were trying to find the best fit for me. So I worked 3 hours a day. I asked for more hours but I was denided. Me and the other people who worked the same amount of hours I did all got denided the same as me... so I thought anyways till I found out they were working the register for some of the cashiers and working stock some nights. That was when I realized I was getting paid the least out of all my coworkers. So I asked for more hours. This did not sit well with the hiring manager who was never there. When he was there he threaten to give me even less hours if I didn't liked what I got. So I told him I'll just find a new job and he was ok with that. Out side of the bad pay the managers were like bullies and held grudges. One of my cowokers who wasn't a manager but she was a valuable atset to the managers was a bully as well. She would
bad,Still working the floor & adding lots of miles to my feet. Not advancing or broadening my skills.  Not getting to work with my accounting ability
bad,"Of all the nopes. I give this place the biggest nope in the world. Management is often unproductive and sits on hours for themselves to garner overtime. Lean heavily on part time workers, while not training them properly then complaining about them soon after."
bad,"First and foremost it do not have any structure, management is like a night mare waiting to happen. This company is in need of a total make over and I mean a total overhaul because they are greedy for money and they don't know how and when they have good workers also the need to LOOK AT UNDERCOVER BOSS SESSION REALLY , REALLY GOOD and maybe the will learn something from it because as for now I don't see any help for them. This Is ridiculous making your employees work until 11:00 on Christmas Eve all because you'll are money hunger you are at home with your family so why not let them be at home with their love one's too this is a shame before god greedy, greedy"
bad,i love my sustomers but this place has employees that all want to be the big boss one ofe the managers are hard to work with and complain to musch some employees just want to start drama besides the employees the customers are great!
bad,A typical day at work was busy because I was a cashier working with customer at all time. What I learned  for working for this job for 9 to 10 that hard work pays of if you put in the time and love what you do. In this job management was easy because I care to always make the customer happy. I work good with all my co-worker. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customer happy.
bad,We would meet at the delivery entrance and start unloading the trucks by hand.  After trailers were unloaded we had to stock the new products and then throw out Out Dated items.
bad,"Typical Day...you are the cashier, the person cleaning the bathrooms  and you might not leave until the next day. They are constantly moving new management in. Simply run. No breaks or lunches."
bad,Everyone worked part time and management was only full time employees.  Upper management had unrealistic expectations with little to no payroll given.
bad,"Pushing people to back problems and near death situations. A normal day in the DC I lift and stack over 5000+ boxes a day! Boxes that range from 1 pound to 250 pounds by myself!! As u watch 3 jampacked conveyer lines, u also have to load furniture and non-conveyable off carts that have no brakes. Management turns their heads to their employee's and the countless OSHA violations. Big lots DC only cares about the bottom dollar and not about the employee's that they have stretched thin. The company is a revolving door for regular employee's and temps. A warehouse that is state of the art from the outside is a logistics nightmare on the inside."
bad,"management at big lots is so unfair! you only get treated right if your pretty,young,and have a nice butt."
bad,"Big Lots started out good, but i did so much for them and they treated me Awful, i got held up on the job, they wouldnt even go to court with me. i was harassed by another employee and threated and they did nothing."
bad,"This company treats it's store personnel horribly! In my first week, as an Assistant Team Leader. I knew that this was not going to be a good experience. The Store Manager was very distant and barely spoke to me. I was one of the few males working in the store and it was very apparent that I was not apart of the group. The female management and associates hung out together outside of work. I was made you work every holiday and each time that I would ask for a day off it was denied."
bad,Sadly it  is all about making money with disregards to environmental hazards or employees health.  If you are wondering what is in your drinking water if you live locally. That site is a good place to start.
bad,The company is heading in a total different direction than what it was founded on. It is no longer a close out retailer and that has caused confusion upon customers and has contributed to the decline in customer traffic to the stores. It’s best to always have a 20% off coupon to use to help bring the prices in line with other retailers
bad,"Very rude managers, there was a lot of favoritism!  Ridiculous and not professional at how they spoke to me and other associates. I constantly got blamed for mistakes that were not in my control in FRONT of customers. Do not work here."
bad,"Overstaffed, no hours. Most weeks you only get 15 maybe 20 hours scheduled if you're lucky to get that much. There is no appreciation for good help. The only ones that mean anything is management. Other employees are treated poorly. Management is very unprofessional for the most part. They don't really care about medical conditions at all."
bad,I like working with people but it can be stressful because of the sign up's they want you to get. If you don't get them your hours go down. 8 to 12 hours a week on average. Great second job or good for retirees but not for someone to support a family or themselves.
bad,"Your typical dead end job with no room for advancement. As a cashier, (tasks are scarce)aside from promoting company programs, you'll mainly spend your time straightening fixtures over and over, sweeping the floor, cleaning the entrance windows and check-out area, business is usually slow with some days being fast paced. (At this particular location) management will talk negatively/unprofessionally/condescendingly about other associates in the office, there's strong favoritism -(certain associates can typically be found lounging in the office). It's overall been a neutral experience."
bad,"Ive been working at biglots a year and some change in furntiture department, organizing furniture warehouse, stocking, sales, delivery fulfillment, building, etc. And i get Payed the same as the cashier that been working here say like 3 or 4 months and some change  that just... cashiers. Big lots does not like giving raises to hard workers do not work here. Managers push me to makesales so that their lil bonus is bigher at the end of the month"
bad,Only had me work days to throw the truck at 9.50 n hr 8 hrs a week af taxes i ended up with 36 dollars after gas 16 after a pack of smokes and a drink maybe 4 dollars
bad,I got on at big lots as a cashier. Wanted to work full time was put on part time. Didn’t get any benefits no hours was fighting for hours. Was always getting carts or recovering shelve. Never ran registers always did most of the labor while everyone else messed around
bad,"Hate this job, i unload a truck and stock at 4am - 10am every thursday and friday with 3 people to unload 6 pallets of food, cleaning supplies, outdoor accessories, big furniture, etc, etc. The management thinks its possible to empty that truck with 3 people in 2 hours flat, we dont have automatic machinery to move these items quickly into the warehouse, we have a mobile metal belt we roll into the truck, what a joke, dont work here."
bad,Come in start to work. A job like this is a set pace. To operate the computer more quick. Manager was a sad for this job.Moving forward for advancement
bad,upper management does not follow through with communication with employees.  scheduled several meetings  and was told they would get back with me and never did.  I contacted HR upon leaving company and still cannot get contacted by them. I feel they are not transparent in how they treat employees or conduct business.
bad,no ability to make more then 13.50 hour. Most sales jobs offers an ability to make commision. not this one more like a basic retail job just with sales in your titlt.
bad,"Got hired on very quickly due to lack of current employees, management treated me like I was dumb. Asked to do certain tasks when no training for those specific tasks was ever provided, then told I wasn't doing it properly. I was here for an extremely short amount of time because the management did not make me feel welcome. The work is decent, but the way the supervisors organized and conducted everything made it seem like the tasks lasted forever with no rewarding feelings to follow."
bad,The hours are so inconsistent. The stocking process is a nightmare. Quantity is cared about so much more than quality and merchandise appearance. And the stocking during the store is open can be very frustrating and distracting as well.
bad,"Big Lots expects a lot from their enployees with little compensation. I have worked for the company for over a year, and only get paid minimum wage. The raises they give hardly make a difference in your paycheck. The majority of my shifts are 4 hours even though I have open availability, which is very annoying. Your hours arent guaranteed at Big Lots either."
bad,"The district manager has his favorites dont matter what you tell him he covered for his pets ,you can call hr all you want and  district manager would cover and nothing never done management was the worst."
bad,"Big Lots is very competitive. The managers don’t train you so you’re basically learning as you go. They get irritated when you ask for help. Barely get a break, and if you get one it’s very short and you can’t even use all of your time. Very rude and always try to force customers to sign up for stuff which can lead to bad customer service. Hated working here."
bad,"Big Lot's should paid more to employee, for thoses people like work part time this the place,employee there was great and learn lot about retail business"
bad,"-Big lots management often harass each other and employees, the level of respect of management to employees is ridiculous. "
bad,"They have the work but not the pay to offer. They go by the volume of the sale's. Love the facts you get paid every week and it's laid back but the job security you can't make a living off it , just a good part time ."
bad,Store manager retaliates like a child when upset. Other managers are amazing and hard working and easy to get along with but the store manager is the kicker.
bad,A lot of pressure is put on management in my particular store. 7 Store managers have failed in my current location. I have to work 6 days a week just to keep the business a float.
bad,"Great for job security... They don't allow you to have a balance life outside the job. A push down company, you idea don't matter."
bad,"Liked job, not hard work ,but they don't give any hours, I worked there five years, never late, no call in sick, worked  two shifts a week 6/10pm. grandson in college, need more hours then that. had years experience collection, would like to get back into that kind of job, if possible."
bad,"For a top 100 store in the company,  The objective of big lots is not to schedule you more than 20 hrs.  With a lot of people getting 8-12 hrs.  The store runs a skeleton crew at most times except if there is a big store ad or event.  Good first job or a job while you attend school.  Its no wonder the turnover for mgmnt is so high"
bad,"I opened and closed my store. I worked in New Philadelphia, Ohio for the first 2 years. Then when I moved to Arizona, I became Assistant Manager. I would open and close again. This time I was in charge with all office protocol. All the invoices, accounts payable, receiving, merchandise ordering, Plan-o-gram's, inventory control, schedules, payroll, received all truck deliveries, and literally receiving the merchandise of 20-25 couch's at the back door."
bad,"I would arrive to work and walk through the store to the back to put my belongings away, then go back up to the crowded register and clock in. I would go around zoning and cleaning isles until my manager would come up and tell me my duties, i would do everything perfect and always show up on time and was never praised. All of the employees disliked and feared the Store Manager because he never credited us for anything or showed us kindness. I would be so bored I would do other peoples jobs like money deposits and count drawers and a lot of other things I shouldn't have because we were under-staffed. Then when my time to go home came around I would finish all my duties and beyond and go clock out and hope no one sees me."
bad,"I am  the type of person to ""want"" to help the customer even  if they say ""oh you don't have to"", but then I insist & say ""But you are the customer & that is my job ""to help you & want to help you."" :) !!"
bad,"Lack of training for new management, existing management in store has no work ethic and they hate new hires. They want to maintain a ""family"" atmosphere. They want to work the hours they mandate to management. They call HR open line on a daily basis, stories are made up and they get several employees to back up the stories. They have lost 3 managers in the last 2 years and they need to look at the employees that are behind the problems of the store. The assistant manger wants to be the manager she has no management background, and only works when it benefits her. She can not produce the merchandise to the sales floor, except when she wants to. If a visit from upper management is expected she drags her feet and has 70 -85 pallets of merchandise backed up in the receiving department. This is how she has pushed the past managers out the door. She is vindictive and a person that should never be in charge of anything. She let's the associates work the schedule of their choice. She takes them out to eat regularly to keep them on her team. She will never work with a new manager, and she still believes she will be the manager."
bad,"Great discount on items when your employee, store needs an upgrade and new management but overall staff was awesome to work with"
bad,"If you're at a furniture store, you hand load customers purchases into their vehicles. Make a $1500.00 sale, you load it. Then D.M. wonders why there are weeds in the cracks in the sidewalk."
bad,"The store manager is very rude, and very strict. She is OK when it comes to scheduling, but she's very condescending in person. The assistant store manager should be the head store manager because she actually knows how to run a store."
bad,Store manager liked to play favorites. He never trained me or tried to prepare me for what I had to do. He criticized me for my work and work that wasnt even mine. Not a good leader.
bad,I only received a maximum of 12 hours per week!!! After the holiday season I only would receive 3-5 hours per week and they would offer more hours if someone called out which isn’t even enough for gas. They continued to hire more people when the current staff hardly received hours. Management showed huge amounts of favoritism as you could see by the schedule. Hiring process was also very uno
bad,The company has taken an unfortunate direction under the new CEO. Mass lay-offs throughout the company included employees with 25+ years working for Big Lots. The company continues to bleed talent as job uncertainty and lack of faith in management has caused additional employees to seek opportunities elsewhere.
bad,You won't get more than 30 hours per week.... ever. Unless you're management. That's for the sole purpose of not having to give they're employees any benefits.
bad,"Only worked here for about a week, spanning 2 pay periods. When I didn't get paid on the first payday I quit. I got paid for the hours I worked in the second pay period, although I was paid a dollar less than the rate I was hired in at. Still have not been paid for 10 hours that I worked in the first pay period. Needless to say I HIGHLY encourage you to look elsewhere for employment."
bad,"the work is easy but the politics not so much, need to be able to lift 50 pounds as well as be able to merchandise new inventory to product standards. The give very little training so you must be able to learn things very quickly."
bad,"No one looks out for each other, management wise. You have to always look over your shoulder.  Going to work at  Big Lots is always wondering who is going to stab you in the back?"
bad,"This is very easy. ATLM and the DTSL are the 2 worst positions you can have. Your responsible for everything from -prepping for the truck, to unloading and organizing in the back room.  Have a plan to get it to the sales floor and stocked in 2 days. Can it be done... Sure.. If you have the right people when your hired. if not... your screwed. Ask at the interview. how many exployees, how long have they been doing the truck.  And DTSL how long, and does she know what she is doing, cause me didn't know a darn thing, dumb as mud."
bad,"This company consistently asks for more from its employees while simultaneously cutting available resources to complete task. For example, as a manger I was allowed to use 200 hours for my stockers (per company policy) to empty the warehouse. Was given less than 125 hours to complete the job. When the job was still completed, the following week hours were cut below 100. This was consistently done for the 1 years  I worked there."
bad,"The management at Big Lots is incompetent, be ready to perform the work of 3 employees and then be told that you didn't do enough. I was a Furniture Sales Associate and would  sometimes meet weekly sales quotas in a single day, only to be berated by my manager in front of customers for selling furniture instead of cleaning the store at 3pm in the afternoon. "
bad,I was averaging about 18-20 hours  That still not very mush on $8 an hour. they hired for the season dropping my hours  left me with 8 hrs last week. you dont cut hours during the holidays
bad,"They clam they don't have favorites but in reality they do. As long ask you wait on them hand and foot they are good, but if they make a mistake its fine but if you make one they are all over you no matter how hard you work."
bad,"I spent nearly 5 years with this company, worked my way into management after my first 2 years of being a part time associate.  I received little to no training for my leadership position in both locations that I worked at.  I had filed several grievances about internal theft, incompetence, discrimination, and all they did was give me a pay raise for my troubles without ever resolving the issues."
bad,for the most part i liked the job. it was hard to ajust there because of a couple of employees. i feel the company does not care for there employess. i have been there 6 mon. and still no 90 day review and i still only make 8 dollars hr.
bad,"Not a Long term Job when you think you have a great place to work and you think your going to advance ! If you don't click with your store manger who try's and run the store picks his nose and eats on the sales floor.And talks about his employees that he likes behind there back,It gets old quick. Upon taking a promotion to another store i was told when i got there i wasn't welcome and was told i would be fired and i was over stupid childish stuff.There was no control of associates  if i was offered to go back i wouldn't"
bad,Good if all you want is part time and low pay. I've worked there for about 2 1/2 months and I've barley got up to 29 hours a week. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who actually needs work but for someone who has a tight schedule this would be a good job
bad,this company does not really care about work/life balance. they will schedule you to work late and then schedule for early shifts the very next day. They run a skeleton crew all day long during operation
bad,"Big lots does not offer enough hours. Does not offer any benefits. From working at big lots I learned how to be a furniture associate, how to stock shelves, and unloading trucks."
bad,"Culture was unprofessional, unethical and cutthroat. No sense of team. Very little value in most responsibilities."
bad,The previous DM for the Houston area was awesome and really made me feel that I made a difference and always listened to what I had to say even though he couldn't change the company culture. When he left the RM went down in position to replace him everything changed and I became invisible. I don't know what happened but over 4k employees lost their jobs.
bad,"Simply just stay away and never trust no one.Your own district stores never have your back.No budget,no help,no bonuses.Work life balance was horrible"
bad,No room for advancement. They don’t care about you. The dm is always rude and don’t care about anybody. They expect you to do a job of everybody. Just poor environment.
bad,the work was really easy but the management sucks. The promotions aren't based on your work performance it's based on who your friends with. When you work hard it's a problem they want lazy people just like them!!
bad,Worked at big lots for about a year and a half. My store manager constantly sexually harasses any female in the building and when reported to hr they take forever to get back to you and when you report retaliation they basically tell you to go F*** yourself. Never bringing business here again or supporting the corporate policies & butt buddy club.
bad,"Like the crew and 2 leads , not alot of hrs to give, very pushy by a lead yelled at you constantly... I left do to racists remarks said to me didn't make you feel welcomed."
bad,"Worked at Big Lot's for over a year, including stocking, cashier and unloading the truck. There is absolutely no consistency whatsoever in the hours you work and the schedule is put out only one week in advanced every Saturday (For example if you are scheduled to work on Sunday you'll only know less then 24 hours in advanced) One week you may be scheduled for 25 hours and the next you may be given only 5 hours with no advanced notice..This happens across the store for ALL the employee's except management (Which are the only full time positions available)"
bad,Had a good time working there.  Management was very good and fellow employees were pleasant and helpful.  Lack of hours was the only reason I chose to leave.
bad,"Consider I was working their as the management, I was in all aspects of the operations from open to close. I learned a lot about the operations of the retail world."
bad,"Can be an ok place to work unless you have a bad store manager.  In my district, the District Manager has favorites, therefore there is no accountability for the manager that is a favorite. Manager is often not productive  and sits in the office.  The new computer scheduling system is supposed to be better if used, but manager make changes to schedule according to their personal life and not what's best for business, and this is never addressed or enforced. There is no type of rotating  schedule. Also assistants have to work what they are scheduled, and the store manager has a schedule, but comes in whatever time they want to, usually 1-2 hrs late if they want to. I feel company no longer values their employees, this  is evident by low pay raises, extended holiday hours, unconcerned about employee safety. Don't waste you time with this company like I have."
bad,Its an ok job if you want to earn some fun money.but if you need to keep a roof over your families head don't waste your time. The upper management is a joke and elitist. They crave to have their egos stroked after 3 years of of beyond dedicated service to them being denied benefits and promotions I an happily moving on
bad,Was pretty good place if you were looking for short hours all you do is unload trucks and stock shelves . fill out inventory sheets pretty standard stuff
bad,"Selfish, good if you don't want a life,They use and abuse you. I busted my butt for years and was moved around from store to store cleaning up everyone elses mess. Drove all over the state and did special projects, prepared stores for inventory, and for executive visits. No one cared that I was transferred to another dump (which still makes up over 60% of their stores) and they would bust my chops during a visit. Since they cannot retain good people, I always had a new management crew which I was expected to train because their training is....WHAT TRAINING?? So I worked 70-80 hour weeks and all they did is bust my nuts during a visit. As for the HR department, the were more like a Hang the GM department because there was no ""regional support"" from the ficticious regional support team. This was the best job I ever had in the beginning until they began to micromanage everything without ever being on the firing line to see what it's really like. They cut payroll so bad that the manager on duty has to ring register all day, handle all vendor receivables, receive furniture deliverirs, and cover breaks. I walked into a Yougut store and thay had more associates than my payroll allowed. My advice to you is that eventually this company will build such a negative reputation that they will be the highest paying retailer in the industry, but beware the pay will be coming off your store payroll budget. Prepare to ring register all day. Good luck!! "
bad,Company does not give enuff hours and work force to fully stock the store. . Sometimes they send to much merendise to the store overload the wherehouse ( toojamed packed).
bad,Worst company I have worked for. Lack of people and underpaid for the work. Management was great except Wade he didn't know what he was doing and was always angry.
bad,I worked at Big Lots for six months and over the six months I worked there I was belittled and talked down to. The management is mean and they complain about how nothing is getting done but they are either taking a smoke break every ten minutes or in the office their entire shift. If you want to feel like you’re stupid work here.
bad,i don't know if other stores are like the one i work at but the pay is alright the problem is there is no real hours in a week for my position i'd be lucky if i even get 10 hours in a week. we do get a discount and we get payed every week. i think most of the people in the store are good and kind people. i can only recommend taking this job if you don't have monthly bills to pay
bad,Big Lots treats its employees as if they are disposable. There are unrealistic expectations and even managers are considered to be disposable. You are expected to be willing to stab fellow employees in the back.
bad,"My days of work become stressful by rude customers."
bad,"I worked at Big Lots for 1 year as an Assistant Manager. The management had worked at the store for more than 5 years and were not very welcoming to a new employee. I did the hiring and was told by the store manager that I was spending too much time with new hires. She also told me not to show the training videos to the new hires because it took up too much of her payroll. She also told me that I shouldn't have hired a young lady because she was pregnant. Unloading the weekly truck was awful! The store manager only scheduled 3 of us to unload the 52 ft trailer. She wanted it done in 4 hours while she knew I had a bad back and one of the other 2 had an enjured arm. Knowing this, the store manager kept scheduling the same 3 of us every week. When I would close the store I would leave a detailed note of what was going on and none of the other managers gave me the same courtesy. The district manager didn't visit the store as often as he probably should have. The other managers did what ever they wanted."
bad,Being on work on time .Learing new skills Getting the work done .and allways do your workkeep the good work up get alone with other people do you own work paid attention to your work know what u ate doing
bad,"Job is fine. Not difficult. It's just if you're not management you don't get many hours, or any benefits or vacation time. As little as 4 hours or up to 29 hours max. Get ready to take a 2nd job if you have rent and/or bills to pay."
bad,"New chance was made and I completely have to structure of the company."
bad,They often mess up on your pay check management is clueless about their role within the department & they demand perfection but dont give it in return
bad,i was a cashier i rung up items and bagged up customers i also was a floor associate and stocked shelves. I also helped with furniture between split shifts.
bad,"Less payroll hours than any company I've ever worked with.  Terrible logistics,  bad pay, not open to any suggestions,  overall  burn and churn retail.  Very good benefits.  Leaving soon"
bad,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with but there are a few things that just don't make sense to me. The scheduling is quite last minute, you may not received your schedule for Sunday(the following week) until the DAY BEFORE which is a big issue for making transportation arrangements as well as appointments. Also, 2 weeks over the course of working there less than a month I was only scheduled 8 HOURS which is ridiculous considering the fact that I have been a Key Holder previously. I genuinely feel that I have down graded and I'm pretty disappointed. I am currently investing my time looking for a Full-Time job in replacement of this one."
bad,Well didn't like working here no good service. Staff is not organized managers always come wit an attitude. Hours is always moved around or changed with out notice .
bad,The manager at the Tiffin store micro managed everything.  Showed favoritism and spent too much time in the office. No communication at all and was very condescending to everyone.
bad,I would never commit to a biglots again. Either work or personal shopping business. They have horrible management skills and very poor leadership skills.
bad,"Bad management "
bad,Management needs to treat employees as an asset instead of talking down and making them feel like their always replaceable .they need to follow schedule practice.
bad,The first job I had where I moved up. Was a good experience to become familiar with invoicing and keeping inventory in a structured environment.  Would recommend.
bad,Store manager pretty much spoke to you like as if you’re a child and pretty much they were always on your back about doing your job when none of the managers really did anything and one would be to overwhelmed with multitasking that she would give you attitude and yell at you. I am definitely happy I got out
bad,"I'm a 50 year old woman. They bring in young kids and have them do very unsafe work practices. Not giving them equipment need to perform the job safely (example : ladder, cart).When I confronted them about it they because very angry. A member of management was sexually harassing the young girls. When I wouldn't lie for the management upper management became very angry."
bad,Very poor management I wanted a certain shift because I know I couldn’t do the one they gave me and they was okay with it at first then still gave me that shift when I couldn’t work it I was very polite about it so they put me down as terminated
bad,"They start everyone at Part-Time & the pay is not enough to support yourself. I let them know that I had some back problems, but I was still put in situations & made to do task that were not suitable for me."
bad,A typical day of work is doing what you can without any guidance or training. The hardest part of the job was the complete lack of communication and explanation for any and all tasks.
bad,"The company doesn't know how to properly run a store, and then blame cashiers for the management issues. Products they sell are terrible and the aggravation from the customers when they have to return the items is not worth minimum wage."
bad,I was told that overnights were to only last for 2 weeks. I left after 4 months of overnights. Management didn't communicate very well. Getting a day off you requested was a joke.
bad,"When I was employed..  I never got more than 15 hrs a week..  Most hours we're divided up between managers and cashiers. In my eyes,  all hours should be divided equally between regular employees if you want a fair working environment."
bad,Nobody knew what anybody was doing manages didn't communicate with each other or other employees things were done wrong because nobody was telling others what needed to be done. I won't even shop there
bad,"I worked in Stock at the Durant DC for almost 7 years, I can tell about alot of things, for one thing it's just a job not a career no room for advancement, it is labeled as unskilled labor, that means a monkey can do what they do. I'm just glad we moved to Tennessee and now I work for the Tennessee wildlife resource agency and I have a real career operating heavy equipment helping build fish hatchery ponds."
bad,"this is not a company that treat it workers fair"
bad,"I loved the people I worked with, but it wasn't a job I'd keep. All the work and not enough pay. They will make you bend backwards and pay you minimum wage."
bad,Another over worked and under paid and under appreciated job. The company does not show any care for it's employees at all. I cannot count how many times I got a knife in the back.
bad,"Grueling manual labor at minimum wage. No chance at advancement. Hours were all over the place in terms of the number of hours you were able to work, there was never enough to make a decent living. Managers would literally stand around and eat candy while you worked, and became hostile if you had to ask a question to gain knowledge or complete a task."
bad,the hours are not where they need to be. the pay rate of the job could be better. also the management was terrible no one has a knowledge of the inventory.
bad,I really didn't like working at big lots because the managers would criticize how I would do my job. I didn't feel appreciated whatsoever. The lines were always long. Manager didn't do bbc.co his job well
bad,This job is not all that great the hours are always different the pay was not all that great you could not get overtime and the manager was very unprofessional
bad,had 2 interviews the main manager ask me offensive questions said he would get back to me one way or another nevar did. Bad management.
bad,"Long hard hours, poor compensation for the amount of work being done. High Turnover. Flexible hours is a plus for the students"
bad,"This is a job for kids in the summer or older retired  people that need something to do, they only give 25 hours a week if that but shopping wise it's cheaper then a lot of other places"
bad,this was a short term job. I don't remember much about the place. I do remember that coworkers were nice. boss sat around and ordered everybody to do things he wouldn't do himself
bad,"I enjoy the the vibe I have with my co-workers, however; the line of work does not do anything to aid me in finding a job in my field of study."
bad,"Horrible workplace, would not ever recommend to anyone. Management is a joke."
bad,The job was OK but the manager was racist towards black people and always rewarded his own race
bad,"This is not fair and unjustice management. Too many managers. One associate manager will force you to work hard to death, giving more works not equall to others. Descrimintion always prevail. If she thinks you are not the fighter one, more work for you. But if she thinks you are a fighter, she is scared to force you even she knew you are lazy. Do you think, this is fair?"
bad,The most joyful part of the job is meeting new guests everyday helping customer find what they need to make sure they’re happy every time they leave out
bad,I worked here 2 months. Two months of the worst job ever. I will never recomed working here to anyone. The company as a whole just isn't that well put together the whole system is flawed and we just tried too hard to be good. My coworkers did nothing but talk bad about each other and never followed rules. Management is very unprofessional. They favored their employees and allowed their favorites to break rules. They also were very immature about everything. I can't even describe how awful this place is to work.
bad,"No work life balance, work load was unrealistic to complete. The store structure was not set up to succeed in realistic terms, rather in a drawn out perfect world scenario.."
bad,"I love this job, it's fun , customers are friendly and they expect good service with a smile.I have learned to be careful and pay attention to your surroundings.Always make sure you count the money back to the customer as to not over charge or under change yourself.My coworkers were great and friendly.My job was overall pretty great."
bad,It was a good job if you like a laid back work environment but the hours are not good. The schedule would come out the day it was over and you could not plan ahead.
bad,I had learn lot working there at big lots they take the time to show u what u need to do clean and nice and I had a real good manger the show u how to do things
bad,Favoritism plays a huge role in hourly wages. You will be passed over for promotion because of favoritism.  The managers won’t move for an override which leads to complaints.
bad,Always had excellent reviews. Still have them. Just needed more hrs at that time. Great worker. Always on time. Never missed work. Worked various departments.
bad,"My review is 1 being the lowest score possible.The worst retail company I ever worked for.I worked for them 1.5 years.It was ok when I started,but the manager left,the assistant managers left,the district manager left and very under professional management there now. They change your schedule and don't tell you when it's changed from the original schedule ,no team work,a large furniture truck comes in ,well your on you unload it most time by yourself when I asked for help with other associates there,was told not there job,most managers walk around on there cell phones all day"
bad,Working at Big Lots does teach you everything you need for retail but the pay is very bad and it does not balance the labor that you have to put in. So I say working at Big Lots is not good.
bad,This job is low paying for all the work that you do you’re extremely overworked and stressed out Through the day.  It seems the days get worse Here...
bad,Manager was always talking about firing becaude we cant force people to use there big pots rewards look up. And we couldnt force them to sign up for big lots credit cards.
bad,"Not enough sales floor associates, to much work for a single person to do, no appreciation for those that actually do their job, playing favorites with those that do not work, promote those who do the work, "
bad,The manager does not know how to accommodate to a persons schedule and punishes you by giving you the most less hours I’ve ever worked in my history of 30 years working retail and as a stocker . He lets the same people get away with calling out every day and keeps them hired and the one time that I as a hard working mom called out for something real he punished me again by calling me out in front of the huddle and scheduled me even less . I feel like I was slapped in the face for putting the extra effort into my work and was always being micro managed at stuff I already knew how to do and this is why there was a high turnover because of the manager who lies and takes credit for ideas I had to work smarter not harder in addition watching us and spying on our every move and making me and other people uncomfortable!
bad,"Overnight stocker waited for the shipment and only had 4 hours to stock everything. Poor working conditions, staff was nice and so was the supervisor."
bad,unloading trucks are strenuous and demanding here they're to demanding on how you set boxes on pallets. They don't properly train. The hours are unbelievably inconsistent and management flirts to much.
bad,"Overall, the  work experience depends on  Store Management  at the store your working in.  Management is key in any work environment and when you don't feel welcomed or appreciated it's a very big drawback.  I hate to sound so negative but, I'm being honest.  They expect way too much for the hours and pay rate they offer."
bad,"Managers don't communicate with eachother , It's an entire mess to work for . No one knows what they are supposed to do until they arrive to work. Pay too low for everything they want you to do"
bad,I'd to reset several aisles a day. I love to assist with the customers and check them out. I learned about the merchandise and aisles as I took returns back.
bad,"Big lots tries to compete with bigger stores like target and Walmart so they want employees to get a certain percentage on sales, credit cards, and rewards cards sign up. I ask everyone about those sales and when the customer says no. That’s a no. Big lots wants you to force it on them and that leads to bad customer service. I would work at 4 in the morning expected to unload boxes like I was a machine or a superhuman.  Not to mention getting paid minimum wage for getting up early in the morning to break my back and be getting paid the same as the time old ladies that don’t do much besides cashier. Truly upsetting. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. They ask for too much for minimum wage."
bad,Great job if you love back breaking labor having to lift 300 lbs on your own because  there is no team work or any type of management  with leadership  skills only plus side they offer great insurance  when you hurt yourself  and have to see a doctor dont expect  much in the pay department  with there sad wages making about 360 a week after taxes wouldn't recommend  this job to anyone unless they are desperate
bad,A few key things that make this job difficult is tha lack of leadership from management. The hours are bearable but it is truly difficult to get 40hrs a week
bad,Awful honestly. Just got out of there recently with very bad memories of the job. Coworkers and some management were decent people but management in general was awful for the environment.
bad,Managers dont care they  dont do nothing when employees harass other employees. pay sucks pay raises are a joke   they are not a good place to work no one stays  some of the workers are nice but management sucks big time!!!!
bad,company does not offer any kind of advancement and pay raise is not even a option. have to deal with management that does what ever they please when the please.
bad,"Working for Big Lots is ok for someone who is school or just need a part time job. No benefits, the management is not together and the pay is not good at all."
bad,Working at Big Lots was enjoyable and pleasing. I was a cashier/stocker. It was my first job working with a cash register which I learned quick thanks to the employees.
bad,There never seems to be hours but they're always short-handed. Everyone seems out-going and then there's managers letting their personal lives affect their job and they'd make me feel awkward. The store has new management and they can't seem to hire people who know how to be efficient and competent. New management seems oblivious to hiring addicts and people with no work ethic. This store could be a lot better with more direction and less drama.
bad,Wasn't my favorite job at all. Customers were always so rude and they were mostly elderly so I took it for as long as I could. Everyday there was a problem working at this small place of employment.
bad,"I did not enjoy this job at all, unfriendly customers and management was never helpful in anything. No benefits. just an overall bad experience."
bad,Biglots repeatedly violates work laws and there own rules and policy's with out regards to workers they fire people with tenner so they can replace with temps they are micromanagers and don't care if you are injured because they will refuse to pay and drag any and all out till the person is unable to keep the fight going or starve todeath
bad,"I was hired for recovery. most times I had to just assume what departments I was responsible for.  then later to find out I was needed else where.  "
bad,"I started in the store when it first opened up. I was given full time hours, until the store was completed. Then more people where hired and my hours where 3 a week..Thanks for showing your loyal crew where to go..."
bad,"This company has such a big name. Its just disappointing that they are a terrible workplace .No management style, People are confused on what their job is. They pay poorly and not good benefits."
bad,The manager would not make the male workers do any stocking of the selves he would make the females do it. But other than that I loved meeting and seeing new people each and every day
bad,Long hours and not enough pay for the hours worked.  If you have a good staff to back you it keeps you sane.
bad,Big Lots seems to hire ANYBODY to manage their stores. I cant wait until i find another job! The only thing I like about this job is weekly pay & cheap prices. & also the pay... Most of us were started off with $7.50 - $8 hourly... new people are coming in getting $8.75 and they dont even show up to work!
bad,it was nice having a hands on job but the pay was not worth all of the work that you do
bad,"I worked for this company very briefly. This place was unorganized, there was no communication, and there was hardly any hours available. Once I became pregnant, I addressed my manager with my concerns, she then scheduled me to work nights and unload trucks, so I left."
bad,"The company will use you for their needs and toss you aside afterwards. Will hire ""temporary employees"" only to keep them on after the remodel and cut everyone's hours."
bad,"I did not really spend much time working there but the little experience was worth for me. It was a relaxed pace environment, friendly staff and customers."
bad,Assistant Manager didn't know what he was doing.  Head cashier had no clue how to do her job.  Terrible pay.  Assistant Manager didn't allow associates to help wanted to do everything himself.  Didn't trust his workers.
bad,"Low pay, low hours, management is terrible. Unless you want an EXTREMELY part time job in a stressful environment, I'd stay away. They are literally scheduling people for 6-10 hours per week. What is the point of that? I'd be gone from work for days and someone in management would still blame any issues in my ""section"" on me. I work 8 hours a week, I don't know why these items are in the wrong spot. Favoritism galore in that place. They treat you like a criminal, they want to check everyone's bag before they leave work for the day..even though they already have cameras everywhere."
bad,"This company takes advantage of it's employees by over working them and under paying them. Management is very slack,and often missing in action when customers need them."
bad,"I loved to unload the trucks, I helped stock product."
bad,Hated working here because the organization as a whole is on the decline. Would not recommend working here unless you want to be miserable waking up and going to work daily.
bad,"Poor management, some managers are better and more helpful than others but as whole it’s not great. Several employees are allowed to bully and/or discriminate against fellow employees without being reprimanded. The work environment isn’t ideal at all. I also know of a few other fellow employees who tried their best to work their way up and were tossed aside even though they continued to go above and beyond and reach amazing goals much hire than much of the management team. I definitely don’t recommend as a permanent position."
bad,The job was good and co-workers were nice. The manager didn't really listen that much. I kept asking for more hours and they'd give it to others. I worked 4 hours a week.
bad,"Typical day for me was constant  movement, taking initiative to improve display of products. I learned valid complaints were ignored (for improving the store and reported employees who were not doing there own jobs correctly). Learned raises ""NOT based on work at all, but customer treatment"", as TOLD by mgmt at my review. Deep sighs EACH time you call in sick resulting in guilt. Same amt of raise each yr, 24 cents. Learned that corporate raised wages from the very minimum to $8 per hour, not store mgr.  Mgmt. not always readily available when needed. Learned mgmt. believed, trusted even dishonest, disgruntled customers instead of loyal employees. Being treated differently than long term employees. One could not trust other long term employees for honesty, real friendliness or personal stories. These attempts at making friends resulted in more gossip and falsehoods spread to others, including mgmt. All this combined made for a very hard job, a hostile work environment, very uncomfortable, which should have been enjoyable and pleasant. I was criticized at every point and had NO ""pats on the back"" for a job well done in the almost 3 yrs. of employment. No compliments, no rewards. At least I knew I was doing an outstanding job. I enjoyed and was very good at my job, excellent at working alone and also with a team. I went above and beyond and they knew it, but without any acknowledgement, the exception being when I was in the hospital for 4 days in 2017 and the store mgr. said to me ""Man, did WE miss YOU!""  Missed me so much, they fire me for being sick, working sick! The day I left"
bad,It was very slow there with almost nothing to do.. time goes by so slow plus the pay was not enough with just standing the mentally going crazy with nothing to do
bad,No home life. No hours to give so will live at store. Thank god they sell beds. Higher management hard to get answers from or directions from. No full time employees so average 5-10 hours a week for part time.  20% discount is nice. Its decent job but not worth the headache. Extremely high turnover for management and associates.
bad,was most of the time but managment was so unfair not enough hours only when managers needed help you got hours store manager was always late to open when asspciates were on time
bad,"I believe this company would be okay to work for if they would have a different Manager, and better more constant hours, some people cant survive off of 16 hours."
bad,I have been getting only 4 hours a week since sometime in June when my schedule got messed up by management. I have had a hard time talking with management to train me on register position where I was promised to be a few weeks after I started the job.
bad,"I worked for Big Lots for 2 years and was robbed at gun point. I had to go through the whole nine yards in identifying the suspect. Not once did anyone from management reach out to me and ask how I was doing, there was no day off but the thing that bothered me the most was even before we got robbed other staff members and myself and told management about how dangerous it was and how we had people coming into the store threatening the employee's, stealing and even at one point one of the people who stole from the store on a regular basis even hit an employee and never once did the district manager get security for the store. Big Lots makes all this money but does not care about the safety of their employees who put their life on the line just to come to work."
bad,its not a good place to work and there is no hours there and the different adjudicate there are a mess. everybody is not on the same page there and poor management there
bad,"No room for full time no benefits only part time."
bad,"Big Lots Store #00451"
bad,Management micromanages its staff to death. Dirty and dingy. Very loud and dangerous place to work. No one pays attention when driving their lift machines.
bad,"I start my day i would unload the truck and stock the shelves before store opened. after store opened i would count my drawer and make sure the money was right, i would then clean up the the store."
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for. Absolutely no professionalism within the management team. Bad work hours, nasty bathrooms. I deserved to be on commission, I sold a lot of furniture for the Boone NC store. I never received a bonus and definitely no thanks for a good job. For holidays when we worked, we received cold pizza,YUM!"
bad,Management is very snooty torwards associates at times. Also lacks in certain Interpersonal skills with associates.
bad,safety was horrible there. it was there way or no way. management knew of problems and just over looked them. management was also very hard to find when a problem arise.
bad,"Learning how to cashier and do recovery, go backs, answer phone, making announcements on pa system, cleaning & stocking bathrooms, cleaning throughout the store, getting carts, helping customers take product to there car, and more. My Managers are not very good. My coworkers are amazing , helpful, kind , understanding, I have nothing bad to say about my coworkers. The hardest part of my job is management not trusting there employees and helping them with there job like there suppose to. Getting to know people and my coworkers better."
bad,"At Big Lots it was pretty simple and easy going. Customers come and go. On the other hand working as a cashier was great, meeting new people and you never know who your going to run across either friends or family. It was just great overall working in a workplace filled with positive co-workers."
bad,I worked 5+ years. Was treated bad by district manager. Got fired over nothing. Was a great place to work at first and then it all went down from there
bad,"A typical day at work involved running the day to day operations."
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had. I worked at Big Lots for over 2 years and it was a dead end. Management doesn't care if you're in the hospital, they still want you to come to work, and oh yeah, be prepared to get yelled at 100% of the time. Most of the time, it's only 1 cashier.  So say good bye to your 15 minute break,  bathroom break and everything in between. Customers will yell at you because the line is so long, and management never wants to help.  I once was yelled at because i was wearing my sweater in the winter, but still had my badge/tag on, but was told to take it off because, ""customers didn't know I worked there"". Excuse me?! I'm the only cashier here, do they think someone just walked in and started checking out people????!!?!! PS. my manager didn't allow a heater."
bad,"At the beginning this job was awesome, I learned the logistics of the company. Organizing aisles, making pallets and such. The assistant managers liked my work. Then when the Manager came to work he would talk to us in the worst manner, he was rude, and was not appreciative of our work."
bad,The owner doesn't seem to know how to operate a company as he threatens his team a lot with termination if goals aren't met.
bad,Co-workers and management are nice people to work with.  Upper management consistently cutting work hours.  Managers only work full time with benefits. They hire a lot of employees to work less than 25 hours a week so they don't have to pay for benefits.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate customers and not all the products can be scanned without having prices on them.
bad,No internal growth promotes from out side of company. Will run you under staffed on manager and expect you to work 18 hour days to cover the shifts.
bad,"Cashiers and stock personnel make the same pay, did not keep word of pay raise for all of us after 90 days. They keep cutting back our hours.Working about 12 hrs a week some people 4-5 at barely over minimum wage, does not support a family unless your a manager working 40plus hrs a week, getting $3,000 to $8,000 just in quarterly bonuses, off of other peoples hard work might I add. I'm thankful to be employed,when I started I was working close to 30hrs. a week, at least then the paycheck was worth it. I am a stock person making $8.00 an hour to pull heavy pallets,lift and move heavy boxes, Hurry Hurry Hurry to get merchandise up, 5 or more pallets in 5 hours? Cashiers stand around gossiping, ringing sales for the same pay!? Not reasonable,rational or fair. We are after all human beings not machines."
bad,"Understaffed, overworked and unappreciated.. Safety is not considered important when it comes to 2 people in the store and a product to help load that could weigh up to 600 lbs.  The company has changed their focus to strictly a care of money."
bad,"job started well but people were somewhat pushy and became rude and irritable at times. hours were cut and eventually I had been laid off, for the claim that after the remodel of the store, the hour quotas were cut by half and they had to drop employees"
bad,They don't train people very well but at the same time expect you to know how to do everything. It makes you feel like your being thrown to the wolves. In the 3 yrs I've worked there they have gone through at least 6 or 7 managers and twice that in regular employees. It just makes you feel sad to see them go especially when its someone that's been there 20+ years.
bad,"Might have been just  the one i worked at. It wasnt will manage at all. No onw was really trained.  You got one  day of training which was  watching someone  else do the work without  really explaining anything. Learning  the whole store while expected to do go backs and  help customers. If you tried to ask a question, you could tell the other  employee would be annoyed."
bad,"The work was easy, management was just horrible. Expected you to know things you weren't trained to do. Little to no help from other employees. Over all just a negative work space."
bad,I started working at big lots as a stocker and I loved it! But as soon as the new management took over she had a chip on her shoulder when it came to me. I came in one day and all of a sudden I was a cashier.. No notice.. No warning.. Nothing. I thought it was just crosstraining until a new girl showed up doing MY JOB AND MAKING MORE THAN ME!!
bad,"put out sales adds, put furniture together, lifted, stocked, and carried out furniture to customers sometimes no help. lifting mattresses and box springs over your head. dangerous. lifting tv stands straight off the floor. does not have a concern for your well being."
bad,"Horrible management and other employees were lazy. Most of the work was left to me and I got scolded for taking too long to complete tasks. However if you were to walk in today, the management has highly improved and cleaned house. They have updated the store nicely. Much needed improvement, I was highly impressed. I would consider working there again under the new management."
bad,"i liked to work at big lots, but the lack of hours was hard for me to continue to work for them, because i had to pay bills and couldnt with the hours i was given."
bad,You get paid minimum wage to do everything in the store. Get offers higher positions then give them to someone else. Not worth all the hard work for just enough money to pay for gas to get you there. Some  management was inappropriate.
bad,"Two out of four managers treated you with kindness , this is coming from more than one source . Hours are low , you're lucky to get more than 20 a week. Easy job , for closing and opening . It's very slow and fast paced . They use the same mop to clean the store as they do the bathroom , which is gross."
bad,"I started not to long ago and its a job for the most part. I stocked shelves,unloaded trucks, hauled furniture so far. they really just put me on the floor on the first day. I dont think it was worth the rate of pay to work there even tho i was part time. Management wasnt really around and didnt help moving furniture or anything. I definitely dont plan on staying long and will pursue another job somewhere else. Its easy if youre looking for part time and not looking for a living wage, you wont get it here at Big Lots. The store where i worked at offered me plenty of hours but i declined as unloading trucks and stocking was brutal enough for the low wage."
bad,"typically start at 3 or 4 in the morning which is when Big Lots stocks their aisles. Needing to work, I accepted the position. Management trained me to stock the aisles, but reduced my hours when they thought I stocked too slowly."
bad,"9 to 11  hr. day with no gratitude for caring"
bad,"seasonal part time recovery and cashier"
bad,"Poor management no pay increase, long hours with no advancement and micro management in the work place. Working here is good for the discounts, not a career move."
bad,"The job title says, ""Store Associate/Stocker"" but in actuality, you'll be spending most of your days cashiering.  Very rarely are you granted a chance to reshop items and fix/stock the shelves, which makes answering customer questions difficult when you aren't familiar with the store layout and items carried.  If you're new, you'll be left at the registers by yourself very frequently, which is offputting."
bad,The managers sit and talk about you all day but want you to do their work. The only time they pretend to do their job is when the district manager is there. Too much laziness favoritism attitude.
bad,The store stinks the managers are not friendly they act like the hate their job I don’t recommend a teenager or a newbie to the work force apply there
bad,the job will over work and not count all your hours. make you work In unworkable conditions. you are worked to death for short hours and pay. and have short or no brakes.
bad,"The rules are of utmost importance,  except for when they inconvenience whoever has to deal with the paperwork, and management talks down about other managers,  which I find extremely unprofessional,  regardless of what I feel personally, which I keep to myself."
bad,I worked here for almost a year. I was injured in a NON work related event. My manager refused to allow me time off to recover and let me go since I was unable to heal within the 3 days. I had a sever back injury. Terrible management. Still notice the same when I shop there even.
bad,"The job kept me very busy; which I like. I worked at my own pace; which is fast. I didn't like working third shift; the pay was very low, but it was a pretty relaxed environment."
bad,"This has got to be THE worst retailer I have experienced as either a customer or an employee. Its worse than Walmart on both perspectives, and that should tell you enough. Company continues to have a difficult time finding good employees, since they cannot start people out with any guaranteed hours, at a salary lower than the people can get working in fast food."
bad,No Hours they won't tell you when they hire you that you barely get any hours to start I was doing like 12 a week at one point totally worthless place to work unless you have been like there for years...DON'T BOTHER
bad,Big lots is a fast paced work experience. There are a lot of different things to do while working there. 80% of the customers visit the store frequently.  The hardest part of the job is during the holidays when the store is really busy and there is only 3 registers. Big Lots only gives out part time work hours.
bad,"place product on counters."
bad,terrible hours and management guarantees you hour than doesn't give you said hours. management also does not work with you on hours or when you work or what shifts you get.
bad,"tough physical labor, poor hours, poor pay. lower management tries to help as much as possible. a lot of the time blocked by upper management.  most people left the company in less than a year."
bad,The job was really unorganized and the manager was always blaming the problem on me instead of finding a solution.I went back to school and when I returned my job was given away to another person.
bad,A typical day here at work for me started out at 3 am usually unloading trucks and organizing freight but sometimes due to the request of management my scheduled leaving time of 9 am could quickly turn to 5 pm especially during the holiday season the coworkers were mostly gossips and snide and there was always tension between some of them I never really had a problem with this myself just chose to watch it from a distance and keep to myself the district manager didn't care for any of his employees and was quick to fire anyone that would challenge his rulings with an iron fist the most enjoyable part of the job was the peacefulness of the overnight shift not. the hardest part was extreme heavy lifting during unloading the trucks mostly due to furniture.
bad,"Since this was seasonal it is not really fair to judge overall store, however it is extremely hard work, very physical and not for anyone over 30."
bad,"I am really glad that I am no longer apart of this company. The pay was the only good thing about it as there weren't many hours to give. The biggest disappointment was management and that there wasn't any and when there was, they treated you like dirt. I would never recommend anyone to apply at this particular location."
bad,"Company is still in the dark ages needs major improvements. True example of exec and territory managers taking care of themselves versus seeking innovation for progression and what the company offers its employees besides low pay for slave work, no benefits or instability"
bad,Do not promote advancement in the company. Big Lots was a job that helped me find my way through dealing with customers on a daily basis but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody but high school students.
bad,"Low pay"
bad,i love merchandising in making my display. big lots was always big on that and always let me use anything i wanted to make it look outstanding. the work was easy but sometimes long. the only thing i wish wouldve changed was the gm
bad,I don't have much to say about this company I worked hard and was under appreciated so I had to leave to better myself for a better opportunity!!!
bad,"worked hard for barely any money at all, managers were no where to be seen, not given a lot of hours, but had great co-workers that made work enjoyable"
bad,"Honestly its a great place to work, but I don't get enough hours or compensation to live off of"
bad,The management was rude and unfair. They would not give the proper paper work to request off and when they did they would cut your hours and have you work only on the day you request off. They had no respect for anyones feelings.
bad,"This job was seasonal for me, and it took a very hard toll on my body. My manager was not understanding of previous injuries that I had. My co-workers were amazing and we got our work done with smile on our faces. Hardest part of the job was the toll it took on my knee. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
bad,"15 hrs a week if that when i was promised 30 a week."
bad,It is a great job for part time employment or first job learning experience.
bad,I unload trucks and stock shelves part time I sometimes run a cash register I hate the job my skills are in factory work  the only plus side is my coworkers are good people
bad,A typical day at work was the warehouse was full and you need to get the shipment on the shelves fast. I learned how to speed stock and the fornt of the shelves is the most important. My co-workers were very nice and did there job very well. the most enoyable part of the job was unloading the tralers and helping the costmers find what they are looking for.
bad,This company needs new district managers. One district manager in particular would actually yell at the store managers. This person was very unprofessional and purposely intimidating. It was an absolutely awful enviornment to work in.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend a ""career"" at Big Lots, unless you like having your life belong to this company. Any manager at this company almost immediately becomes miserable and regrets their decision, but is too afraid to go back. Big Lots is perfect to work at if you need extra money during college or something similar."
bad,The corporate environment makes it tough for anyone to be happy at Big Lots. They are all afraid to move for fear of making corporate angry. I wish someone would get a union into Big Lots just to make them treat employees better.
bad,The managers didn’t like each other so they were always going back and forth and talk to people like they were kids smh   And the pay i was told i was getting i was told I couldn’t get because i was over qualified
bad,"I wouldn't make working at Big Lots a career. Temporary ok. You can do a lot better somewhere else.Salary, work schedules, benefits  are very shallow.As far as advancement opportunities, I wouldn't put a lot of faith in it. Its who you know to get where you want to be. Even that's political. I'm just being honest.not bitter. One can do better at another career."
bad,"Worked for a year there. The most hours I ever had was 27 and that was during Christmas season. Lots of 4 hour shifts and is under new management which is why I left, wasn't willing to work with my other job."
bad,Not enough hours unless maybe a high school student for play money not enough to live off of even come close to the cost of living unless you have another part time job
bad,"They give good hours during the summer, around 40ish, as well as during the holidays. Other than that you can expect a decrease in hours. Management was actually pretty good except for the store manager. He thought about no one but himself."
bad,"Talk with manager for a position in management at the store and the manager looked tried.  As we went to the office the warehouse was completely full and it was hard to get to the office . Taking care of the freight was one job and several other items too and from what I heard they have a revolving door in hiring new associates. "
bad,"It was the typical minimum wage job position. Management was not very organized and there was always miscommunication between them. But, everyone was friendly. And if you needed something, you would get it in a timely manner."
bad,"As an experienced manager, this has to be the most unorganized place to work. Training was next to nothing, DM had favorites & was transparent in this regard. Technology at store level was primitive, example: all stores received iPads but email was not available on the iPads nor was store metrics in real time."
bad,Over all needs improvements with in management. Lack of communication and team support. Only good for part timers. No room to grow learn nor advance. Work environment isnt bad. One outstanding manager willing to work side by side train and teach. Positive attitude. Never had such outstanding manager. Couldnt ask for a better one.
bad,"We have multiple managers there, now the main manager, I adore. He's a great boss, and our new one, she is also great. One, however, I've had problems with since the beginning of when I started working here, I cannot lift anymore, and all the other managers are working with me, but she keeps asking me to do things that require me to lift heavy things and i just can't do it, I've tried to be as polite as possible and she's extremely rude in return. It's hard admitting that at 25 I have to get a desk job, but then I'm getting harassed at my work about it too, I just can't stay there anymore. However, like i said the other two managers are great and they both try to make sure that they have someone else lift, and are just generally very pleasant to work with. My coworkers are all wonderful, very friendly. And the job itself wasn't bad at all. Very laid back environment for the most part, and I've learned that most people are very nice, and it's not hard to talk to them, before I worked there, I was so shy and I can pretty much talk to all strangers with ease now. So I think that was something that really helped me grow as a person and come out of my shell."
bad,"The managers are extremely unforgiving when it comes to shift times. Never an opportunity to try different aspects of the job, they left me at the register for the whole time I worked there. No advancement opportunities. Managers liked to play favorites and had a complete disregard for employees I saw that had mental illness."
bad,The store where I was located had unreasonable managers and was a older store that was nasty and I wouldn’t recommend to the next person to work in. Some days stock was impossible to get all out in a timely matter. But other stores I went to I loved and wouldn’t mind applying to a different one next time especially the newly renovated ones that are much cleaner.
bad,"They were slave drivers, managers were arrogant dicks. You were responsible for loading 3 trucks of junk and furniture. Good for a high school dropout or a illegal."
bad,"As a furniture sales associate you are pushed to sell sell sell but are paid minimum wage, with little to no raises and no career advancement opportunities. I started my job getting payed minimum wage and ended with minimum wage. There is no commission paid on your sales either and bonuses go to the furniture manager, even if he or she is absent for most of the period. Management does not care for their employees and if they are displeased with you or your work they will cut your hours down to about 8 hours per week. When I left the company I gave my 2 week notice and was only given 4 more hours after that.  I was left without work for almost 2 weeks."
bad,"Not a good place to work at if your'rean adult, great for kids who are in high school. Location I work at there is a lot of favoritism involved. Poor hours, expect you to sustain yourself with 10 hours per week or less."
bad,“That’s not my job” and “I don’t get paid for that” are the mottos there. I wanted to advance in the company but apparently it’s not in anyone’s job description to train for positions.
bad,"Pay is bad."
bad,After working here for about two years the store has a hard time keeping managers. There's no incentives for the employees. There's a lot of heavy lifting in the furniture department and most of the time there's nobody to help with the lifting putting a strain on your back. The best part of the job is getting 20% off on everything in the store and 30% off on furniture. Most of the customers are nice as well. The worst part of the job is the store manager.
bad,"good manager, low pay not good,work for 3 years for them"
bad,"it's a decent first time job to gain a bit of experience, but management sucks and talks about other employees behind their backs which caused a high stress environment. no benefits at all. the only perk is a discount. the hours are so inconsistent that you cannot plan anything unless months in advance and you put in those days off. my store never put money into anything so the a/c units were broken (and in the hottest months), and the plumbing is so bad that you never knew when the bathrooms would work. they also had a major mice infestation."
bad,"This place was not a good place to work. Dirty, unmanaged. Favoritism to others. Work schedule set for next week put out the day before next weeks start."
bad,Worked at big lots for a little while after I graduated from high school. Was paid poorly treated poorly and hours were very poor. Did not enjoy working for the company.
bad,"Worked as a early morning stock crew member.When I started I was getting 30 hours a week, and soon that was cut. At the Christmas my hours went  up to almost 40 a week, but after Christmas they dropped to 10 hrs a week."
bad,"its not a bad place  to work, unless you need time off for something an they refuse to give it to you, the pay isn't very good at all and some of the people you work with  like to talk behind your back , no one likes  to help when  you need help"
bad,"Horrible place to work.. They treat you poorly, management is not welling to help.  They barely pay any money.. The health insurance ain't worth it.They expect way to much for one person to do. Employees are always on cell phones..It is a very stressful environment, would not recommend people to work for this company. This company is run horribly.. Seems like corporate doesn't understand how retail works."
bad,"A few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. Some of the employees there work hard to make the store a productive and profitable place that is appealing to the consumer. Other employees and management seem to be there just to get a check and to see how little they can do that day or how much they can delegate the lower associates. The employees who did care about their job would end up picking up the slack of those that did not. The good employees often got promised promotions to keep them there, because most would leave for a better place of employment.  These are some of the reasons there is such a high turnover rate."
bad,In the 6 years there the store rarely functioned work a Store Team Leader. Both assistant team leaders had to work multiple roles without compensation.
bad,Management say they'll work with your availability but they don't.  Low hours. Don't expect to be able to pay any bills with this job. It's a good start up job but that's about it.
bad,"The coworkers were some of the best I’ve ever worked with. But the hours are terrible. They hire new people and take hours from those who already work there. Unless you’ve been working at Big Lots for 10+ years, or a manager, your hours are up for grabs at any giving moment. On average you’ll work 3-5 hours a day. The average hours for a full week is anywhere from 8 to 20 hours. The only time you will see 20 hours is around holidays.This job is only good for high school graduates that’s looking for a little experience or spending money ."
bad,Hardest job I ever had. I have had a LOT of difficult jobs but this one is so very physical and no breaks for the 6 hour shift.  I found out later that you CAN take a break but it was too late and I was hired for SEASONAL work.  I helped the customers who needed help but that was not within my job description so I got in trouble for helping them!!
bad,"A place where management sits and gossips in circles like high school girls. As for what i learned. I learned how to organize/move furniture in tight places, as well as strong verbal customer communication. I'd say the hardest part of the job was trying to make sure everyone is working. I believe i would have made a much better manager and got rid of the slack that was slowing down production.. PRODUCTION IS KEY"
bad,This company is one of the worst I have ever worked for. The management is terrible and so is the pay! They work you like a hog and you end up with nothing to show for it. Very shady company!
bad,I learned how to multitask & deal with 2 maybe 3 customers at once. Also learned how to keep  clean backroom & a clean furniture sales floor.
bad,"Huge intracompany political culture, You constantly are needing  to fight to maintain your position within the company. lies and misrepresentations run ramped and unchecked."
bad,"typical day at this job, I go in ,punch in, see my supervisor to find out what I was doing that day and begin work. coworkers were nice, management was nice I learned cashiering, stocking shelves, etc. hardest part of the job was really nothing hard. most enjoyable was talking to customers and helping them find what they were looking for."
bad,The management doesn't care about employees and talks badly about employees behind their back. Other employees feel that management doesn't care as well.
bad,"I was fired by corporate because if a drunk abusive iterate customer. My GM defended me and several customers also gave testimonials stating I did not do what iterate customer claimed but because he threatened corporate and GMs jobs I was terminated. Didn't even speak to me themselves. "
bad,"I worked there for twelve years and I learned that store, district, and corporate management have no respect for employees. They could be as rude as they wanted, not fair about scheduling, did not want our opinions or suggestions, and we should just be glad we had a job. An example of their way to reward employee of the month was to give an extra unpaid day off. When you are fighting for hours that's just a kick in the butt. I regret staying there as long as I did."
bad,Management was completely unorganized and rude to employees. Continuously switched my hours with little to no notice and had a hard time handling my availability.
bad,"Greeting customers and helping them find what they are looking for, i have learned different areas of a retail business,recovering,cashier,shipping and recieving."
bad,"I learned that it dosen't matter how much you do, that it don't matter.I have learned a lot since the years I have been working their."
bad,another low pay employment with a very high turnover rate. constant freight delays and shortage of personnel. No real room for growth.
bad,"Once this store manager took over, it went to pot! He is rude, and has no consideration for his employees!  Wouldn't recommend working at Middle River store, not even to my worse enemy!"
bad,"Horrible management, the store needs someone who will encourage you, not someone who makes you feel uncomfortable and creeped out. Many of the employees are liars, gossipers and cowards. They work you like a dog and then they complain because you are to slow or not doing something quick enough. At $7.25 an hour, they do not pay me enough to break a sweat. Hours suck. Manager hangs up on you if you call in sick, he said ""thanks for putting me into a bind"" an hung up. Also, this place is not equal, everyone gets treated differently. Seniority over rules the newbies. Not a great work place at all, don't let the boss fool you. Unfortunately I fell for it, I regret %110 taking that job."
bad,"I am the administrative assistant here. So very minimum interaction with the associates. In my overall assessment, the company has room for improvement."
bad,The company is a failing company due to its lack of upper management direction. It is working to be a better company but it will some time before that is able to take place. I was wanting to move up but with its lack of growth position where very rare.
bad,I was a stocker but I spent most of my time fixing other people's mistakes rather than stocking what needed to be stocked. The store was very disorganized and most of the time the stockers would only get 10 hours a week.
bad,"As an intern, met all company's requirements and did more work and knew more than employee's. Store Manager gave no reason why they didn't hire me. The place sucked for employment"
bad,Management often had a hard time figuring out who got what hours and when. The kept scheduling people for the wrong shifts and people are often expected to more work than the pay is worth.
bad,"The life balance in management is pretty non exsistant as to keep the stores running payrol has been cut to the point on one manager and one cashier. The expectancies between stores is not even IE in trouble for *** but the next store still has *** with no repercusions.  Expectations of quanity of work can only be completed at the expense of any customer service which will not grow sales and is not the business plan of the company but is the reality in the stores."
bad,"lot's of hard work, hard to keep a good employee based on hours, amount of work and expectation."
bad,everyone I worked with here was awesome except for the store management I felt like they didn't care about anything except thereselves
bad,I used to be one of the top store  managers in the company.I was the first store to reach 1 million dollars in net profit.I went on several incentive trips 3 in a row.After 19 years with company I was terminated in Feb.2013 for so called job performance.
bad,unloaded trucks put product up very boring.store was always being shoplifted. but nice co-workers
bad,"I love retail and hard working. But this company is a company to employ people who appreciate a job. You are underpaid first of all to do everything in the store. Clean bathrooms , stock , customer srrvice, cashier. Which I don't mind but when they only have one cashier and one manager on duty and you to do the rest, is not good. Customers complaining cuz no workers. And don't get hurt on the job either cuz you will lose respect from mgmt. Sorry but this company is not a good place to work. Upper mgmt don't care if you work your butt off cuz there is always criticism."
bad,"Was not a well organized or staffed store, but I have gained much knowledge from working there."
bad,"As a former manager I applied for a management position, and even though the position was open, I was offered an associate position. I had just moved back into the area, and with the job market as bad as it is, I took the position. "
bad,"Two days of the week are stock days, while the rest of the week is to set planograms and to assist our guests with what they want."
bad,"I opened, Closed, did payroll, trained new people, and worked closely with the public."
bad,It was a good play to work. Newly hired DM was clueless. All fixtures were outdated or damaged. In 6 years I ordered fixtures 4 times and was denied 4 times.
bad,making sure the shelves are restock and straight. cashier when needed.
bad,Not a very freiendy company to work for. Upper Management sets goals that are inpossible to get done.Customer service has gone down hill long lines and never enough workers to help the customers.
bad,"The culture was the most difficult aspect of the company to adjust. The daily challenges of trying to motivate tenure employees and make deadlines to drive the business was challenging. The overall business is heading in the right direction, the opening of the new AVDC will hopefully be successful."
bad,"No respect for the individual. No benefits for non management employees."
bad,Its an ok job the weekly pay coworkers are cool just the management and the low hours get to me alot they want you to do multiple assignments in a short period of time while they sit around talking on the phone or locked in their office
bad,"Do not work in the warehouse, it is a black mold spore colony.  Some good, some bad managers. Like I said, stay out of the warehouse if this location if you value your health."
bad,My work experience wasn't the best working here. it was very tiring and not enough hours and pay. sometimes they would only give me 18 hours a week to work which was not enough to pay for my phone bill and my car insurance. the management was very all over the place. there was lack of security.
bad,"The manager that hired me got fired and arrested for theft. He tried to blame it on me. New manager that took over did not know what she was doing, ran off a lot of good workers. Also ran off her furniture manager"
bad,"Managers speak down to associates. To the point of yelling at them ."
bad,"It's an okay place to work if you are part time, it allows you a flexible schedule that you can work with other jobs around."
bad,"Managers get full time"
bad,"Big Lots isn't a good place to work they don't offer any good salary or vacation, the manager doesn't even treat his employees fair, he picks and chooses who he favors and if you don't kiss up to him he will treat you like your nobody. My experience at Big Lots was horrible and even when your on the register and you call for help nobody comes to help you they stay talking to others around the store, and even if you contact any higher supervisor they won't do anything at all."
bad,It’s a good company but just have bad supervisor that sit around  other than that it’s a good paying job good environment good pay get Lot of bonuses and Etta pay
bad,It was a decent job. You could call for a manager and it’d take them 5+ minutes to get to you so customers would leave. It shouldn’t take that long...
bad,"A typical day at Big Lots was busy but i learned a lot of different things such as how to stock, and communicate with customers.The hardest part of the day was when it got really busy with customers and the most enjoyable part of the day was helping the customers."
bad,Not enough hours to make any money. Its really hard living off 100 dollars a week. Also truck days aren't very safe. Packages are just thrown into the trucks and shipped. Stack product on pallets and load it. Boxes fall on peoples heads and some are heavy enough to just someone.
bad,"You cant afford rent with this pay- maybe care insurance once a month but really, you cant afford any serious bills. Im not writing over an extensive article on this place. No great benefits, except 10% off. You couldn't even afford to sufficiently get groceries for the month with this job. Crud pay, crud job."
bad,"little pay, very stressful, no training"
bad,"After working there 5 years I still don’t make $9.00"
bad,"Most employees are expendable. Didn't learn anything to help in a future career. Management was unorganized, chaotic and confused. The best part of the job is when you got off work."
bad,when i first started they said they would work with my schooling and then they started cutting my hours and then they fix it and scheduled my hours during school .
bad,Management was horrible. no benefits and for a part time job it was the end of the world if you requested off or needed to switch shifts........................
bad,"Stock Freight, Zone department, and help customers. Push buggies"
bad,The store manager was unprofessional and was unable to keep commitments with employees.Overall working environment with other employees was enjoyable.
bad,"Stressful job, they want you to work like a professional but pay you like a high school kids summer job. Treated poorly, constantly being told you would be fired and not taking into account what type of section you were working that day."
bad,If you are wanting to advance in this company then you should start at the top. District i worked in does not promote from within making it feel hopeless in moving up. Wants everyone to fill out what you want to do and if you are ready to move up and still hires from outside the company when there were several internal applicants wanting to move up.  Pay was good and benefits are good. No real communications from the district and store manager level leaving you in the blind.  But if you get in the right store with the right management then it can be good and fun.
bad,Stores average 150% turnover. Most pay minimum wage and the stores are mostly understaffed. Store team leader is the only salaried associate in the store. Processing freight is the hardest part of the job. Unloading trucks in open air whether it's 95 degrees out our 30 degrees and snowing.
bad,"Poor leadership, poor management. Not set up to advance as a working professional. Often would cut hours if employee didn't pick up extra hours or stayed late."
bad,"If you have a life, don't work here!! Management doesn't understand understand about having kids and that they get sick!! If you have NO life...apply."
bad,Not enough pay to be handling pallets and heavy furniture. Manager would not help when asked. Did not support his managers as well as associates. Not a great place to work.
bad,"I have never felt such a lack of respect in a workplace. Very unprofessional members of management. Consistently would overhear management talking to fellow associates about another associate's work habits. Confront issues, stop with the drama."
bad,Management was poor and didn't care. Double Standards. Homophobic.  Would never work there again. I did to much for such little pay and didn't get appreciated for it.
bad,"I meet lots of fun and amazing people in here (customers and coworkers ) . I have so much fun working in this store . I learn a lot about  customer service, customer's, restock, inventor , etc ."
bad,This job had a very nasty manager.  I was an assistant.  My manager didn't work often and I was told that I needed to pick up the slack for her.  She didn't always come in for her shift and many times I both opened and closed.
bad,"A typical day in this position was spent working many hours both in person and on the phone.  Travel was a constant which is okay if results the expectation were reasonable. "
bad,When I left nobody came to me and told me anything I was basically forced to leave . Because they thought I wanted to leave they just cut my hours out of no were . They job is pointless
bad,One manager in particular was routinely condescending to the rest of the staff. I brought this to higher ups attention and they did nothing about the matter. The manager in question repeatedly was rude to customers and other staff members.
bad,The management over works the employees and expects a day`s worth of work to be completed in just a few hours. Moving up in the company is not very likely if you are a part time worker.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was with management not understanding certain dynamics of being a parent, and emergency's arising out of my control, and just being one minded about it. Making threats about my status with the company if I did certain things and didn't do certain things."
bad,"Stocking shelves, working with customers and organizing merchandise really helped as a first job to shape my skills in other company's I have worked for. There was not many things hard about this job, it was a easier first job."
bad,hours weren't  steady. Managers showed favoritism. No opportunity to advance . No benefits. Pay was very poor. No teamwork at all ... everybody was on their own
bad,"The employees were completely unprofessional. The management would make inappropriate comments about the other employees and managers. Also, the management was lacking in knowledge of the store and operations."
bad,No Hours had to beg for time just to make a chump check maybe a good job for a first time job or a teenager that is about it don't waste your time.
bad,A typical day at work includes selling or moving upholstery around the warehouse or to a customers vehicle. I learned patients when dealing with unruly and elderly customers a like. The hardest part of my job is goggling multiple jobs while still trying to perform my furniture duties. The most enjoyable part of my day is talking to people throughout the day.
bad,"It's a retail store. Nothing much else to it.Customer service, stock, cashier, etc. Pretty straight forward on that. There is a 20% discount though so that is nice."
bad,"It was a very fun place to work at and the people were great, but the scheduling was difficult and at time only was able to get 10 hrs a week. not a job for someone trying to support a family."
bad,"A typical day started when I was called for to receive a truck followed by 4am shifts for the next two days. The management seemed very disorganized, I would get told to do tasks that I would later have to redo because another manager said it was wrong. The most enjoyable part about this job was absolutely my co-workers while there, they treated me with respect and never hesitated to answer any questions I had. The random call ins that I would show up for and get sent home as soon as I got there was the worst part about this job. Overall I believe this business just needs a better method of communication and organization."
bad,"Management: worked well when not at work"
bad,"The associates are great, nice people. This is a hard job with low pay. The mangers are expected to do more work then there is time for. Hours are long, no time for family."
bad,"Upper management seems to have no concept of what it is like to work on the sales floor. Equipment is outdated. Customers are not always right, but they do get away with murder. The store policy seems to go out the window if the customer is rude enough. Workers are not allowed to have WATER, a basic human need. If they want a drink, they have to go to the break room, but in order to do that they would have to have someone take their place while they were gone, and there is never anyone to replace them. In fact, if we're short handed, and we often are, they may forget to give me a break for several hours. I'm left standing at a counter ready to faint with no hope of relief. Signs are worded in a tricky way so customers just read the part that looks good and then they are disappointed when we have to point out the fine print to them--I can't count the number of times I've heard a customer who failed to read a sign completely say to me, ""That's false advertising!"" It is NOT false advertising, but it is tricky and problematic, and management doesn't care that we have to deal with that on a daily basis. They don't care that they could easily make the signs clearer and avoid all that. Never enough help on the sales floor, never enough able-bodied people to load furniture so the manager has to double in that department, ergo the manager is never around when you need him/her, the temperature is kept sweltering in summer and freezing in winter... I can't begin to describe the deplorable working conditions. That's why I'm job searching right now. I've faithfully stuck with this job for"
bad,"Too many responsibilities and not paid adequately. Coworkers were nice. Store Manager was not involved, assistant managers were running the show."
bad,If your a associate manager you don't get any breaks and sometimes no lunch breaks. Expecting you to do the Assistant Manager's job.
bad,Winning daily goals and providing great customer care. Exceeding goals with passion.
bad,"The store manager was sleeping with a cashier, made the work environment very uncomfortable. No one cared enough to fix the issue just allowed it to happen. I wouldnt even shop there, just a very disgusting environment."
bad,did not like the job at all. The management was okay. customer service was okay.
bad,part time stocking 4am - 8am shifts learned to handle back room assignments and freight management and checking inventory as well as stocking working pallet jacks unloading trucks ect.
bad,"Unload 3,000-4,000 piece trucks on Mondays, work out as much product and clear out space in the warehouse before a smaller or equal sized truck for Wednesday morning. A maximum of 4-6 employees are scheduled overnight for 4 nights, push out the same product that they handled unloading. Fast paced work, have a fun time as we work, but are mainly focused. Everything flows just fine"
bad,pull stock to floor make room on shelves for stock take trash to compactor clean up
bad,"Good customer interaction daily."
bad,"If you were sick 1 day, they would punish you by only giving you 4 hours the next week. People would show up sick so their hours wouldn't get cut."
bad,"I worked as an ASM in Centereach, NY and let me tell you this is a terrible company to work for if you have any motivation or experience in better stores. Big Lots is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to retail, it's a half-step above a salvage store. The stores are filthy and unkempt and the store manager and district manager are don't seem eager to change it. I tried to change some of the culture of the store based on my past experiences in better and cleaner stores and was met with resistance every step of the way by both the store and district managers."
bad,Keeping front end neat and orderly. Greeting customers entering store. Performing cashier duties. Stocking shelves.
bad,This job was not fun at all. There was way too many politics going on. Too many people were in each others busins
bad,"Business does not care about employees at all. Everyone starts out at minimum wage, which is acceptable, but no longer offers 90 day raises. Only yearly raises of $.25. Requires employees to work overnight to stock store, but does not offer a shift differential. Most employees only recieve an average of 10 hours a week except during Christmas time. Since hours are so terrible, it usually leaves just a Customer Service Specialist and a Manager during the day shift, which makes it difficult to get things done."
bad,the Store was ran pretty decent for what it is. The employees were not very helpful or as polite. Was just trying to get in out of the work day there unfortunately
bad,"I appretiate the opportunity and growth but the professionalism of upper management sucks. For the customer base to be that of brown and black people; there is no diversity in management, lack of training and professionalism. My experience would have been better had I had the proper training, I believe my termination was driven by racism and hatred."
bad,Expectations do not match pay.  I'd dig holes before I would recommend Big Lots.  Company portrays itself as your second family.   They lack respect for employees and appreciate nothing.
bad,Not enough pay or hours for the work they want you to do. Management doesn't get along. Company doesn't care about employees. No proper training. Unreasonable expectations for having only part time employees.
bad,"When I first started working there it was $7.25 then there was an overall raise to $8.50. Then was raise to $9.50. Every year gets a couple cents added to hourly rate. Everything 20% discount and furniture is 30% discount (which is awesome). The hours are inconsistent. The shifts are anywhere from 3 hours to 9 hours. I never have regularly over/at least 20 hours per week. When on floor the managers over assign in the time given. There isnt enough people scheduled so furniture is almost impossible to get help for team lifts and have almost had furniture dropped on me on the regular (dressers, sofas, firepits, etc). Items on the managers list (like price changes) is given to the cashiers to do instead."
bad,"I loved working at Big Lots because of my coworkers, they were amazing people and easy to get along with, the management on the other hand was terrible. Most of the managers at my store treated the employees like garbage and had no respect for us. So I would recommend working for Big Lots as long as you work in a store that's fully staffed and has good managers."
bad,Not many chances to grow with a company and pay wasn’t fair for the amount of work that is asked of someone. Management was always changing as well...
bad,"The manager at the time was very their way. The training was mainly on computer, didn't give appropriate amount of time to fully train. You were lucky to get your break at a decent time. There was a lot that cashier's had to do. This job will definitely push you out of you comfort zone, i.e. speaking on the intercom, using a walkie talkies for communication, and setting up displays on your own without any guidance."
bad,Then they got new management. And it really got bad. No one stayed there except a few people who were there before I started working there. Towards the end it really got bad.
bad,"I worked at the Big Lots on E Ireland Rd in South Bend, IN (1200) and I can say confidently that no one there, management, coworkers, or otherwise, cares about you as a person. As a human being. They care about the work you do for them while constantly screwing you on hours and money. You do not have a choice to work there full time. In fact, every employee other than management is working part time. The average hours you'll work a week is between 12-18 at $9.50/ hr. You get paid weekly but you are not bringing home even $800 gross doing this. You get no benefits, no PTO, no paid sick days, no insurance through the company, etc. All this is reserved for full time employees which is only management. The people I worked with were not really a problem, save for one who would always micromanage me while stocking. And since we are on the topic of stocking, I was hired as a stocker and never stocked more than one day a week. The rest of the time I was a floor associate doing what's known as ""recovery"" in which you roam around the store for hours playing neat freak and scavenger hunt. And that's what I did as a STOCKER. All in all, stay away from this place if you're looking for a job. The pay is awful, the hours are inconsistent, and management does not care about the person they hired; only the labor that person does."
bad,sold furniture and unloaded trucks. assembled fruniture and bbqs. ran the cash register and credit card machine. greeting customers was one of the only perks of the day
bad,"Big Lots in Edmond was slow, and constantly filled with incompetent coworkers and poor/lazy management. Generally small percentages of employees account for 90% of the work done."
bad,Big Lots was a nice job but it was more of a secondy job to a main. Nice easy money. I worked with some very friendly people and management was amazing just wished they gave more hours.
bad,"While I like most of the employees there and everyone tried to do their best and get along, I felt that I was taken advantage of and that I was put in positions that I should not have been put in for other people’s gain."
bad,Customer ls were always nice and loving that’s what I loved most about working there it was just some employees that made it hard you can’t put your all in something and not see any results back
bad,Didnt really care for it there wasnt enough team work the managers had favorites when you come on as a new employee the employees before you are rude I didnt like it there.
bad,Spent 3 years of my life on the management team. Got 3% annual raises. Also customers frequently complained to me about how bad customer service was when i wasnt around.
bad,Working at big lots was not what i expected it to be. I organized shelves of food and stocked them when they got the truck. I sold furniture and also assembled furniture.
bad,"A nice temporary, High-school, part time job.  Overnight.  A lot of work for the night shift.  Fast paced, understaffed, but relaxed and no real penalties for not completing work assignments."
bad,"it's pretty productive yet Predictable. Depends on the manager that you have. my former store was to small for alot of the things we got. there were never enough co- workers for the truck days. The closers would leave a mess for the morning people to clean up, that would take up the loading time for the trucks. Management could be better. Better keep up with days you work because they play games with your time and schedule. But, it had lax days to were they put you were you needed to be than leave you alone. Hours always very but that's retail, But only 4 hour stock days..WOW. All i will say is BE ON YOUR TOES."
bad,"My ""Training"" was basically just shadowing someone for a day and then asking questions when needed, I did not feel prepared at all for my position but somehow I managed. They started me out working 30 hours a week for minimum wage, then about 3 weeks later they dropped this WAY down to 12 hours a week every single week for the remaining time I was there. At least the actual hour times they gave me were consistent (always the same time frame but different days of the week). The work was boring, not very challenging, and monotonous. Not worth even having the job for such low pay and hours. Not much room for advancement or pay raises. Definitely do NOT recommend except for maybe a good starter summer job for students."
bad,"Fast paced and unorganized. Team leads dislike their Store Manager and gossip while on store floor during store hours. I like the customer service aspect of retail , BigLots isn't for me."
bad,"Corporate has policies that employees must implement to our customers. If a customer complains or sends an email including names of upper management, policies go out the door. After employees implement these policies or rules only to be told ""why didn't you help this customer is very frustrating. Good side is having a team on the same page and helps each other. Job description doesn't matter because you're most likely going to be doing some one else's job including yours. Depending on locations probably always gonna be understaffed because no new hire wants to be guaranteed 20+ hours and get scheduled for 12 random hours a week"
bad,"It was a okay job for part time. It was room for advancement, if you were willing to suck up to the company. Management may had been okay if you could keep a consistent one.. They would have a very high turn over with management and employees. You deal with all types of unruly customers"
bad,"for working its ok."
bad,The only thing i really disliked was that employees that were not management could not have full time hours. I was under the impression it was so the company would not have to offer benefits which is very dissapointing and unfortunate.
bad,Overall its ok ! Discount is awesome ! Products are not bad ! Not enough pay for what is expected of you and the raises are not good at all  and dont keep up with the price of living!
bad,"it starts at 9.50 hr but you barely get hours if you dont sell credit cards which is fine I get it, but the customers LITERALLY complain about how hard it is to access coupons so much in fact as you're signing customers us others pitch and and tell them NOT to get it smh nobody wants a reward every 3 purchases, realistically Big lots is not that popular in my area. Most of the customers are older and dont have access to internet / dont use it often so why would they want digital rewards."
bad,"retail work, unload fifty three foot eighteen wheelers , hook box rollers together, unload the truck, organize the merchandise in the back, price the merchandise, use fork lifts and pump lifts to move items, put  the merchandise on the showroom floor organized and orderly.  Ask customers if they need help in a polite manner and use manners doing everything you can possibly do to make that customers experience the best it can be for that time period."
bad,I was hired to help set the store for opening. Then I was offered a job overnights unloading the truck and stocking. Eventually was offered a CMS position and was still on the overnight crew as well. We never knew when truck would come in or how many pieces were on it. It was a very stressful job and wasn't worth the pay.
bad,This job is for kids to me someone with little to no bills the pay not much but the job is very easy it’s about organizing and detailing and making sure the customers where satisfied with purchase
bad,It was a seasonal job. I did all the areas they have to work in that store. I always tried to go above and beyond in doing my job. I had just moved back to Indiana from Ohio and was hoping to have a job I would be able to stay at. I wasn't involved in clicks so I wasn't asked to stay after the holidays.
bad,Fast placed. Different departments to work in. Mostly short shifts. Different availabilities accepted. Good management and good opportunities for advancement.
bad,Management was helpful and the team was supportive. Ive learned the in and outs of being a great customer service associate I would recommend anyone for a position moving forward in the future
bad,"productive,great management poor hours slow paced  messy slow co workers great costumers lots of theft to much drama betweeen co workers noisey people"
bad,Not a place i would work at for a part time job wasn't a good place to work at. Pay was not good and the environment was unhelpful and management was bad.
bad,"Typical day just being on cashier, ringing customers up, answering the phone, asking customers if they have a reward cards with us an if not if they would like to sign up. Keeping the front of store neat."
bad,"Being an employee for Big Lots at that time was good for me learing how to work in retail. Daily tasked required me the functions of register, stocking, and friendly customer services."
bad,It was a very stressful job. Pay was ok but not enough for the workload. Management need improvement. Lack of team work and does not care for the well-being of workers.
bad,"Retail work, stocking, cashier, janitorial, inventory. Management could of been better. When one would call for a manager, sometimes they wouldn't come as needed. Hardest part of the job was the time given the get your job done and having enough employees to cover the work load. Plus, having employees that did their jobs. (What one is getting paid for). Enjoyable the people."
bad,It was a very chill place to work right around the corner from my neighborhood so it wasn't stressful in that area the workers were nice everybody seemed upbeat
bad,"Depending on your dm you have less or more stress,There consistency with  what the company wants and the dm wants .I know what it takes to make it work and sometimes the message isn't clear on who to follow . Corporate or dm policies"
bad,Positions are very few in hours.and minimum wage scheduling is done at last moment. No time to pre plan personal time team work is a 5 on a 1 to 10 scale.
bad,"Just a typical day at work. Didn't like some of the managers, the job was slow-paced, they hardly gave you hours to begin with even on holidays. Some of the coworkers were nice though."
bad,I couldn't tell you what a long term career is like at Big Lots being that my assignment was cut short due to being relocated by the staffing agency I was working for.
bad,"Poor communication, lack of management. Schedules were consistently conflicting others ""set"" hours. Employees who had working their longer were favored even when their work ethic was unfavorable."
bad,"Management style was hard to work for. I was a hourly assistant manager, but was correcting the work of a salary assistant manager. But, the team work, of the store members was like being part of a family."
bad,Friendly slow paced job. No benifits and low pay grade. God with communication and easy to work with when you need a day off or to change a shift around.
bad,"it was  a good place to work for,a little stressful at times upper management i did not care for,i did not care for there asset manager,the district manager was a pain would recomend this job for stuents loking for part time work or for someone looking for seasonal work"
bad,"For the most part the job is pretty stressful. Customers aren't the best in the world, some aren't bad. Current management has a lack of communication, each one tells you something different to do. You're pretty much expected to work yourself to death with little to no incentive. New store manager seems to want to let everyone know he's in charge, and comes off as someone who is full of themselves."
bad,"A typical day at work would be go in, ensure the employees are informed on the tasks they need to accomplish that day. Deal with all customer issues, hire and rehire all associates. To also ensure they are all properly trained on the constant changing things."
bad,the job is fast pacing but its fun. you can meet alot of different people and they like to teach their workers different things to make the easier and less stress.
bad,"Not a good place to work. Management was bad, employees did not want to be there, and customers were always griping and in some instances wanting to fight cashiers. Would not recommend working here."
bad,I do not have any review son big lot because it was a fun thing for me. I will go back when I retire from this job and I will think about going about it
bad,"Good for an first time job, fast paced environment. Great way to understand retail business, always learning something new at the end of the day.  Great way to talk to people and understanding."
bad,This is a place that you would work for when your looking into going to school full time and still need to pay the necessity needed. Defiantly a stepping stone.
bad,"Manager is unprofessional. Yells when things do not go as he planned, makes the employees feel belittled. They expect too much from their employees when the pay is only minimum wage."
bad,had a nice time working with people at the store they had great sales at the store as well as good products for sale and nice prices an there ad's were always on time for customers
bad,"the work place is on depending on the site/area, other than that it is just retail, so if you have ever done retail work then you know what you are getting."
bad,"this company in Tallahassee may vary from other locations however, management are very well aquantanted they know each other and practice the same philosophy.. they love young minded easy school minds so that they can overwork without true lifetime expectations in the near future not very supportive of helping support a family."
bad,This was a good minor job for what it was worth. If you just need a leisure job to have some extra money this would be for you. It is also worth the extra money for some seasonal work.
bad,Most enjoyable part of my job as assisting the customers with selecting furniture and making sure they were happy with their selection. And helping them with loading and securing the items
bad,I would come into work and run registers or I would go behind the customer service desk and take care of regular transactions and returns.  I got along with management well as to what they wanted for me to do for the day.  Loved this job and my friends and associates.
bad,there is no benefit for good attendance and or behavior. 65 year old and older women are expected to unload freight trucks. Hours are so varied it is hard to plan bills. new hires are paid more than people who have worked here 8 years and more...
bad,Hours  are up and down not a good place to work unless you have a full time job already and just want a little pocket change management was so close if you weren't one of them then you weren't chosen for promotions
bad,"unloading the truck was dangerous, materials falling down and hitting you at times, no stopping for breaks after truck was done you took a break, then less time to put out products if you were just part time"
bad,"good for college students, Lots cares about the community, and that’s why we’re donating time, money, and other resources to non-profit organizations across the country. Through the Big Lots Foundation, our associates come together and give big!"
bad,"past few year we have stopped losing early on christmas eve , instead staying open until 10pm, so for 3 years I have missed christmas eve with my children"
bad,Wasn't getting paid more then 100 a week and I moved to another town. So I had the quiet this job to get a full time job for school. Moving has opened my job opportunities.
bad,Work schedule is unpredictable. Management isn't the most helpful. No room for growth and opportunities. Management can also play favorites which creates an unfair working environment.
bad,I hated working here. It was terrible having to go in and if you needed to call in sick or had an emergency everything was questioned as if you were a no call no show.
bad,"The management was good. There was room for advancement but very little pay. After working there a year, I only got a 25 cent raise evan though they told me I was one of their best employees."
bad,"At Big Lots I went to work, did my job and went home. The managers and other employees often spoke negatively about one another and it was no secret. Often times I felt as though I had to play security but certainly wasn't getting security pay. There were several occasions when I had asked ""customers"" to leave the store for attempting to shoplift, luckily each situation ended peacefully."
bad,I recommend this job for first time employees. Not everyone is built for that kind of environment. I just couldn't agree with some of the tasks that were handed to me.
bad,"Been there over 1 year.  Rate of average hours has decreased drastically. When I started,  it was about 25 to 29. Ever since January,  it has gone down to as little as 4 hours a week.  If you are a normal adult,  who hasto pay rent,  bills,  etc or be evicted and be on the street,  then don't bother.  This is made for students or anyone who can still rely on family if they don't get enough hours."
bad,"ok place to work, minimum wage, no benefits for part time associates, little bit of work hours 12-15 hours weekly part time, bad management, would not recommend working here"
bad,great job poor management. management is lackluster. too much harrassment. great schedule. great pay and benfits. too much favortism. no advancement .
bad,Misleading expectations on the first day of employment. Minimal training program. I learned to unload process of their truck and the expectations were very unreasonable. There is hardly no support from management staff.
bad,Management was ok. Work day was slow but around the Holidays is was fast. I liked working with the people and my co-workers. I liked that I got paid every week and the discount I got.
bad,Job wasnt a friendly enviroment to work for mangment did care and neither did employees work place was never staffed correcly wich over work employees
bad,"Very disorganized company to work for, No support from district level management. There was no planograms to work with. What I learned from working there how it's important to motivate and thank your associates for a job well done."
bad,Corporate expect the impossible. I do not recommend working at big lots to anyone after working there. it can be done if there is no other job available.
bad,"My store manage never gave me feedback on my performance and as a result, all I did was clock in every day and reorganize the shelves.  Once I gained proficiency in my job, my manager never talked to me."
bad,The job is slow and management fools around a lot with things. I also understand that they aren't very nice and the work load can be a lot if you do get busy. Also have found that they aren't very nice and can be a little too picky about things and pretty strict.
bad,"Described use and operation of merchandise to customers. Maintained knowledge of current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment, exchanges, and security practices."
bad,"Working at Big Lots was an educational experience. It taught me what kind of job I would want to avoid in the future. Whether being yelled at by customers, not knowing what to do because of bare-bones training and generally uncaring management, or being expected to do the work of three people by yourself, it wasn't what I would call a ""good"" workplace. Maybe it's for some people, and I'm sure people's experiences will vary quite differently from mine, but for me? I don't care for the place."
bad,OK job easy work just people move to fast and gets mad easy but would defentily work there again needs improvement of security and a little on management.
bad,The job takes over your life. Pay is not good for the job they want you to do .To many changes in store all of the time . Not enough staff for the job they want you to do in store.
bad,very nice place to work very family oriented and clean you feel safe being here with the customers as well as your fellow employees you will find something to buy each day u r here
bad,a typical day at big lots is a stressful one if you are a cashier. you stand in the front of the store all day long you are not allowed to go to the back of the store when you are on the clock. as a cashier you are left to deal with the difficult customers and no one really comes to help you.
bad,I liked working there it was a friendly place and friendly people the job was fine but they put me in as a temp and I was looking for something more permanent
bad,"learned how to cashier and how to train new employees."
bad,I think this job was alright the pay wasn't really that good unless you had more hours. sometimes busy just not all the time some co-workers were okay some just always had an attitude hardest part of the job was when all managers disappear and you have to deal with angry customers overwhelming.
bad,"No more then 27 hours a week, no benefits, hard labor work for really bad pay. The type of job you get till you find something you actually want!"
bad,"I settled for this job because I didn't have transportation at the time. This job is very unorganized and unprofessional. I work part time and it is an easy job, but you can't move up in this job. Now that I have reliable transportation I can hopefully find a stable job that is full time and provides benefits to their employees."
bad,"When I got hired at Big Lots, I was guaranteed a minimum of 3 hours a week. I started out at 20+ and it's been declining ever since. During the holidays of course, my hours are plentiful, like everyone else. "
bad,"The company is trying to expand and grow, but the rules are not consistent and the management team needs more direction. My previous jobs I always excelled through team leadership and growth. I knew I would be able to move up within the company, and I was able to voice my opinion. All of that was stifled within this company."
bad,"At Store level you will find hardworking even passionate people, move to the District level and you will find a complete contradiction to Store level and move to Regional and chances are Arrogance would be the flavor of the day."
bad,"I worked in Tempe, Arizona, and it was a hostile experience. I've been in retail a long time, but this was something I've never seen. They almost encouraged negative behaviors and intimidating approaches to employees. My store manager yelled at customers and employees, threatened employees, illegally dispersed vacation pay without the employees knowledge. And openly talked about inappropriate topics on the sales floor. The worst part was that many people have made complaints on him, yet the DM seemed to accept it and be ok with it. It's like this whole company has a culture of scream at each other until something happens. I would never recommend this as a place to work for anyone seeking a long term employer. Hopefully other stores are more proper."
bad,Gave it my all for this company also.  But don't recognize you of your work performance or your job.  Only recognize the ones that are lazy and don't do a thing.
bad,"Not a professional company, but you'd expect as much. Products are junk, food is usually spoiled. Not a respectable job."
bad,high stress and harassment at this particular store. store manager and district manager hard to work for. not a good environment to prosper and grow with company.
bad,It was a a great job until me being to myself became a problem with the owner's son. I learned to be more productive with food however oppertunity came knocking so I went for it.
bad,Great customer base. Fast paced and fun environment. Management was inconsistent and very unprofessional. Overall company also inconsistent and unprofessional.
bad,"My review of the company would be that as a whole the benefits of me working there outweigh the change they had to make. I would give them a 8 out of 10, if I had to rate them. The people there were knowledgeable in what they know. Having never had to work in this environment in a long time, It was an educational experience, learning some aspects of Working in the back lines of Retail.."
bad,The management was very poor. They didn't care about the workers just cared that they got their work done. The pay was shallow for the amount of work that was being done.
bad,"Revolving door associate turnover ignored by upper management. Paltry starting wage with even more meager annual review for pay increase.  Even though production incentive in place, and fair, operations and general managers expect you to do more for less. proof is in the facts - turnover of supervisors appalling. Associate appreciation non-existent, and suggestions for improvement go unheeded. Director and GM's all about the numbers, baby!!"
bad,"I would come intowork and clock in way in the back of the store at a time clock. I then would make my way to the cashier and imediatly start assisting customers. "
bad,i love working here big lots. but i did not like how i never had any hours. the managers was all over the place and did not know what they was doing. and the most enjoyable part of this job is where i got to go home.
bad,"very easy laid back, learned to find something to keep me busy management was great and all co-workers got along great, hardest part was unloading the trucks which still was pretty easy. loved meeting all the people that came through everyone was always in a great mood."
bad,"The environment was not the most suitable places to work. The upkeep of the business was not well maintained and the treatment of its fellow employees was well below par. This caused an unfriendly and unstable environment. Perhaps if the management was well maintained things could have been much different,"
bad,"Mornings at big lots start off getting straight to work. Unloading trucks, cutting boxes, and stocking shelves. I learned how to stock shelves and not only that I learned where everything goes. The managers can be helpful at times other times they aren't so helpful. The co-workers are friendly they help anyone in need of help. The hardest part about the job is making room on shelves for other items when the shelves are already full. The most enjoyable part is everyone works as a team, well at least the team members."
bad,"it was the worst job i ever had stocking, there is no organization on the shelves or for unloading trucks, well slightly, the manager was alright but the co-workers were smug juggalos, Smuggalos lol."
bad,workplace was a cleaned and organized environment. managers developed leadership skills.
bad,"too much work for such little pay. not appreciated at all. I liked it better in Connecticut, but not too much."
bad,This company doesn't have enough hours for you to work. Overall outside of management things could be better for this company.
bad,"Long boring repetitive days. Managers have no sense of leadership."
bad,I worked for Albertsons for 5 years and that was too long. There really isn't room to grow there and even the managers aren't paid very well. In my opinion this job should be for kids and students.
bad,"Very nice job, everyone is very nice. My co workers were easy to get a long with. Thank you"
bad,Big Lots was more of a means for some pay compared to no pay. Some of the people were fun to work with. Raises were there but I was still making the same amount of pay as ten years earlier.
bad,"Bad hours, okay management teams, your pretty much on your own.  They always look at the bad you do but not your good."
bad,"A typical day consist of zoning store, assisting guest, and stocking shelves. Management not very good, to many problems between co-workers and management."
bad,I manage the store and help customers. I help out the employees when needed. I stock and remerchandise my departments. my departments are HBC and auto. I deal with venders and i unload trucks. i open and close store.
bad,Great place to work but raises never happened.  Managers were awesome.
bad,Working here was good when it first started about as the weeks went on it went down hill. When I first started I was able to get ~20-30 hours a week but as my time ended I only had about 8 hours since it was a temporary position and we were not guaranteed to wok there any longer after the store was up and running. There were also too many assistant managers at the store which reduced some workers hours since the managers needed their 40 hours and then it trickled down to the associates that had been working there for a while. Overall it could have been a better experience but I was able to see what type of environment that I would want to work in next time.
bad,"loading trailers and picking orders, a hard workers always gets call in to work, management is easy to work with, outgoing employee's, hardest part of the job is waking up early, most enjoyable part of the job is working in a fast paste."
bad,Checking customers in with lay a way options. I learned the computer system. Management was nearly awful to work with. My co worker kept the job fun. The hardest part knowing that I could be fired at any point with out notice. The most enjoyable part was working with people who made the job fun.
bad,i loved the job its self because i love customer service and cashiering jobs.
bad,Consolidated Store / Big Lots Furniture Division required to travel as needed to any number of locations within a 5 state area with little or no notice. Ability to change hats as needed from management to unloading trucks on a daily basis.
bad,Average workplace setting. Interaction with the customers made my day a lot better.
bad,The job was a lot of fun during the opening of the store. Big Lots is a good job for someone looking for part time work or something to keep yourself busy while looking for full time work. While on the job I learned how a store is setup and maintained during operating hours. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the employees you work with.
bad,stocking and unloading trucks and take care of customer and working with co- workers as a team
bad,The typical day at work was fun.I met alot of new people and the skills i already had just got alittle better.The management was not all that good to many different managers.The hardest part of the job was whining down all of that energy that i had at the end of my shift.Ienjoyed the customers.
bad,"Typical work week for salaried employees were close to seventy or more hours with split days off if any at all. I learned much during my time, some self taught, most had to learn from mistake. Upper managment never directed or assisted with internal conflict but reprimanded a lot. I felt most of the time my hands were tied. Never recognized for any personal or crew achievments. Most enjoyable part of this position was most of the customers and co-workers."
bad,"big lots isnt that bad of a job. if your not looking for a lot of hours. the avg working gets 6 to 14 hrs a week.they can work well with your college schedule. the company its that bad ,how ever some stores maybe controlled by the store manager and use the company to get you out. meaning dont buck the system or they will find a way to buck you out."
bad,was hard to adjust boss had favorits co-workers were great the hardest part was loading trucks by hand off convaor belt standing allnight
bad,"I started at this job with great hopes of chances for learning and advancement opportunities. That did not and has not happened, and after a year in this company I do not have any desire to go further. The store management is poor, and very lacking especially with employee relations. Advancement, time off, meeting employees certain schedule criteria that may arise all depend on what you do to make and keep your manager ""happy"". Would not recommend this job."
bad,1.A day at Big Lots begins with a good rest before u come into work.
bad,"When hired their training process was only one week, you arent given the right tools to perform the job adequately,"
bad,Wouldn't want to work there again. Constantly changing management. Employees aren't valued. Pay doesn't reflect the amount of work. Hours were always short.
bad,The Company on whole is not a bad place to work. The only issues I had is that there is little to no room for advancement. The amount of leadership in the building on any given day in minimal. It is difficult to attain quality associates as there is limited full time positions and no path for growth. There is no work/life balance and the company does invest in their future by recruiting and attaining quality associates/managers
bad,Typically depending on what manager was in charge it was a great experience how ever the main store manager and the manager that was just promoted were not the best. I felt over worked and lied to about a pay increase for increased hours
bad,"When I first started for this company, I loved it. Great, pay, benefits and PTO. But the new CEO is letting the company go down the drain. No remorse for the actual workers who work in the store and keep it running. They are sending more freight and product but then are cutting hours and still expecting you to show the same results. No motivation within the management team. You are left short handed without a main role manger and nothing is done about it. As long as the store manager gets their days off, it doesn't matter what happens at the store. The store could be burning down and the manger would still leave."
bad,Big Lots is a slow paced company.I would not recommend the big lots I worked due to lack of hours the offer a week. Big lots was part-time only offered 12-15 hours a week can't live off that salary.
bad,"zero opportunity for advancement, management was treated like dirt, do what I say or else.  no energy in stores, always a beat down, always behind.  Executives could care less."
bad,"A typical day involved stocking shelves and helping customers, except for days where we would just unload the truck that arrived. I learned how to stack boxes and double task. Management won't help you, but they will rush you constantly. The culture there was just a ""what ever"" feeling from the co-workers, nothing else. The hardest part of the job was the constant rushing, but it becomes the lack of hours, they started my friend and I on around 16 - 18 hours a week, but over a couple months we were lucky to get 10 hours, they eventually gave me a 3 hour week and that was when I decided I was going to quit. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers."
bad,If you're looking for a job with little amount of hours and alot to be expected from you. Don't expect much from them. Unless you completely delete everything from outside of work.
bad,I’ve been made to feel ignorant at times by management and was placed on specific jobs without proper training. The pay is pretty low for the amount being asked to do.
bad,"Part time that's it, minimum wage pay. you clock in and clock out. And that's it nothing else to it. They try to compare their workload to Walmart and how fast it should be done. Even though a typical Walmart has over 200 associates and biglots only has 25"
bad,"1.  Job is always on the line "
bad,"Having worked in the company for 3-4 years, I can say right around the time I first started it was the best experience I've ever had with a job/employer. Gradually the quality of management and environment decreased. Little to no advancement opportunity is available to PT associates. The only position ever open is usually the DTS Lead position, which is one of the more harder and less secure positions of all management. The company built it's foundation of family, loyalty, and teamwork amongst employees. But, sadly they do not believe in or enforce it in the work place."
bad,This was just a regular job working in retail. You couldn't get more that 20 hours a week so there were no benefits. Very boring most of the time an a minimum wage hourly rate.
bad,nothing about this job is great. I do not enjoy the time I spend there and I soon will be leaving. you have 5 managers 2 out of the five are very reasonable the other 3 should not be managers.
bad,They don’t care that you have a life outside of work. Can guarantee any type of schedule or amount of hours. Max number of hours for anyone other than managers is 29 hours. Pay is decent but they work you like a dog an expect so much out of you
bad,"In the beginning it was great. i mean there were times not so great but overall i loved it. i grew so much while there. i quickly moved up to assistant store manager. i was 2nd in charge or the last 7 years. "
bad,Not the most favorite place to look at. If you're needing a job quickly then work here for a few months trying to find another. They can be pretty quick to let you go if you mess up too.
bad,its mimimum wage for regular employees . it is a never ending mess of trash. its not organized and the management is really mean. they have a high turn over rate.
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of different responsibilities and allowed me to learn new tools. At the time I was happy with management, but the pay and hours could have been better. I was only making minimum wage and would have like the opportunity to pick up more hours and days each week."
bad,"Never a relaxing atmosphere, Can't really enjoy or get to know staff. Work, Work, Work..   Always working all holidays at extended hours.  Never a short day for you to enjoy any time with your family. Company's stores seem to be the only level in company with accountabilities."
bad,"not enough time allocated to do tasks in time allowed, no support from HR department. Micromanagement, underpaid employees, raises are not adequate. I loved working with my customers and employees, but no support from upper management."
bad,Do your job and leave my time here was not a pleasant one. Just do as your told and keep to yourself that way no problems occur. I personally cannot recommend this job to anyone and the pay was not good.
bad,"I was not getting enough hours or paid the way I should have been, I didn't like that there really was no benefits. The work place wasn't bad bit it was just the way that stuff had to be done and I wasn't able to keep up on my bills with the little hours and pay I was getting"
bad,I worked as a cashier but they have you work different places in the store at a time. The hardest part was keeping myself busy but it was easy just really boring. I didn't care for my management and they were honestly condescending but flexible so give and take.
bad,"A generally relaxed and slow paced environment sprinkled with intermissions of high stress. The only people who this company treats worse than you are the management. Plenty of problems in this company, and no one to voice them to."
bad,"Management is horrendous and treat you like garbage. They preach safety, but if that gets in the way of production and getting their numbers, it gets thrown out the window. When supervisors don't get their numbers, they take out their frustration on associates. Do not recommend working here."
bad,Helped customers ring up their things. Put stock on the shelves. Help unload the truck. The management was good but it had its flaws. A lot of call offs.
bad,Management was attempting to offer more for employees but they had not backing from corporate. I learned how to work with customers to meet their needs and expectations.
bad,Typical high turnover retail store. The employee discount was nice. Was there for many years but did not enjoy my job for the last several. Actually tried to find other work and couldn't.
bad,"this is a typical retail job which means your hours vary from 8-29 a week. There is not enough people on a day to complete every task, you will constantly be straightening product no matter the time."
bad,"I liked coming in early and getting off early 4-12 were good hours but I'm very flexible and worked over night also I would be willing if necessary,and  required for a job."
bad,"A typical day at work here was okay. It really depends on what you are doing. Doing recovery or stock is fine. At the location I worked at I was a cashier. I thought this would be a good experience for me, but I was wrong. There is only one good manager there that will help you with anything you need. The co-workers are also friendly for the most part. The GM is not around often and when he is he doesn't really do anything. He is also very rude. I've learned to go to the other managers with problems because the GM will just get mad at you and he isn't understanding. The other manager is nice at first, but she shows favoritism after a little while and tends to care more about gossiping rather than do her job. The hardest part of the job is having  a line of customers waiting to be rang up while only one register is open. The most enjoyable part of the job is either cleaning up the store, or clocking out of course. This is not a good job if you are just starting retail. They do not do enough training. They just make you watch a quick video and assume that you know everything. They will help you sometimes, but will criticize you afterwards for not knowing or making a mistake. This place has great potential, if only some of the managers would act professional."
bad,You'll never get full-time hours unless your management & be prepared to do every kind of job one can do in a store. It is basically like every other dead end job!
bad,If your looking for job security and advancment dont work here. The enviroment is based on who likes you. If your not in good with upper managment they will quickly get rid of you.
bad,"The job was a good fit for who I was when I initially accepted it, "
bad,"If you are looking for a place to grow and you have any experience - then Big Lots isn't for YOU....... Too many favorites; especially by the District Manager;asked to do too many unethical things - like work off the clock to ensure you hit your payroll numbers.  District Manager's overall Integrity wasn't there as he was afraid of his boss - the Regional Manager. "
bad,It was constant movement which is fine. The management always made you feel like you were replaceable and your work went unnoticed. No manager was ever happy with any employee's efforts.
bad,"loved the people I worked with.how to unload trucks,manager was fair with everyone.hardest part was stock but I enjoyed it."
bad,"I worked at Big Lots in a temporary seasonal position for several months before I was fired. The particular store I worked for lacked communication in every aspect. I was not trained on everyday tasks needed to complete the job at hand. The schedule was lacking in hours (by alot) and changed without informing the associates and this was the main cause that I was fired."
bad,"Benefites are honestly only good if you are a manager of some kind. However, I've found that while there are five management positions in a store (Dock to Stock Lead, Furniture Sales Lead, Assistant Team Lead x2, Store Leader), the Assistant and Store Lead are the only ones that are treated as such. The lower two were considered expendable, and often handed far more responsibilities than would be considered appropriate given the lack of appreciation and the lack of compensation. Often the company talks about ""Upwards Maneuverability"", but often they will hire outside of the company instead of picking from those who are more veteran. For those who are hired outside of the company directly into management, as I was, there was an incredible lack of support in regards to training. At one point I asked for more, and was told that I had had enough time with the company to just ""pick it up"". I was heavily dismissed whenever I asked for assistance, and despite having people supposedly scheduled in my department, I never once saw an associate there that I didn't have to fight to maintain within my department. "
bad,"Stock shelves, unload truck, keep lanes clean, cart pusher. Customer service, people skills. I liked my managers they was just never on pace together."
bad,"Typical day at work was waiting on customers and fulfilling their needs in my department. I learned a lot, how to work a register, recovery, delegate tasks to others in my department and vice versa. My co-workers were always friendly, willing to help one another out, but we were grossly understaffed. "
bad,"my normal day would consist of helping customers and making sure they are satisfied and happy with any and everything they may need. I really enjoy my co workers we all have great work chemistry and wonderful work ethic, we dominate and kill any problems that we may come across. I wouldn't say that there are any hard parts of the job more like a little overwhelming some times if we have more customers than cashiers, but as long as I get to make some one happy and smile its all worth it."
bad,"Huge pressure from hire ups. was with the company for 3 years and went through 3 Regional Managers, 5 District Managers, and 12 out of the 14 Store Managers have less then a year under there belt with the company."
bad,"you give everything to your job,you commit yourself to do your very best.you work for 12 years day in and out all kind of crazy hours and keep on trucking then they decide you are too old and make too much money so you then become the target.It is sad and humans should not be treated like this.The corp is all for themselves the money!They say they care about their employees but,don't count on it.they use you up and then they are gone.Open door policy,be carefull they will use it against you.DM they are the worst,however they will all have to answer some day,for their actions.Not a good place to work."
bad,Supervisors were horrible. Security was severely lacking; I constantly felt threatened. Working environment was not safe.
bad,There was no room for advancement.  Management hired too many employees and only worked them part-time.  Seasonal help was only given 4 hours per week. My co-workers were great!  The public was great!  The management lacked organization.
bad,"I would help unload trucks in a timely manner, stock and price merchandise. On call for cashier when needed. Greeter at the door for grand opening. Management didn't schedule very many hours. Co-workers were fun. The hardest part about this job was finding equipment ladders, blades etc. The most enjoyable part was working night shifts with logistics team."
bad,Work/Life balance was not good at all!!! schedule would be posted and chaged on a regular basis. Loved interacting with customers and employees.Manager would leave on a 3 hour or more break regularly and come back and wonder why certian things wern't completed and regular employees were not able to scheduel doctor appointments easily due to the changing schedule. Some part time employees were only scheduled 1 day a week @ 4 hours!!!
bad,"a day a big lots consists of stocking and merchandising sales floor and furniture department, customer assistance, managing cashiers at checkout, load/unload customers when help is needed, inventory/damage control, and reconciling all sales at end of each shift (cash/check/credit card transactions) I learned to multitask and prioritize tasks based on adhering strictly to a deadline. management expected miracles from a warehouse that had not been managed correctly for years. This location in particular had been through several store managers and rounds of employees in an effort to clear the warehouse of old product and progress was very hard to come by with over 3,000 cases of new merchandise entering the store each week. Making this progress was by far the most challenging part of the job and also the most rewarding when recognition was noted for making some amount of sense/progress/organization in the wreck of a warehouse."
bad,Didnt have a long histosy with this compant this big lots closed down
bad,"For this I don't have more to say and my department was not easy "
bad,Big Lots taught me how to build furniture and to interact with the public.
bad,"This company doesn't hire full-time and a person my age cannot survive on the salary.  Promotions are nonexistent, as are cost of living salary increases.  I do enjoy working with some of the employees and do enjoy my regular customers.  "
bad,A day at work would be like you working five different jobs at once in a retail environment. I learned to not let people (managers) walk all over me. Co-workers are okay. Hardest part of your job is lifting boxes that can weigh up to 500 pounds. easiest would be selling furniture.
bad,I arrive and restock all misplaced merchandise then go around the store and organize and restcok any merchandise that is out of place.
bad,Big Lots is a Nice Place to work and it is a Very Friendly Enviorment and Has Great Costomer Service
bad,"A typical day at work consist of down stacking a pallet of one of my departments to a flat cart to take to the floor to open, price , and place on the shelves for customers to purchase. I have learned that you complete one task before going to another so you don't have to back track. We just got new managers again so you have to learn how they want things done because all managers are different so you have to adapt to their ways. I like my co-workers are very nice and willing to help you if they have the time. The hardest part of the job is the dock to stock program you have to put so many cases out an hour but when you have all kinds of other things to do it is hard to get done. The most enjoyable part is being there to help customers the joy you feel when a customers finds something that they are looking for is worth all the hard work."
bad,"busy,how to put furniture together,some managers was not that good,backstabers,unload trucks,sales"
bad,"unless your a mormon and Male, working in this district intolerable, very streessful. your family is always put last and even if your having a surgery your expected to work that morning. D.M has no compassion. I highly recommend speaking with current store managers before excepting a job in this district"
bad,The work was done at night during the third shift. The goals set for you by the management is achievable if you can focus on your work and move quickly. You do not receive many hours to work during the week so you cannot pay for any of your bills.
bad,"i work at big lots dc for six an half years with the company i never had a problem, a operations manager comes too me one day and he said the i was the employe of the year"
bad,when i worked for big lots customer care line there were between 10-20 of us for the entire company. while my direct management was good upper management and other departments did not know that we existed. there was always another call to be taken and you have the usual back and forth from management about giving away too many coupons vs customers being too angry every few months. expect to do what management tells you then be told your doing things wrong and to do it the other way a few months later as with most similar customer service jobs.
bad,Slow-paced working environment usually makes the hours drag. Bathrooms are hardly ever cleaned properly. Difficult to get hours and ask for days off. Would not recommend.
bad,I originally signed on to help remodel the store. But they decided to put me on cashier and floor. I was paid less and had less hours  then we agreed upon. Don’t bother with them at all.
bad,After working there for 8 years as a CSS I was not able to become full time because the status was limited to one full time CSS out of three. They only raised my pay .25 to .50 cents a year. I was not even asked to interview for a management position I more than was qualified for doing and good at but passed over for managers friend that was a new hire while on a maternity leave.
bad,"I did enjoy my job,but when it came to promotions and higher up management were very unfair and unreasonable. I would work double shifts if needed. come in on days off etc. I did more then was applied for my role,but was always turned down ever time I tried to apply for high role."
bad,"They purchase items not very popular in both food and home categories resulting in heavy markdowns and write offs. Recently reorganizing company structure resulting in management jobs eliminated which are the only full time positions, everyone else is part time 15-25 hours weekly."
bad,"I worked here temporarily in a retail position. Pay is very low close to minimum wage, hours are unpredictable from one week to the next. The only upside was the people working there were pretty cool."
bad,While I did like the people I worked with the rest of the job was no good. Often stuck in need of management for transactions to progress for minutes at a time. Lovely people but terrible service from the top down.
bad,"Store was not clean or organized. Did not consider what I had to say as an employee nor did they have open conversations about their policy. Some of the managers were not that nice, and didn't care if you had experience or not."
bad,"I would have to bring out beds and couches that weigh more than 50 pounds by myself and help customers put them in the car. I wouldn't complain if i was getting paid more then 9.25, but the pay was horrible"
bad,"Loved working here but management didnt want to give you no more the 20 hours a week and the pay was BAD"
bad,"Big Lots could be a good place to work if the company cares more about employees. Give them a decent wage and benefits. This would slow down the turn over emencely. They don't seem to care about customers either. Otherwise they wouldn't do things like have a rewards program that only people that have computers or smart phones can belong to. They closed a store in Erie, Pa in a community that has a huge part of it's population are retirees.  This was an enormous hardship. These people have limited funds and are now forced to shop at much higher prices stores."
bad,"Big Lots policies make our job very difficult. When customers wish to break the rules, and throw a fit about it, Corporate policy is to capitulate, making the cashiers look foolish and inefficient. Its so disheartening, Im leaving retail over it."
bad,"I got paid too little to deal with the B.S. that big lots have to offer their employees. The only excellent thing they do is a couple of times a year they have a ""sale"" that is an employee only. For $20 you buy a wrist band, and you walk through the specified area of the Warehouse and shop. As long as it fits into a contractor bag, you take it home plus you get one (1) large ticket item."
bad,Working at Big Lots is ok it's really a job you pick up for extra cash they do not have the hours the pay or the career advancement to make it worth your while they start off at $9.50 an hour or $10.00 an hour if you have experience there are NO FULL TIME POSITONS unless you are management other than cashier you can apply for furniture or stock which they come in early in the morning like 4am other than that you work with a pretty small group 1 cashier 1 floor person 1 furniture persona den 1 manager on duty the company has put alot of money into remodeling thre stores which they now call the store of the future overall the management is very helpful at the store I work at the store is kept clean but that's it I would recommend the job if you need extra cash only for school books if your a college student or you have bills that you need some extra cash paying off that's it other than that no reason to apply.
bad,Being a store associate at Big Lots was okay. I think the worst part is customers can sexually harass you and managers don't really care or do anything about it.
bad,"Only management is full-time.  All other workers are part-time.  New schedule with different days and times to work EACH week.  Least amount worked in a week is 4 hours.  The most hours an employee can work in a week is 28 hours according to corporate rules.  Most employees get an average of 13 hours a week.  13 hours to 15 hours is the typical amount a week, however, the company will hire new people so current workers can not obtain more hours toward the 28 hours maximum. This is what the company continuously does.  When more employees are hired your number of hours will go down even if you have let management know you want more hours. "
bad,"Do common store things. "
bad,"You can't get full time at all if you're not a manager. The pay is very low for the amount of work you have to do at EVERY location in OKC. The managers are  trash & the district managers are even worse. It's not enough to live on you will need second job, managers never on the same page. One good thing is you can pick your own hours & pick whatever time you wanna be off. No benefits for employees as far insurance. Two15 min breaks one 30 min if you work a 7hr shift. The most enjoyable part of this job was the co workers they made it a family environment there wasn't really nothing hard about the job. They had you doing way too much for really bad  pay & bare to minimum hours. Once again the managers are trash, never organized, very lazy, always off hiding somewhere to avoid working the district managers are rude & talk to you like you're a child. I learned really nothing here but basic things like cashiering & stocking something I already knew how to do. They show no type of appreciation for the workers & we worked harder than them (the managers). No appreciation lunch for the whole staff, no type of rewards if you sign up 6 or more customers for the rewards program which they're suppose to do. No paid vacation, no paid sick time off."
bad,"Upper-management is deceitful and underhanded. I would NOT recommend working there to anyone. In store management was fabulous until she had to cover her own butt, then she proved to be nothing more than a lackey for the upper management. Small stores but a much more personal work environment. My manager is nice and I am able to really communicate with my peers. The only downside is managing with a small crew in the event of an emergency. Low Associate pay makes the retention high."
bad,"Rang customers, stocked shelves, unloading trucks. Truck was unloaded outside, even in the dead cold of winter, a lot of pressure was put on the few to get everything finished quickly. The only good thing was the nice people I worked with."
bad,"The pay was okay and the work was easy. Working in the mods, your day pretty much consisted of labeling and throwing cases up to 60 lbs(sometimes heavier) on a conveyor belt to be transported to the shipping doors. The pay was decent at best. You really had to bust your rear end if you wanted to make max incentive pay. The only thing that made working in the DC miserable was the fact that management was completely clueless and didn't know how to properly delegate or treat their hard working employees with the respect that they deserved."
bad,They did not train me so in the beginning I would come in everyday unsure what I was supposed to be doing. I don't get enough hours either. In most weeks I'm lucky if I work 10 hours.
bad,"There's almost always a big sale, so you'll spend the day at the register, facing the store and re-stocking or re-shopping. Every week you'll unload a truck and stock the store and move things according to the POG. hardest thing about the job is inconstant scheduling."
bad,"Worked there for last 3 years. Enjoyed my co-workers and my regular customers. Due to life happening, changes in my employment became mandatory. Lease is up, store is closing. On to the next adventure."
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful"
bad,"The store that i worked at has a very high turn over. Some left due to how the customer treated them. Some left due to not enough hoursto work. And when you did your hours were all over the place. No set times it is always changing. Always short handed which makes the customer upset and take it out on the employees. No matter how hard you work they want to push you harder."
bad,"The manager was mean and disrespectful, rude to customers, never nice to the employees, also had an attituded, was never friendly, and always called off from work"
bad,Hours they have low hours no concern for you as a person and a human being moreless treat you like a robot. They set ridiculous standards they don't give you the equipment and resources needed to accomplish said standard. But they're quick to reprimand.
bad,A typical day at work stressful very very stressful I work as an inventory associate or a night stoker as you would call it the work was demanding much more physical strength than mental but all the more  i had good co-workers that what made it fun.
bad,Company culture is about what you can expect when all your co-workers are part time and minimum wage; everyone except management looks for other work.
bad,"Terrible Management. Have been accused for things I did not do twice already.  I do not want the fact that someone does not like me to ruin my life.  I believe they need to look into their management better, because they are really the problem.  It is an easy job, but the backstabbing and theft is ridiculous."
bad,"The job entails a little bit of everything from cleaning the store (including some very disgusting bathrooms) to unloading a truck with some very archaic equipment.  It was back breaking work each delivery day.  Also included is stock maintenance, cashiering at times, furniture assembly and many other duties."
bad,Awsome company to work for  this company is all about numbers and sales and how many pepperoni u get signed up for your commission check very fun job as well
bad,Overall good pay but really didn't like the chaos. Large deliveries and overwhelming freight. Constant changes made things more difficult. Not a bad employer but I wouldn't do it again.
bad,Its a typical store job . Stocking/cashiering/fronting. managment is nice and is not pushy. The coworkers are down to earth . hardest part of the job is customers .
bad,"What I have learned to work with money also what retail is about."
bad,"Compensation and benefits A+,no advancement opportunity,poor management skills,there are no set days for vacation approvals,there is very poor job work/lifebalance..."
bad,"My review is this company doesn't care about its associates. I worked there for two years and it's very stressful when you don't have a working management team. Your job is to sale furniture  and control your department. Everyone there is there own person some will be a team player others will be subordinate and management will do nothing about it.  You get paid every week, 36+hrs, and vacation time. It's very laid back and easy. By January or March they are redoing furniture so expect alot of work, care for the department like it's your child, greet and make strong relationships with all costumers."
bad,I love my coworkers and the nature of things I have to do at this job but I make no money. They don't schedule to my full ability and then blame the scheduling on a computer when I know that's not true. It's an ok job but it's not worth what you get paid which is little to nothing.
bad,"Nothing was too hard. The only problem was the scheduling and the help from the managers in that position. No matter how much was told to them, they never listened. The co-workers were good people. The management did not seem to care."
bad,"Fun working atmosphere, friendly associates, overall a great place to work, very easy going stores. Upper management was king and understanding during stressful times."
bad,Overworked Management with very little payroll to accomplish all the tasked that given by corporate. Every store has its challenges but this store takes the cake!
bad,A typical day at work consisted of keeping busy and checking people out when they came up to the registers. I learned how to sign people up for financing and payment plans when selling our furniture. My co workers were friendly but not very talkative we just did our work and waited until we went home. The hardest part of my job was signing people up for financing and payment plans for our furniture. The most enjoyable part of the day was keeping busy and making sure our customers left happy
bad,"There is no balance, its all work and no life. The few of us that are hardworking and give it our al..l get taking advantage of by corporate for example helping troubled stores or short staffed districts and then when you fall behind in your own store they blame you. They expect you to get it all done on no hours and no help doesn't matter what volume you are and if your fully staffed. they offer bonus for when you make goal however they make your plan so high you can reach them and open stores close to you and make it impossible to reach the bonus structure."
bad,Managers just don't seem to want to lead a team with this company.
bad,Management is awful and I only worked here a few months. They didn't like me for whatever reason. I always put furniture together and put it on the sales floor.
bad,was not my dream job but it was ok the mangers was the best people to work for.
bad,"Responsible for the customer, sales, merchandise flow, operations, hiring, training ,scheduling, payroll, marketing, merchandise layouts, unloading freight, evaluations, inventory controls."
bad,"As a General Manager, too much was expected.  You were only allowed 300 hours to run a multi-million dollar business.  As a G.M.  you are the only salaried employee in the store which means you not only have to manage the store, but you also have to cashier when needed, stock shelves, unload trucks at all hours of the day (sometimes 3AM) write schedules within the budget constraints, process payroll, etc.   You also have daily, weekly and monthly reports which you have a limited amount of time to complete.  Although you may have 2 assistant store managers, a lot of store managers end up doing a lot of the work themselves.  I would personally spend at least 65-70 hours a week at the store and during the Christmas rush (which by the way starts in September for Big Lots) I would put in 80 hours.  So if you have a family FORGET THEM!  They no longer exist in your world!  Also, Big Lots is only closed on Christmas, meaning that they are open regular hours or longer on all of the other holidays including Thanksgiving.  The pay is ok but the bonuses (which are rare) only pay a measly 1/2 of 1% of favorable sales plan.  Also, raises are only once per year and a good solid raise is usually a 1-2% increase."
bad,"Tried unsuccessfully to move into Canada, took over the liquidation world stores and opened some new Big lots stores in Southern Ontario. Stress and Financial  problems of a new company existed, unfortunately they could not keep up and went Bankrupt. I was able to secure another job before this occurred."
bad,they wont you to work hard but they dont care bout your health
bad,"This company is a relic in the retail field due to his outdated concept of ""closeout"" deals."
bad,"good part time job to start off with.. 4 hour work day, work all around store"
bad,"My day consist of unloading truck merchandise and palletizing it in our recieving area. After that, I unpackage,price,and sometimes stock the items. I am also a cashier."
bad,We are often running a 30-45k sqft building with a staff of 3-4 associates including the managers on duty. Can often be pulled from tasks to do basic positions such as cashiering due to the lack of payroll support. Outside of Management there are no full-time associates so we are often left to perform tasks typically done by standard enployees.
bad,"Less then 7 hours to train"
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years different management would come in and compliment me on my job I made it my business to learn the whole store then a new manager came in I helped her but when she didn’t need me anymore she stayed on me called me names told me  she was waiting for me to quit I loved working at big lots until she got there. I would work at 4am and when I got off I would go to Galveston for 2 months because my mom was very ill died twice I would go to the bank for them I wasn’t trained on register are furniture but a customer went off on me one time because I didn’t know so I made it my business to learn furniture and the register was easy I did the merchandise during the remodel I had to work nights during the remodeling one night had to be there by myself and mind you I’m not a key holder but I put a lot into that store then when Michelle got there their was new rules she didn’t tell me and would write me u call ghetto watch every move I made would call me out in front of other workers and customers over loud speakers but she finally got what she wanted she fired me even though she was only giving me 4 hours a week and I’m a mother of 4 they can’t keep anyone there they work for a min and out the door "
bad,"I worked at Big Lots throughout college (and unfortunately still do), and while I was a full time student the job was perfect for me: they were able to work around my college schedule, letting me only work nights and weekends.  But the way the company is run is really dumb.  The managers that work at my store were nice, reasonable people who know just as well as I did that the rules we followed were stupid (though I'm sure that varies from store to store), but I can't say the same about the higher-ups in corporate who actually run things.  The company is obsessed with suckering customers into signing up for rewards cards, and they set a pretty unreasonable goal for how many people you need to sign up in a given day.  We also have to ask customers if they want a Big Lots credit card, as well as let them know about our receipt survey that nobody cares about, which gets really tedious and wastes a lot of time."
bad,"The responsibilities can be hectic at times, but it's a laid back environment overall.  That being said, the company has been changing its positions and removing some, so it's hard to feel comfortable that you're secure in your job."
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company. The entire reason I left my other job to come here was for better work/life balance. It actually turned out to be worse. I was taken advantage of constantly because I was always willing to work. Eventually, it was just too much. I was not even able to take care of simple day to day activities at home. They just tell you what you want to hear."
bad,"I was a Assistant Manager. In the year and half I worked at big lots I had three different Store Team Leaders. The DTL only came to our store 4 times while I worked there. However she was able to do her monthly reviews on the store from home. When the last STL quit his job in September. It was only the operations manager, Furniture Lead and me to run the store in the 4th quarter. We produce the best numbers in sales, credit cards, lease to purchase, increase in sales, big coverage, and  customer survey scores in her District. Both the operations manager and I applied for the STL position. We were told we would not be successful in the roles as STL. When asked if we she felt we would not be successful as STL why did she leave us alone for the entire 4th quarter. She had no answer. Basically the DTL makes judgements on managers without visiting the store or actually getting to know her team."
bad,Every day at Big Lots was different. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to all the different customers through the day. Other than that I would not recommend this job.
bad,"My personal experience at Big Lots was that I couldn't live on the wage they were willing to pay. Also, as the single employee responsible for manning the furniture department many days, I was expected to wait on customers in the store and do inventory-related duties in the basement and see to the loading of orders at the back door of the warehouse, all at the same time, which meant constant trips up and down the stairs and a lot of customers waiting their turn for long periods of time."
bad,"I was in a very difficult position and finally had to leave the company due to management issues."
bad,Biglots only cares about the new employees. There is no set schedule and they dont like to tell you when your leaving intil its time to leave. The y dont mind lieing to you the employee. Its a good job for about a year or so after that you find your self work a dead end job.
bad,"Its alright, the coworkers are great to get along, management was good on some managers not all. Hours are unfair and unequal for everyone. Your schedule is never steady even if you have specific times you wish to work or can work. only good benefits are the 20% discount. Don't take this job serious."
bad,I have been working for them for years yet I am only getting 4 hours a week wile brand new hires get more despite nobody telling me I was doing an unsatisfactory job and directly asking for more hours.
bad,Early morning truck unloading. Working hours were inconsistent and wage too low for the amount of work required. The hardest part was staying enthused to continue to work in the environment.
bad,"just simpl work nothing hard.the managers were alright people.i learn something every day so it really didn't teach me anything I alrealdy knew.the people were great to work around,there was nothing hard about the job.and I enjoyed interacting with others."
bad,"The job is easy if you're stock seeing as there almost no consequences for your actions there in regards to destroying product or the rack and the break you can take as you please. "
bad,"Working for Big Lots was.... an experience to say the least. While I learned how to operate a cash register, stock shelves, invoice items, etc. One of my managers was awful. He would yell at me in front of customers (before I even had decent training) and if I wasn't doing anything for a second, he would scold me for not doing anything. They would not train me to do anything else besides work on the register. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my awful manager. Retail is generally simple so I had no difficulty with the actual work."
bad,Unrealistic expectations for a low volume high profit organization. Store management teams are hard working and really care for the customers. Big Lots has a challenge finding a place in the retail big box family.
bad,"the work is nice, the people are nice. I was a furniture associate building floor displays was always a joy. assisting customers with their purchases is just one of the requirements."
bad,A typical day at big lots starts bright and early as we are pretty busy from the moment we open until the time that we close. We have several repeat customers that know me as well as most of my staff by first name as they come in here 3-4 times a week to shop for their everyday needs.
bad,"The job was ok,I liked my job it was just bad hours, and the pay was not my enjoyment but it was fine tho I loved it. Overall a pleasant environment to work in."
bad,"As a customer service sales employee, you can be a cashier or stock shelves You also are expected to help customers find items, answer questions and fill in where ever needed"
bad,Underpaid and over worked. Had to wake up at 5 a.m. to unload trucks every Monday and Tuesday and then be expected to return to a normal schedule for the rest of the week. Only received $0.50 raise every 6 months and starting wage is mandatory minimum. Weekends work was mandatory and I believe that it would become more lenient with seniority. Very high turnover rate.
bad,I have been at this job for a while and this job really don't appreciate their employees. Lack of communication skills to employees (Supervisors and Management). There are departments who do strenuous work that should get paid more than what they should. They don't give us a cost of living raise. You would have to work anywhere from 10-15 years there just to top out. The hardest part of the job is wondering what rules Management is gonna come up with next. They really make it difficult to come to work everyday. The only enjoyable part of my job is socializing with my coworkers during breaks
bad,"Obviously, with retail, a ""typical"" day varies with season, day of the week, etc. It could be packed to the walls with customers, or a snorefest. Managers tend to be laid back enough that you don't dislike them, but not so much that nothing gets done. Your fellow associates will obviously vary greatly, but anyone who sticks around tends to value doing things well on the job. Unfortunately, Big Lots doctrine demands that stores essentially stay understaffed; a single person calling in will throw the entire store into dire straits."
bad,Learn hard work. How unload and load trunks.Work with a team. And start from nothing to something. Great people to work with.
bad,Working at this company has been full of chaos and disarray of planning sent down from corp. Most of the employees have been extremely fun to work with and hard working as well.
bad,"typical work day is usually hectic. It's all about muti tasking. You sometimes have to do three task at the same time. I have to manage my cashiers, and make sure the customer is serviced."
bad,Company have limited option to grow due to limited SAP products.
bad,Not knowing what mood everyone is in or not knowing what the store will be before you begin your shift. got along with all my co-workers and most of the management that I met and worked with while i was employed. Hardest part of work is getting through the holidays and the most enjoyable time there was getting together with co-workers who like to go out and be yourself kind of evening with those you work with.
bad,It was alright but meh. Days were long. I didn't really learn that much. Management was sub-par at best. Co workers were strange.
bad,"Overall just like any job it has it's up's and down's to it. The co-workers are usually good people but as you know there will always be a few to rock the boat. "
bad,"The stores are in older buildings and usually the floors are dirty, boxes on the floor that customers had to walk around, HR and OSHA rules broken almost daily to accomplish goals. "
bad,"It was ok in the beginning, the manager that hired me was great. The employees were great to work with. But when they changed manager's that's when I didn't like the job anymore. I wasn't getting enough hours anymore. The new manager was the type to hire his friends before he would give any part time employee the opportunity to get on full time."
bad,"Big Lots is a good company to work for, however they do work long hours and its not clement controlled. And management do not get paid overtime pay. So there are weeks we work 60 hours and only getting paid for 48."
bad,"Big Lots is an easy company to work for. However that being said, they do not care at all about their employees. You are just a tool to help the company make profits. If you jeopardize the profits in any way they will show no hesitation to get rid of you rather than help teach you and build you as an individual."
bad,"it's a nice place to work for, but its not a place to stay at for multiple years, unless you're management."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is not having a support from the company to achieve results that are realistic to the present time, associates with years of service making almost the same of money as the ones recently hired."
bad,My 2 years I've worked here I experienced more management changes than I can count. Inconsistent hours. No room for Full Time unless you get to be management. Which is highly unlikely as they will hire you as a Temp Manager for six months and then hire someone extremely less qualified than you. It's a terrible job to stay for awhile so only go if you need temporary employment
bad,"Our Regional Manager would not allow anyone but Full-time employees to be scheduled for more than 20 hours per week to make sure that you didn't get over 30 hours by filling in for others. Pay level is about a dollar or so per hour less than what other local retail pays. The schedule is different every week. You have to put in requests two weeks in advance to make sure you will be off on a certain day. This can effect how many hours you get that week. Sometimes management can fix that, sometimes not. Staffing is often short, making it a hard day and difficult to get breaks."
bad,Typical day at work is running register and or stocking shelves. I learned how to be a people person. Management is wonderful until you get to a district level. Hardest part was not enough hours. Best part was working with people I really cared about.
bad,"I found the work hard compared to the wages they paid. Over all the job was okay.I had a great manager, so it made it easier . I stayed for 2 years. I was given the pets department and hardware to restock along with running register ."
bad,"i enjoyed the 20 percent employee discount on anything from that store."
bad,"fun good management vary easy job "
bad,It’s was a good places to start some work experience but not a career. It was a very helpful job. It’s helped me learn a lot about warehouse work. The good thing about this job is you do get to take a good amount of breaks. You do get to work at your own pace. The only thing I didn’t really like was that you didn’t get that much hours and the pay essentially that good.
bad,"I started as unloading and stocking. after that, they put me on a till. then had me selling furniture. so with in months I've and the a managers job open up. and of course they give it to a new guy. even though I could run the store, they were short staff and people would weather apply for the managers spot then being a stock boy."
bad,My typical day would be clocking in at 7:00A.M. and ending at 6:00P.M. The people that work there is real understanding.
bad,"Cashier,Customer Service, Retail Unload Trucks Was Working Here For Only A Month Was A Part Time Job WIth Minimum Wage Pay At 7.40"
bad,This is a decent place to work the only problem i had was some weeks you will only have 4 hours of work while the next you could have 36.
bad,I really didn't like the hours they were giving me but the people who I worked with was great but they don't offer enough hours for their employees.
bad,"a typical day at work is ringing purchases,answering the phone and basically helping customers as needed.I have learned a lot of things and i am also in the stock crew where i have defibitely learned a great deal.Management is okay,and most of the employees are great to work with.The hardest part of the job is dealing irate customers and the enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers."
bad,Big lots is a good company to work for but the hours on the job will drop or the pay will drop. You will got from doing 30 to 40 hours a week to doing 6 to 12 hours a week. It’s not good at all
bad,I like to work and I work hard I just not really into warehouse things but if I have to do it I have no problem getting up and doing it but to be honest warehouse work is not my  dream career
bad,big lots is a decent place to shop but they are an unorganized team and we are given these walkie talkies for communication to speed things up and they hardly like to use them so it takes longer to get customers they stuff
bad,"it was fine but this wants me to keep typing stuff so I will, it wasnt horrible nor was it great, it seemed like it would be ok if you dont mind working at a fast pace all the time"
bad,Not many hours and need a second job. Very fast paced working environment. Management very demanding. Multitasking is a must have and weekly pay. The customers were my favorite part of coming into work.
bad,The store I worked at was garbage poor communication with the team and management will single people out. And if you're male good luck they make you lift all the heavy and bulky furniture by yourself the pay just really isn't what it should be for all the work they pile on you.
bad,"Worked here, it was a good place but overall the new management has made the place horrible.  I would not suggest anyone working there as a career its more of a high schoolers job."
bad,Working at this company was a challenge a bit annoying. Very strict. Friendly when want to be. Not many people stay. But that’s when I worked there. :)
bad,"Customers, 85% of the time, were rude and demanded they always speak to a manager"
bad,Anyone looking for a permanent position i would have to not recomend due to lack of pay and not always keeping the word they promise to you but great for a high school job.
bad,Big lots is a friendly environment and is a good place to work at they are good with hours around seasonal time but after that they cut your hours down
bad,"Working at Big lots was relatively slow and was tedious over all, it was a place that didn't have much room for growth and above all they decided to cut back my hours which was a clear indication for me to move on to a more beneficial work place."
bad,Very great place they treat you like family very great hours with overtime 30 min lunch break  very easy to come to work an be relaxed I give good advice for big lots
bad,"Lots of standing on your feet, the pay is low, and the hours are poor.  The people that work there are nice enough it's just that you hardly make any money by working there.  You make at a maximum of $300 per week which is pittants, because it's really hard to live off of $1200 a month, maximum.  And that's standing on your feet on a concrete floor the whole time, so your feet get real sore after 4 hours."
bad,"Dinosaur ordering and record keeping systems. Security also fell way short with no real help. However,I loved the direction they were headed in at that time."
bad,Management did not treat you with much respect.  There wasn't much of a workplace culture. Everyone mostly just kind of kept to themselves.  I would always sit in my car during lunch.
bad,"would not recommend working here. dont waste your time, only benefit is the employee discount. management only looks out for themselves and raises are horrible"
bad,"Working the register, and putting returns away until it's time to switch out to be moved to the Customer service desk for the rest of the work evening. I learned real quick I knew how to multi task. A few people that are part of Management needed to be let go."
bad,Flexible hours for busy schedules. Slow paced but crowd comes in waves. Management is very friendly. Costumers can be out of hand but you learn how to handle hard situations.
bad,They don't pay enough neither do they giive you enough hours to make it through next pay. No one is allowed to go pass 30 hours weekly unless you are a manager
bad,Thursday I learned how to be a better salesman. The Management was unorganized. The hardest part was moving the furniture with out any trainng. Get to meet new people
bad,Working at big lots was a new experience for me working in Warehouse settings. We was required to unload semi trucks on to a belt at a alarming paste but work was easy.
bad,"I couldn't get any more than 28 hours a week as much as I asked since I am a single mother of a 1st grader. They wouldn't give it to me and during the holidays, the cut my hours to less than 10 a week. I couldn't even afford to travel there."
bad,This place give you number to bonus that you won't hit also send truck that won't fit no help form upper management and no real ideal how they orde so skocking is heard
bad,Had a great work experience with all of mgmt. and co-workers. This is good job to have as a starter job or entry level pt second job. I do not regret having worked for this company.
bad,Poor Management. you'll make a few friends though. The pay was decent until they switched over to the manhattan system.
bad,The hours were inconsistent. Freight starts at 4 and freight members also work closing shifts as cashiers. They'll put you on 6 days a week and you'll still work less than 30 hours.
bad,There are very interesting associates. The customers were enjoyable. Management was okay. There's a great discount and always low prices.
bad,"Big Lots Assistant Team Leaders are not leads at all. Basically saddled with tasks and grunt work.  Stocking shelves, unloading trucks and building displays."
bad,"The customers were great. I enjoyed being able to assist customers in finding what they needed. I was exposed to situations that I had not previously experienced, and grew as and individual."
bad,I always busted my tail when i went to work and   still  got treated bad. i say the  co workers would agree.
bad,Good place to start off getting work experience. Some Management makes it hard to work for Big Lots.
bad,"A typical day at this job is just waiting on customers, cashing them out and enjoying in light conversation. I learned how to be fast and efficient and gained experience in multi-tasking. Management was ok some more willing to help and engage then others. Hardest part of this was the lifting of products. Most enjoyable was being out on the floor putting stock away and being able to engage with guests and help them if needed."
bad,"I was not there very long, but as I was there I ran the cash register, helped customers, stocked shelves, and cleaned restrooms. The management and fellow co-workers were very helpful and tried to help me when I needed. The hardest part was learning the cash register when I first started.  The most enjoyable part was seeing all the customers and working with the employees."
bad,"My typical job responsibilities include the following: Merchandising product already on the floor, stocking the shelves with product received from trucks (free-range merchandising), register, recovering the store at night"
bad,The management in the store that I worked at played favoritism with the employees. He would schedule unfairly.
bad,The company as a whole needs to improve accountability actions. When a single manager is performing while others are not it becomes more than frustrating to the one who's performing. Let your store managers run their business
bad,Working at big lots was interesting. The job itself was okay. The workers were nice and I enjoyed working with them. The managers had no sense in how to manage a store like that.
bad,Big Lots is a good place to work I enjoyed the coworkers and greeting the customers everyday they were aways nice and I enjoyed doing my job by working well with my peers and doimg my daily duties
bad,hardest part of the job is being short handed and never having enough hours to get the job done. Best part of the job was the employees. No matter how hard it gets we all try to boost each other up.
bad,good work place I would highly tell anyone they will feel good and nice place to work and good people to be around cant say nothing bad just all postive
bad,I found the management very abrasive. Store managers give out instructions for things to get done but then tend to sit in the office. And that is true for store managers at many locations.
bad,The job was okay got boring real fast especially when rhings got slow. The manager i was working with was no fun either especially when i was new to the crew
bad,"I enjoyed working at Big lots, it helped to grow and learn things, I didn't know how to do. The people I worked with was very friendly and helped when you needed it."
bad,"I think its a good company to work for,but you really can not move up    a typical day is hard and productive you can learn a lot management is good depends on the day"
bad,"A typical  day at work is helping customers find items that they need, and making sure they have a good. I have learned how to merchandise, recover, and run a front end of any store. The management team is great. Were not only coworkers but we act as a family. I get along with all my managers and they all show what worth ethic is really all about. My co-workers were just as hard working as the managers if not more. We have fewer hours than the mangers do so we have to do more with less and for the most part everyone succeeds on it. Hardest part of the job for me is not being able move up in the company after the new policies were put into place. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people you got to meet along with the co-workers I got to see!"
bad,"As a part time employee and being in high-school, it was a great place to work. I was not getting paid much but at the time it really did not matter. Management was great and I learned great customer service skills along with how to be a cashier.The hardest part about my job was unloading trucks.The best part about my job was working with the customers."
bad,unorganized but friendly customers and coworkers. love that you spend more time on floor than actually what you were hired to do
bad,"Company guidelines seem to come from a group of people who have never set foot in any of their stores.  The job was stressful beyond my ability to handle.  The pay and benefits are excellent, more than competitive but cannot compensate for the amount of stress endured."
bad,"Used to be 12 hour shift, but I think it is 8 hours now. When I worked there I worked from 3am-3pm and sometimes 6 days a weeks. turnover rate is high and if you have no life you will love this slaving job"
good,I worked there for nearly 6 years. Your raises were never consistent. One year you'd get 50 cents the next 19 cents. They don't pay their staff enough for the work they do. They treat you like machines there's no longevity working there.
good,"Overall rating a 3 because  management."
good,"I get maybe 20 hours a week. Sometimes work for only 3 hours a day. They are great people, dont get me wrong, but they hours suck and you have to do everything from stock, furniture, front desk, cashier. You dont have just one position"
good,Good place to work but unless DM likes you no place for advancement
good,Advancement none-benifits very little hourly job no future just a pay check
good,Nothing negative to say. The company is big on getting rewards and at times threaten employess with write ups. Also if your sick they frown apon it. Overall decent place to work
good,"This job was great when I started. Anytime someone would call out I was the one they would call to come in and cover the shift. Then when I became sick and had to take care of my kids and move all at the same time, it was a problem. I was every active with the customers and made sure my job was completed before my shift was over."
good,"Ive been working at Big Lots for a few weeks now and I HATE IT. In the beginning I actually liked the job. It seemed to me as if everyone worked equally and it would be smooth work days. I WAS WRONG! Managers disappear and smoke cigarettes by the loading dock instead of doing their job, if you're new they pinpoint YOU when things go wrong, the training process if very limited and literally a day long at the most, THE PAY SUCKS for the nonsense you deal with on a day to day basis. I love my customers but I HATE my coworkers. I asked to be cross trained and was given the runaround on who to ask about, who can actually approve it, and yet I still haven't heard anything back since. Everything is so unorganized and I'm looking for a new job now! IF YOU'RE 16 THIS JOB IS PERFECT FOR YOU BUT IF YOU ARE AN ADULT....DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
good,Things in the store need to be handled better the management is not always on the same page with things and the workers dont always listen and act professionally
good,Employees and managers were enjoyable to work with. Constanty having to get called in to work on my day off because people would call in sick every single day.
good,"after 3 years of dedicated customer service work for BL i had to quit and check myself into a psych ward. management was abusive and unkind and worked everyone to their deaths, without any real reward"
good,When I was hired on it was for a specific position with few added duties here and there on occasion when asked by management team of which I enjoyed working for very much and very friendly welcoming environment but about 7 months into it everything changed and went downhill unfortunately.   That's when I had to remove myself from that disaster.
good,Big Lots owns its own stock and can be  a great place to work if the manager of the location is willing to make the atmosphere a good place.  Not too bad.
good,slow paced work place. there is no room for advancing in the company. barely would get any hours a week to work at most 30. also the manager was horrible.
good,"no hours,nothing to say low paying job with no benafits did not like the job, no vacation pay no over time mag was rude act if they didnt care that i had a wife n kids"
good,Asset protection was near non-existent. Repeat shoplifters would frequent the store. The manager held back employees that were efficient and excelled in customer service. Not a great place to work! No promotional opportunities.
good,"schedule would get changed and no one would let everyone know so there was a lot of confusion with scheduling. For the most part everyone was very friendly and would work well together. A lot of items that would be in weekly sales advertised, we would not get a lot of these items for sales which upset a lot of customer's and they would not issue rain checks."
good,"Over all not a bad place to work, but they treat their employees as tho they are expendable. They also did not care nor try to work with their employees when life problems came up."
good,As the team leader I enjoyed working with my own team of 4 women and to list out all of the day duties to make sure the store is full of products and customers and assisted.
good,Working for this company wasnt too bad. I always stayed busy rather if it was helping the customers or stocking the Shelves.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers
good,"The customers was the only thing that got me excited about working everyday. The pay was low, the management was terrible and the employees did not have good customer service skills."
good,"I worked there for a few months are they do not work with your schedule even when you ask, the store itself is very messy and they do not keep up on their dates on the food. The people barely get training if any at all. The employees do not like the head supervisor and most of them do not get along. NO Communication. Over all not a bad place to work for as a company but this store needs a TON of work."
good,"Dont care about employees,rude, and disrespectful management! They cut our whole crews hours without notice! Treat people very badly I would never work here again or refer anyone to work at this horrible place"
good,Company moved to a computer generated schedule tool. If you are lucky you may get between 4-20 hours per week. You will never know your next weeks schedule til noon or later Saturday. Upper management is placing too many expectations on store management making them almost useless in day to day operations. Company instituted a mystery shopper program that is almost impossible to score a good shop. Looks like they are trying to weed out good high paying managers with low paid yes men. Keep looking there are better jobs available.
good,"A typical day at work, was miserable. They want you there at 4am to yell at you to unload heavy items in a short period of time, while the managers stand around and gossip."
good,"The Rome, NY Big Lots store is ok to shop at due to the low prices and the employees that are helpful and respectful. "
good,"To work at Big Lots was very nerve wracking. Everyday I went in I was in fear of losing my job because you never knew what mood the manager was in. and if one was to make a mistake your hours would be taken from you. for example, i have ciatica and it was acting up. so i went to work with a doctors note and they cut my hours from almost 36 hours to 8 hours. The managers including the assistant manager make work their life. So they think that it should be the same for everybody there. "
good,"There are better companies to work for. This job is more for a student/retired person. Hours are non existent (except holidays), pay could be better. Management could use training on how to be nicer."
good,My location recently changed management. When I got hired it was a fun environment. Management did their own thing and wasn’t on your back. They felt confident leaving you up front because they knew that u knew what u were doing . If you needed help they were usually around to help you out. Recently management changed FOR THE WORST!!!. Worst new manage EVER
good,"Store managers do not follow a schedule that is given by corporate.  Assistant managers have so much to do most are having to work off the clock to get it done.  Not enough pay, and bonuses should be given quarterly if sales are exceeded from the previous year, not based on everything they just changed to.  They've made it hard and harder to get a bonus every year."
good,I Dislike working a customer service for this company. Because we have to ask all customer to do a survey questionnaire its mandatory. AND WE HAVE TO SIGN CUSTOMERS UP FOR A REWARDS CARD EVERYDAY.
good,"My experience working for Big Lots was a good warehouse to work for at first. Then i would over hear supervisors talking bad on other supervisors. some supervisors were very unprofessional. Workers there love to gossip. i had problems with the women in my department spreading rumors and trying to ""bully"" me. nothing was done to them nor was i ever moved away from them. I was put on leave by HR until my doctor could give me a letter stating my work status. With that I could not get a letter because my doctor hasn't come up with my diagnosis, With that being said they terminated me due to the fact that i couldn't get a letter stating my work status after. while I was still employed with them I tried to apply for unemployment under reduced hours because i was not getting paid for my leave that they put me on. After unemployment contacted them they terminated me. I never got a letter stating my termination by them but from my insurance company by them."
good,"I loved my big lots when I worked there,  I gave everything I had for 3 and a 1/2 years I was 3 different management positions working well over my pay grade, hate that it ended,  Management has went to h*** since"
good,"They required managers to work on all national holidays, my position required almost all closing shifts after I was there for a while but I was originally allowed to work opening and closing shifts and I could only have 1 weekend off per 5 week cycle.  I was originally asked if I was available on weekends thinking they meant some weekend days not every Saturday and Sunday every single week"
good,Wasn’t very happy about working at big lots almost 9 years ago.have never really found a job I legit love working at. There are a few people at every job that make it tolerable for me and wanting to get up everyday for work.
good,"Worked 10 + years in the grocery field, and they have me doing recovery ( face up the store ). The only time I'm aloud to stock the shelves, is when the store manager is off."
good,"Hired to open this store . so worked closely with everyone. once store open people was weeded out. worked there until Christmas or new years and was not given any more hours when manger quested was said o"" you where seasonal. ? hired to open store!"
good,"Was often mistreated. Store manager was not fit for job. My other managers were pretty great. Often, I met great customers and my supervisor was a genuinely great teacher and I learned many of my skills from."
good,Big Lots cares more about the money they make then the people that work there. they were made to come to work in terrible winter conditions . No time for family gatherings the store manager is all about him and not the employee
good,Perfect example of poor pay low hours and poor management. Managers stole product were rude they harassed people and acted like bullies. They played favorites with the schedualing
good,"This job prepared me for the warehouse experience i have now because i would work the Line in the storage room when the trailers would show um with food, furniture, and recreational equipment"
good,"Management is nothing but favoritism. You're told you will receive a raise with your 90 day evaluation, however they don't do the evaluation until about a year and its 25 cent if you're lucky."
good,I knew when I took the job that it was only a seasonal job. But  I took the job for the job experience and to be able to pay my bills at the tome. I enjoy wherever I work.
good,I worked with a great team of people and the customers were a lot of people the used to come in the circle k I worked at so I enjoyed that a lot. The hours weren’t all that great.
good,fast paced helping customers and ensuring freight is on the floor. With the number of managers there seems to be no management of anything. Expected to work hard and fast for little to no money or available hours
good,"I was always early ,never called out unless very sick always did my job and loved helping the customers and always made them feel welcome .My true belief is taken care of customers."
good,"I feel like you , can’t really get any where there they don’t want to pay you more. if they offer you a positions they don’t want to give you benefits."
good,"The job of associate manager was fun at times, challenging at times, there was not a lot of support from upper management when it came to directing better customer service."
good,only worked 15 hours a week but constantly had openings for the same position i had and that is all i have to say about this company  .........................................................................
good,Tried to make it as fun as possible although the rules were ridiculous and the pay sucked no way I could survive with out government help working there
good,"Poorly managed (corporate doesn't allow on site managers to order inventory so most items run empty while others are overflowing due)"
good,"Its a good job, a great place to work. I just wish it could have more structure and balance to the people and persons in charge. With that being said at the time we had no real set person running things correctly with everyone following their lead. Instead it was a handful of managers running it there own way on set nights."
good,"During my time here, I saw many employees as well as management come and go. The compensation was not worth the stress the job demanded."
good,"The over all job experience would have been rewarding if the management hadn't been terrible. The Store Manager can not and will not keep his word to any employee, his assistant managers are too busy socializing to recognize a good employee, and there are not enough hours due to an excessive amount of new hires."
good,"I would describe a typical day at Big Lots as completely uneventful unless it was during the holiday season. My job was to maintain the furniture department's sales goals as well as cleanliness. Since this location worked with a skeleton crew, it was also my duty to supervise incoming shipments and process inventory checks. The hardest part about this job was dealing with multitudes of people during the holiday season with literally 3 other employees on staff. By ""multitudes"", I mean literally 150 people at a time. Whether they were fighting each other very the last electronic Xmas tree , or arguing with a another shift manager about the lack of staff on hand, this location was a hand full. That never really dampened my spirits though. the work area was challenging but it served a purpose. one learns patience when dealing with this many people at a time. Not just with the customer, but also with fellow co-workers who you feel might not be working with 100% effort. Customers who see that you're doing your very best to accommodate their needs not only establish trust in you & opinion but also  puts them at ease and calms calamitous situations. That was probably the best part of the work day. Putting customers at ease and establishing a rapport with them made my work load much easier."
good,"management was extremely childish, a lot of favoritism, seemed as though raises were based on looks, management cared very little about employees"
good,Be prepared to handle 5 tasks at once.  The stores are severely understaffed at all times.  Management is too busy doing the jobs of associates to perform their own duties. Only managers are offered full time employment. Hours are sparse and most of the payroll is used on evening or weekend shifts.
good,I would unload trucks and stock shelves and assemble furniture.
good,"When I started big lots I love it. Until, the GM came back from vacation and thats when I learned why big lots is always hiring. She was very rude, disrespected, and the language the came out of mouth was just unbearable."
good,early morning off loading and stocking the merchandise.
good,was a ok place to work for like cashiering and meeting new people.
good,I enjoyed myself at this particular store but there was some favortism towards some employees and those particular employees would receive more hours but management told the staff that was questioning hours that he only had STRAP hours to give which would be 7 to 10 hours for the week.
good,Not the worst retail job but not the best. Tend to expect too much in such a short amount of time. Not the best at training. Shotty inconsistent hours. Great co-workers.
good,Started as a regular part time cashier and got promoted to furniture manager fairly quickly after that. Loved the job but management made the job unbearable got hurt on the job and broke my ankle about 6 months into my promotion was out due to that for a few months the week I came back they fired me. managers and coworkers Stealing merchandise made the atmosphere hostile and cruel
good,Managers are awful. Mine seemed uninterested in his position and it’s duties and just talked on the phone in the back of the store. There is virtually no training and they just expect you to know everything.
good,It  was a good place to work at first and then they started cutting hours so it made it very hard to make a pay check and management was really poor and not fair to all there workers.
good,I worked overnight as a stock and replenish associate. Our job was very fast paced and stressful. There was stress on our mind and bodies. I made some friends. We worked hard but we didn't get paid enough for what we were doing.
good,The store just got remodeled which was great. However the working environment is lacking communication between team members. Also one of the managers acts like a Drill Sargent and has caused a hostile work environment. Members talk badly about their fellow team members. The store I work at is always disorganized and floor most of the time is not swept. Employees where I work don't know what it means to be a team player. It is a HOT MESS!
good,I worked her for over a year when I had a great manager who was really understanding. When I got sick with a bad kidney infection I didn’t know about yet he let me stay home for a week. The second week I got hospitalized & he was understanding about it. When my water broke at 20 weeks he understood too & let me come back as soon as I had the baby at 29 weeks. One day I didn’t get my schedule no more & when I found out I called the store & my previous manager wasn’t working there no more. I tried reaching out to the manager to ask about my schedule & he wouldn’t talk to me. I went to the store to ask & he said I was never on the system. One of the gay managers that worked there never liked me & always tried to bully me so maybe he was the reason why I didn’t get my schedule no more. You get a 30% discount. The managers will try to force you to work at 4am as a stocker when they don’t have stockers. My manager would ask if I wanted to but I will always tell him only if he paid me more. I got paid 9.50 the hour & the manager was really understanding on how many hours I wanted to work & what times. New managements nowadays are really mean & unfair.
good,Over all Big Lots is not a bad place to work. All the associates are nice and friendly. Everyone is a team player. There are two good managers. There is one manager that Is inappropriate at times and hard to work with.
good,"Moving lots of items with machine assistance and annoying workers that harassed me, there were some good people there but it seemed everyone just put up with annoying ones. Would work in a similar environment"
good,Good job to work at very easy and fun. Just was the store manager was horrible the company was an ok company will I work there again sure but another location
good,"I enjoyed working there as far as the work part and the fact that you could go do your work without having anyone steadily looking over your shoulder. They however, showed alot of favortism.  There was also racial discrimination and alot of employees not doing their job.  They would get onto one employee for something then not say anything to the next person doing the same thing."
good,Pay is low and not many hours. Always doing other people's job and picking up the slack. Had a hard time getting more hours. Go to the point where i despised going to work.
good,I enjoyed working for big lots but they didnt have the hours to give umless you were managment and for the work you do not enough money unloading trucks and stocking at crazy hours 8.00 an hour is not enough
good,New experience in retail.  company is all ways changing to must be able to change with it.  Very demanding job and stressful.  Something new every day and work life balance is hard to manage
good,I was not given a box opener at all while i worked there. The managers were not very understanding of my needs as an employee. There were two people in the entire staff who were kind to me.
good,"In working for this company I personally feel I have grown in learning to know how certain things are run throughout the company. It has broaden my aspects of what its like to work in the retail environment and has provided me with what I need in life, however I am looking to advance in life an have a better role in the workforce."
good,I enjoyed working in the Grants Pass store and I got along very well with management and made a lot of friends there. The store was always kept neat and clean. The Bend store was okay but not as friendly or clean and neat as the Grants Pass store is.
good,Managers spend too much time on the cell phones and the hours are real bad that you get And you get threatene when you ask for help from the other am stocker.
good,If you have never worked in retail before then it wouldn't be so bad. If you have you will not like it. It sucks that when you work there you can get 4-29 hrs a week & you find out your schedule for the week Saturday for the following week which starts the next day. Most of the people are so nice. You do get paid weekly :).
good,It did not have steady hours and enough hours to live on. The hours were always changing. One day you work days and the next you work nights. You spend your day moving stuff all around the store. Nothing stays in the same place for more than 24 hours.
good,Big lots would be a much better company if it wasn't for the management ... very unorganized.. lack of care and understanding for employees and their families.. nothing is consistent not even your work days and hours.. changes every week sometimes everyday.
good,I have only been employed here for a short time but I enjoy going to work my coworkers welcomed me as part of the team and have been very friendly
good,Get along well with other enjoy working with my co-workers. A typical day at big lots is unloading trucks or stocking or cashiering
good,Big Lots provided lots of opportunities for customer interaction. They needed more of a team environment. Other wise things ran smoothly.
good,Typical night at big lots is recovering the store. The most enjoyable part is when customers let me know how good the store looks since I  have been there.
good,"Store manager can barely manage it seems most days. Schedule is written and out less than one day before the next work week, and at times he has to change the work schedule because he didn't check the times when the truck arives. My hours got cut after disclosing the information of my pregnancy. The store manager and I discussed  my shift being moved from early morining to evening and he made it sound as if it was going to happen, yet my hours got cut instead and I am still on the same early morning schedule."
good,"It was fun working at Big Lots, part time and easy money for school and books. It was my first job and it was very excited to find something on my own that will open my doors to bettrer opportunities in the future."
good,"assisting customers with furniture purchaces and check out, as well as setting floor plans, selling credit cards, and daily store up keep."
good,"unorganized management"
good,"A typical day consisted of ringing, returns, answering the phone, and searching for items for the costumer.  Daily I completed transactions dealing with money, credit/debit cards and checks. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers. I've had costumers tell me I have the best attitude for the job and I go above and beyond to get them what they need. The people at Big Lots are like a family. Because it's only a handful of people it was like a close knit family, everybody knew each."
good,"I enjoyed the time spent working here with my co-workers. The customers were nice, and the job was not terrible. The management was poor, and I sometimes had to help my manager count down his drawer at the end of the night."
good,"well in the morning i have alot of things i need to do when we open. like fill out paper work and count the money, write off things that are broken. after all that is done i check out customers and do returns. the hard thing to do is when my manger is in a bad mood he tends to complain alot."
good,"I enjoyed work with differet people every day, but the night shift and work in the warehouse was very hard. The managent was not shore of running the copany so it became very hard to do my job completly"
good,The big lots store was a brand value store that has great skills. It has a career builder that you defineately can see the career side streamline and growth possiblities. The job pay could be better and the balance needs improvements but the job is well-trained.
good,It's a job. Been there almost 5 years not much potential for advancement.
good,They try to help out as much as they can with the issues you are having at work.... Sometimes they were resolved and sometimes they weren't.... You have great spirutv when you get in there ....I did love the fact that I was able to work on my own for the most part I felt like I was doing something.....
good,Not to many hours involved unless you can work day and night .Laid back and relaxed typical day. Most holidays and 20% off friends and family days draw in a big crowd. Management is normally pretty good with flexibility as long as you let them no b4 hand.
good,Big Lots was a great place to work. I never had a problem if I had to call in or had an emergency. The work itself was easy and everyone knew their set jobs and how to go about their business. The only reason I left was I began college and could not fit three jobs as well as classes into my schedule.
good,Would be a good job for a student or someone who doesn't need a lot of pay. Only management gets hours. Discount is great. Not much room for advancement
good,"Constantly short staffed due to high turn over. Minimum wage and lack of hours. The Store Mgr lacked any leadership skills and there was also alot of drama. Upon hire, I received GREAT training At another store but it was a tough job when I didn't have enough unloaders or for merch resets Or stockers to replenish inventory. VERY STRESSFUL AND HECTIC JOB. Employees didn't receive enough recognition at our store either. I always made a point to acknowledge any pudding work"
good,This company has high turnover rates at the associate level. Unrealisitic deadlines for task completion. Not enough manpower to change their seasonal selections. Overall this company is very stressful at the management positions and unfair pay for store level associates.
good,"I began cashiering as temporay during holidays. My original store manager allowed me yo pick up hours and I showed him I was reliable and hard working. He put me up for advancement very quickly. I began in the furniture area and excelled at signing up rewards members and selling protection plans for furniture. I was rewarded with gift cards to Big Lots. When he decided to venture elsewhere once he felt was wrongly over looked in advancenent, he pushed for my advancement. I enjoyed the customer interactions daily, and the commodity of fellow employees. I also enjoyed being able to assemble furniture and being heard and my ideas being considered and weighed. Unfortunately in some areas my personality and standards of behavior clashed with others as well as fellow management, that cliques became obvious and favoritism. I tried to maintain best I could but being pulled away from my duties to finish or completely do others made me fall behind, and then the attitudes toward me and snide comments boiled me that I on 2 occasions exploded and stood up for myself and the facts at hand whether it was up against multiple managers and the new store manager. I was very embarrassed and even though I had the controversial conversations in appropriate area away from customers, I still felt embarrassed and as if I were in the wrong. The manager i replaced went on maternity leave and  ig Lots had me in a temporary status as furniture lead. I was made to wait for longer than originally defined and agreed upon when I took the job. Once it was finally in process I then got told that corporate was"
good,the job is okay for starting out and experience but it's not somewhere you want to stay long term. management was all over the place. Customer service was poor and the pay was low
good,"I’ve been with the company for three years and not once in those three years was my work ethic called to question until the newest manager. It was a great place to work and had fun doing it but it became hostile and more of a chore than anything else. Losing hours and insulted behind my back by someone who is suppose to be in charge. Screw that place, I would’ve and have recommended it two years back. Wouldn’t even bother now"
good,Very stressful for some positions while others are a breeze. Depending on what the store manager has plans for you may have to close 4 to 5 times a week cause she doesn't want to. Favoritism is off the chain and once one person knows something about you everyone will because they don't seem to understand what confidential means.
good,"I unloaded the trucks and restocked the shelves. Not having any stocking experience, unloading 3 pallets per hour and stocking the shelves was very difficult."
good,Impossible scheduling never consistantly a certain day or time work every holiday only day closed is Christmas does not care if you have children you will miss every holiday birthday because of how they schedule is made
good,the environment was nice but the management was not tolerable because they refused to give me the hours i asked and sincerely deserved. They only gave me 4 hours a week which was way less than the rest of my employees
good,"The role model for store manager was a poor example if they wanted better productive employees then they should get a supportive managment, the customer a were the best I've ever encountered"
good,Its ok to work if your just need a little extra money. The district manager is not great don't like to hire women for managing a store and if he do give them the worst stores in the district basically setting them up to fail. not for you if your looking for a career great for someone starting out or in school
good,They will over work you and not show any acknowledgment. They change your schedule without notice. i would have to close then come right back in to open the store at 5am
good,"Generally I work in every department. I am trained in furniture, cashier, floor and DTS crew. It seems the turn over rate is fairly poor. I have only been here for 5 months and I've witnessed change in management to 6 crew members leaving. I am not quite sure if it is just my store in particular, but the atmosphere is a bit toxic. Management will not listen to their employees and we don't get any benefits unless you are a full time employee which only includes management. We are not being heard about what we need in order to do our job correctly and not hiring quality employees. No drug tests and I feel should be done due to the amount of coworkers I have witnessed not sober during work. Overall I feel a lot needs to be changed in order to make this place even a little welcoming."
good,"Nothing notable to share.  I worked at 2 different locations, the first was very well managed.  The store manager was engaging and involved in all areas of the store.  This particular location had a team working environment.  The second location was poorly managed.  The manager spent most of his time in the office, and was only at the location during the mornings.  Rarely saw the manager interacting with employees or customers."
good,The management was not very good.  There was a lot of favoritism that was being investigated by corporate. The shifts were really inconsistent.  The hours were not consistent either.
good,"It’s a stressful and unfriendly work environment, to many people focused on what they are doing and not interacting enough with customers or each other, in order to work like a team you have to become one all the family and community talk and there is none of that inside the company. When dealing with customers an employee should feel privileged to assist with there needs. It’s hard to love your job in such a stressful work environment, there are to many goals and expectations put on one person"
good,I moved to a part time stocking position after relocating to NE from FL as a full time assistant store manager. The store was in a bad area and a disaster. Lack of management was apparent and saw no resolutions. Only 1 of 2 stores in the area.
good,"The duties were a bit too tedious for my pay rate, but eventually it became second nature. At first, my hours were pretty flexible until I ended up changing my schedule due to school. And then my hours were cut too low, and my paycheck represented that. I ended up leaving because of it and management were rude and very judgemental. all in all, a learning curve/experience."
good,"I like working at this company because i love interacting with diffrent people . the experance was great , but the hours and the pay wasnt enough. The manager didnt seems to know much about managing."
good,"A typical workday is helping customers with their needs. Making sure the store is clean and in working order. Can be fun with the right manager. The customers can get a bit cranky, but other than that it's a decent job."
good,"I also work at Lowes in Zanesville, Ohio so Big Lots work's around there hours cause I make more money a hour there Big Lots only give a raise once a year and so I have not got mine yet."
good,Not a bad job.  Not hard they just expect you to work mixed schedules. They also will use you for holidays and then cut you to 12 to 15 hours a week.  The managers have a lot of drama between them selves.
good,"A typical day at Big Lots consisted of running back and forth from stocking shelves and manning the registers. There were a couple of nice employees that i got along with, as well as customers. We would try to set customers up for Big Lots Reward cards that they could use for discounts on items and also get weekly emails regarding the new upcoming sales."
good,"I was happy to work for Big Lots, I was at costumer service helping the costumers, with final sales and returns, I enjoyed working with the public also I liked my Managers."
good,Really enjoyed working but just couldnt get the hires. Taken care of the customers am making their needs to what they needed an making sure they was happy when they left the store..
good,They work you short shifts. At the end of the week you may end up with only 20 hours. Part Time Job for the most part. They don't pay good at all. My paychecks were small.
good,"The coworkers are decent, the managers are bullies.  Complaining does nothing. Twenty percent our your purchase,  weekly pay.  Still open snow days and holidays."
good,was a good productive place for experience.work days were not that decent needed more days in schedule to make it a more flexible and financial support.
good,a typical day at work consisted of opening or closing the store. Operating a cash register if there were lines. Processing customer returns. Merchandising the products on the shelves. Management had poor communication. They do not stick to company policies. The hardest part of working there was getting stuff that needed to be done being the store was short handed. The best part of working here was working the night shifts.
good,"Bad management."
good,Still building to become a  Big Box competitive retailer with a Small Box mentality. Definitely a stepping stone company but not a lot of upward mobility. If you go to a Store Manager position it is very difficult to move up.
good,"good place to work, hours are too low for a work week ,good interaction with customers and job skills/freight skills also."
good,Position was exactly what it advertised. Temporary help during the holiday season.  Sometimes there wasn't enough staff to help with  holiday deliveries
good,"Lack of attention towards co-workers, unprofessional, use of profanity, unhappy customers, messy, exp. dates on most items, managers would joke around instead of focusing on their work."
good,"Friendly environment, but not much room for advancement. Specifically set for individuals who do not want very many hours to work"
good,"The managers are rude, and have no common sense. And don't care about your personal life  (i.e. if you have doctors app., sick, or hurt) they're selfish. When they're not in ""manager mode"" they're nice. But when it comes to requesting days off, or calling out because of a medical emergency, they're more rude than anything. It's a very stressful work environment."
good,I assist customers with their purchase of furniture.  The hardest thing is putting the furniture together. I have learned about the different types of mattress.
good,"I, really enjoy working for big lots but staff could be really rude at times  management is great when working with the team working ones cause there some that are too lazy"
good,"Lots of work to do, always something different. When female managers were there I was taught so much about business and taking ownership of the business. The store manager is out of the store most of the time. He never knows what we really have in the store.When he is there he is very condescending to employees and customers. When he is mad at you, you get less hours and expects you to do more than anyone else. He is out of touch, doesn't  care we are short handed, when he always leaves. No job security.  Store manager makes it hard on you if he is mad at you or doesn't  like you."
good,"Exceptionally fine environment, except for management disrespecting staff as well as vocally and physically expressing displeasure with staff. Management making several remarks in fun of staff not being great workers and the workers being fired or let go."
good,"You never know what to expect, not a bad place to work.Better for someone who justs needs PT not FT employment. Co workers are friendly."
good,"A typical day at big lots  is a very hectic thing anyone will say that works there. Co-works don't  want to do there jobs and leave it to the next person to have to do, management is the same way."
good,fast paced environment to work in. Multiple job duties. At this job you will learn that you are given so many duties with very little employees to help you out. This company tries to save so much money and put very little effort in investing in their employees. The pay at this job is minimal with no opportunity to advance further in the company.
good,"The main reason that I left was because they were not giving me hours at all. I had a 5 hour week once, and I have bills to pay. The management knew that I had family issues going on, and knew that I needed the hours, and did not care. There were NO benefits, whatsoever. They would not even promote me, or give me a raise when it came time for my evaluation. THEY DID NOT EVEN DO MY EVALUATION!"
good,"The corporate office is full of snobs who treat you like garbage, the supervisors and managers have very little tolerance for any enjoyment at work. The hours are terrible, and the work/life balance sucks."
good,"Management at big lots sucks, they over work you with part time status and never hire full time. They don't work with school schedules, or other job schedules. They hire nothing but girls and only have 2 guys working, so when the guys aren't there, the girls are struggling to take out furniture."
good,awful place to work poor management and very poor planning on corporate level would not recommend this as a good job choice
good,"Customer service, made returns and took large payments for furniture. ran cashier. restocked shelve and unloaded trucks as needed."
good,managers are very overworked. dm gave direction and changed it on next visit causing many wasted man hours. I worked 70 hours plus a week. I have taken 8 years off after this job when I had loved retail
good,"Working for Big Lots was an experience, I mostly worked on the cash register besides stocking shelves. This was my first time ever working with a cash register and I learned pretty quickly. My co-workers were very nice and helpful. The job was fairly easy unless we had a sale, then it became a challenge with all of the customers. I would still be working for the company but unfortunately they closed because of poor sales. Now that I am without a job I am looking for a more challenging position, something that will challenge my work ethics."
good,"I love the people I work with, but I don't get scheduled enough hours to support myself on a minimum wage budget. I typically run the register all day, interacting with customers or I am stocking the shelves. Big Lots has taught me how to talk to people, help them out with problems, find solutions to thing that have made them unhappy and keep up on my time management."
good,not organized.. put in new programs but don't add the hours to ensure their success nor let them develop.
good,everyone is part time except managers. more work than money. rude management. dont trained when new hire(s)
good,"This is my HONEST review. We were were initially hired, they explained to us that we were going to be ""temporary"" workers. I understood that due the time frame the new store had to be set up and the demand as a whole. I also understand what the word ""temporary"" means. But, half of us were let go after 2 weeks of employment. I enjoyed my duties and my coworkers, but I feel like we were just used as ""paid help""."
good,no hours and short shift can't make a living off it not even a good second job its a waste of time
good,"They only were able to give 6 hrs a week, at most 12, and of those six hours they tried to fit a weeks worth of work in."
good,"I liked working at Big Lots, I just had to take care of family. A typical day was a 9 hour shift, meeting customer needs and meeting sales quota. I learned to depend on myself to get the jobs done. Management was great in the store, the general manager disliked women and was reprimanded. Some of my co workers were great and very well job oriented. Others didn't do anything. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I liked the people and the environment."
good,You have to do a lot to get terminated from the company. The upper managers do not train. There is no training program in place. Turnover is very high.
good,The manager was not a good manager and the people were mean and were stuck up
good,"You do what your told, no buddy shows you any respect and your on your own threw out the day"
good,Fast paced
good,The customers are so friendly and nice. My team at my store is really great and mostly everyone gets along well. Overall a hardworking team with positive attitudes.
good,"They are open 364 days a year- when u work holidays u are able to take another day off and get paid,  there are young college kids that work more hours than employees that have been there. I believe the employees that have been there and are hard working employees should get more hours"
good,Work there 14 years  it was a good job managers talk to much to the hourly about what goes on but other then that it good place to work they work well with your hours
good,A typical day at work I was provisioning 10 or more VMs and often I was provisioning new 1U rack servers to support data center and business mission strategy.
good,"Poor management, not enough hours kept getting sent home early. Picking furniture should have better pay as is back breaking work. This place has a revolving door and ultimately you get the feeling that they don't really care about individuals here."
good,Wasnt one of my favorite places to be. Wasnt able to get very many hours and the pay wasnt enough to provide for my child or myself. Managers arent very friendly or polite.
good,Team lead is the way to get full-time and part-time 20 hours or less and there know way you can live with that and team leader is hard to work there with the way it get run
good,"When it comes to overall company involvement and management there is not much to be spoke of.  Ok yeah you see it on the bulletin board, but the feeling when you walk in the back breakroom or supply room let alone the whole store it's so ;("
good,The hours and pay are not suitable to live off of. It is an easy job but truck can be tiring. Managment is great although they havent been able to keep a store manager very long.
good,"I was taken advantage of my things were stolen from Unknow employee there."
good,"Good to use as a stop gap job or to assist as supplemental income. Not enough pay to be self sufficient or to sustain a single person, let alone a family."
good,"Big lots didn't pay the bills, but maybe some bills. I need a better job, which means better pay and understanding."
good,I do not have anything to say. The store manager was pretty much the easiest and most reasonable one who you could talk to there. I had so much experience but they never showed like they cared.
good,"Can’t be lazy to work here!! But there is no training, and never set hours! There are not to many perks to working and no way for advancement! The managers are nice but do not train new employees they expect min wage employees to train new hires! I got sick and they wanted a Dr note with diagnosis!! None of their business! I wanted less hours and they wanted a reason.. wrong!!! There is no incentive, to working here!!"
good,"This is easy as I was a cashier, however the hours were very inconsistent as to I was working maybe 4 hours each week if any. And I never slacked off."
good,"An overall nice place to work if your not afraid to put in some actual work the, the floor managers are nice and will work with you and are very personable"
good,"They dont give you the opportunity to advance in the company. It's really hard to survive off of the checks, every week may be less than 200 bucks depending on the hours. Liked to see alot of new products though."
good,ton of work for a little paycheck plus management is never around which can be a nice thing.But they are never around when you need them to resolve a problem or solution.
good,"Cashiers and stockers/merchandisers are not given the hours they need to get the job done on time, resulting in the management team scrambling to complete the job. Unrealistic expectations regarding hours available by the associates leads to high turnover - again, leaving the management team scrambling to get jobs done. "
good,"They gave their associates poor hours & minimum wages. Most store managers,  assistant managers & associate managers  were cool but the RM (regional manager)  was a capital  B. All she cared about was her getting her bonuses. Didn't care that the associates weren't getting fair hours & wages. They are the ones doing the back breaking work."
good,"the mangers was so lazy wouldnt even work yet quick to yell at you for not doing thier job, the over stock in the backroom just piles up and up and up i spent 6 months getting that  down and not once did i get "
good,Responsible for stocking duties and running cash register as needed. Worked in warehouse to unload truck. placed merchandise on shelves. ran cash register
good,Big lots has an amazing group of associates. The company does not offer any benefits for their employees other than a 20% discount off the merchandise. Great experience for a first time employee but definitely not going to go succeed in life working there.
good,"Management was terrible, simply abuse code of conduct apon associates and abuse their power to get their duty completed, also used abusive language towards other associates."
good,"My position at Big Lots helped me learn skills that are valuable and applicable to future life paths. I found the customers to be the most challenging part of the job, and the management staff was not especially helpful."
good,"I would say that Big Lots is very competitive with other small box stores, but I do not think they can compete with stores like Walmart, Smart and Final, etc."
good,"Wasn't really a big fan of working here, the thing that made it bearable was the customers I quickly grew bonds with all kinds of customers and was so excited to see them again, they were happy to see me as well. The management wasn't that great. My supervisor was very rude and always had an attitude towards me, I'd ask questions when I first started and it seemed to irritate her, like she was upset I asked. I was new and had no idea what to do. She always told me if I had questions to ask but, didn't go well. I kept my cool with her the whole time I worked there. I enjoyed the customers more then the actual place is the bottom line. I love shopping there though!"
good,"I enjoyed working with others putting out stock unloading trucks. I worked a lot in LP.I did a lot of staffing and training of all new management . work hours was fine. Its the not having people (crew) coming in to do their job on time hurt working there,"
good,good place to work if u r going to school and work here for par time and learning new thing in the warehouse and up in front and knowing how to clean up after everybody mess
good,Typical work day could be either slow or extremely busy..
good,We had no fun here. Was always move move move in the hot weather and the freezing cold. No compassion for the employees and the work they did. Only thing that worked well was the discount given
good,"The over all staff we easy going and to work with. In my words their were a lack of communication, between the managers. The amount of work that was needed to be done 'VS' staff. But looking from a supervisor point of view,meeting numbers ect. That's the way retail runs. When asked for additional training material, would get told later."
good,i was not very pleased with my experience at big lots. my boss at the time was extremely rude and spoke to everyone with such disrespect. i would not reccomend this big lots in Attleboro to anyone !
good,Computer training only. Managers annoyed by hands on training questions. Very few shifts offered. Managerial duties pawned off on associates. Customer service not a top priority
good,Store needs a more effective manager. There's a lack of discipline and communication. It's mostly friendly there and most of the customers are pleasant. There are problems with signage and that always falls on the cashier.
good,"Didn't like the consist management change, vacations are fair, benefits are fair, sick and paid time off is fair. They don't respect  family time when your off."
good,It's a job for high school or college kids. looking for a part time job in retail to help them get on their feet.I don't think it's worth the hours u get. Working three to two days a week can't help a single parent pay bills
good,The pay was too low in the warehouse.  The manager was never around.  Was called to fix time clock at all hours even though IT was there for all three shifts.
good,In all honesty the job was decent the people where great and the days were chill.Just not much room to move up the ladder and it seemed like a lot of favoritism in my opinion.
good,the management there was very poor. I had a hard time with getting hours. I always had to work at night on weekends even when i was out of school or on weekends
good,"Never too much going on, laid back . Worked with a good group of people who made the job alot easier. I would say the hardest part about the job was just dealing with impatient customers ."
good,"working evenings was horrible. But the management was great! I wish I had a different position here. But my position was to fix the whole store, and once I was able to get a better job, I did."
good,A typical day at work at Big Lots is when you're taking out a couple of pieced of furniture and you restock shelves and work cashier a little bit. I learned that you will deal with very rude customers. The management is alright. Hardest part of the job is taking out heavy furniture by yourself at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out when it is time to go.
good,"Great place to work, Easy going, not very stressful at all. Only work in small shifts. 4 to 6 hours and way less than 30 a week.  For most this is considered to be a second job. They have outsourced for most of the management jobs instead of promoting within. Management would hire new employees instead of giving more hours."
good,"I worked with this company for 4 months before quitting. I knew how to work all positions except for a manager position. When my schedule availability changed I was reduced to working only 3hrs a week 2 weeks in a row before I was done with the company. There were no excuses for the lack of hours as I knew how to run the cash register, stock/replenish, and run freight from the truck. The main manager didn't want to be flexible with my new availability so I left. I loved my coworkers and the customers that came through. It was one of the places I felt the most at ease working for. The department managers were AMAZING. The main manager was callous and robot-like with employees and customers. I wasn't the only one to leave store number 5247 either. 3 other co-workers of mine left the company within 5 weeks. This store has the highest turn over rate I've ever seen due to the main manager."
good,"A typical day was usually busy, not always. There was training for new or updated equipment such as new checkout computers. Culture was conservative. The hardest part for me personally was delivering customer service with a smile to those who argued or switched prices or had 12+ coupons."
good,"Not completely awful but very quick paced. Only reason i was fired was because they failed to tell me that i had to work on a Friday, which people usually don't work on Fridays."
good,Worked in the furniture department putting together furniture and also worked on the cash register.  Greeting customers and getting carriages from parking lot.
good,"I worked there seasonal it was ok place to work, pay was bad and crazy hours, but other than that the work was pretty easy and the people are easy to get along with"
good,"it's pretty easy going, and the managers are nice, with the exception of a shift manager in furniture.it would be nice to have more hours, as the average is 12 a week."
good,"I was only here for 2 months. Only knew a couple of the managers. One was cool, one was kind of ehhhhhhh. Nobody really my age worked there, unfortunately. Not a bad place overall."
good,my typical day is register and some stock as well as answering phones. i have learned how to price things as well as price holds .management can be hard on workers. i think the hardest part would be working with so little employees all around. i think the most enjoyable is the interesting people you meet.
good,Some managers can be rude but the work place its self is not that bad. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck its a lot of moving and you got to keep up to get it done in a specific time. The discount is decent and the employees are nice
good,"you know like most jobs mangers are dummies but you get along with coworkers, that's how it is. To make my day go faster i try to talk to all the costumers they love to chat."
good,"It's an interesting place to work. You can have a great time assisting customers. If you take the time to learn your work environment and find an area of expertise, you can have an enjoyable time. It can be stressful at times, but what job isn't, especially during the holidays and Back-To-School? It also depends on the location of your specific store and how the management and employees interact with each other. Each store location and personnel has its differences."
good,They did not take into account my first job hardly at all. Had to practically fight to get one day off from both jobs to spend with my family. They wouldn't release the schedule for the following week until Saturday. The new one started on Sunday!
good,There were inconsistent hours every week. They really don't taylor to anyone who has a family. The management process needs to be refined. The pay is terrible. A increase in pay will boost morale and decrease turnover rate.
good,"If you want to get promoted, have benefits, or get more than 29 hours then this job isn't for you. Big Lots is poorly run as a whole. If I had the choice I wouldn't work here."
good,"I really enjoy the people I used to work with, I didnt get as many hours as i liked, managers got overtime when noone else got over 25 hours. Very easy"
good,"Not fairly scheduled, especially when short handed - missing 2 managers.  Lot of closings and working weekends to cover missing shifts.   Very draining."
good,"Nice coworkers fair managers overall nice place to work with short breaks. The hours were very long the job is very stressful stacking carts & tugging equipment. A typical day at work is a 1,000 piece load of drinks furniture rugs candy etc"
good,Early mornings on Monday to unload the truck and tag everything. After that it was just stocking after that through the week. Had fun sometimes. Found out I was hired in at $7.25 an hour and everyone hired after me were making $7.50.
good,"I worked all areas of the store, would of made management if I hadnt of moved. Very productive work place. Always busy. Could of been better if there was more of a raise than a 15 cent raise for 6months."
good,"A typical day consisted of cashiering, stocking, and keeping the store clean and organized. I learned more about retail working with this company.  I enjoyed working in the retail environment."
good,It really was just a job i made my best effort to just go to work and go home. There was the occasional horrible manager but i always tried my best to avoid them.
good,"Although I loved the aspect of the customer service, the hours were minimal, less then 10 hrs a week in some cases.  They hire a lot of people and spread out few hours."
good,I choose to be a part time employee at this time.  So I will not receive benefits or vacation time and I agree to this. Other than that it is an OK place to work.
good,"> Not enough hours to operate store"
good,"The Job all around was average. Management could be a lot better. The job was like being inside of high school all over again. Everyone is dating someone next to you and it felt like high school drama. "
good,A retail job that stays busy though out the day. The only thing I could say about the company is I wish they took more care of their employee's not just their managers.
good,A typical day at work would be when we started collect buggies. Go through and sort reshop. Take the reshop and put it where it belongs in the section of the store you were working on. straighten shelves.
good,"its discount retail, what can i say. its not any different then most stores. rush rush rush with little reward. not a spectacular place to work but easy to do."
good,"I would operate a cash register, assist customers locating items, would help unload the freight truck and separate items throughout the store and would stock shelves."
good,"This was a good company to work for, yet the opportunity for advancement was not readily available.  I believe I could have done so much more with my experience, knowledge and talent, yet I was not given the opportunity."
good,"My typical day at work included marketing new furniture merchandise, taking care of customers and employees, inventory adjustments, and furniture sales. I learned from this job that organization is key to being successful.  As a manager I worked with the rest of the management team to operate the store. Some of my co-workers are hard workers while others are ridiculously lazy and rude. The hardest part of my job was maintaining everything that goes on in the store as well as the furniture department which accounted for a large amount of the store's daily sales.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customer's satisfaction with mines and my employee's hard work."
good,A typical day at work staying on task. I learned to stay focse
good,Management doesn't keep up and always complains about everything. They lost my application for associate manage position.
good,It's a job... It's a job that I go to only 3-4 days a week. And I am really ready to leave. I'm trying to stay positive about this review. Thank you.
good,This job taught me about the block method used in retail stores. it also taught me about having patience when needed. it taught me how to work with others and become a team.
good,Working at Big lots was a job that helped me lern how to use better costomer service.  The other cashiers were fun to work with.
good,"Cashier responsibilities, fast pace environment checking out customers, and bagging purchase."
good,"I enjoyed working in this atmosphere but when it comes to magament, they could have done a better job."
good,my current job is ok really not anything to special just a job. I dont hate it or love it just do it
good,Highly stressful environment but challenging. More work than available hours can handle. Troublesome customers add to difficult overall management and there are seldom full time positions offered.
good,There aren't any growth with this company so I see myself going no where.
good,Favoritism is shown to younger and newer employees while those who are a little older and have been there longer for a year are shown some disrespect and hours have been cut.
good,A good place to work if you dont need money. No hour for living.
good,Met Lot's of people. Enjoyed helping out clients. Learner management skills while training new workers.
good,I was chosen to do the Office job in a short amount of time and I learned it in around 2 weeks.
good,"I worked for the Big Lots in Lynnwood, WA. There was alot of Negativity against the Managers and Hours. There is no compensation for employees to keep up morale."
good,the short time that i had worked i would like to say i made a few friends in the store and met some interesting people. management was very encouraging and helpful when i had no clue what i was doing.
good,"Biglots was a good company "
good,While working for this company I saw a bunch of mismanagement the managers were inept at their jobs and the Store Manager was Crass and unsympathetic to anyone's need but her own. The more you learned the less they cared.
good,When I worked at big lots I had lots of fun the overall job was fun nothing to hard fairly easy to understand management was really cool they treated you with respect but the pay was horrible only getting 10-20 MAX each week it's not a place to only have that job and not another one that job is like a weekend job or something on the side
good,"typical day at work is very busy, especially now because it is the holidays. it is a little overwhelming, working in this company is easy and most importantly being a team player."
good,"Dont mind working for the company but pay and hours are a big issue.  Being retail, they dont support family time like they used too in the past.  As the years go on, they are more about making money and less about appreciating there employees"
good,"Scheduled 25 or less hours per week, minimum wage with yearly raise up to .30 cents based on yearly review. A lot of work and can be stressful at times."
good,"Overall the job is easy but the pay is low. The management was ok and the work days are slow during the week and the weekends were kinda busy. The only crazy hectic days are the friends and family days which is a 20% of sale, but it's only 4 times a year I think. Another tiring job is inventory prep but that's once a year. The hours are low and almost never any overtime."
good,"It was stressful at times but also fun with co workers and customers lots of standing and dealing with public, the hardest part of the job was the truck you need to be able to unload and lift and carry large and small boxes and put them on the pallets they belong on so they can go directly to floor"
good,When I 1st got hired from there I loved my job and then I got promoted to furniture manager and I was really sick so I missed 2 days in a 30 day period  And I got fired I never know you could miss days cause you were sick and I had 40 hours or 46 hours of sick time. So I end up losing all that. But it's a good place to work if you were never going to call out or you are there part time as a second job or going to school
good,Its a good company and there are good GM'S OUT THERE. But if you work for a bad one you better start looking for a new job. They only believe in false accusations and tall tales with no proof.
good,"Big lots is a good start to get your foot in the door for a retail job, its only part time so if looking for a part time job it is a good place to help get started."
good,Most are easy to work with. You have your few who try to make things difficult. Fast paced...overall I like working here. A little unfair in the advancing aspect.
good,"I liked the people but they only had 2 stock ppl . it rough doing truck with a few ppl. Especially the furniture!! They need new ppl!!I liked the management. Most were helpful!! Taught me time management!!"
good,The job isnt bad and is pretty simple. I’ve been there for a couple years now and they work well with your schedule and have great flexibility. I enjoy stocking the shelves and wouldn’t really say there are too many difficult tasks asked of you.
good,"Work environment was decent. Had nice co-workers and managers. Worked over night doing stock. Wasn't comfortable with traveling home during those hours in the city I was in so I moved to day shifts. Unfortunately hours were limited and I ended up leaving for a different job. I don't really have any complaints. The work wasn't bad and everyone I worked with was nice, they just weren't able to give me the hours I needed. Separation was amicable"
good,All the managers seem to have a different way of doing things and you’ll get griped at for not doing things that other ppl tell you to do even though you were told something different . Management isn’t the best and some are extremely rude. They aren’t that well at teaching new people but it’s a job.
good,"The customer were very nice and down to earth, but over the time working there, it got very boring. The pay wasn't enough at all. They also showed favoritism."
good,"For place I was at, the manager was mean. Didn't want to train you or help you when you needed help. If you had to work another job than they wouldn't work with you at all and make you chose between jobs."
good,"The work experience over all was okay. Management has no consideration other than for other managers. When told to do one thing, another manager will tell you something different & ultimately you’ll end up getting in trouble. Good days are good there though."
good,"I liked the people I worked with. The job can be stressful and the benefits are not good at all.  I think it's a great place to shop but I would never work there again. "
good,"Management needs some work, the people there say one thing but mean something else. Really hard to get a straight answer from anyone. Most other employees are interesting."
good,Overall a okay company. New CEO restructured the company eliminating many jobs and cutting sales floor hours creating a poor moral situation. New trend is showing unrealistic expectations.
good,"Good to gain experience in customer service "
good,"Floor recovery or register"
good,"I learned how to fixed stock by the date on supply, The hardest part was getting 5 lanes done in an hour and also trying to help the cashiers and go get carts all the same time."
good,"I loved my job, I loved working with customers, I even had regular customers that would ask for me by name. I was responsible for stocking mostly, it wasn't hard and I enjoyed it. Fast paced and for the most part you kept busy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management. They were unfriendly and I don't believe they have the employees or customers best interest at heart. I felt that I was targeted my one manger specifically. I reported it several times and this person was spoken with yet the behavior never seemed to change. I enjoyed very much so working with the other employees, the majority were very hard working and friendly."
good,management took credit and didnt support team memebers in front of corporate memebers. training was not a key like it should be.without a team the system is setup for failure.
good,"Slow paced, cant move up without being completely open on your schedule. Double Standards and favoritism is always present. The pay is low compared to other places."
good,"it wasn't a bad place to work... I was there until I could find something "
good,"You could get 27 hours for two weeks then down to 15 hours, because of new hirers. No hours regularly, liked to work there now, hate the managers, only give hours to the people the like the best"
good,"As a Store Manager I would either open or close the location. Open or close the registers, prepare the drops, unload trucks, work out freight, deal with customer concerns, discipline associates when necessary and do weekly conference calls. The associates were a great group of people that strived to give their all under difficult circumstances. Location was not given enough hours to operate on a weekly basis, work loads were consistently heavy with little to no direction given on how to  complete. Best part of the job was teaching, coaching and training the associates to be successful. They all showed a great desire to improve and would ask for ways to better their performance."
good,"Enjoyed working under the managers I had. Enjoyed most fellow employees. This was a fun job but it was also a hard working job. Unloading tractor trailer loads of items onto an ancient conveyor belt, stacking items onto pallets, crushing boxes with the machine, stocking shelves, cleaning your area. I would work there again as long as I didn't have to work so fast and hard unloading the trucks."
good,The management team seemed to cause more issues between the employees then the employees themselves. Positive reinforcement was almost none existent. The L.P. in Las Vegas is very friendly and nice. The G.M. seemed friendly but management talked so negatively about them it was difficult to make your own assessment.
good,It was a breeze most days just like any other job but some days i would get left unloading a entire truck by myself. My schedule kept changing within a weeks time but once u learn the store u wont b confused on how to approach the revolving merchandise in the store.
good,Things where wonderful tell new management came in. I would still be working for them if they had not brought in managers who don't care about there employees.
good,"Unable to finish tasks because of being delegated a different task that is time-consuming, then being told the previous task needed to be finished hours ago but you couldn't finish because you had to provide top of the line customer service to anyone you can make eye contact with."
good,It would be more successful if there were a better communication in leadership. There is room for some better coordinating of responsibilities. There is a lack of price coordinating that leads to loss of income for the store.
good,"You have to deal with a lot of angry and undesirable customers on a daily basis. It was an okay first job, i  just would never work their again nor would i recommend it to a friend"
good,This was one of many first job experiences I learned the basic work ethics. I don't like to talk down on a job it was hard working in hostile work environment.
good,"It's like any other retailer. You can have a good day or a bad day depending on you rmanager. It's busy or painfully slow depending on the season. Usually I never got a break and if I did, I had to beg. Not the best place to work, but it is a job."
good,"Enjoyed talking to new people. Management could've made things run smoother, but they only did enough. Decent pay for a non demanding job. Overall it was a good experience"
good,"If you just need some money in your pocket then this is the job for you. Days are slow, store isn't very crowded, even on holidays. Friendly staff and good teamwork but the store manager needs to learn how to properly talk and communicate with people."
good,"Mornings it starts off slow but picks up the pace around 12 or 1 o'clock. Have trucks that we unload on Thursdays, and stock to put out freight afterwards."
good,"Es buena compañia, pero si tu eres padre de familia y necesitas un buen ingreso, definitivamente no es el lugar adecuado. Pero si eres un estudiante o un joven que trabaja para si mismo esta bien."
good,"It was a  slow paced job,was not what I expected,only worked three weeks before they cut my hours and days due to not enough business..My experience was not to my standards ,it was uncomfortable to work  with Co workers who were non friendly to myself and others"
good,"In the 12 years I was there, I started out as a simple cashier, with in the first two years I was promoted to a Customer Service Specialist, then to an Associate Manager. A great place to develop strength in customer service."
good,"Working at BigLots was demanding at times, but we all worked together as a team. With our manager as our coach and us associates as the team players. Yea, things could get stressful at time, but no mattee what was going on (inside the store or out) we were always there for each other."
good,"I liked my fellow co workers, and I liked the job, the hours were pretty much what I looking for part time and about 4 or so hours a day and a break in the middle.  They gave a good discount on products that were already discounted and that was good.  I got stuck doing one thing with no chance to change or grow cause it was just easy for my manager to say ""Go do this"" he knew I wanted to do something else but I was good at what I did.  That part didn't make me very happy but it wasn't the reason I left.  I got injured and they held my job for me but it was impossible for me to go back to working that kind of job again because of the injury"
good,"Great job for a teenager during the school year, doesn't pay very well but everybody has to start from somewhere and where I worked the co workers I worked with were awesome."
good,"The manager was easy to work with. But there was no advancement."
good,"Revolving door of employees and no accountability for the staff.  Employees would call out or not show all the time and were kept on due to lack of employees to unload the trucks, which is part of your job no matter what your positions.  No benefits, but discounts on purchasers are offered."
good,Being a sales associate helping customers stocking the shelves pushing them all the way to the front. Helping customers with the bags or carry outs today vehicles. Helping customers find what they need.
good,"Sometimes it was very busy , that's good because it's fun and it always makes me feel good to be helpful to customers ! It's a good place to work, it always was clean and smelled good"
good,The job is decent at best managers don't have any control of  inventory that is shipped to the store causing overstock and almost no room in the warehouse the schedule is set Saturday to Saturday you dont know what days you'll be working the next week which makes it hard to plan around
good,The work we did was remodeling the store. After the job was done I tried to be hired on full time but was let go. The store closed a few years later. They hired anyone who needed a job at the time.
good,"It was a pretty average job, I dealt with the customers, as well as handled the return cart. I don't remember much, but I did it, and it was not that bad"
good,"A typical day is early morning floor recovery."
good,"during my time working at this job I really learned a lot, as for a typical day they were really never a typical day, you never knew what you were going to come up against or what was going to happen, management was good but very demanding, the hardest part of the job was dealing with unloading the trucks and get the stock out at the right time.  The most enjoyable part was the staff was all very friendly and we all would work as a team to get the stuff done."
good,"I enjoy working at Big Lots most of the time. Most of the people I work with are great. Just not all of them. If you don't have to work, it's good, but if you have to, you only get part time."
good,"My experience working there is okay. Some of the other workers can be rude but other than that it's fine. We don't have many rude customers come in, so that's a plus."
good,It was an okay job for the time I had it but I only recommend it if you just want some extra cash. The hours all depend on the truck coming in. You will never get more than 20 hours. Learned how to work retail.
good,"company expected you to work a minimum of 60 hrs, / week"
good,Company needs to have a clear direction. Management needs to be more involved in helping to achieve changes in company rather than expecting change with no involvement. Managers over 50 need to document all comments that can lead a bad working environment.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking, inventory and unloading trucks. Management had rapport built with already existing employees that affected equality that showed in many aspects of the daily functioning of the store site. The hardest part of the job was the inequality in work load. The easiest part of the day for me was assembling furniture and unlading the truck"
good,big lots is had to work for job surecuret is a big porbolm manger are all was no you back getting you to do more then you can and yelling at you and not organize
good,I didn't enjoy this job too much. Not really much of a stepping stone for advancement. I mean it was easy but it never truly presented a challenge for me.
good,"A typical day at Big Lots can be just about anything for me. I am usually cashiering or furniture associate but I do just about everything, which keeps the job interesting. "
good,"The management is mostly good and friendly."
good,"There were very friendly coworkers there but the atmosphere some of the coworkers and management presented made my experience less desirable. The schedules were created by a computer and sometimes it would schedule people to work on their off days. Management was notified of the problem but a positive work environment was the last thing on their mind for their employees. There needs to be better organization and better communication. Very often there would be backlash from coworkers because of the management and their lack of support for their employees. Other than management, everyday work life was great and very often the store would be so busy that your shift would be over quick."
good,"Big Lots is an ok place to work just needs better training, better benefits, and management needs to help out more. Management needs to get trained on how to run the store not just standing there not helping or staying in the office doing nothing."
good,I love working with the public also especially helping my customers and giving them great customer service. I've learned to always make my customers smile know matter how bad of a day you're having. Always be a team leader in management and with your co-workers communicate is the key to success.
good,meeting greeting and assisting customers. Working cash registers well. worked in furniture as well as unloading truck.
good,"Come in early morning and unload the truck"
good,"a typical day consist of clocking in & Doing my job at hand. Noting complicated but nothing small either. I go work a four hour shift, or a six hour shift, deal with rude customers & Clock out for the day."
good,"Depending on the position, Big Lots is a good company for students or those who work part time. If you are able to get in management, Big Lots is a good company with compensation for higher management roles."
good,"No advancement, poor management, unplanned breaks, high turn over rate.Management wouldn't give you the time of day, Customers were rude and bad area of town"
good,"Worked in all areas such as customer service, furniture sales, merchandising, sales floor and warehouse assistance."
good,"Typical day is short hours but felt like forever."
good,"Management at store does not work well together"
good,"Management is horrible! If you enjoy working somewhere where you and your co-workers are being disrespected and looked down upon daily, then this is the job you're looking for. Pay is okay for someone who really does not have responsibilities (bills, rent, etc.)"
good,It was OK. It was a Job. It was some money coming in. The management needed more help. The customers made my days as conversing about the otherstors as compared to Big Lots. Many of the people entering the store were surprised as to the different products.
good,"As a worker at the company, I have excelled in business, life, and personal skills. A typical day at work is intense, but I am able to multitask and manage the task at hand."
good,You don't get very many hours. Co-workers are friendly. Great Prices. Furniture is reasonable priced and great quality.  Product is easy to find.
good,"Bad pay, bad moral unless in management. Management does work with employs about schedule. some very early mornings. employ kept under thirty hours."
good,"Fast paced work environment that kept me busy.  Work environment started out very good, but slowly declined.  Mostly due to management and change in work policy and co-workers."
good,"We would take the shelves apart paint some of them to be reused and rearrange the store. I enjoy the experience and my co-workers were amazing. It was 3rd shift which I do not mind. We were only there for 2 weeks, but I had fun and learned a lot."
good,Ive worked here for two years before finding a job in the field i attended school for-this to me is a place to work as a side job or just a summer job-pay was not that great-they wanted you to do harder work for less pay-management was OK. Some employees were cool but i heard lots of complaining from them more than anything.
good,Work environment was enjoyable but they tend to keep employees at part time in order to dodge the benefits payout to assist employees with their home life.
good,"I didn't work long at this store, but I had no trouble with my co workers or management. The customers were easy to deal with, and the workload wasn't overwhelming."
good,"Manage acounts, move, maintain, build, and deliver furniture to guest's trucks/trailers. "
good,"Typical day consists of making sure the shelves were were always stocked and occasionally checking people out at the registers, also I would clean up areas that needed to be cleaned to keep the store's image up."
good,No possibility of advancement or security. Hours were held to a minimum while not providing any financial security for life.
good,"not enough hours , low pay , the management was ok, I enjoyed working the overnight shift because the people I worked with made the time go by fast"
good,"After a year with the company, I was less than thrilled to continue my career with them. I felt that it made more sense to go back to school full time and advance my education in hopes of finding a career that was fulfilling and rewarding."
good,"Big Lots was a good place to place .But my co worker i loved my co workers and my customers too.My most enjoyable part was seeing my customers happy But our store had problems keeping  managers, so throughout the years i was there i had lots of different mangers"
good,"it's a job... not awful, not great. schedules and structure needs work, but who cares. they pay you to do basic stuff. why complain. the job is not hard, but may be repetitive."
good,Unload a trailer Mostly inventory the store. Help customers if they need carry-ons. The managers will ask assistance for putting together something. It must be done fast.
good,"I would cash out customers, make sure the store looked neat, counted down my register at the end of the night. I learned how to use there register system. Management was not to bad. enjoyed working with my coworkers. the hardest part of the job was getting help with items up high. Most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,"Don't get me wrong, I loved my job and my co-workers, but not having a set schedule every week was rough. It was hard to have a social life and spend time with the ones you love. I think that was really the biggest down fall of this company."
good,I got to learn all about dvm procedures for new car buys I met lots and lots of clients on a daily basis I sold cars too when I was needed to step in as a saleswomen I did terrorist checks everyday as. well as credit checks I haad the vegas team and it was a learning experience considering I first started as a floater and in months worked my way up to finance .
good,"Honestly, its not a job where anyone except for full-time and management employees can afford to rely on for survival its simply a strenuous part-time job."
good,"Average, would not work at this store because managers were on power trip."
good,a typical day at work I would dust furniture and organize. Help customers load furniture. Management were pretty good about helping when they had time. it was only 4 of us in furniture so some days it would just be only 1 of us there. Hardest part of job was lifting on those 1 person days. most enjoyable part was chatting with customers and co workers
good,You get something different every week so you learn about different products and how to merchandise just about anything
good,I would work warehouse and unload the whole truck all by my self i was lifting large furnature and toxic items that were harmful to my health and unsafe. They were short staffed alot and I was attending college and needed a better schedule to work so i left the job.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job are the employees as well as being able to help those in need of help and knowing that you did a great job supervising them.
good,"Big Lots as a company has some odd ways of going about things. Most of the stores are chronically understaffed and corporate never provides enough hours. Every year i have worked for the company corporate has increased our daily sales plan but cut our hours, which i feel is counterproductive. To compensate for this lack of staff management/front end supervisors often end up doing things above and beyond their job descriptions with no additional compensation. The company is so focused on cutting costs that it takes an inordinately long time to replace broken or unsafe equipment/fixtures. Tasks that require more than one person are expected to be completed by a single manager in one shift while concurrently completing no less than two other tasks and if all three are not completed by the end of your eight hour shift you are considered to have ""productivity issues"""
good,"A typical day for me is pulling replenishment, putting out replenishment then either working the floor,running register or sitting at baby registry. "
good,Not an dependable job because all they really need is two maybe three people to work.
good,"I was asst. store manager and bookkeeper. I learned a lot about management and retail details."
good,no fun things at big lots. they cared all about numbers and not too much about their employees!
good,"Has a good base, however they need to take it to the next leavel. Pay scale for managment. Prossesing merchandise needs a overhale out dated. For exampal. They pay for somone to unload truck,,touch the merchandise,,put prices on merch,,now they have touched the mercandise twice,,now wheel merch to the sales floor and that make three times before it's on the shelf. There's gotta be a better way."
good,"A typical day at work will include helping customers with their purchases, restocking shelves, and trying to satisfy management. The hardest part of my job is satisfying management with the available resources."
good,"a typical day at big lots is usually pretty interesting there's never a dole moment iv'e learned alot in my almost 5 years working there ,just how hard retail can be and get but i keep pushing. Management has changed numerous times while ive been there , I have some excellant co-workers who work hard and put in for the little hours they get. The hardest part is the hours i work it changes so much its hard to adjust i currently work overnights and unload the trucks every wed .Most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and having the ablility to goof around yet still get the job done"
good,"Managers are freight pushers and don't have the time to coach employees. Customer service is not a priority, pushing freight out is the goal."
good,Stores disorganized and not enough training. Benfits not good at all.
good,"Managed operations within retail store setting ensuring inventory accuracy, customer satisfaction, and product knowledge were constantly maintained."
good,It is a good way to get a job without having any experience because it demonstrates and teaches you great customer service skills and it gives you an insight into management at the retail level. I liked my job and position and it is a great way to make connections if you really put dedication into your work.
good,Unload trucks on overnight shifts and stock shelves. It was a sociable environment when all work was being done but had its dull times.
good,"Not the best place to work, but it is a steady paycheck and they give raises annually."
good,As being once in management I can tell you the company believes in training the employees.  My district manager was  not a good person.  Expected way to much work for what we were given.  Starting pay was decent but expect to work every weekend.  You can not do your assigned job description versus what they want you to accomplish. They will lie to your face and smile about it.
good,I like working there but sometimes I have alot todo with little time but it gets done. The managers and employees are nice outgoing ppl. It's something to hold on for now.
good,The day of a job at BIGLOTS is most of the time fun love to see the customers faces and how they love the store . How clean and organized . How we as employees are very nice and friendly
good,Working there was just ok. Everyone was nice and pleasant except for one supervisor who barely spoke english. Wasn't appreciated until her favorite workers quit on her.
good,"Wouldnt recommend staying long. Short staffed, so mistakes add up quick. Falling behind schedule is a recipe for disaster if you really wanna hear about everyones problems even outside of work (including management)."
good,"Store manager was very nice, other managers are rude and mean, they only kept people out of desperation.  Its probably better to keep hard workers and reliable people, but those people quit.  I in 2 yrs called off maybe twice and always came in when needed on my days off.  They had/have some employees who are late daily, call in at least once a week,  no shows,  and are slow,  but people who go above for the store get paid about the same.  I had enough of the stress.  Wasn't worth the money for me."
good,Okay place. Highest management -the boss at the location- should do more work than he does. Most of the time he didn't do much yet was on u to get stuff done when he wasn't helping at all. Too much favoritism for sure. I worked my butt of every single day and yet the people who dont do anything get treated way better. Co workers were great! Schedules flexible! Environment was good. Management could use more training and lay off the favoritism a bit. Over all okay place i guess.
good,"This job required good customer service skills, which wasn't too difficult. However, hours were very low and employees often had to work another job in addition to working there to pay for their living expenses. Overall decent place to work, if you are looking for a part-time job with an average of 12-16 hours per week."
good,Schedule is based on your availability. The more available you are the more hours you’ll be eligible to receive. Extended Holiday Hours until midnight for at least two weeks
good,"Greeting customers, fill and manage empty shelves, limited hours, but overall great work environment. managment was linient on hours, I learned alot about retail here."
good,there was a lot of miscommunication and hard working for a small pay that made me not like the job. and the manager didn't really care for the workers.
good,Big Lots is a great place to work if you are willing to do it all and get paid minimal. The hours were skim and the management was disorganized.  Great if you are just starting out.
good,District Manager and District LP turn thier heads on Store Level behavior that is unbecoming and against Company Policies and Procedures and against the Company's Mission Statement. I am not talking about minor violations either! We are talking using petty cash for personal loans; inappropriate relationship between STL and ATL; breaking and entry obviously an inside job; making up allegations that never occurred and the list goes on and on!on.
good,Meet a lot of great customer coming to shop here. Friendly and respectable. Also I have worked with some amazing employees. Prices are affordable.And lots of great items to choose from.
good,"It was a good company to work for a few years ago. It was typical retail in some ways: too much to do and not enough time to do it in, but you did not have the crazy expectations and abuse that cause employees to have to work sixty and seventy hour weeks."
good,"I worked through black Friday as a css and the next day I came in she let me put up all the inventory out of about 10 boxes and then proceeded to tell me HR said they had to let me go cuz of my background, after I got them all caught up in the store."
good,"I have been working at Big Lots now for almost 9 years now, and have been for part-time ever since. And after each year, I was told that I would get full time, and each time it comes up, I am passed up by a new employee."
good,Not a bad place to work for a partimer but if your looking for full time only management. Unfortunately advancement is not a option you might get to be a store team leader then get stuck there.
good,"Productive, but never enough employees. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. I got to know so many regular customers, most were very friendly, but there were some that were not so pleasant."
good,"its not a hard job, follow directions and you will be good. keep your personal life personal. its a stepping stone. i meet great people there from mangment to the cashiers."
good,I learned to run a register when hired. I then stocked and unloaded trucks as well as worked in the furniture department. I like the fast pace of the job as there was always something to do.
good,It was a good place to work. But if you try to advance you could be overlooked. This company loves to hire outside for top positions rather than seeing the talent on the inside who have worked hard to get to those positions. Its basically who you know.
good,Back in 2016 i worked as a Perisahble Stocker at Big Lots. I was in school at the time so i only worked Part-time. Once school was out I requested  more work hours but did not recieve them
good,My job was seasonal.  It ended shortly after getting hired in.  I am not sure if it was to just cycle the employees or if they just needed extra help for the time being.
good,"Your schedule is predetermined by a computer despite your needs as a person (i.e., you may be schedule to close one night and open the next day, etc). You are only limited to so many hours a week and are not able to go over a set amount. There is no advancement in position as part time associate, no matter how long you've worked there. After having worked there for 3 years, after the company-wide pay raise I made the same amount of money as someone who just started. Management above store level does not listen to a store's or employee's individual needs to have a better work environment."
good,"Never really taken seriously, never get good hours compared to new hires, hardest part of job is dealing with rude customers, best part is interacting with regulars"
good,After taking classes at college I usually went to work at Big Lots after. I was in charge of the Furniture department most nights and helped with the daily closing of the store. The store didn't get many customers throughout the night time so we had to find things to do to keep the night moving along. The employee's I worked with at night were all awesome & we had good times.
good,"We received two new managers. Most of the employees are not happy anymore and seeking employment elsewhere.Morale dropped devastly low. Since the new store manager arrived, the hours have dropped from 30-35 a week,  to 8-16 per week. Other than that, the ones of us that has been there for a long time, help each other out when needed and we get along great!"
good,"If you are someone that stocks you have to get a system down that help you put things up easier. Truck crew was fun. I didn't even mind the fact that we had to go in extra early to unload. We did some morning stretches, got some music going, and everyone had a positive attitude."
good,"The job was ok, i was a furniture associate. The work was inconsistant due to the hours varying from 5-20 hours a week. The biggest annoyance of working there was that i worked there for a couple of years and was given the raise of a few cents, and newcomers were employed receiving more pay than i earned from my time of work there."
good,I learned so much about customer service with my time there but they are poor on working with people on there schedules and availability They gave me a pay raise from 8.00hr to 9.78hr! awesome right?! no! I was working 28 hrs a week at 8hr before the raise. but after some weeks I would only get 16HRS!! to 22hrs a week. so i made less then what I made before my raise most pay checks.
good,"Theres no way to advance in the company I lost out on a promotion to someone who works two days a week because of favoritism. They also do give you a ""raise"" annually of 20 cents. If you're lucky you get 27 hours until corporate has them hire more people just so they dont have to pay you for working long shifts. Oh yea, most shifts are 4-6 hours. Only thing I enjoyed was staff."
good,"job is a good place if your looking for part time work. decent discount. fast pace. pay is minimum. overall i would recommend this job,................."
good,Management was very laid back and as a result some areas of the store suffered. Management was not professional and at times inappropriate. It was difficult to be full-time unless you were in a management position.
good,Working for Big Lots was fine. My position was eliminated is the only reason I'm no longer working there. I would have retired from there if they had me busy full time. My supervisor could only keep me busy about 10 hours a week by the time my position was removed.
good,A typical day working at Big Lots would have to be a calm and sometimes out no where a busy day. What I have learned working at Big Lots is that people are not always will to work with a person. What I mean that is not other associates will take that the time out and help if some needs help. There is really hard parts about Big Lots everything is pretty much self explanatory. What I enjoy about Big Lots is helping people and working around the store.
good,"A work day at Big Lots was always a very busy one. I was able to hone in on my skills for balancing many things at one time. I learned the value of time management, reliable help, honesty and the support of the manager. We tried to make it fun for the employees to enjoy their day with competitions for different things and rewards were simple. The shift never seemed to end as the daily projects never seemed to get completed. Always something more to do. But, at the same time, I enjoyed being active as it made the day go quickly."
good,Big Lot is my first part time retail position. The management is very friendly. I worked only 4 hours in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new friends.
good,"Big lots is a good place to work under right management but certain managers make it hard to want to work there. I work alone on the furniture side and it's hard to manage when they ask you to take furniture out, run the floor, grab carts, make purchases, meet requirements daily and there is only one of me inside of that part, not to mention the furniture there are usually heavy, so working is like being under pressure but I manage to do so."
good,If you want a career at big lot's it's possible but not worth it because the company is cheap and does not give good benefits. If you're looking for a seasonal job then big lots is wonderful because it picks up during the holidays and there is endless hours. But other than that there isn't a lot of growth opportunitys and they don't pay you enough to make ends meet.
good,Being the freight manager of Big Lots is a tough position that does not pay what its worth.  The company expectations of truck unload time and stocking shelves is unrealistic.
good,"A job if you want something to do during school, however I would never make a career out of it. The management was always unaware and the customers where very rude, however the pay was decent and you did get a raise. Just do give your all or the management will put all their work on you."
good,this job is very differentand always full of surprises. It is a fun environment to work in. You meet a lot of people. Great deals on many things and overall a nice place
good,"Keep all areas stocked and fronted.  Learned how to place and assemble furniture, front stock, unload heavy items with ease.  Over all good work environment.  Keeping up with the changing schedule.  Nice work pace job."
good,Do not make a career with this company no advancement I enjoy working with my co-workers and manager is laid back and I've worked every section of the store.
good,Working at Big Lots wasn't all that I thought it would be I went in expecting to learn a little bit more and put a few more notches under my belt but that wasn't the case.
good,"A typical week of work will consist of arriving to work at 4 AM on Mondays. You'll learn a ton of things like, what your quota must be, stacking pallets, unpacking, relocating, the numbers on the boxes and items, where to place, how to handle customers, shape of store and advertisements, what to do to broken, stolen or ruined products, how to handle shopping carts, how to operate as a cashier, establish healthy worker communications, how to handle messes, how to handle expired food (if applicable) and irate customers, carry outs, custodian work (besides floor waxing), and covering for other workers who leave on a limb without professionalism. The management is on their highest level that can be provided. The culture structure is sophisticated and ""bites off more"" than what should be expected of the employees. The hardest part of the job is staying with them due to bad hours and how much you're paid on the hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the coworkers are friendly and if you have any O.C.D. , you can ""splurge"" out and organize all of the products they allow on the photo to structure."
good,"upper management does not feel that its necessary to step in until store is going under."
good,I actually really enjoyed working at Big Lots. There were only two reasons I eventually had to resign form working there is because management wasn't working with my availability and it was alittle far from where I lived during that time.
good,"Money focused company, who doesn't care about it's employees or customers so long as they make a profit. Short hours and rude managers were why I quit."
good,"the company is very small . the manager at the the was being switched out . had good experience with the employees . I have learned how to work with difficult people and situation's. on a typical day I would go in and clean bathrooms , front end. once that was done help stock till store would open."
good,"I felt like this job wasn’t enough for me we didn’t get benefits, no paid vacation or paid time off, no bonuses. We only received 20% the store we got 30 minute breaks that we’re free. I didn’t like working here because there was drama all the time the work was boring it wasn’t much for me."
good,"some great management and some bad .They didn't take advantage of what they had.They posses the talent and workers to make the tasks more efficient ,yet don't take advantage of experience.They relied to much on college education .I looked through 500 different colleges ,and not 1 ONE had class on warehouse management .It's a different breed of people ..you have to get to know the people ,along with their experience"
good,"The job is excellent in the sense if someone has not worked before, returning from work after a long period of no employment or a young person.  They expect to much from their employees in a short amount of time.  Advancement, raises, benefits are slim to none."
good,"The other employees constantly discussed their distaste for the job and management. Management would rarely give out full time hours to anyone but another manager. And customers were almost always irritated with the constant state of ""mess"" in the store."
good,it's a good place to work is relaxing there are very good companions is a very busy place they always have thing to do they are always busy they have very good customer service
good,Best part of job was interacting with customers and straightening shelves. It was a plus that we got employee discounts. Coworkers were a pleasure to work with
good,Poor organization. Poor communication. Poor planning. Management questional business and professional behavior. Assistant manager stealing time. Managent not following company procedured.
good,The atmosphere was pretty relaxed and the management at the time was decent. The only thing I can think to complain about was the disorganization of the products throughout the grocery side of the store.
good,Nice place to work you meet so many people working with the public nice discount sometimes your breaks were cut short due to not enough help for the busy times of day.  Employees need separate bathrooms from the public restrooms. Could use better newsroom for employees
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with directly on a day to day basis."
good,big lots was a good place to work at its just the managment that was the problem and also every employee that did work there were very nice to one eachother never no problems at all
good,I work on the register so I see the customers when they are ready to check out. I pretty much do the same things every time I work. There is a lot of miscommunication between employees and management. There is no guidance in training because of lack of staff.
good,Big Lots store deals with alot of after market name brans stuff on a daily bases. Freight comes in after mid-night and it has to be unloaded and out onto the floor by the store opens.
good,"I used to enjoy going to work every day. But ever since our new ATL-M came on board, everything has changed. The moral in the store has gone down, because she gossips and talks behind peoples back. And she is the laziest manager I have ever met in my entire life. She has made it so that I don't enjoy going to work anymore."
good,"I held this job just to earn some extra cash on the side.  I liked the fact that they paid out weekly, which helped with daycare gaps.  I also wanted something at the time that was pretty simple.  I'm sure there were ways to advance, but I was not too interested in all of that at the time."
good,No job work/life balance for management. Work expectations far exceeds compensation received. Raises for managers are a joke!! Store manager will throw you under the bus at any time!! Too many shifts with too few associates working to get the job done. Store manager doesn't put in the hours he should so most of your shift spent as the only manager in store.
good,One draw back to working retail is it's part time and you can't make a living working part time. Management is great and will work around your home life if possible.
good,"I worked here for a while it was minimum wage but I got my $0.20 raise for being there a year. It was fast paced almost everyday but we had some slow days (which was rare) I liked the people I worked with the management was okay you run into those rude and never satisfied customers but that's in any retail job, pay was weekly but depending on how many hours you get depends on what you'll check will look like every Friday but I was part time so I didn't expect a big check but sometimes it felt like I was working so hard and my check didn't amount to anything."
good,"Working in Accounts Payable was never boring, always something new. management had favorites that did not have abide by all the rules. Made it difficult on others on the team. Merchandise Coordinator was extremely stressful and no formal training for this position,"
good,"Biglots was an okay job, but its more so for a teenager. The Work environment was great as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck."
good,i absolutely loved staying busy.. i love stocking.. i loved my employees.. i loved having a set schedule.. i didnt like the manager setting hihs shifts up and other managers to fail
good,"Usually people who work here last only about a few months before they cant take it any longer. The work is very fast paced and it piles on you very quickly and usually its not the managers fault. The reason i say this is because they give each store a specific amount of hours total for a week, that is divided up between everyone working there, and its never good. Say they only give your store 300 hours for  week,and you had 4 managers the store manager and the assistant store manager immediately take 90 hours of that, then your other two managers take 32 hrs a piece so a total of 146 is left for everyone else,which is supposed to be about 20 people, that's about 7 hours per person that week. some people get more hours than others so its total garbage."
good,People are great to work with but the managers communication is not very good. Coming from an organization that  Communication is key to a place that don't really know what it is; is very  frustrating
good,"working for big lots was ok everyday I would walk an hour just to make it on time , I would be the only one unloading the truck ,had boxes fall on top of me , I worked my butt off to get laid off because the manager didn't like me."
good,"The company provides you with good training and assistance if needed, the coworkers were fun to work with and the manager was a reasonable person . The work was equally divided so everyone contributed in some way ."
good,"Big lots is an easy going place to work, very easy and not stressful. The customers are usually great, as is the management. Theres always something to do, your never not busy. i would definitley recommend working here for a part time job, but not a place you would want to make a career."
good,If you are just a stock the shelves you are doing good. As soon as you take a salaried position you are constantly working with hardly any time off. This is a major problem if you are a single parent.
good,"I currently work at big lots where i work in furniture sales but i also assist with cashiering and other things around the store such as unloading And loading furniture, taking out bales and trash along with gathering shopping carts from outside."
good,The whole warehouse was disorganized. The way the management team set schedules for people was bad; there would not be enough employees scheduled. The shifts were long because there wasn't enough customers coming in.
good,"Working at big lots you had to strive for a clean store and perfection every time. I understood that work mentality, but some of the managers there only worked for themselves. They capped off associate ours to only work less then 24 hours a week and no benefits. Pay was not enough to ever survive unless you were a manager."
good,Big Lots allowed me to use my creative management skills to build and maintain professional relationships. Very task driven environment.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at big lots however the pay is not worth the labor on ones body and mind. Also the hours are so random it makes it very hard to plan life around your schedule.
good,A typical day at work is extremely long. I learned that you have to be a team player to get everything done. Co-workers are awesome and the store manager was a great person.
good,co-workers weren't too welcoming. the hardest part of the job was loading/unloading 18 wheelers in 110 degree trailer.
good,Big lots is a nice environment to work in and you become friends with all your co workers and you guys become a family. But schedule wise it's not good because they only give you 20 hours a week.
good,"I have worked for Big Lots for 4 years and I have enjoyed my time with the company. However, they are very hard on their employees and can create a very hostile work environment at times. They don't offer any kind of sympathy or pay minimum wage."
good,"Typical work environment for retail. Learned a lot about the register and different ways to work as a cashier. Good management, good co-workers. The hardest part would be the holiday rush and the most enjoyable about the job would be being a cashier."
good,work at Big Lots keeps you busy and multi-tasking while remaining a challenge to stay on your toes.  I learned new ways of dealing with difficult customers while reassuring we appreciate the customer and their business.  Remembering the customer is the purpose of our job not an interruption of it. Management has improved since my employment there. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers and got along while implementing our duties. The hardest part of the job it to remain calm when very busy and getting customers checked out in a timely fashion in addition to multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new faces as well as repeat customers and being able to fulfill their wish list at good competitive prices.
good,"I'd clock in by signing in on a register, and as soon as I got there the other cashier would clock out. I'd greet customers coming in the front and check customers out at the register at the same time. Any time there were no customers in line I'd start restocking shelves but would get reprimanded if I wasn't in direct line of sight of the front door and my register. I would also get reprimanded if I didn't ask every customer if they wanted to in our rewards program regardless of if they were already in the program (lots of regulars). At the end of the night I'd restock all the shelves, clean all the isles, roll up the front mats for the deep cleaners, grab all the carts from the parking lot, then till out."
good,A great place to learn the basics of cashiering and the general ways of retail. Everyone is typically friendly. Best part was the 20% off daily and quarterly getting 30% weekends that can be used towards the lay-away. Hardest part is any retail job with people trying to cut a deal with the merchandise.
good,didn't have a chance to advance. hours were sporadic unloading the truck was very tough considering the weather because the truck was not next to the building
good,Typically you go in trade places with someone else. Maintain a clean work place. Check out customers and make sure all work that hasnt been done gets done.
good,"Early morning freight. Unloading trucks two days out the week. Floor associate, organized the aisles (food, tools, appliances, toys, domestics.)"
good,"About what you expect out of a retail job. Nothing special to say about this job. It wasn't terrible, but it isn't great. In building management was alright. Turnover rate at the job was fairly high, partially due to inept/corrupt workers, and partially due to it not being a destination job."
good,"had a blast working at biglots, though management was horrible.  Many fun people to work with.  A lot of wonderful customers, stocking and building furniture was a blast."
good,"I advanced quickly in the company due to my sales and communication skills. However, when new management got involved the operations and company fell as a whole."
good,"Great place to work but the store i'm at needs improvement starting at management and trickling down to the floor associates,management likes to through blame around from one manager to another on why they can't finish there tasks and ultimately other associates do the same, my job has always been easy for me since i was trained in almost all store job fields for big lots ranging from floor, stock, ad sets, cashier, and furniture. when everything goes good and everyone does their job the store is perfect but to many times people don't want to do their jobs and just walk around and do nothing. i could say more but this is just one store out 1,493 other stores"
good,An ok job for getting a little bit of extra cash in your pocket but not really a place to settle down if you want well paid job. Working there is mainly to get basic working experience then build up from there. The work place is friendly and all the associates I work with are very nice.
good,"managers tend to be lazy and put their work off onto other employees. i often played the part of manager, taking on many of their duties, but was denied a promotion to become a manager twice. i learned a great deal about staying calm when things got chaotic, and how to lead people despite not having the manager position. i enjoyed most of my co-workers, many of them were very hard workers and i got along with most of them. the most enjoyable part of my job was being challenged almost every day."
good,"Working at Big Lots is a great seasonal job, or first time job. However, after three years, multiple management changes, and redundant work it gets tiring."
good,It is a good starting point job. Did have many misunderstanding with the management. They do not feel as though there is a life between work and personal life. Not many advancement opportunities within this company at all.
good,Retail was my expertese so it was easy. Met new friends and did my job and learned new things.Wish i worked more hours to make more money it was fun.
good,It was a good job to start at for a first timer in the work force. I learned what hard work was there when I was on truck duty and had to unload the stores shipments item by item. Then label the items 1 by 1.
good,They were very flexible with my schedule.  It was a good job while going to school.  not a lot of breaks.  great people.  you have good days and bad days.
good,"Big Lots was one of the worse jobs I had. The store was robbed everyday, no security and lack of hours. I only like coming to work on Tuesdays because that's when a new truck came and unloading it was the best part. The hourly pay wasn't so bad, but the hours where not the best. It is a part-time job with only 6hrs( if even that) a day. One week I only received 7hrs a week or 14hrs a week. Not worth the travel at all."
good,My typical day starts with getting the department I work ready for the day. Make sure that all displays have proper signs if there are any sales going on at the time. I also make sure that if there are any delivers I find out what and how many pieces are to be delivered.I have learned that people are very receptive to other people who try to get them the best customer service they can. I have learned that my work ethics can carry me a long way. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers who are almost always repeat customers.
good,"This company had very friendly coworkers and managment staff."
good,"The corporate America that I get from Big Lots teaches me that there is not enough room for full time employees because they do not, or cannot pay for benefits. Pay is very low even thou I way told at time of hire I would receive more. Management works hard with employees to leave a corporate image to the public. I work hard to do what the company is asking of me. I do not see room for growth, and it somewhat depresses me, however I know that I must move forward and do why needs to be done. With that I do get some self satisfaction. I work well with ALL coworkers, however I do not have time to fatinize while working, and grow impatient with those that do not do their fair share of the work load.  It's all in a days WORK."
good,Easily paced work environment with a minimal amount of issues with management. Assistant managers create an uncomfortable work area in which one might not want to work.  However after getting past this the job is actually an easy an helpful experience to have.
good,"I only got like 12 hours a week but my job wasn't hard at all ,I was just a cashier. I liked everyone I worked with and the store manager Ronda was awesome ."
good,I enjoyed Big Lots. It's was a great place for me at the time with me being a young adult learning the ropes of retail. Management was great and you can't beat the prices.
good,"Sold furniture to customers, set up deliveries, and assembled as needed upon request."
good,"I like most of the people, but manager is not a people person. Great manager, just needs to deal with more people"
good,"Some days seemed to drag, i learned a new system, management was alright, coworkers were good."
good,Unloaded the trucks and stocked all food and other items reorganized all furniture in back room
good,"customer service is top priority, duties in task manager and processing paperwork.  Truck day is busy unload and stocking.  Receiving vendors and anything else need to be done."
good,"on a typical day at biglots i am gathering all the carts so customers dont have to go and complain to manager or css after that usually on wensday in the warehouse helping with the truck and after that stocking merchandise on shelves and doing odd stuff til evening then when the customers leave thats when the employees including myself recover the store like, go backs facing products on shelves til it is done."
good,wasnt the best but it was okay management could have been better
good,"Managers are constantly be switched out, bringing with them their own ways of managing a store. So be ready to learn a new way in doing things."
good,"A typical day at work at Big Lots is operating the cash register or being a stocker. Pricing merchandise and stocking the shelves. As far as management, they could use a little work. They could work on their communication skills. I love my co-workers. Everybody is friendly and down to earth. There is no hard part of my job while working at Big Lots. The most enjoyable part is my interaction with the customers."
good,"Always something to do, fast pace, merchandize product, work with many different people,"
good,"pretty much easy job dealing with nice people and co workers "
good,always productive work environment and learned how to unload freight and cashier experience.
good,"It's like working at Walmart from what I've heard. As an employee I wasn't treated well even after working with the company for years, but I made the best of it and gave it my all."
good,"I liked it at first, furniture dept was good liked what i did. but then was made to do other peoples job becuse they where managers and they did not want to do it."
good,"Demanding job, nice coworkers, management working on corporate culture, liked the travel and business relationships."
good,"I appreciate the knowledge and the skills that I was able to acquire "
good,Didn't have the opportunity to be a fulltime employee.
good,"I enjoyed this job because of the location,the type of work that i was doing, and the overall environment"
good,Typically an average weekday shift would be coming in and checking to see if there is a truck coming or if there is any furniture to put away in the back. If not you have to find something to build that isn't out on the sales floor. They try to get you to sell 5 rewards per shift which rarely happens because only regulars frequant the job. Most of the mangers were pretty cool. The furniture manager was the one I had a problem with. He didn't do any of the work that he left for others to do. Once he became the furniture manager he stopped doing most of it.
good,"Many areas covered, diversity,multitasking multifaceted position."
good,Arrive to work and clock in on a computer. I learned that at a store like Big Lots rotating the shelves happens more frequently than one might think! Management at this particular store was very forgetful and lazy with the random boost to work. Often sitting in the office for hours at a time while a short handed staff ran around like elves. The co-workers that I met here were outgoing people and hard workers (with the exception of a few). The hardest part of the job would have to be the roller coaster schedule consisting of all hours of the day. Honestly the only enjoyable part of working here was seeing my customers leave with a smile.
good,"Typial workday included opening/closing store, interacting with customers, setting planograms and merchandising. Reviewing p&l statements and other financial/sales documents to determine areas of improvement....Enjoy working with customers and co-workers."
good,i would do everything from cash regester to sales floor to recovery and costumer assistance all in one day
good,"a typical day included working at the cash register, ringing up guest, closing the store"
good,The company had a lot of change. In the short time I was there we had 4 different store managers. They each had their own style but especially the last manager I worked with came in strong and didn’t seem to care about the associates. I would often hear him speaking badly about my coworkers and other managers.
good,"Managers spent to much time in office "
good,I stay because I need the money but the hours are low and management is not so good. Business is not good and it is so sad because Biglots is trying this store of the future but it did not stop the slowdown.
good,Ok place to work if you're looking for part time work or a college student.   Full time is not available except to managers. Shifts share normally in 4 hour increments.
good,"Very tight on payroll with little support from corporate management due to being a store away from others, out of the way, so very little support from DM"
good,"Big lots is an okay company to work for and you often form close relationships at store level. Unfortunately corporate is in constantly tweaking and changing every little thing in a desperate effort to increase sales, which only frustrates the customers and the employees who have to move and/or relearn something for the 100th time. "
good,It is an ok culture to work for. The pay needs to be better especially for long time associates. The only way of knowing is to actually work there. Everybody’s experience is different.
good,"Can get into management pretty quickly by just being a good employee (staying late, coming early, offering to take more shifts, show up on time). Getting to the next step is a little more difficult. Better to leverage your experience with another company if you want an advancement after the initial one."
good,Sometimes management teams not strong.  They like to call out then you end up working double shifts.  Have to be hands on to make sure your are successful.
good,"I work freight most days. I unload a truck 1-2 times a week,also acting MOD on the floor. Open the store which is counting the registers the safe and change  drawer. Get tills ready for the day. Twice a week I close the store, counting tills and getting money ready for deposits. I also help train the nest people who start to work."
good,Assistant management is good. Hours can be flexible depending on your availability. You get a 20% discount on everything (not dairy) and 30% on furniture.
good,"I loved working big lots. Just not enough hours. Their a great company to work for. They have good training,and friendly staff. If you wanted to work two jobs would be more ideal as a second job."
good,My job at Big Lots was pretty fun I worked as a stocker and cashier. We would unload the freight trucks and put the items on pallets and then the next day we would put the items out onto the sales floor. Most days were pretty slow and the managers liked to micromanage and push you to sign people up gor their rewards program which no one wanted. They would speak over the radio to you telling you what to do and what to say. The hours were low and I at 20 hours had some of the most hours out of the other employees. They would just hire a bunch of people and split up the hours. Some shifts were 4 hours and that was the regular. You get a store discount which is good but there's just no where near enough money to make. The manager's defiantly had favorites and it felt much like high school. The work was fun enough but defiantly a short term job.
good,"Very chill and easy job, great co workers and managers. Great job for college students as they are very flexible around hours and schedules. Just not a good job if you’re looking for full time and room for advancement."
good,"If you are looking for a part time job while you are going to school for something else, than big lots is perfect. If you are a cashier it is very slow paced and sort of a laid back job, but if you are a stocker it is more fast paced. There is not a good chance for advancement due to the fact that big lots would rather hire from outside then promote from within."
good,"Fun job, not a lot of room for advancement though. Have to be on your feet constantly, so if you can't stand for long periods of time, not the job for you."
good,"Employees Are great just management isn’t fair, always treated different people like different he’s okay with you for a day or two then if you do something that he doesn’t like he will  punish you by cutting your hours"
good,I had okay experience with big lots. Nice co workers. Reasonable sometimes. Different positions clean store and some respect. Friendly and customer are okay.
good,"I enjoy it and the people can be friendly. I just can't afford to work part time. I'm raising 2 kids by myself and its just not enough money. I supposedly have dental and vision coverage but I've never heard nothing from my management. I don't have a set schedule, so my hours are all over the place, which makes it hard to make appointments around it."
good,Managers are always breathing down your neck. Not getting paid enough with the amount of work expected. Physically demanding wit little compensation nor organization.
good,"They would never hire you on full time.  "
good,"Big lots was fun as a first job and I was glad for the opportunity, but some of my co workers were unprofessional, I felt like my manager tried to hide from me when I had questions, and when I called in to check the schedule after Christmas they told me I'd been fired. I worked there 3 months."
good,"Big Lots is a great place to start working at. However they do not have opportunities for advancement. They do have some employee benefits however they are not the best. Management is ok, but sometimes they set unrealistic goals for employees."
good,"too few on shift for expected workload.  Flexible work hours. Only managers work full time and get benefits. Lead Associate position does not include pay raise. No pay differentials for experienced workers. No pay raise incentives , only an annual review with 2-3% raise allowed."
good,I only worked for a month for when they remodeled and it wasnt bad really! The managers are great and the co workers were very caring. Overall pretty great
good,I made a mistake working there. I have nothing more to say. Please think twice about working there. They don't care about people unless you're a customer bringing in money.
good,It was a quick paced job.....I liked it tho but for dts leads we had to unload trucks our selves in the furniture section if the furniture manger had left for the day
good,Just like most retail stores if you are a stocker you most likely will have to help with the truck which is the toughest thing you will do there. The only difference is that Big Lots carry furniture and lawn sets that come in heavy boxes that will always need several people to help with so imagine call outs which makes you have to work harder. Working the cashier is fairly easy and depends on how long you can stand in one spot assisting customers with their purchases. Other than that coworkers are very friendly and understandable.
good,It has both slow times and busy times. I enjoyed working there with the people i got to know. Hours are here and there but they try to be fair in scheduling you.
good,"I learned how to be more independent at my work station, managers were always there in the blink of eye if help was needed. The hardest part about the job would be unloading the truck. The most enjoyable thing about working for Big Lots was having friends and family that also worked there."
good,"Management is a little poor. Managers can be rude to you if you were to call off, especially if you're new.  There is alot of gossip so its better to stay quiet and mind your business of course."
good,Big lots had its own style of handling things. Customers weren't always nice and employees would handle them rudely. Its something I didn't want to be a part of.
good,"Like most retailers, being a manager at Big Lots requires you to fulfill project requirements with inadequate resources and time, dealing with perpetually low staffing due to low pay at the associate and lead levels, and constant stress.  Having a competent store manager has a significant impact upon the success of the store and how well operations proceed as the assistants are rarely given enough authority (and certainly enough hours as we are hourly employees limited to 45 hours per week) to be able to act in a way that could overcome a bad store manager.  A good store manager can make the work environment a lot less stressful.  However, there are some managers out there who are only interested in their own career advancement and will use up employees and assistants in an effort to get ahead and stand out for promotion to district manager."
good,"There were several layers of management, which felt unusual for such a small store. Turns out, 'manager' was a term thrown around surprisingly lightly, and I often found myself doing 'managerial' duties (such as hazardous waste disposal, or inventory shrink reporting) simply because the manager had other things they -liked- to do, and arranged their priorities as such (unusual to have a floor associate dealing with HazMat, and using manager ID codes, and falsifying their signatures)."
good,Productive place to work but short on hours.It’s a  too hot or too cold environment to work in on a regular basic..But the people are friendly and cordial
good,"Customers was amazing to get along with "
good,"There always very friendly coworkers and managers, very helpful with hours but only benefits was discount which did come in handy. Very clean and very well put together."
good,Good people and managers not enough hours to go around between associates. The pay was not enough to sustain an independent lifestyle as a single mother in bend oregon
good,"Very low hours, the manager likes to complain about everything and you never seem to do anything right in His eyes. I worked 4hours in one week and my hours never seem to go above 8."
good,"Everyone does a little bit of everything and you must learn how to use the cash register. a typical day a work is you clock in and do your task that you are assigned to. Management kind of suck depending on who it is. Everyone is friendly at work.  The job is easy but sometimes i feel like i do too much for too little of the pay (register, recover floor, work on furniture).  The work is easy. you get paid every week and get a 20 cents raise every year."
good,Had different hours every week and you couldn't plan anything.  No benefits unless you were a manager on salary.  When unloading a truck in the winter there was no heat.  In the summer the fan hardly worked.
good,Poor hours but great management. Friendly customers. Friendly coworkers. Some weeks I'd get 4 hours other weeks I'll get 20 hours. Extremely inconsistent
good,the overall operation is dated and needs improvement.  Processes need to be realigned but for someone who is looking for a mid level management opportunity its a good stepping stone.
good,"Close-knit, encouraging, and energizing place to work! Plenty of variation throughout the day and a wonderful discount on the already cheap snacks and drinks!"
good,"My coworkers were enjoyable.  My managers did the best the could with what they had to work with. (Meaning, insufficient support from the corporate office, lack of employees, low moral and pay.)  There was opportunity for advancement because turnover was high. The hardest and most frustrating part of the job was being expected to handle customer phone calls while managing the point of sale."
good,It's a nice place to start working at if you like stocking and unloading trucks. You will learn something new in each department that you are placed in. The managers are friendly and always willing to help. It's a very diverse place to work at and not hard to get along with each other. Hardest part of the job would be trying to learn everything in furniture department but you will catch on.
good,"Don't have much time for family, they take advantage of the good workers and let the bad workers do what they want. Scheduling is a joke, get your schedule on Saturday for the next week so you can't make plans for Sunday."
good,The staff is nice. You only get christmas off.You won't get 40 hours per work. The training could be better. Be prepared to learn most of it on your own. Also you will end up working in every area of the store. And women do help with the heavy furniture .
good,Needs more room for advancement Also need to be a better training program to get to advance. Better activity with managers within your own district. also needs more updated merchandise in the store to bring a better customer to the store
good,"I was hired as seasonal help and worked for several months until I had a conflict with working hours for the State Job at Jones Beach. It was difficult to balance both jobs. I did both jobs to the best of my ability. Nice seasonal job, no long term growth there."
good,Stressful place always changing and always demanding more with less.we run the store on minimum people but expect more from everyone.  Want customer service n expectations are high but no extra help.
good,"The company has an old school vibe that is trying to figure out it's next role in the marketplace. It's plans really look towards the future, but there will be some adaptations to make to get there."
good,It was a fun place to work. The only reason I left was to try something new and to have a more consistent work schedule to be able to better provide for my children.
good,If you need hours not the place to be. All associates are part-time and hours vary from week to week.Good for a little spending money. You get hours if you are always available.
good,My time at Big Lots Onsite was a very enjoyable environment.  We had a small team but we worked together.  I loved this job until new management stepped in with little to no idea how a travel department should be run.
good,"OK job if you're satisfied with barely above minimum wage for PT work, that is the Big Lots corporate business model. Store management is the key, and our store has excellent management and we all take pride in being the best store in our district. ""It is what it is""."
good,I enjoyed assisting and helping the customers at Big Lots. I feel as if I learned a lot of my customer service skills from working in this position. I would suggest working at Big Lots to a friend.
good,"you Meet a lot of nice people, customers and workers. Job is not hard. Register is fairly easy to learn. Tax exempt is not that easy but doesnt happen often. Stocking and straightening not bad. Scheduling is a nightmare, never the same two weeks in a row, hard to make appointments when you dont know what you work the following week. Hours are limited though they did try to work around my home life schedule. But 8 hours one week and 26 the next doesnt cut it. It is not steady until around the holidays like thanksgiving and christmas."
good,"I am still at Big Lots due to my great working relationship with my Store Manager.  If it was for him I would of left this company a long time ago.  My current Store Manager is fair, caring and is supportive.  He empowers me and encourage me to grow.  These are some of the reasons why I stayed."
good,"The time that I have been working here it has been okay but nothing to write home about. The people you work with are the real backbone in the place not the store manager. well at least from the store I work for. The management is pretty well divided because some of them want to help you thrive and advance in any way you can but, the others don't care one bit about you. They sit on their butt and expect you to do everything they are suppose to do. Also don't expect to be making good money at all. I've been working for them for almost 3 years and i'm not even making $8.20 a hour."
good,working there was a little bit frustrating. management didnt really care for the employees. We were overworked and yelled at for small issues. It was a department store so we had a lot of customers but they were unrully. a lot of cleaning up and organizing and a lot of rude customers. would not work there longer than a year
good,"As with most jobs, the management and culture are the biggest factors in determining job satisfaction and longevity. If management treats you with respect and provides adequate support and your chemistry with co-workers is good, it will be a more enjoyable environment. This will no doubt vary from store to store. The furniture sales lead position can be very physically and mentally demanding in a smaller store with less employees and one needs to be quite flexible and versatile. A typical day not only includes excellent customer service and sales skills but also maintenance of the sales floor, including replacing signage, assembling and displaying furniture, receiving and stocking freight, checking emails and other paperwork. Positive customer interactions can be very rewarding, while negative ones can be disheartening. Maintaining an upbeat, can-do attitude is essential to meeting performance goals and is made easier with management recognition. The work is never ""done,"" but each task accomplished brings a sense of satisfaction!"
good,"management sucked, the deadlines sucked, it wasn't a well ran place. My boss was very lenient on attendance. Big lots should invest in cleaning associates. It sucked stocking all morning then spending the afternoon scraping vomit off a shelf."
good,"Work days could be very so most of the time. Some Managers was good to work with some wasn't. There was room to advance ,nor was the pay good all. If they hired you for stocking ,you only work 18 to 20 hours ."
good,"The cashier was fast paced, the breaks were whatever worked with the flow of customers and other workers breaks. Stocking the shelves were at night after closing and didn't last long."
good,The work that u are given on a day to day is vary stressful. The supervisor make sure that you work for your 12 dollars an hour. They make many promises that they don't hold. All the supervisors are all about self image and will through you under the bus to save there own.
good,"It's an okay job but certainly isn't something you would want to make a career out of. Management is okay but the pay and benefits are not good compared to the amount of work that is required. Everyone does everything there. I made 8.25 to pack out furniture, run the register, clean nasty bathrooms, mop floors, put back returns, etc. and I do not think that's good enough. It's typically busy around the holiday season and managers practically refuse to do any work and haul their tasks off on associates. I like the people I meet there, and customers are some of the nicest I've dealt with, but still not worth it."
good,Big Lots was fun learning new things working with the co/workers meeting new people. But during holidays time the place is outta control. You spend more time unloading boxes you got a week to unload 3000 boxes with two people that’s willing to work
good,It was a decent job that works its employees hard. Lots of different duties for this job and a very wide variety of selections to work with. Lots of customer service involvement. After my injury on the job here i was unfortunately not treated as a valued employee even for part time. I had about 75% of my hours cut and was treated lowly by the head manager. I left shortly after this happened ensuring theyd still cover my medical bills and expenses.
good,"This was probably the best experience anyone could have as their first job. Flexible hours and a laid back team. Management was stressed out half the time due to company impulses, but took the time to teach new employees the rope. However the company itself was trying to do innovative things that lacked proper guidance. The day seemed to run on impulses rather than plans. Overall the experience was fair, great people at my specific location, flexible hours, tons of experience and new knowledge."
good,"Working at this place an be difficult due to the physical demands. Other than that, its can be a fun place to work because of the constant change in product"
good,"The potential for growth with this company is nil. If you are looking for a job where you can work minimal hours for minimal pay without challenging yourself very often, then this is the jobfor you."
good,"You have to be 18 years old you get paid weekly 8.50 but depending on your service and what you do the pay isn't worth it the stress is far from it. "
good,The store manager was total drama and a back stabber.  Some of the employees that I met would help make my day.  The hardest part of the job was getting a compliment from the store manager.
good,"Learned how to run a very large scale big box store. Learned how to manage multiple departments. Which included furniture, food, electronics, seasonal, and pet department"
good,"The one and only reason why I've stayed with Big Lots so long is because of my co-workers. It sounds cliche, but we really are a tight, little away from home family. I'm leaving, because I desperately need benefits, (health, dental, life...) and they don't offer benefits to part time employees."
good,The management shifted quite frequently. It has a friendly staff but the schedule can change weekly. There are opportunities available for those willing to work fluctuating hours or different positions.
good,The company itself is good but the way the policies are its very hard to hold employees accountable for there work performance  and discipline them. The freight unload process is one of the worst company run direction.....
good,Its pretty fast pace and you also will have your fair share of very rude and impatience customers. There's great furniture to be bought. So its an ok place to be.
good,every time i came to work I cleaned the men and women bathrooms then i sweep around the front area then i clean the windows make sure my area is clean before opening
good,they don't hire    full time employees so no health or other benefits just discount on merchandise  the hours are okay any where from 3 to 8 hour shifts but normally just 4 hour and you only get 13 to 28 hours a week
good,I dint like it it was hot dusty and stink but I had to pay my bills I need another job I have nothing and will come to wk everyday on time no felonies I'm a young strong man
good,I enjoy working for the company but seem to be stuck in my current position with no way to advance up because you have to go through each step on the ladder and the next step is ready to advance yet. I'm more than qualified to move up a couple more position's but cant.
good,"I did not stay here long as it was just a place holder job for me to make ends meet as i was waiting for a better job to do a mass hiring. despite that i enjoyed my coworkers, but at the time organization of the store was messy.  i have visited old coworkers that still work there after having left nearly 4 years ago and they have all assured me its gotten much better in the past years."
good,a gret palce to work if you don't have any bills and no family at home no benefits and low hours I would recommend this job to any high school or a second job
good,The warehouse that I worked in was hard work and not for those who aren't physically fit. The second shift didn't allow for much time at home with family or friends. There are dozens of people who have been there for decades and not advanced beyond box throwing.
good,"I counted my till ran recipits on all registers straighting up around the registers.  And answering the phone and by then it was time to open up the  store. The hardest part  was when everything was happening all at once,  the phone would ring someone needed a refund some one needed to be rung up so I had to call another cashier up to her register. And the most enjoyable was making new friends  learning new things also getting  a discount on my purchases.  I got along well  with management and my other coworkers,  I think that we all got along well with  each other."
good,"a good part time job. i work in the furniture department, so i learned how to sale. the hardest part of the job is adapting to the scheduling. overall the workplace is good."
good,"While working at big lots I learned great customer service skills. As a cashier I learned about the Point of Sale system for cashiering, promotion of Big lots loyalty card members and Loss prevention."
good,"very fast paced and stressful. not everyone actually works, some just walk around. my day was always different, very physical and demanding. very few managers that actually work. the pay is good if u find a store where everyone does their share of work."
good,"The atmosphere of the Big Lots company is very relaxed. I enjoy my managers and the flexible schedule. If a person is looking to work part-time while attending school, this is a great place to work."
good,"Labor scheduler was designed to improve efficiency writing weekly schedules, instead causes normally flexible schedules to assign less hours for restricted personnel (I.E. single parents,college students)"
good,worked for biglots straight out of highschool and was great first job but not as organized as it would appear. some of my managers were questionable but got along nicely with co workers
good,"Neighborhood pillar for great sales, groceries, and everyday furnishings. Management was spotty due to poor workers, but work was fulfilling. They worked well with my school schedule and making up extra hours was a breeze."
good,Nice people but they can also be catty. We barely make any money and we get no benefits. Corporate tries to control everything even though they have no idea what they are talking about because there not in the store everyday.
good,A typical day at Big Lots was typically laid back. I learned to use a pallet jack. The management was friendly. the hardest part was unloading the goods truck when it was cold outside. The most enjoyable part was that no customers were in the store while I was working.
good,"Biglots, Inc. is a great place to work.  The only two downfalls are the dependency placed on the computer to train their staff and the quick training of store managers.  "
good,"A typical day would be me up front by myself assisting customers and maintaining the front the store. Restocking returns, unloading delivery trucks,and training new employees. Cleaning bathrooms and staff lounge."
good,"This is a good job for someone who needs just a little money or needs flexibility in their work schedule. Ideal for high school students, college students, or bored retirees"
good,I was please and enjoyed the place  but I didn't get a chance really enjoy and have much with the people I worked with cause I had a family issue out of state and I just stayed .
good,"Love the people I work with. I unload trucks, stock shelves, sell furniture and handle all kinds of frate, and cashier when needed. I also keep the store clean and shelves orderly."
good,This job taught me how to be quick and tidy. We had to put out merchandise and be done with truck that same day it came in. Manger was amazing and assistant managers were so much help.
good,"The on a good days we have our enjoyment on a bad day it gets really cranky ESPECIALLY the holidays. If you're an employee you get a 20% on everything not bad, EH?"
good,Great place with low prices everyday all day. Amazing products that last a life time. Different adventure down every isle with surprises that would even shock your wallet. Employees are hard friendly workers on stand to assist you with any questions or assistance with products. Hardest part is finding a product to take to checkout because there are so many different awesome things to choose from. Looking foward to another day of Big Lots! Where every isle is a surprise just waiting to be opened!
good,A typical day at work involved signing in to the computer then proceeding to the back of the store to get a pallet full of boxes. The rest of the day would be spent stocking shelves with the merchandise from those boxes
good,Big lots is a good place to get into your first job but isn't a job to stay at for a while because its hard to grow. And big lots doesn't give you many hours
good,"This was my second restaurant job and it was a bit different than i was used to. The team was great and the management was fine. There was a lot of ups and downs with the company, but it was overall a great experience."
good,"When I worked there it was busy, good managers, but the company had no security when we needed it the most.It was very close to my home which was a plus."
good,A typical work day at big lots was about six or seven hours of just stocking merchandise. My coworkers were cool for the most part minus this old grumpy guy. The hard part of the job was the requirements. We had to stock 21 boxes of merchandise and hour.
good,"My co-workers were probably more managerial than the managers. They would sit in the back room and basically leave all the hard work for us, until the registers got full or crowded. SOme of us would have to work as early as 4 or 5 AM in order to try and get the freight off the truck and to the shelves. All in all, I had a minimally nice time while working for Big Lots."
good,Biglots need better priceing system lots of tag dont. Scan cause your line to back up my Relief was always late are trying to call out on payday no manger would relieve me till my Relief got there im all for work but when im ready to go im ready to go manager was cool if you have Bill's working here make sure you have a SECOND JOB WORKING HERE they will give you 3hours Shifts
good,This job was one of the first jobs that I've had. It was a learning experience and I was gracious to start making money on my own.
good,"unloaded trucks for floor merchandisers which I also did."
good,"Weekly shipments of freight, unloaded by hand for up to 5 hours outside the store, whether rain or shine, hot or cold. Management is friendly, but lack disciplinary skills. 1/5 employees actually work in that store. Others simply talk in the back room or stare at their phone in the bathroom."
good,"Big Lots is a company that I have come to find a bit lacking. The management lacks cohesion which makes for a work environment that is both stressful and chaotic. Managers are not very helpful, they never let you finish a task that you were given...by them. They always seem to push you from one place to another, and when they ask why a task was never completed you have to tell them why and then they become frustrated at you."
good,Provide customer service on a daily basis and assisting customer finding specific products in the store. I learned to be a cashier. I worked very well with my co workers and everyone was friendly in the store. Managers with great to work with and provided a work friendly environment and positive attitude. The hardest days were during holiday season and the most enjoyable part of this job was the customer interaction.
good,"My job at biglots basically consist of getting asignments for my level & going to each slot putting labels on product. I have to make sure its the right product & have to put the product on a conveyor belt at a certain amount of minutes to keep up my performance percentage which  if is above 100 or more you can earn incentives on each pay check each week.The breaks are split up by 30minutes which we only get 2 breaks,I have very friendly co-workers,& the hardest part about the job is working the long hours on the shift I work.The most enjoyable part about job is they pay every week & its easy when the work isn't heavy on your level."
good,I usually do all the returns and exchanges. Assisted cashiers when they need it. The hardest part of the job is sometimes they did not understant what you were going thru .the most enjoyable part of the job is when i went home.
good,How they ran some things wasn't the best but they did give me a lot of experience due to having me work in all different areas and some of the managers and employees grew to be like family to me. The experience and the family like environment will be the reason i will never regret this job.
good,"Working at Big Lots was a new and good experience for me. By working in an industry where it's necessary to be reactive to consumers' changing needs, it was necessary to be flexible with scheduling shifts. In a typical day, I would: organize and stock store shelves with fresh products, assist customers with questions and locating merchandise in the store, and set up and tear down promotional displays. I did this while working with an incredible group of individuals. All employees and management would show up, prepared to give 110 percent each day, even on the most difficult days. For example, when we would receive our weekly merchandise truck, it would require a team effort of five to six individuals to get the truck unloaded in the allotted time. As a team, we would overcome fatigue, extreme heat, and even dehydration."
good,"As the Assistant Manager, I handled total store operations, but it was a very hands-on position. I really loved the people I worked with and it was a very challenging job. We didn't know the specifics of what product we were getting until it arrived, so that made merchandising very difficult. I learned a lot about controlling shrink at Big Lots."
good,It was fine i guess. I have no ill will towards this company. Unfortunate that it is going through some financial change and closing down its Valley Operations. Needs to improve in its culture. Needs to hire more main stream staff in order to accomplish its 21st Century concept.
good,I've been overlooked 4 times for advancement while they go outside the company to hire.  Also goes for many others in the store.
good,This company changes a lot with who your supervisor is.  Salaried managers stock a lot of shelves and put in the time until the store is in a good spot.
good,Working retail could be difficult but you manage throughout the day. I have learned how to help two to three people at the same time making each customer happy. I am a team player and making sure everyone leaves with a smile is the best part of the day.
good,"First coming onto the shift would be register sign on, then proceeding to clean up the front end from any items left from the shift before.  Once the next associates shift begins, they will take over register and then begins recovering the store and making sure each customer is satisfied. Management is not the most supportive or pleasant to be around, due to high demands from upper management.  Co-workers are very careless when it comes to tasks assigned.  The hardest part of this job was dealing with co workers and their lack of passion.  The most enjoyable was accomplishing goals asked of you and making sure the customers are happy. After working here for 2 months, I was promoted to supervisor."
good,"If you like to work with people, this is it. It is fun and they will try to work around your time frame."
good,A typical day is handling money transcations(credit leasing or cash register).  Assign break times to employees and ensure that timing is right. The hardest part of the job is doing everyones job when you're trying to get yours done at the same time. The Most enjoyable part able the job is developing resolutions to customers with problems with products.
good,"Big Lots has for the most part proven to be a downhill experience. It was good work at the start when me and the original team were building the store however things very quickly deteriorated. The district managers and the head manager like me in the store, however my loyalty to the company only runs as deep as my paycheck, which isn't much. Like any other retail store they keep everyone's hours just below the legal requirement to be considered full time, and they do not let you take overtime."
good,its was a nice place to work but not a lot of hr.... but I work late night stocking and it was fun I must say I love to work so any job I have I will make the best of it
good,Working at big lots is hard if you make it hard. They have great beefits and great vacation.
good,"Days at work are spent working resets and freight while maintaining a clean and neat presentation for our customers. "
good,This job is a great position to learn management. There's no room for a promotion and your wage is not equal to the responsibility. It's a decent employment to help understand store related procedures and store dynamics.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, assembling furniture, cleaning sales floor, making sure orders were placed for day, moving orders to designated areas, going over inventories, checking sales for previous day, selling/loading of furniture, paperwork, use of the cash registers, counting of tills, add prep and changing floor plans when needed and repairing or replacing out of date or damaged displays."
good,"Learned how to better organize a warehouse, stock and unload the trucks that came in."
good,like the costumers like the job but hours were bad employer was good people
good,"I was responsible for all aspects of a multi-million dollar business in all HR, operations, and merchandising standards. I was the general store manager for this company for one year, but have been a retail manager for over 15 years and wish to leave the retail workforce for better work/life balance."
good,I do not recommend anyone to work for this company. Always under man to accomplish a tasks
good,"a typical day at big lots last about 4 to 5 hours and it feels like 8 hours because i get done with my list before the first half of my time being there then after I'm done I'm just supposed to go back and straighten up the shelves again and again and again and so on, then i go into the wear house and sweep the floor and compress all the loose cardboard and throw away all the garbage because no one else does it themselves but decides to leave it for someone else to clean up. until about a half hour before the end of my shift then i sweep the whole floor with in 10 to 15 minutes then then day is over and i feel like i accomplished nothing at all... the hardest part of this job is when you clean the whole ware house on night, its completely destroyed the next morning and you have to do it the next night because people are lazy and don't like to work. the most enjoyable part of this job is my break because i get the time to be away from the people that talk so bad about me because i get the most hours for working hard and they talk bad about me together and make sure i know and try every day to get me to quit for it and its just really relaxing to just take a break from that, and that's the part of the day i look forward to in this job. what i learned is that people don't like to do their jobs themselves but instead rely on others to take care of them. my co workers talk bad about me and try and get me to quit every single day."
good,"- Handle customer service, promote sales"
good,"Training is very light, you are not prepared for a very long time. I was not register trained for almost an entire year. Daily work process was pretty simple, clean products, interact and sell to customers and recover your sections. Management can range from anywhere between hard working or someone that hides in the office until closing and still takes all the credit from the rest of his staff. Most of the employees are nice/respectful."
good,Walking in its not that busy but when an hour hits its on. the managers dont like to deal with customers but they have the rest of the team to help out.
good,"Good training, Customers are the best.  A lot of good people to work for. However, there is no backing by upper management, and they have a high turnover rate."
good,"my typical day at work: I would unload boxes, price the merchandise, then place the merchandise on the shelves. When we would close up for the night, I had to straighten up all the shelves."
good,"1.my typical work day is  unloading 21 - 2500 loads of  boxes off truck and bust 2 or 3 freights a day and help out my employees and clean up all the trash see everything cleared off the floor before the store opens."
good,"i was a manager, with no associates under me really to help me move and lift furniture. Even though that was the case, i would still get slaps on the wrist. VERY unfair working environment, would never go back. I had a 3 people job but one small salary!"
good,They were a good company. We had a store full of long timers. The company eventually got rid of them all and replaced them with two facers and suck ups. It eventually turned into high school all over again. I was great at my work and really enjoyed it. The petty squabbling eventually drove me to quit.
good,"It was a typical retail job, I learned how to provide excellent customer, count down registers, do deposits, and stock inventory. One of my boss's was not pleasant at all but I worked through it."
good,was a good work experience everyday I learned something new and that made me grow. I learned that you have to communicated to everyone and make sure that they understand what you have discussed before the comversation ends. I love to interact with others; working with the public and co-workers is what I miss the most they were like family.
good,For me this wasn't a place I enjoyed but having 2 children forced me to take any position available to maintain. I did not stay long the employees there are more secluded people everyone sort of did their own thing
good,"Waiting on customers. Helping them find products in store, cashing them out."
good,"worked 10-12 hrs a day. I would open or close the store depending on my shift . had to get cashiers and their cash draw counted and ready for the shift. I unloaded the trucks and stocked shelves. maintained a clean store,and provide good customer service.treated coworkers like family and with respect. hardest part about the job was the stress and no time for family life. most enjoyable was the customers."
good,The store always had trouble with the heating and cooling system. Management was ok. Never could depend on getting many hours until holidays.
good,"I have been with the company for 9 years. The last 2+ years have been the worst. The DM is unreasonable, and lacks people skills. Rude, condesecening, hateful are just a few words to use for her. It is illogical for corporate to expect one or two people to recover a huge store in just 3 hours, and expect the store to look 100%. It cannot be done in the larger stores. I started as a recovery associate, & am now a css. I do recovery, cashier, stock, furniture, cart retrieval. Half the time there aren't enough people to get anything done,because corporate won't give the hours. There is always a list of projects a mile long, with no hours to complete them. It's like corporate is setting you up to fail. When you have managers that will work along side of you, instead of delegating from an office with a mini fridge of snacks, then you have a more productive crew. Many of my co-workers are like family. We have held on together over the years and kept our store going. Our regular customers know us by name, & I enjoy knowing that they come back because we gave them great customer service."
good,"Considering the area i live in, I didn't expect much from this workplace with cleanliness and kindness. I have an easy job as a cashier but the store and team can do way better and i mean that in so many ways!"
good,25 years retail / over 15 years management experience working with customers and the general public daily. Couching teams to strive to succeed in both career and life. Enjoy the excitement and fast pace of retail and the creative aspect of merchandising.
good,"at biglots i would have to clean the front area before the doors opened, count my register, answer phones, supervise cashiers, build merchandises, then count my tills at the end of work."
good,I started this job while in high school. . This job did not offer benefits such as health insurance or retirement so I looked for another job that would provide such benefits and locate Albertsons.
good,Stock shelves and check out customers. Fun place to work not a whole lot of micromanaging
good,I enjoyed working with team members on certain tasks. Easy and simple instructions. Management always was on your back.
good,"A typical day at Big Lots is just interacting with different kinds of people, learning new things everyday through the customers. The hardest part of the job is getting the irate customer that are irate because of the outside world, and still remaining calm through it all."
good,A regular day at work would be punching in and getting your cash register ready for the day and your area ready for customers with enough plastic bags and a pen in handy. What you learn is to be able to deal with all types of customers that you will an counter with while being at the register and how to keep a smile at all times regardless if you are having a bad day. Management was nice and on task with everything. Never really had a problem asking questions when needed help with something or just advice on what I need to work on. Co-workers were really fun to work with. Very helpful and we never gave each other a hard time when it came to cover each others shifts. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with rude customers and the go backs. Go backs would be a lot of stuff that customers would leave behind that they would not want anymore or just place them where they do not belong. Enjoyable part would be the co-workers and great customers that would come in and not give you a hard time .
good,I was constantly understaffed and always scheduled with short staff; two other managers left many tasks to me while they did nothing
good,"Usually scheduled for a 3 to 4 hour shift, but tend to work 6 to 8 hour shifts because of work needing to be done."
good,Lead others and make our daily goals. Helped open and close store. Cash Office was a great expirience.
good,I was in high school at the time that I started the job. Over all the job was a great place to start. Learned how to deal with a variety of customers. Learned how to operate a cash register and how to count down tills for the first time. It was fun while it lasted cause it was my first job.
good,Nice people to work with. Good management team.  Not enough hours. It was very casual attire there. This is the first stock job I have ever had. I would do this kind of work again
good,"Fairly  decent job"
good,"I worked there for 4 years and moved up very quickly from a basic start employee and went to Furniture sales lead, and than a Dock to stock lead. It started going down hill when the GM started to become more and more lazy and placing more work on the other staff and blaming the slight failure of the store on the team, when the team was doing it all to keep the place afloat. The benefits are some of the best I have ever seen. The pay is lower than most places, but the retail environment is nice and the customer base is really friendly. Its a great place to work, but the team is what, i would say, makes or breaks the overall experience."
good,"A typical day at work is very simple"
good,"Biglots is a wonderful place to work with wonderful coworkers and management. You have to be willing to work very hard and be very reliable, If everyone does there part the job is wonderful."
good,It was ok for the time I was there. It's a good starter job for someone entering the working worId or just out of high school. I prefer not to provide additional details.
good,Good building block for your career. People can make all the difference in your success or failure. Team building is very important and good team leading is complicated to find.
good,"Maybe it was the area and the store I was at, but it was a joke working there.  Store manager didn't listen. I even let him know what was going on. I even tried an contact the district manager and never got a response. Apparently they didn't care."
good,Great place to work as far as a part time job goes. Friendly coworkers and customers. Management is willing to work around your availability. Starting out I had no cashier experience but was very easy to learn and adapt.
good,Poor upper management with no sense of urgency to help stores out when they need it.  New upper managers assume they understand what's going on in the store without asking questions first..no support
good,"Working at Big Lots gave me more retail and cashiering experience that I really needed at that time.  I have sensed a very strong need to be able to run the cash register along with other machinery associates with retail or many years.  My retail skills were growing during a six-nine month time period.  However, I stayed there for four years until I returned to workin my field of architectural CAD drafting."
good,I enjoyed working with the public and the assistant managers. Day to day operations were somewhat mundane but I enjoyed working with the public and would recommend the job to those entering the work force.
good,Biglots is extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling. Staff has some problems getting along but the managers are fairly nice and willing to help.
good,"Furniture Sales Manager. Because I was knowledgeable in sales, product knowledge, management, customer service, I had favor with those over me and was allowed room to flourish in my department. Unfortunately, I out grew bonuses. Like most retailers in this day and age, competition has caused many issues in our society. Policies are broken, Not followed, causing inconsistency."
good,I am scheduled to work all late shifts. And every weekend. I am expected to lift very heavey things with no help. And there is a lot of favoritism. upper management is out of touch and lazy
good,"Working here there is no union, they like the open door policy. You have to work your way up if possible. They do like to hire whomever they see fit for the duties that are needed."
good,Don’t get stuck there it’s really the other employees that make it worth it. 20% off the store isn’t that much. Mangers nice one day then rude the other
good,Working here isn't difficult. The managers are nice and work with you. They have a good health package and 401k. It can sometimes be stressful with coworkers but at the end of the day you can accomplish alot and feel confident you did a good job
good,"You dont move up no time soon. I been promised an Msnger position for snout 5 months, and nothing had happened.  I do just about .every task management does ,and after 5 years, still nothing but 12 cent raises every once a year.  NO Employee Benefits, and absolutely no hours per week . I'm like how am I gonna live off of 19-22 ,,hours an week? I can't, it's just an good p/t job for school students"
good,They hire a variety of employees. As long as your honest and have work ethics the job is nice to work and usually pay weekly.  Usually get plenty of hours and paid holidays. Pretty flexible on schedules
good,"Overall, Big Lots was a good company to work for, but towards the end the corporate structure began to change and uncertainty began to question its longevity to be a competitor in the market."
good,It is a good company to work for. Lots of hard work and  dirty being part of the stoking team. Be ready to be responsible of your teams ups and downs as the DTS lead.
good,"With the new management in place for just under a year. New initiatives are beginning to take hold, and changing the culture of the business. All changes are for the long term good of the company."
good,Big Lots wasn't a bad place to work. Mainly part-time options and limited hours. The atmosphere is friendly and work wasn't too difficult for the average person to handle.
good,The hardest part of job is trying to balance your job description with everyday corporate assigned duties along with store daily operations with limited staff given.
good,The employee discounts were nice but it always felt like coworkers and management were snakes in the grass. The managers made you feel comfortable and feel like a team but the next day they'd have an entirely different attitude. My coworkers I could never tell if they actually had the best interests for me or the store. I learnt alot working there and I don't regret it but they gave me alot of anxiety. I do hope that they get store of the future one day tho
good,If you don’t mind minimum wage and a physical job it’s a good job. The only reason I didn’t satay is due to one particular manager not all. Hours are scared too so it’s feast or famine.
good,Working at Big Lots was a way for me to keep busy and get me out of the house to meet new people.  I moved to the Antioch area in 2013.  I had applied to over 344 jobs and Big Lots! was the only employer that called me in for orientation and ultimately a position.  This store had extremely high customer theft and there was nothing we could do about it.  Other than that Big Lots! was a fun job.
good,"Great small box store to work in with a large assortment of every day goods. Employee discount is great. However, as member of management, schedule is posted the day before the new work week begins which makes planning in personal life difficult. Work week entails working three nights with only one weekend off a month and one day on the weekend off."
good,"Besides the management needing reviewed, many of the employees are very easy to work with. The store management needs reviewing also. The store remodeling has created tension between the employees and customers because no one knows where things are moved."
good,Teamwork is essential yet good help is hard to come by. A lot is expected in sales despite being understaffed and overworked with truck deliveries. Warehouse back room needs tremendous overhaul.
good,Super great just my hiring manager retired and the new manager didn’t take the same opinion about my college scholarship and surgery schedule so I had to quit
good,"Good part-time job, multiple managers, great team work, always a good time when its a busy day, learn to lift and manage in funiture, you get a work out in the warehouse."
good,"It's a good place to work if you have experience, some people aren't for retail and all companies have their own ways, Biglots is no exception. You have to work! Or you want last and show up,pay attention! Ask every ?. Do not move forward unsure,  Find managers and make them train you. As a 3rd Level Lead, you are at the mercy of hiring managers  as DTSL u are supposed to have a team 5 or more and you babysit..if they suck,  you suck..FSL is the most demanding especially if you have no furniture associates to help you drive metrics and MOD at same time. We haven't bonuses in over a year or been fully staffed. ""We are Store of The Future ""...You would think they would fully staff a brand new store...nc/ns twice in a roll...TERMINATED"
good,Big Lots is changing their culture and investing in stores. It is a good place to work. The payroll as a percent to sales model is a little tough. Management plays many roles within the building.
good,No life and work balance as stores are opened on all but one holiday and stay opened late. Selection of goods are nice for the price and the furniture is affordably priced. No help with furniture trucks and normal store trucks are tough to unload.
good,"Big Lots is not a bad company to work for if you just need a part-time job. If you are looking for advancement there is very little. The only Full-time positions (at my store at least) were Ops Manager, Furniture Lead, Store Manager, Assistant Manager, and DTS. They offer part-time insurance for dental, pet, and optical."
good,If any member of staff is injured the bonus's are not given for a year. This creates an atmosphere of frustration if any one is injured on the job or makes them less willing to report.
good,"Ok, so I applied as a seasonal employee and it was my first job. Hours were amazing, as one would expect during the holiday season, it was after the holiday season that issues started to arise for me. They began to drastically cut down on hours. I went from having 20+ hours a week to basically having 10 or less and that was also never a guarantee.They once tried to give me just 4 hours for the whole week and even if you complain and ask for more, it's never a guarantee, because they use an autofill schedule that automatically assigns the hours. The manager is also only given a certain amount of hours to hand out so if you draw the short straw, you're out of luck and have to just hope someone doesn't show up and that they call you to cover the shift. I also feel as though they show favoritism as well because I began to notice they gave plenty of hours to the old timers and people who have been working there for at least a year. They also force you to push a stupid rewards card on every that doesn't have one and have you keep a tally of how many rewards card sign-ups you have gotten. At one point my manager had actually joked that the employees who get the most sign-ups get more hours. I am an incredibly hard worker and I had never showed up late or called out and I sincerely felt as though I was being treated unfairly just because I didn't get enough sign-ups and that is just completely ridiculous in my opinion. It's no wonder they have a high turnover rate if this is how they treat their employees. Apart from all of that however, my coworkers and the managers were pretty cool,"
good,"It's like any other retail job, stock stuff, clean stuff, help customers. The management usually doesn't tey to hold a lotnof meetings so people are readily available to customers."
good,"Big lots is an ok place to work. It is only a part time job place. For the positions are for cashier and stockers, management positions are only full time."
good,"I unloaded delivery trucks that were incredibly messy and time consuming. Would come in very early to stock shelves and repeat. Coworkers were hit-or-miss, turn over seemed quite high."
good,As an Assistant Manager of Merchandising the work is demanding.  You have to unload the trucks and work the freight. Your hours have to be flexible. The 20% is nice
good,Our store is exceptional for Big Lots. Our manager is very involved with all store operations. It can be stressful during the holidays and special sale days. For the most part we have a really good team that all work together. We even go to other stores on a regular basis to help them make their stores more efficient. The pay sucks but for me it was worth it because they worked around my schedule for school. We have lots of regular customers that are more like extended family rather than just coming in to just shop.
good,I worked hard and gave big lots my best. Biglots has you do multiple jobs.  you dont do just one job description. Your schedule changes every week which makes having plans very difficult.
good,nothing more than working for a retail company. no holidays or weekends off because it's retail. decent prices on products. products in the store are old because it's a discount store.
good,"Working here is actually pretty great if you don't look at the pay and swing shifts. Management is fair and kind, of course there is always one who isn't but that's wherever you go."
good,"I have enjoyed my work, especially in furniture, and I'd recommend that department to anyone with the will to work hard and excel at customer service and understanding that business."
good,"The  schedule is posted at the register on Saturday for the upcoming week, and only goes for a one week block.  It is not electronically sent; I was told to call the store or come in every Saturday to check the schedule for the upcoming week.   I don’t know why it can not be made at least one week ahead of time so that people can plan life events and, in today’s day, electronically posted. I was told, “That’s just how Big Lots is.”  Additionally, it’s a disservice to the customer while the working associate is on the phone giving the schedule notice to a caller, and it’s inconsiderate to have to come in just to check a schedule."
good,"My first thought when applying to this job was a big step up from my previous work and having hours that wouldn't get in the way of school. Unfortunately that wasn't the case at all. I got hours that interfered with school. And after bartering with management for 3 weeks was able to resolve the issue but, it will never make up for time lost in class or the classes I have missed. I decided to leave due to sad management and the weak leadership I saw with my own eyes."
good,It's a decent place to work but it's not somewhere I saw myself working at for years. The managers weren't the best and it just seemed like they only cared about the money they were making and not the employees.
good,"Big Lots has changed alot in the last 10 years. Better products, name brands, better allocation according to sales. They are focusing more on the customers and their needs and less on just selling bulk items."
good,"The schedule changes every week, so you cant plan ahead. Runs Sun-Sat, only comes out on Saturday. Way too last minute, need more notice ahead of time"
good,"I set up the location I was at so I was intimate with the layout and management team.  Even though another employee set up for my failure to cover up her thefts, I enjoyed the time I worked there.  The manager there said he didn't want to terminate me but the way the shortages were (3 times over or under totaling $5) under my number signin, I was let go."
good,My managers are friendly and always willing to help and give sound advice.  I also enjoy the atmosphere being a team player and working with the public.
good,The work experience lacked in some areas but overall it was a good experience. Flexible hours easy going environment. Great management. Great crew team.
good,Big Lots helps you better your communication and time management skills. It is not a bad place to work at all. Big Lots just wasn’t suitable for me because I had bigger plans on my agenda.
good,"I loved working at the Big Lots in my college town. I made many friends there and my managers were all very kind and great at training and helping me adjust with my school schedule. "
good,Great work environment. I learned a lot from customer services. Hardest part of the job was receiving during holiday season. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with others and building a team atmosphere.
good,The stocking shift is easy. You have to wake up early at 4am to start a majority of the time. Usually shifts are 4 to 8 hours depending on your availability.
good,My review is that they can give employees more hours and monitor management because they are unprofessional in several locations. They can also focus on upgrading their locations as well.
good,"If you have a family, Big lots is not a place to work at. Hours are NEVER consistent and schedules are not available soon enough to plan things with your family. Was promoted quickly"
good,The job was ok. I did learn while working their an gained some skills. Like learning how to operate a cash registered something I have never done before.  But the pay is low and and the hours isn't much. It be good for a first job though it's easy not stressful to work at. I had greet managers though accept for one guy who was rude too all the employees but he left and the job was less stressful when he wasn't their anymore. I enjoyed talking to customers and helping them felt rewarding.
good,"Big Lots is ok, but if you are a minority, they will work very hard to ensure that you are not promoted and they will depress your pay."
good,Though I enjoyed my fellow crew members the pay was low and labor was a bit strenuous. Management seemed overly strict for the type of work environment.
good,you are told what time to report to work(varies) and are required to meet production goals (95%).from Jan-June are slowest production times of year while July-Dec are highest-more hours of work.it is hot in summertime in building.
good,Working at big lots you're always on your feet. Little to no advancement in the company. Holidays are horrible. Barely got any hours in a week. Customers are rude.
good,"The location I worked in, was great. Management were friendly and flexible to my availability. My coworkers and I got along well, which made for an enjoyable work environment."
good,the hardest part of the job is when your unloading trucks and theirs not enough room for the merchandise sometimes you have to pick up other peoples mess.
good,"All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. Meh as long as you keeps your mouth shut about the mistreatment of employees, you're good. If you are a boot licker, you'll do just fine."
good,Got harassed by a fellow manager turned it into the DM and never got resolution. Sad because I loved the job before that and then I had to quit because it got to much to take.
good,Good place of you have a job and need some extra income. 2-3 day out the week 4-8 hours a day. Half hour breaks. The store I worked at had small holiday celebrations
good,Big lots was an easy job managers were pretty chill and flexible with hours. There is a place for improvement with to this place and for higher positions.
good,"nice place to work, wonderful environment. very friendly regular customers. here it was easy to adapt and co workers were nice and management treated workers fairly"
good,"Big Lots is pretty good company to work for, the staff is great and willing to train-if you are willing to work the hours. You can elevate quickly within the company if you are dedicated"
good,"Big Lots was a good company, however the regional VP. was the rudest man i ever worked for, He would curse at you, never offered any advice to help you."
good,"Big Lots was my first job so this is where I learned the basics of retail. I worked with some great people whom after 11yrs I still go in and visit with. At the end, I had to quit because even though I'd give the Store Manager my schedule of my second job two weeks in advance, they would continue to schedule me when I had to work at my other job and would count me as a no show. So to prevent them from firing me, I went ahead and quit."
good,"Big lots is a great place to work if you don't have a job.If you're looking for a job then Big lots can be a great job to have. If you don't have a job and big lots is the only place that will hire, then big lots would be your best option."
good,"Great co-workers, managers vary.  Company wants more done in less time. Big Lots love their training videos. It's difficult to run a store with minimal staff working. It's great to have a work relationship with the customers."
good,"really sorry to say, since Big lots changed management the workplace environment has changed. Pic'n' save was pro employee. Big lots is CEO"" benefits."
good,"its a decent place to obtain initial work experience for retail or customer service, for high school students/graduates or people lacking work experience. The company overall is chaotic and unorganized and the pay is minimum wage. Will obtain  customer service experience"
good,Good company to work for on part-time basis. Discount is good. Room for growth if you plan to pursue a retail career. Great place to start.  Would recommend this place for employment.
good,"Big lots does not pay much and your hours are never guaranteed, so if you are looking to gain money and work hours this is not the job for you. However, if you are looking for a chill laid back job with few hours then you applied to the right place."
good,love it some days hated it others bad manager not enough hours were given also was very faced pace work environment which did not bother me at no place to take breaks
good,"Went unappreciated. No matyer how much you do, they always want more. Set unachievable goals and have little interest in employes having a life outside of work. Upper management looks down on all under them."
good,"I can't say anything too bad about Big Lots. The people I worked with were great but just getting 20 hours a week was a struggle and there was no chance for full time or advancement unless you were basically willing to sacrifice your life for the job. IT was good as a first, part time job but thats all it is really."
good,this job isn't for long term. really bad on your back and super demanding. very stressful. great way to start off I retail but you must really build a back bone when working here.
good,"As a floor associate/cashier work tasks varied by what was needed to be done: setting up new products, reset shelves, clearing out expired dry goods, pricing, return items to correct shelf, keeping shelves visually appealing, helping customers find items, cleaning restrooms, retrieving shopping carts from outside and be quick at coming to work as a cashier when called."
good,"hired for part time only.Big Lots has no full time positions,unless applying for management. supervisors were nice,but don't work here and expect to pay your bills"
good,"Not able to get the hours needed to support the cost of living.  Must work 2 jobs in order to maintain and survive.  If you are part time, you do not receive benefits."
good,"The company was a discounted retail company which sold mostly overstocked items from other retailers. Learned to train, boast sales and how to be patient."
good,Only work part time for six months. Very fast pasted. Did over night stock.  Management was good. Once we got company built up and through christmas hour were cut.
good,"I was one of the few stocker that worked big lots store aisles, I stocked the whole store not just any department, I mostly worked alone and sometimes it was no choice from the lack of workers."
good,Very slow during the week.Easy work but too much work for the amount of time given to get the job done.Don't expect to be scheduled many hours.This place for someone that's looking for a second job or needs extra cash.
good,"The management at this location is very bad, the turnover rate is very high because of it. I left due to a move and poor pay. This job is busy at peak seasons."
good,"Great people to work with."
good,"This is a great place for someone to get their first job ever, the only thing I have to say is that one of the managers is very rude. The rest of the managers are amazing and make you feel happy to go into work, any day. The pay is awful for the amount of things they make you do & if you don't do them exactly like the picture they're given, prepare yourself to get a long lecture about it. Also breaks are a major problem to one of the managers, every time I've asked for one he always has a remark & I've overheard him doing the same thing to other coworkers. I do not get paid enough to be loss prevention, a janitor, a cashier, a stocker & a Floor Associate, everyday."
good,I liked working here. it was just a seasonal job offer but I really enjoyed the job itself. lots of teamwork which is always nice to have. it was fun to work there
good,Did enjoy the team and working with the crew just didn't like how many hours the give to the workers for the week.  Was a clean steady work place had a great time there
good,Not enough hours or pay. The people were fun to work with as well as the customers most of the time. Like getting a employee discount. Good starter job or for a student or someone who is retired.
good,"You do not have to work only one position. You can be a cashier, stocker and a floor associate. On truck days, you unload the truck, take a short break and then stock shelves. The cash register is outdated, so it is stressful when the store is busy."
good,i was lucky i had a great manager and a great staff. other stores i worked in was a mess upper management didn't provide enough hours to run the store the right way causing a messy store and shipment not put out the right way. The staff i worked with is no longer there but it was a great fun job for me. i wouldn't go back because of that reason.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a part time job or if you still live at home. I believe the people that have been there for years are under paid.
good,I only worked here a short time but the manager that was there at the time did not contribute to the running of the store. The company had some good goals but it was very difficult to achieve them due to poor leadership.
good,"Usually it is very quiet and not too busy."
good,Big lots as an employer was a critical point because i had just moved to the area. They gave me a job right away helping to open a new store they were planning to move to. The pay was minimal but the job was rewarding. In terms of happy customers that gave us repeat business.
good,Management has a hard time running the store due to many employees being stubborn. Employees get treated the same regardless of whether you performed your job for the day or did not.
good,"As long as a person showed up for work on-time, regularly, and did what was asked this job was a piece of cake.  Generally managers liked to joke around, and the employees where fun to hang out with.  The benefits are poor and there is almost no ability for advancement from within."
good,Job is not to difficult. However very little chance of advancement. Low pay but very routine schedule. Not to much on the hard labor side. Very simple and easy to do
good,The paid is very bad. The amount that we're paid is not enough for the work we are required to do. Atypical day you can be non productive and the warehouse isn't organize is too small for the amount of product.
good,At the time that I was working here I got a long with every one so that helped make run things good as a team. but to much to do in such little time . But some times they would let me put a little more hours in.
good,it is a ok place to work at. you barely have time to yourself alot of black out days that you cant request off and you only get a raise after a  year of working there. the plus side is that the customer make your job easier because they know what they want and they get to know you by your name.
good,The people I work with  are good people.  Corporate is less than desirable. Advancement inside store is impossible.  Pay is not good unless you are in upper management.
good,"A typical day is approximately 4-6 hours.  The duties range from acting as Manager on duty as needed, Furniture Associate, Cashier, Floor Associate, Stocking and unloading merchandise.  Customer service is always the main focus, making sure their shopping experience is enjoyable answering any questions they may have.  This means having knowledge of all areas of the store and merchandise offered.  I have learned the importance proper product merchandizing and product knowledge. Management is good but thorough training is not always a priority.  Workplace Culture, sadly there is not a lot of trust among the employees and managers within the organization.  Hardest part of the job would be unloading a furniture truck and loading furniture on a customers vehicle"
good,"This is a great place to start as a first job. But there are no benefits besides a discount, no latter to move up, management never sticks, and above all else this place is beyond unorganized. The worst part about this job though is easily how no one is on the same page, &they don't train you really at all. "
good,"My opinion is that Big Lots is a good company with a few good store management. The leadership in each store is so different and that is not good for cohesiveness. Each store in itself is different, but when policies are disregarded because ""it won't work in our store"" then that destroys the foundation. If the stores would just make an attempt to fulfill company policies then management could have proof that it didn't work."
good,This is a good company as long as the restaurant is ran correctly as a team and not individual entities. The hours are very flexible and the atmosphere is very mellow and peaceful.
good,"Decent retail environment, and a very nice employee discount as well. Also they are flexible with your schedule. Most part time shifts are only 4-6 hours."
good,"Managers work very hard at big lots.  We unload truck, stock shelves and run customer service.  If you have a great store manager that creates a great atmosphere in the store, big lots is a great place to work"
good,"typical day at work was nice everyday was different."
good,"A typical day at work would be to pick up anything out of order , help any customers, furniture sales, take out furniture and load it.What i learned from working at big lots is that hard work does pay off"
good,"Good place for advancement. Is a fun place to work. Can have a lot of turn over, not a job for everyone. Some managers are better than  others."
good,Great workout from moving furniture. The managers weren't bad but sometimes they had attitudes for no reason. Too many people that have worked there for WAAAYYY too long 15+ years and still don't make much.
good,"Be prepared to hit the door running.  Salary is higher than average for a reason.  A typical day consists of 2 or 3 associates in the building. Freight unload process is timed to the point of being a safety issue.  You will be asked if you can lift a minimum of 50 lbs, but in reality, this means 100 to 200 lbs.  There will be numerous times of lifting and loading heavy furniture ( fireplaces, reclining sofas, etc) completely by yourself.  Like most companies -constantly tasking while demanding 110% customer service.  As an assistant, you will close an average of 3 nights a week.  Store atmosphere depends on the store manager. Sadly, the Lexington ( Hamburg) store has a rotten, abusive atmosphere.  Turnover is the highest in the district for both assistants & associates. Store manager is a bully (being nice here).  Human resource is aware but declines to take action.  You MUST have thick skin to survive at Hamburg store. There are great Big Lots store managers out there, just not at this location.  On a positive note, benefits are great.  Vacation accrued quickly,  holiday pay, 20% discount, and insurance are all very nice.  My advice, research your location before applying and be prepared to work non stop.   Good luck!"
good,a baby company still tinkering with its own identity/ culture.I enjoyed my job there for the most part. good work/ life balance and a good team.
good,"enjoyed this job,there just wasn't much room in the company to advance,and not enough given per week . If more had been done to make it possible to move up with the company,it would have been a great place to work."
good,"New CEO is not family oriented. They do not value their employees. The bottom line is that old mighty dollar. Do not promote from within. Would rather hire someone who knows nothing about the company. Hard when you try to follow company policies and procedures when management doesn't.  Lack of communication. Seniority doesn't count for anything, it's who you are. Ask all members of management the same question and you get a different answer from all of them. Very unorganized."
good,"i enjoyed this job for its physical aspects it was very high energy and kept you busy all day long, there were little to any down moments. the people were very helpful also"
good,"You simply cannot complete a days work at the office, you have to take work home with you every night. Management has their favorites which leaves little room for advancement."
good,"Big lots is a fun environmen, but the management really sucks. i learned a lot from working at this place, but i was ready to move on."
good,"A typical day is stocking and being in furniture helping customers pick out what they want to buy. We did a lot of warehouse stuff as well, like clean it and prep it for the trucks we got on Monday. We usually unload the trucks box by box which is a few hours processes. Co-worker are easy to get along with everyone just does their job. The hardest part is pulling heavy stuff off the truck. Furniture isn't too bad at all."
good,Great  co workers like working with family. I learned a great deal about retail and people. And just how the system works.
good,Worked at the Preston store for 10 years.  Saw a lot of employees come and go.  Great place for kids in college.  20% off discount.  Was terminated for saving money.
good,Working for Big Lots is a great challenge especially when loading trucks because you have to work multiple bay doors at the same time. Loading included convey merchandise and items to big for the conveyor belt such as furniture and tables and chairs. The work was a great way to stay in shape.
good,fun place to work. managment could be a little better. fast paced. easy system to learn. friendly customer service. clean enviroment
good,Love the people I work with but the pay is minimum wage and there are very few benefits. Only management get full time status and part-time hours aren't that great when off season.
good,"Its a okay job to work at for job building but not for staying, its to hostile and not very clean. The break situation sucks because I have a chronic migraine issue and if I stand and run around for more than 3 hours without a 5 min break, it puts a strain into my lower back and that causes my back ankylosing spondylitis  to enable."
good,i like it. it was nice that is was next to my apartment so i did not have to fight traffic and i saved money. the boss was very good to my when i did get sick and help me get a car.
good,"From a Furniture Associate- then Furniture Manager's perspective:"
good,"Overall, this was a fun place to work. During special sales promotion days, they would provide lunch for free for all employees. Schedules were very flexible, and if there were days employees could not work, there wasn't any hassle about it."
good,"It was really slow for me, I like fast paced jobs. They give you hardly any hours to work, and fired me for being pregnant and having morning sickness."
good,"Being in Ballwin, MO working for big lots was decent experience. "
good,"Typical day at work consist of opening and closing procedures, budgeting, payroll, customer satisfaction, managing employees, marketing, merchandising, inventory control, DTS, freight processing, store meetings training management and new employees."
good,"a day at worwas regular . everyday the same not too busy, Management was okay co-workers were friendly, no hard part of job most enjoyable when we had pizza parties."
good,"This was my first job, for being my first job I learned a lot. I feel that I moved up pretty quickly. I started on the floor, making sure that my area was straighten up and cleaned up. Then I move up to a cashier making sure that I gave great customer service to all the customers. Then I became customer service, more with making sure that the cashier was okay of what they needed, helping customers with there returns, and ringing up, and then I became a associate manager. Managing the store operations, of the floor associates, cashiers, and etc. Opening and closing the store. Balancing out the tills and the deposits. Hiring new associates. Made a lot of good friends from this job, been in touch with these people for over 11 years."
good,"alot of customers shopping all the time especially in holidays, I learned alot in the retail industry which was new to my field this job was a seasonal job but loved it to a certain point. Managers were very pleasant and helpful but weren't really always available. I learned alot alone with my coworkers."
good,clock in and go to the funiture book where they have the log book from yesterday and go to my desk see if manager left a list if not i make sure shins are on all furniture if not make signs. go to warhouse and do the samething. and sell at the sametime.
good,"this company is far from perfect, but there is no perfect world. You'll have to make the best of every day moving extremely heavy pallets of merchandise with no power equipment whatsoever. During your days off you will probably just convalesce. there are no assigned areas of responsibility for management so you must be proficient in every area. On the plus side the pay is not bad if you negotiate properly up front, if you do not do this you will get paid next to Nothing."
good,"Learned how to unload cargo trucks"
good,"My typical day at work, at big L is work from office thur warehouse,sales floor.Were i merchandise and create visually displays of end caps and gondola plan o gram.And then rung from register for back ups and decongess line .Customer return too.Open and closer register and make bank deposit.I've learn lots of procedures from Big L .One of them preping for inventory.Got my technic. Sales procedures and Reading Plan o grams in different ways. My Management are inplace but still need improvement.My co works at store follow all direction that was inplace for that day.My co works are my team member without them it not possible to do many task.My hardest part of job is working without hours for the store and not having right stuffing for store it self.still you have to do many task thought the day.The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting many new people as customer and getting what they need and assist them personal."
good,"I would got into work clock in and then start my day, some of the day I would be up at the cashier then then from there I would go stock for some hours. Then my break then back to work I go do recovery for the rest of time intill it was time to go home. I learned how to work well with others and team work. The hardest part of the job would when cashiers wouldn't be working right. I enjoyed chatting with the  customers when they asked me how my day was after helping them find thing they needed."
good,You never know what your work day will be like. Schedules differ week to week. I have learned how to work in different areas of the store. How to work with customers and handle problems. I have learned how to count down tills and do deposits. Managers have their good days and bad days. But it is hard to work for a company where even the managers don't always get along with each other. My co-workers are nice I get along with some more than others. The hardest part of the job is working till 10 at night then having to be back at 8 in the morning. Moat enjoyable part of the job is working with my assistant manager. She makes it worth going to work when we are on the same shift.
good,"A cashier at Big Lots provides customer service and completes transactions on the cash register. A Big Lots cashier may also monitor inventory levels and unload deliveries. Depending on the shift, a cashier may have to perform basic opening and closing duties, such as counting drawers, stocking shelves, and cleaning the store environment. I had an amazing manager. The pay was not great.  I loved the interaction with customers."
good,The job and culture was great. You have good pay and a work life balance is present. You also have good Vacation time off and also you have personal days off along with sick pay. Overall its a good company to work with. But you do a lot of the work your self. You have no real staff but and certain expectations are hard to follow just do to the fact that your limited in what you can do (No resource) But besides that its good.
good,I was working here the longest I ever had a job. The hardest part of the job was during Christmas and dealing with stressed out management. I liked that it was close to home.
good,"I had a very strong management team in place.We worked well as a team, and we had fun at what we did, and believed as a management team, store moral is very  important to the day to day operations of the store"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is greeting old and new customers.
good,"Loved the people that I worked with, Exciting in the way that you never knew what was coming to the store in deliveries as new products."
good,its a fun job i love working there the people are nice the help eachother out though corrperate does provide enough hours for daily crews and the pay starts out minimum wage raising a max of 25cents a year if u meet expectations its a good job to start with but if you want to actuall live this job simply doesnt cut it to live off a job at big lots you would have to work there at least 15 years and be a manager all of which is controlled by a computer program instead of reward for effort and hard work
good,Under payed and would short you even more when they wanted to. management was either not working or they just didn't care.
good,I enjoyed working for big lots you had your pro's and con's when it came to this particular job
good,Days were always planned accordingly by managers on duty. Learned valuable customer service skills. Co-workers were great to be around and were every helpful when needed.
good,"On a typical day I would run cash register, stock shelves, build furniture, and sell furniture. I learned how to work well with others.  Management was decent and treated you fairly. Coworkers were friendly and occasionally went and saw a movie together after work.  The hardest part of working this job was working late and then having to go to school early the next day. The most enjoyable part of this job was being a relaxed setting.  As long as you showed up to work and did a good job the management left you alone."
good,"A typical day at Big Lots is anything but typical.  Most days start with checking email and ensuring that any issues stemming from the night before get resolved.  I learned visual merchandising, but also a lot of communication skills as well.  My management staff was personable.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with the unexpected situations that popped up from day to day, but that was also the most enjoyable."
good,co-workers for the most part a joy to work with. only full time receive benefits after Obama care. 20% discount and on special weekends twice a year 30%
good,I started of  the day at the register.   i would mark out or reduced price on items when they come to me damage.
good,"Jobs in the category are responsible for the execution of all receiving activities including unloading merchandise, merchandise preparation and staging, outbound shipments, and daily stockroom activities. Assist in maintaining the stockroom in a neat, orderly and safe manner. Other duties include promptly serving the customer at merchandise pick-up, properly sorting merchandise, and properly using all material handling and safety equipment"
good,"Unload trucks and prepare them for the store shelves, also creating displays for to help on sales."
good,"My experience at Biglots was a good one. The people were nice and I got a 20% discount on merchandise. The job was extremely easy to me, because I had to clean up the food aisles and I am very organized. It bothers me when things are strewn about. I was also a cashier, and I am really good with arithmetic, so it was really easy. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks and labeling the items with prices. It was really tedious."
good,They are giving too much pressure to employees and they're giving less hours to people who deserves it. They are greedy with hours and they don't know how to do the schedule. They won't respect people who doesn't want to work on sundays because of tradition.
good,Fun to work with all of the other employees and enjoyed working with customer service and staying involved.
good,Big Lots is a good started company for those who are just starting off in the work field or for those who are in school and can only work a few hours a week. co workers are very friendly and easy going. hardest part about the job getting hours. most enjoyable part is all the great customers you meet from day to day.
good,Performed manual labor. Read and interpreted work orders. Determined work assignments and equipment needs. Loaded and unloaded materials. Moved materials by hand and using heavy equipment. Maintained production sheets. Reported shortages and damaged materials. Checked incoming materials against invoices. Ensured a clean and safe working environment. Performed housekeeping duties. Maintained tools and equipment. Followed all safety rules and regulations.
good,"I liked the job a lot but they didn't give me many hours and after a while they just stopped giving me hours and I called in and asked if i was on the schedule and they just said no you're not on the schedule and hung up before I could ask why so I just took that as I got fired, even though they never said I was either laid off or fired. They could have better managers."
good,typical work day is somewhat busy you always are doing something.
good,This job is ok but don't depend on it as an only job. It is the perfect second job.
good,"over worked and under paid, you work more than you are home , and no policy is set in stone... to many gray areas"
good,"My typical day of work consisted of throwing freight, being a backup cashier, helping with anything else I could do."
good,New manager came in and had the store making more profit and satisfying for customers and emplees.
good,The management was not good at all here and a lot of drama. i moved to fallon so i left.
good,"stocking, putting displays together and customer service"
good,"The typical day for me would either be working the first register, or the furniture department. For the register, I would be responsible for ringing out customers, answering the phones, and being the first to answer most customer queries. When working Furniture my duties would revolve around maintaining the department, building new display items, selling the furniture, arranging pick ups or deliveries, as well as loading sold pieces."
good,help costumers and keep the store clean and neat its a great company to work for.
good,"A typical day for me is to make sure certain items are on the floor and are signed correct. making sure paperwork is done before and after closing. Providing great customer services to all customers."
good,"The company is alright, but if you get hurt their insurance company will fight to be sure you don't get any compensation."
good,Pick up a list of trucks I had coming in an trucks going out so I could run threw the day in the most productive manor making sure my out bound pallets where staged at the right doors in a timely manor as well as keeping in bound product delivered to the work lines to keep other associates building food pallets to be shipped
good,A typical day for me involved what you would anticipate if you've ever worked retail:
good,"its nice to work with the public.i ran the front end as a customer service specialest,cashier.i learned how to deal with the problems that customers have with products,and to help them or correct the situation."
good,Operate cash register.
good,"A typical day on the job is working with little supervision, on a four hour shift. Management was Great, co-workers were great freindly and helpful."
good,The management at my store is not very well organized. I will be told by 3 different managers to do 3 different things. Then I say I had another project going for another manager I'm told that project isn't important and to start another. Later on I have the first manager come around wondering why the first project I received is not completed.
good,"My First manager in Elizabethtown was a mentor, the manager in Shepardsville was no manager."
good,I supervised the cashiers made sure they took their lunch at the scheduled time. I made sure they were following policy. I also maintain a clean work area.
good,"I have enjoyed every moment at big lots.I just feel they try to run the business on a skelton crew.Which sometimes upsets the customers.I enjoy meeting new people,stocking shelves,and workin recovery.The hours our short,but if that is what you like ,you have time for other things.The hardest part is trying realize why they dont want to give more hours as long as it is part time,but continue to hire.I only get 12 hours a week."
good,It kept me in shape and at a steady work pace.management was cool and I learned to follow directions better . Hardest part of it was steady lifting non stop.
good,I do enjoy working for Big Lots. I work typically 2pm - 10 pm usually five days a week. The hardest thing about the job is lack of communication between co-workers.
good,"I don't think I have much to say about Big Lots. I worked there just after graduating college, and before that I worked for a local super store, so it was interesting to see the differences."
good,"Warehouse stock, cashier work, comfy chairs, loved management"
good,Big Lots is a growing company and is changing all the time. The look of Big Lots has changed over the past year to be more like a Traget.
good,If you are able to stand for long periods of time and have excellent customer service skills then Big Lots is a good place to work. They have excellent team players.
good,"The managers friendly , fun environment , different job duties to choose from , and skills to learn from , advancement opportunities"
good,work is frustrating managers are often perfectionist and people constantly call in. I have had to stay after my shift several times because the same person keeps calling in or showing up late. one of my managers cannot be satisfied and constantly complains about people not working the way she wants.
good,Job position and work is very straight on. Pay is decent and hours are decent as well. Very chill work environment and friendly employees. Nothing more nothing less.
good,"It’s alright, it was an easy environment to get accustomed to and the work was usually on the easier side so I never was behind or confused about anything"
good,"Most of the jobs offered are part time. there is an employee discount which is nice. moving up from within is not that easy, they tend to hire management from outside."
good,"Its a good place to work for if you've got the communication skills, and the ability to do several duties while you work. The management is normally very supportive and tries to make a easy to work around, and most of your co-workers understand any struggles one might have. However the hardest part of the job is going to be the customers. and the best part of the job tends to be getting off."
good,Its a good place to work. The people care about you and help you the best way they can. Its not that good of a pay but its a good job and that's all that matters.
good,"Great entry level job, or job where you can build customer service and character. Hours were between 16-30 a week."
good,The only problem it is very hard to become fulltime I worked here for 10 years liked the job unloading truck's the 20% discount is very nice flexable hours
good,It’s a job to say the least. It’s easier than other retail experiences I’ve had so that’s a plus. I guess I recommend if your looking for an low key kind of job.
good,"This job was once a good place to work at"
good,"Overall was decent till they had me doing a little bit of everyone’s own individual jobs for them. I was mainly used to maintain and clean the main floor but ended up being a cashier, janitor and help set up furniture on the back."
good,working with the crew at big lots was a great experience. crew was always available to help when needed. communicated well with others always polite..
good,"Average warehouse to work in. Competitive pay scale, good benefits, HR open door policy and always listen and help. Job security, plenty power equipment, advancement opportunities"
good,This was my first job ever and I truly liked the energy there but I just felt I needed more but other then that big lots is a great first job to have.
good,It’s a good first job to have. There isn’t anything that’s really too hard. Just have to come to work willing to learn new things. Seems pretty chill.
good,"Helped people find products, stocked shelves... Made sure the floors was cleaned, collected shopping carts and walked the floors to make sure everything is in order."
good,"Loved It, it was a great place to work. Loved the employees and the customers we had. It was fun and it was like one big family there. I left because I found a job paying more is all."
good,It’s a decent place to work for a student or someone looking for a job to keep the busy but not a great place for people who need a job as a sole income.
good,"We all worked hard together as a great team, but the pay was fairly low generally for the time and place we live. They need to pay better."
good,"It was a job decent, could have better pay and the manager at the time could have been more helpful in the job setting . Decent amount of work to keep busy"
good,"Had good management , good workplace, everything was good but the pay, job was easy, it’s a fun place to work at......................................"
good,I was a store manager for Big Lots and like much of retail the budgets are very thin for labor.  If your store is run absolutely perfectly you would be able to meet goals but if you get behind at any point it is nearly impossible to catch up and still make budget.  The pay was decent but the work is very physically demanding if you are the sort that likes to work alongside the crew.  If you are not the sort that wants to work with the crew you are likely to fall behind quickly.  Employees are non union so you can easily get rid of the dead weight but if you find a good employee that can get the work done you had better be ready to pay them a fair amount.
good,"And A LOT favoritism (especially when it came to scheduling,) gossiping, finger pointing, and a ton of, from management, I didn't do it, or I don't know, or they'd put the blame on under management. Oh and they loved talking about fellow employees when they weren't there and than be super nice to your face when you were."
good,The job wasn’t worth the pay. I felt over worked & unappreciated. Some managers took their personal problems & frustration out on the employees. Favoritism was shown a lot.
good,The management works with you on any problem you have . So.e daulys is stressful and some days smoothed . The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck in hot weather or cold weather .
good,not enough hours but nice and friendly place to work  at. the hours were not enough but were flexible. employees get 20% off every thing even the sales item.
good,"Great first time job for teenagers, some coworkers where friendly while others where the opposite. Its a very laid back job until a rush comes in and then the pace picks up and you have to be able to handle multiple customers at a time all while scanning merchandise and working a cash register."
good,Everyone worked as a unit and less of a competition and more of a teamwork based organization. Managers were clear on objectives for each day of work.
good,"A good starter job for a college student, or someone who is looking for very low hours or who lives with a parent. It is not a complicated job, can be fast paced. The pay is decent for in the area, Just not enough hours for an independant grown up."
good,slow but it's a fun job. the hours are very slim but if you work your way up into the furniture department you should be good. the managers are laid back
good,"Nice staff! Could be much cleaner & better taken care of. Not too busy, it's mostly elderly people who come into this Big Lots location. They have ALMOST everything that's convenient to you aswell!"
good,I learned working at bigblots good customer services the enjoyable part about working with this company all the different personalities an good team environment
good,Big lots is a cool place to work. You just have to have good people skills and things will be fine. You kind of become a small family after a while. Im still friends with some coworkers.
good,"answer phone, cleaning over and under registers,greeting customers letting them know   I can     help them if they need help. the most enjoyable part of the  job is stocking .The hardest part  being at the register, I only get   15-25 hrs."
good,"Big Lots was a great place to work. However as the ATLS the diversity in management is very little which made me feel a little more targeted when organizational changes were made. My Store Team leader was poorly trained and made my job much harder than need be because of the belief that he didn't have to work and he also didnt know what he was doing.  They require a lot of you management wise but do not properly train their management. It can be messy with all the changes that are constantly being made to the way things are executed so it gets hectic and you can be easily overwhelmed. Overall I loved the company however if management was properly trained, organization was in place, and they make changes less frequently to give proper time to retrain associates, I would have enjoyed it much more."
good,"-Hard long days "
good,Busy season are a whooping and pay increases are a joke. Management is understanding and work with you. It's def not a forever job in my opinion......
good,"Fun, positive people to work with. Beautiful new corporate facility. Days off for the Holidays and Flex time through out the year. Good management training classes"
good,Nice store. Manager was good. Asst. Manager left a lot to be desired.  Always gathered employees together at end of day just to speak bad of him. Which I did not care for.  Ok fill in job.
good,Planning puts in a lot of hours. Systems are antiquated. Lots in manual excelwork. Great HQ building. Beautiful campus. Free gym. Good benefits. Very poor development of people. People don’t feel that valued.
good,"Great people, low hourly pay, kind of stressful. The job wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I got a better job offer is why I left. But it’s a good temporary job for anyone in need of one."
good,During my interview process they stated that they were family oriented. During my time there it appeared to me that it depended on who you were if you needed a family specific time.
good,"Not the best place to work but not the worst either. The pay seems alright for entry level but they cap you at 29 hours a week, so it’s not very much at all. Management is hit or miss, they all seem to be really moody. The customers are usually hateful and a lot of co-workers are really lazy. The entire atmosphere makes me dread going there."
good,"You'll never have nothing to do. There's always someone that needs help or something that needs to be straightened. Although the store was hectic at times, I found myself enjoying the amount of engagement. Management and employees were also very down to earth,"
good,"I enjoyed my time there. Managers liked to flex their manager muscles. Occasionally asked to climb on top of shelved near the ceiling in warehouse to get overstock down. It's was actually quite dangerous. Great employee discount, great benefits, great business model, the GM was pretty good but some of the store managers lacked many qualities to be desired."
good,"It has been a very interesting place to work, I started as a floor associate and worked my way up to a Dock To Stock Lead;  I have since left that position and returned to a stocker and cashier."
good,Some days it good then some it is not. Some people are nice and happy you are there other's just are not happy being at work.Customers some think we should show the prices better
good,"Not much to offer for their employees, pay is very low and hours are even lower, hours go to who has been there longer, new people do not get many hours."
good,Great job just need better managers. Also they need to give part time workers more hours. The assistant manager there now is extremely childish and bullies her employees
good,The job was easy. People were nice. Just a lack of hours for everyone so most employees where part time and fighting over hours so that everyone could afford a living.
good,"Big Lots was not a bad place to work or a bad employer.  As with any retail store setting, pressure could be high, you are perpetually understaffed and the only thing consistent about the shift hours is that they are erratic.  It is not conducive to a regular M-F banker's hours lifestyle.  It can make it very hard if you have school age children."
good,"It was a good job to have to keep you busy and pass the time if you don't have nothing to do.  And the employees there was really cool and friendly, make me feel like it was a family instead of a work place.  Treated me so good except for the General Manager"
good,I really enjoyed working here. Up until they replaced management. The new management took over and that was the end of a great thing. He started a firing frenzy. If you didn’t match his requirements you were done. I would definitely go back when he is no longer there.
good,Retail job. Sucks when it gets busy and sometimes you deal with more than you can handle. At times understaffed and sometimes ask you to help out other departments
good,"As the title says I absolutely love my co-workers and the environment as a whole, it is very welcoming and friendly. Unfortunately they hire to many part timers and there’s basically no hours available."
good,Regularly assessed sales floor stock levels to replenish with back stock merchandise before depletion and decorated the store for chrismas and new years
good,Working at big lots gave me the opportunity to work in a smaller setting of retail. I had worked at Target sometime before and I realized that coming from a big fast paced store to a smaller moderately relaxed store was a good fit for me.
good,Big lots is a great job for people who are currently in school and who just needs a little cash on the side.  Workplace is very relaxed and laid back.
good,"It's a comfortable job. There are many associates that are willing to help each other throughout the day. The hours are flexible, so students are able to work at their own pace. Unfortunately, the store is usually short-staffed during the evening, the most common time for many customers to rush into the store."
good,Be ready to hustle. Variety of warehouse positions. Not much internal advancement. Bare minimum of competitive pay. Great benefits.Changing locations soon.
good,It wasn’t hard all you had to do was check people out and restock the shelves every morning and help unload the trucks once a week and help customers find what they needed
good,One hand did not know what the other was doing. Work was repetitive. Always under the microscope. Management waited for people to make mistakes so that an example could be made.
good,I took my fifth amendment. I really don't want to talk about any company online. I decided to leave Big lots for personal reasons that can not be disclored online.
good,"The first manger was great. The store was clean, you could find everything that you were looking for. We were like family. It was a good place to work."
good,"very team oriented, customer satisfaction wad our goal everyday.  we would receive freight deliveries on a weekly basis, and then responsible for the stocking of that merchandise in a timely manner."
good,Managers and sales associates are friendly and respect.. An okay job if you're looking only to work part-time. Willing to work with your schedule if you are in school. Team members will help you to learn the store quickly .
good,It's a fun place to work at. The job wasn't to tough as long as everyone was on board and worked as a team. Management for the most part was great made some really close connections with some of them others were kinda shady but still tolerable. co workers were fun to work with with. Only thing I didn't like about the job was how a coworker got promoted to furniture lead and was lazy as mess and was crippled had no idea how to do the job and me and the other furniture associates were left to deal with all the work and even then those other associates weren't too reliable to begin with so the full brunt of the work landed on my shoulders. if I learned anything is just do what's required and its okay to go above and beyond for the job so long as you don't let them take advantage of you and walk all over you like I let them do to me.
good,"I worked there for 6 months."
good,Working with customers was the best part about working for Big Lots. Not much room for growth. Loved the merchandising part of the job and being able to set fixtures and planograms
good,"Relaxed, Fun atmosphere, collaborative. Work was good, but the manager seemed to have bad days more than regular. The store was right around the corner from my home, so transportation was not always necessary."
good,The hours could be better but it's a good second job for people who don't need a lot of income and can work a variety of shifts. The customers are interesting and you get a discount.
good,"Overall It Was A Learning Experience Learned A lot On Quotas And Awareness Of The Store, Managers Was A Little Immature But Overall The Experience Was Worthwhile."
good,"1.open and closing of the store making sure keeping all phrase of the  operation working."
good,really tough when you only have a couple of people and they don't give you the hour you need to get it done. if you want it to be your first job then it would not be bad
good,"Training was not but a few minutes, not all aspects of the job were explained, so if you didn't know how to do something you were looked at like you weren't paying attention! Register training is a little complicated, entering inf for Big Lots cards was tedious"
good,"It is a retail job - you work on the cash register, stock the store and the back, clean up messes, stock overnights (sometimes), truck deliveries every week"
good,"Co-workers work well together."
good,Working for Big Lots was a decent experience. I worked in shipping and receiving so not too exciting. There was no customer contact. Management was ok to work with.
good,People are mostly fun to work with. Fast paced depending on the job. Can always find something to do to keep busy and stay focused.  You can always ask to learn more.
good,"working for this establishment was ok, but I never really felt secure and I was always under the impression that I was just another expendable employee rather than an asset"
good,Work place is a good start for a first job. All of the managers are very respectful and professional. They are very flexible with school schedules and for emergencys.
good,Discounts you receive as employee is nice. Work ethics in the store\has something to be desired. Things have changed alot in the business they are getting to competitive
good,great place to work when i was 18. got paid every week not much stress put on you. you got the help you needed from other co works or your boss. the other employees where nice there
good,working at big lots is perfect for high school students or if you need a weekend job for extra cash. would NOT suggest to adults with monthly bills because the hours suck and they seem to only give them to managers and over night stockers. The holiday rush is no joke and customers are rude. Management at the location in Arlington on pioneer is great.
good,"This my was 1st job after high school.  I would stock shelves,  be the cashier to help people check out.  Clean the floors after closing. Make sure the bathrooms were clean and fully stocked"
good,"A typical day at work is very easy and slow-paced. The customers are usually nice, they don't ask for much. The hardest thing the job required you to do is lift furniture."
good,great job but regardless how many times you say the leader is horrible and gets bad reviews nothing happens.  Each week and each visit is negative and very little positive moments.
good,"It was okay if you needed a job, but not somewhere you could make a career. They say they hire within, but it is very rare to get a manager or supervisor position after starting in an entry level position. Also, if you work the day shift, you never know what time you will get to go home until about an hour before you would normally leave. If you work the night shift, you will find out what time you have to come in that night as you are getting ready to clock out."
good,"I thought that the job was okay. The people were nice, the manager was kind of mean but had expectations that she wanted met. It was a somewhat simple job, but for me, waking up early was a bit much given that I am not much of a morning person."
good,Big lots is a fun and easy laid back work place to  work the employees are awesome. Its also a great place to shop for food furniture and eletronics. This place pays good and very nice.
good,"I enjoyed the crowd I worked with. I wasn't too keen on the practices from the higher management position, but locally it was a decent place to work and they were felxible with working hours."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day is working and meeting with the public."
good,"The corporate office was always very helpful, you could always reach them by phone if computer went down and you need to speak to HR. they were a good support them for manager. It was a very physical  at the time not enough hours were alloted  for all that needed to been done , if you were high volume store and carried furniture.  The cleaning of the floors we had to do over night . Trucks we were timed on, and the  merchandise to be out on the floor."
good,"Was good would off be nice too stay but they ended up closing down after Hollidays"
good,"I walk in clock in, put freight out, help customers, take a break, come back from break, put more freight out, help out more customers, clock out then go home"
good,"IF you love a challenge with your job, this is the place.   Always something to do, you never fully complete everything there is to be done.  Upper management tends to focus only on those who are looking to advance.  HR is a nightmare.  love the associates, loved the customers.  benefits are very good overall and build with time"
good,Good seasonal job. I would've stayed longer but due to a new baby I had to leave. It was a fast but not over the top place to work lots of things to do never a dull moment.
good,this job was easy and good to work for except for manger that had a hard mean attitude and spoke down to us while he sat in his small office watching cameras and eating
good,"fast paced, planning resets and completing in a timely manner, make sure all shelves are well stocked, assist customers, maintain stockroom, resolve customer service issues,"
good,Gained a lot of experience working with furniture. I did not have the experience at the time. I was trained quickly because I am a quick learner and a team player.
good,It was a slow paced job! The manager was ok but always kept her workers working! I don't highly recommend too many people to work there because of the little bit of hours
good,i never really enjoy my life there because they were rude to me most of the time so i kind of disliked it most of the time i was there you would go in finsh your dayly grind of a shift and go home
good,While at Big Lots there were many changes. Communication between the store and the corporate office would have been a lot better if they had more access to technology in the store
good,Working for BIg Lots in Furniture as a Lead is good for me mentally but physically it is very taxing on your body with liitle to no help loading furniture daily.
good,Great coworkers. But not the best pay and we would have to have a lot of patience working there. So many rude customers. But overall the staff was very friendly.
good,Not much to write about this job. Hardly worked. That's why i quit there. Was only getting about 20 hours a week if that. Wasn't enough hours for me..
good,"only worked there a short time due to having to relocate. but it was quick paced, I worked there through a temp agency and was paid weekly. you pack trucks full of heavy boxes all day"
good,"ok place to work. everyone is very friendly, managers are good people. Biggest complaint is that they don't offer enough hours. Many coworkers don't come to work on time and there's no discipline."
good,"A typical warehouse environment, but the people is what makes it a good place to work. The incentive program that is in place allows an individual to earn an extra three dollars for every hour you earn bonus."
good,"Job was ok/good, some managers were good to work for and others were not, the discounts were pretty good depending on what you were buying. My last store manger was the reason why I left."
good,working at biglots was fun with all the new things coming in weekly .always fun to rearrange thing and reset shelfs.good first time job or late life job.
good,The people at big lots r friendly but when I was hires I was told I would get a certain amount of hours and I never did so I was only working maybe 10 hrs a week and I couldn't even pay bills by the time I was done it was just enough for gas to make it home and forth from work everyday
good,it was okay but felt too pressured to make sales and to get objective completed regardless of multi tasking and or obstacles. benefits mediocre flexible schedule dependant on management and person
good,"I enjoyed the job and the coworkers (management included), I just didn't get enough hours to support myself. Unloading the truck was a little difficult because we use outdated/broken equipment and were understaffed with way too much inventory in the back and store so not a whole lot of room for more."
good,"It's a fun enjoyable job . The people are kind, nice, and respectful. Management always tried to help when needed. we work hard the hours are flexible."
good,"It was an ok place to work. I had to work on Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve till close which was at 10pm.   the store was clean, but the stock rooms were unorganized"
good,"Being a cashier & stocking the merchandise isn’t bad I would work there for"
good,"The was demanding and stressful due to the number of hours required, calls from the alarm company in the middle of the night and the always on call nature of the job."
good,The management was not open to new ways of doing things.  They just let the employees do things the way they wanted to do them.  Very inefficient in the way they stocked merchandise.
good,"This job is good for folks that are looking for part time or temporary work, like high school kids or people going to school. Since the hours are flexible."
good,"I did work at this company for almost 3 years and there was advancement and many other opportunities, but due to medical conditions I had to look for a different job."
good,"Work/Life balance in management is very difficult in this company. Schedules are created every Monday by noon, but never ""Posted"" till Saturday. Meaning, if you try to arrange to make arrangements with friends and family, your schedule may change without warning between Monday of being created and Saturday when its published. Sunday begins the work week."
good,"I loved working with the public the whole time I was at Big Lots, just cant survive and pay bills on little to no hours, and they were hiring more people."
good,It was fun and easy to work for big lots everyone had there own section to keep restock. And the truck would come once a week and that was the worst day because the warehouse was never organized.
good,I loved that job at big lots. But the pay was not worth how much I worked. I was going through a divorce and raising my son alone. I needed something better for me and him.
good,"I was hired to work here as a freight unloader. I got there at 4 am and often left by 5 am. I made $7.25 so you can imagine this was an impossible job to work in order to supplement living expenses. When I gave my two weeks, they cut my hours even more."
good,"Place was laid back, many co workers to help with work and to get to know, pay wasn't the greatest, work hours also weren't so great. Able to switch between jobs which was pretty interesting."
good,"Opening the store, directing employees on there task, unloading freight staging and merchandising, cashiering and customer services, prepare cash for pick up."
good,Many hours to cover other non-salaried employees.  Salary does not cover amount of overtime that is expected to cover the payroll cuts that were implemented on the hourly employees.
good,It was pretty cool to work for in a temporary sense but overall I wouldn't work there to make good money. The staff was friendly and I liked the discounts.
good,I do not have a review to write about this company. this company have lacks but not a bad company to be employee of. I worked for this company for two years
good,Pay isn’t great but managers were good and treated you fairly. Expectations were fair and decent room for growth. A lot of turnover though and retail in general isn’t the happiest place to be
good,"The company does not care about its workers and leaves its workers in poor working conditions. The hours they give weekly cannot sustain you in the real worlds, sometimes they will give u 3 hours a day."
good,"Liked coworkers, minimal hours needed and average.... Hard work. Early hours, store discounts available and supervisors worked hard along side employees."
good,I licked working at big lot management was good and the people were fun to work with.  I wound have stayed but I got ill. and corporate wound not hole my job for me
good,"It is a great way to get some entree cashiering experience. But, the worker's support is horrible and management is incapable of doing anything about it."
good,"When I first worked here, it was a nice place. Everyone worked together as a team and there was no drama. "
good,"very competitive, not appreciated for the work that you did outside of your title, the district manager was like a third world dictator and was not pleasant to be around"
good,This was my second job the staff was ok But Not fair to getting enough hrs to provide for your family. I think other companies paid better for advancement.
good,"What I did was greet customers and scan the customers' items. Then I also stocked items in the correct aisle by using a cart. The management was good, the staff was not too serious about the employees' jobs."
good,"It was a great place to work. The store manager though, did take advantage of the asst role by not working shifts and leaving early where breaks could not be taken. The store manager seldomly switched the schedule around to benefit his needs."
good,"Lack of resources and poor time management. Scheduling was inconvenient for all the staff and employees often did not show, leaving the work load for management to complete."
good,The management of the store was good. Good to employees and respectful until new district manager came in. Cashiers back was to door kept getting yelled at for not acknowledging customers as they came into store. When ringing up customers you cannot constantly turn your head to acknowledge customers coming into store when your back is towards them.
good,Able to move within the company at a good rate if your skills are recognizable. Hours are hard during holidays because it's retail. Management could use help.
good,"All my managers hire than my manager position were great. Most"
good,I worked in furniture at hemet ca ;location which was a good location and manager good people to work with low pay but like I said depend on manager and location some people in these type of stores do not belong in management
good,Working at Big Lots is a okay job. At times. The manager is a pain sometimes. The customers are somewhat okay. The hours are great. My coworkers are cool.
good,Good company to work for. Really enjoyed it. Great people! The true definition of working as a team. Loved the discount we received as well. It was just too far from home
good,"if the benefits were better I would have loved that job. Also a better Job structure would have been nice. More time on our lunches, more people that were driven to get the job done like me"
good,"Overall a good area to work in and easy going customers, some customers unforgettable even. Decent pay, friendly working environment, etc. I enjoyed the time I worked there while I was there."
good,Staff and management very friendly. Always willing to give assistance if it was needed. This was a second job for me. Used a just a supplement while working at the School.
good,In the beginning I liked working there. It wasn't too overwhelming or fast paced but over time the management was very mean and nasty. They weren't understanding and they could put you on edge.
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere, good coworkers, room for advancement, clean environment, helpful management, somewhat flexible schedule as far as management goes ."
good,here you work with a lot of different people; so there is a lot of opinions a lot of different ways to get things done. so you work at getting better in order to learn.
good,"My immediate management is amazing and wonderfully helpful. We work together as a team. The management that extends to the district and further up the corporate ladder are the management that I have issues with. They refuse to pay employees their worth, don't understand what important aspects of the job should be, and enforce more negative than positive reinforcement. Frustration of these issues has caused me to not feel appreciated or valued especially for the amount of physical labor that goes into my position daily."
good,"if you are a young adult looking for extra cash, and an easy job then this is for you. The work is easy, and the people are friendly. Management can be inconsistent at times, and the way they handle returns is frustrating."
good,"My typical day at work is taking care of customers and making sure the store is running smoothly. I am currently the merchandising manager. In the past five plus years I've learned a lot about retail and management. The hardest part of the job is probably unloading trucks. Our culture is based on ""Jennifer"" . The companys best customer according to reward sign ups."
good,I worked at str #5181. The associates were nice but the store manager lacked experience and very rough to work with. SM worked against the managers instead of working with her managers.
good,Big Lots was a good place to work the days were filled with activities and there was always something to do. You got the opportunity to work with a lot of great people.
good,"It is not bad of a job  I liked working there ,wish I got more hours but it was really good I do recommend people working there, I only work bout 4 to 6 hrs a day"
good,"•	Trained new associates on efficient ways to complete tasks specified by supervisors"
good,"This was a nice position to work while attending school still, it wasn't too stressful and I enjoyed showing up. It required some labor and brought me to the next step in my career."
good,"Take cash and card payments; stocking floor; unloading truck deliveries; building furniture; provided customers with excellent customer service."
good,It was a nice place with some nice people. good hours when u can get them  not a bad place for part time work. I like the discount you get it good for all things in the store.
good,"it was a friendly environment to work in. the boss in charge was a rude sometimes for no reason, or would get on your case for the littlest things. the managers made it a lot better!"
good,i didn't mind working here but the lack of hours isnt that good.  so i would recommend it if your tryin to live off just there.  unless you luck out and get full time. but over all honestly it isnt to bad i think its suitable for anyone
good,If your looking for an entry level job this is it. Management is a joke and in need of some serious training. Poor ethics as a company I wouldn't ever work there again.
good,Good place to work Hard work but flexible schedule  managers in all areas were good. The crew was great to work with good part time job especially around the holidays.
good,Big Lots is a great place to work if you like to interact with people. The best part was the overtime they offer. The worst part was the involvement between the team leaders
good,i were a very hard worker for that company i clean i stocker person i mad sure every thing were in order and neat and in place and the store every company i work for i gave a 150 0/0 prcent of my hard work for ever company work for MCI naf Dillard;s AND Sears;s family dollar and tree hous  bakery and i love worker there
good,"employees get a 20% discount, not many hours for non-management employees, unrealistic expectations of management, freight unloading is very strenuous and they don't offer higher pay for these employees."
good,"I really enjoyed this job also. It was very easy and laid back. My co-workers were easy to get along with. I like working with the public in small groups, and it was like that at Big Lots."
good,Big Lots was an awesome place to work. The one I worked at had great managers and co-workers. I enjoyed working with each and every one of them and loved the job as well. The only downside of the job was that you got paid next to nothing. Job starts off at 7.50 or there about and it is very hard to get a raise. Would recommend to work there if you don't mind making less than 100 bucks a week.
good,This job is no longer open. Had fun there. gave great hours. Made a decent amount of money. The hours where long. Enjoyed the people I worked with. Customers was nice.
good,Seasonal work was my position. I was updated to part time and was able to work as many hours as available. It was slow paced and there just wasn't enough available time for me to make this a long term situation.
good,It was an okay job it was that hard at the end of the day. It only sucked when you had a bad manager and the pay wasn’t that good either. I quit because I had to attend school.
good,I worked at Big Lots in Jacksonville NC some years ago. If the management would've been better the experience would've been better. It was like family.
good,"retail business based on sales volume not piece count.  usually receive 1-2 trucks per week.  Most positions will have additional duties assigned to them (i.e. cashier: register, go-backs, merchandising, cart retrieval, bathroom duties, service area, furniture, etc)  Do not work outside your scheduled hours unless the store manager revises the hours prior to allow you access to clocking in and out."
good,"I would come in and work inventory on the floor, help customers with information on items and prices. I also operate a cash register and would sometimes help customers with large items to their vehicles."
good,Big lots was one of my first jobs. I would say for any starter this is a good place to begin. Work hours vary and they are pretty flexible to your life's situations.
good,"Working at Big Lots I had a couple of different jobs to perform.The first being unloading the truck every Wednesday.I also stocked shelves,customer service,as well as cashier."
good,I worked there for just over 3 years and promoted to CSS which is Customer Service Specialist within 4 to 6 months of working there. I liked working there my co-workers where great but the store I worked at closed in late 2014.
good,While working at Big Lots I had a couple different jobs that I would have to perform. The first being unloading the truck every Wednesday. I also had to stock and make sure the aisles were looking up to management standards.
good,"Most days are slow-paced but can become a rush during the holidays and weekends. The most complicated part of the job is when you are required to ask customers multiple questions such as: Are you a Big Lots reward member? If not, would you like to sign up for one? Interest the customer in a BLCC (Big Lots Credit Card) At the end of each purchase ensure they know about current survey. Overall, working here is fine. Definitely not anything you could live off of if this is your only job."
good,A typical day a big lots as an employee if on the stock team you will mostly be in the back ether sorting the back little warehouse gathering the pallets for the day then you will be assigned a spot in the store and then you push your pallet there and start to stock the product. the hardest part of the day was meeting the count of 6 pallets a day.
good,"I worked in the distribution center when the company was expanding, expanding and expanding again.  Lots of growing pains and staff changes. Management was changed often."
good,having to work with a lot of different people who may not like you and having to put that all aside to make it a safe place to work. some times you had to do the night shifts job
good,I was younger when I worked at Big Lots and some things I do not remember. I do remember working very few hours and low pay. I also remember how messy
good,"a day at work there was tough like spend 6 hours in a truck unloading  then spend 2 hours stocking the shelves."
good,its a cool place to work u are very good friends with the managers because they sometimes seem to have some preference with the employees and give them more days and more hours to work throughout the week or month
good,"It can be slow, or it can be fast. Expected to do a little of everything unless specifically noted that you can't. Drama here and there. Not always great management. Stressful or relaxing; just depends on the day. Lots of expectations; competitive."
good,Working for Big Lots was a great learning experience for me. The supervisor worked with me and gave me hours that I needed and worked with my school schedule. Great people to work with and for. I enjoy working for them but I do not look forward to their move to the high desert coming soon.
good,It was a good job. Store wasn't in a good location so business was a little slow at times. Then management was not up to par. Overall it was a good experience. They ended up shutting the store down.
good,It was a good job but sucky pay. People were good and nice. Magingent is good they now how to run the store but they do have good communication skills
good,i give it a 5. each day was something differerent to do. i was head customer service specialist. did stocking helped customers ran registers cash flow
good,"For all jobs held or jobs that I currently hold; I really enjoy the work environment. One of my life's motto's is that ""I love my job""; this slogan keeps me motivated throughout the workday. To earn a long term working career job is a long term goal that I hope to achieve."
good,it was a great opportunity to work in retail and especially in a position of management. I will never regret my experience fulfilled throughout my time at big lots.
good,The hours were not enough to support a family on the people were good people and I enjoyed working there just needed more. Had to find something better for me and mine.
good,"very good work place , lots of support from the team ,"
good,I had an excellent experience working with the Big Lots Company. Employees and Management provided support and made each be fun and productive. Customers as well provided each day understanding with each of us as their assistance.
good,Not a bad place to work. Very friendly and easy to get along with the other folks working there. Customers were nice and the store itself was easy to get around in.
good,"I love big lots and the products that they have I was able to move around the store became management fast,unloaded truck,cashier and customer service"
good,"they give no chances and are very cut throat. you can work as hard as you for them butthey will not have your back."
good,Its fine to work for this employer they do not ask very much of you. Its all about merchandising and making sure that your store is clean and neat. Hopefully.
good,At big lots I did a lot of customer service which bough me closer to people and I met a lot of great people there .Its a great place to get things at a reasonable price
good,I look forward to make it a good with a happy on my face. For the days list of what to do. Ask questions and start my day. Greeting people as they coming the store and ask if they  need any help
good,learned how to deal with all types of customers and all types of situations.It was never a dull day at work.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new faces
good,Working at big lots was an experience I used a lot everywhere I went. While being a cashier in the begging of my work experience there made me more trained for future jobs.
good,"Worked in fleet operations,office people were good.Fast pace office with a lot of work to do operation.Learned alot about the operation and how it worked."
good,"its cool, its generals liked it. i had to work the barley and days and i was frustrated because the would cut my shift an hour before i had it and i hated that"
good,"Working at Big Lot started off to be a great experience great working environment great fellow employees and cool hours. But than I relocated to a different city ad county so had to transfer and all that changed. Once I made it to my new location and started working at this new location facility everything was way different like in a worse different kind of way. This new facility had bad management, fellow employees don't know how to treat one another, like everyone is on a power trip. Plus the hours the hours that most employees were getting was not even considered part time pay. How could one live off okay pay with not enough hours added to that okay pay. Sometimes you'd get a cool okay pay for the pay period with okay hours for that pay period. But  than the following pay period  you'd get really not so good hours like 8-14 hours for the pay period. So it was always almost an issue all the time on not having enough hours."
good,"For the most part I liked working at big lots, big lots has some great customers and I loved helping the customers. I loved walking in the store around the holidays and you get to feel the holiday spirit"
good,this was a good job where i made lots of friends and learned a lot  about different types of furniture and worked my butt off and earned every penny i made
good,High turn over in managers.  Only one assistant manager with qualifications to manage people.  Depending on who was managing the workplace would be considered hostile.
good,I really dont remember it was close to where i was living. I got carts and staighten the shelves. It was an ok job. You get to interact with the different people that come in.
good,"All I had to do was unload the delivery truck, which was normally unstable and had damaged product everywhere. From there I had to organize the products based on where they get stocked in the store."
good,The store is very nice and organized. Plenty of discounts items within the store. On a typical day the store can be busy and other times it can be steady .
good,"Upper management has it favorites. You can go from Hero to a Zero in a day.  Training is at it's worse.  Lack of payroll, keeps moral down due to scheduling."
good,There is drama like most jobs at this location. The management treats people who have been there and are willing to come in when ever they call better than those who want a life outside of the place. The most enjoyable thing about this place is the discount that comes off after most sales if may not seem much but around the holidays it was amazing.
good,"Enjoy going to work, friendly co-worker and management.  Worked  as cashier then moved to floor staff,  then managed a department.."
good,long hours and not lots of help you are a one man team. most of the team is lazy n favorites by upper management so one person ends up doing all the work.
good,not all that good to me it was okay for the few Months  I was worked their I wouldn't would to work there because they are very slow don't get that much of good service.
good,I enjoyed working here.from the employees to the customers just wish the pay was better.customers came in and dealt directly with me because they trust my customer service
good,This was a job that was not hard to do. And it was right up the alley for anyone desiring a customer service job. The location was very convenient. ..
good,"great store, good location, nice employees, great boses, awesome store, store well stocked always by hard working employees who give it a hundred percent plus!"
good,great exercise up and down a ladder stocking....don't trouble them if you have no hustle factor....good 20% discount when you work there....need more respect for your availability when scheduling
good,As with other retailers big lots has suffered some loses. Attempting to do more with less. That unfortuantely does not allow people to have alll the tools needed to succedd.
good,"Was not a big store, however the size of it compared to the people that worked there made an impression larger than the job itself."
good,meeting new people every they and providing them with service such as cashing them out and helping them on the floor. I have learned to deal with a difficult customers.
good,"provide customer service on a daily basis, light management paperwork, manage a few employees with minimal supervision. Open and close the store and complete duties that comes with."
good,"This is a location that is enjoyable to work as it house many different home goods from furniture to grocery.  There is everything you need for a space of residence and children.  So, it was easy to be of customer service as it was easy to appreciate that all that was needed could be found there and affordable. Co-workers are ready to assist and know the store well."
good,A very well organized staff a great work environment everyone worked as a team no one was left alone when opening up for the grand opening great management staff as well
good,Corporate is not very understanding of real work environment and will sometimes tie Management's hands but fun place for the most part. The employees are relaxed and fun and most customers are understanding.
good,Loved helping people when needed or telling them about the product at hand. Setting up the store so its eye catching to the customers. Making the customers happy so they will keep returning.
good,Big Lots is a very understanding job. I have great times working here. I have learned alot about retail working here. Big Lots was my first job i ever had.
good,"I would meet an associate at the store we go in I would count all drawers , put all information into the computer , count the deposit, set up all registers, Then open the store."
good,Learned a lot about freight and manufacturing systems. Practiced how to manage freight and how to balance materials in a market setting. It was a overall good place to work.
good,By far this was one of the best places I've worked. We always had a good report with one another.  We had fun but were professional on the job. Management always was able to answer my questions.
good,"company does not exist anymore, it's a company based from the states who tried to start stores in Canada, i's like a sears. wall mart , target, giant tiger ....etc"
good,"OK place to work. OK place. Stop, oh please, stop forcing me to review anything to submit a review. Indeed is pretty much not providing a service by forcing this."
good,The company needs to focus more on team development . Also increase payroll to allow leadership staff to hire. Overall I enjoyed working with the staff.
good,"Good people, good environment, good pay, lots of manual labor, consistent days off, not a life long career job, can get stuck on any shift, but night shift pays more"
good,"You will become physically fit. You unload trucks and stock shelves.Wear good shoes. I was taught so much here. I learned to stock a four foot shelf with twelve feet of product. It was fun and the other employees worked hard, as well."
good,"Management here is very considerate and do a lot for their employees when necessary. I appreciate everything management has done for me, and have found that following guidelines and rules is key."
good,a typical day at big lots long and hard.what i learned at big lots is that everything is not met for everybody an the simply means if you don't like what you do find something else
good,I would come in start unloading a truck and sell furniture. I was only part time. i worked really hard to try to get more hours and it never pad off. I quit because I found a full time job
good,This job has cashier/floor associate and stocking positions available. Helpful coworkers as well as friendly management. If you're looking for a simple part time job then this is for you.
good,"Out of all jobs, this job was most well rounded. There wasn't much you couldn't do if you had it. I would suggest this job to anyone else & I'm willing to be a reference for anyone who needed it."
good,Spend many years there not the greatest place to work but not the worse either I guess...turnover is great managers come and go always a lot if work to do any always hard to keep up
good,Nice job we all worked well together. The customers and managers were good. It was overwhelming at times because a lot of managers count on me be I liked it because I was dependable.
good,The Company culture and values are great. Long hours are required  for a typical day. Hardest part of the job was the shipping and receiving process. The most fun part was engaging with Customers and associates.
good,"the team i worked with were great! although, we had no direction and pretty much had to figure out how to do anything on your own, even if you were not sure it was the correct way. this was because every manager had something different to say about each job description. If it would have been more organized i would have enjoyed it a lot more."
good,"Some people get over worked and the pay isn't that great. "
good,"its an okay job if you like being a cashier & not really working. time will go by too slow & ill find myself simply standing with no work or any customers to assist. not my cup of tea, but everybody aren't the same."
good,I learned how to talk to customers.  Got some computer skills. Got to know my customers and they still talk to me outside of the store.  Made new friends outside the store and some of my old co workers are my friends outside the store. The hardest part of my job there was the irate customers. The most enjoyable part of my job there was the customers that returned to the store and the ones that made a big impact on my career.
good,I enjoy working for Big Lots. The management staff is hard working and responsible. They allow you to work independently on tasks with out interference. They are trustworthy of the associates that deserve it.
good,"Stocking shelves. How to unload eighteen wheelers assembly line style. Relied on me to do extra duties due to my eager to learn. Great, very sociable, and customer service oriented. Not enough hours given out. Satisfying customers."
good,"Communicate with customers, customer service, handle money. I enjoy seeing customers satisfied and leave the store with a smile making sure they come back to find what they need."
good,"Went in one day to buy a couch and walked out with a couch and a job."
good,"Big Lots is a decent place to work. Great atmosphere, excellent customer base. The crew I worked with awesome and never had a problem between us."
good,It was a steady fun work place that always tried to stay ahead of the competition and keep customers satisfied. I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,a ok place to work people are nice but the hours are short the manager is nice and I don't really remember cause it was so long ago
good,"Began work December 2016 as a temporary/seasonal sales associate for the holiday, great pay for the time being. Since this is a corporate company and mgmt can only work with the hours given, you may find yourself struggling to get the same pay as during the holiday(given this circumstance)."
good,I would come into work usually I would be assigned an aisle in the store to begin working on or put any basket of unwanted items back on the selves.
good,It's had it's up's and down's just like all other jobs. But they made me feel like I couldn't do things right and when I asked for help on thing I would be laugh at by an Asst. Manager that worked that.
good,"This was a great experience for me love i was able to learned about merchandise, and great costumer service. big lots has a lot of opportunitys and appreciate their employees."
good,Its an ok job if it your first job. They job need more help to get the place a little more organized.  Some of the management needs more training.
good,Great working environment in terms of the surrounding coworkers and managers. Relatively low opportunities for advancements in the company.
good,If you need a starter job and work experience this place can help. Especially if you are in school or just graduated from High school. Work is easy to pick up on and learn.
good,It's a good place to work. It's a good experience to work in a grocery store if you don't have that kind of work experience. They also have excellent members of management.
good,"The Days were normally are normal paced, there were a few slower moments. Management was very understanding and motivating towards staff. Having to continuously check your schedule online for changes was kind of a pain, nevertheless was greatly to be apart of a team with great energy and vibes."
good,Big lots needs to train cashiers a lot more. But over all it is a positive atmosphere. I enjoy taking care of customers and have excellent service skills.
good,"not the best company to work for, not the worst. not a very fun place to work as most of the stores have horrible clientelle that destroy the store..."
good,A typical day at Big Lots is Hustling and making sure you get the product received and moved to the lanes so the product can get put away in its location so it can get picked or packed and sent to the shipping department where product gets loaded and sent to the stores to sell to the customers.
good,Present Furniture to potential buyers. Load and unload trucks of furniture and store merchandise. I learned great customer service skills and communication skills.
good,I enjoyed the position as it was independent work with minimal supervision. The hours were the hardest as they were every day early morning.
good,"This would be a good job if it paid more, the salary raises is another issue that should be lifted because of the hard work you out in, but other then that it is a good job to have if your looking for forklift experience, cashiering and stocking"
good,"My experience at big lots was great. I loved most of the people i worked with, made some really good friends, but the management in charge was awful. Had no knowledge on how to properly run the place, they didn't value good employees, we were very poorly compensated and rarely offered over time. The scheduling was flexible. I had several opportunities for promotions and was promoted twice in the 4 years that i have worked there. Six months after being promoted to management i left the company for an internship in London, England with Marriott International, Inc."
good,"Customer service, had my own department to stock merchandise, unloading 2 trucks a week, and friendly staff, answered calls regarding my department and cashier associate."
good,Unload trucks one day and stock freight another day. Small store with only about 20 associates working. Management and supervisors are alright but sometimes get onto you about going slow.
good,You get to learn about a lot of the store areas and also learn how to improve yourself with knowledge when you really don't understand what you have been trained to do you are welcome to go back and learn it again.  Help is always around
good,"When you get a good manager the job is fabulous .the discount is also a plus! Getting a full time position is vary difficult ,it's like waiting for someone to quit or retire.I would love to work for big lots again but a position in my home town area is never available  ...So if par time  is what you need with only a few hours a week then this is the job for you."
good,"This is a decent job to have. It can be very stressful and hard at times. I did learn how to talk to and interact with customers, but the management stresses you out. You are told to do different things at different times. There is not just one task to focus on. They expect you to be doing multiple tasks at a time. The co-workers are not the friendliest to get along with. The furniture associates are being paid the same as the cashiers. The furniture associates are carrying and loading up furniture, doing physical work, while the cashiers are just standing around. This is a job you are going to come into and be ready to leave right when you get there."
good,"Typically a good place to work. There are some days where customers just don't understand that you can't do what they want for various different reasons, but in the long run it's a good place to work. Coworkers are nice, and generally easy to work with, management is pleasant to be around."
good,"I was Assistant manager in the furniture dept , I stocked , sold and constructed furniture for display , and supervised other employees. I worked day shift ."
good,"Performed work on the assembly line."
good,Great company with growth opportunities. Furniture Sales are how the company generates volume.Big Lots should invest more in the people instead of higher management.Invest in more team development and coaching.
good,Was a great place to work.......it was corporate run.........was good until a certain district manager came in there it became hard to work for.
good,"Fun workplace; Flexible work schedule, Meet different people on a daily basis, must be a hard worker, a typical day would include running register, recovering store, stocking."
good,"There was no fun part of the job, it was boring, the customers were rude because the workers were rude, management sucked. They didnt care how much work was being done. Coworkers always on their phones. Nothing but rudeness."
good,"lots of things to do"
good,Big lots gave me good work experience but was not a career with much advancement and a high turn over rate of employees. But is easy to get into this company and you do get a company discount when working here
good,The management and team at Big Lots DC were a group of awesome people it was a real pleasant place to work and everyone got along well there the work was demanding but as long as you did your job then you had nothing to worry about !
good,"A lot of work and not enough pay. I do not know if it was just that location alone, but I assume they are all the same and will never work for one again."
good,"The job was more interesting during the holidays, changing the theme of the store and getting into character was fun. i first learned how to use a register working there. The manager was tough but fair, a good leader and always helped his employees get the job done."
good,Never guaranteed hours. One week you may work 20 and the next week only 8. Sometimes you only have a 3 1/2 hour shift! However they are very flexible to accommodate needed time and shifts off.
good,Fun job with constant interaction with customers inquiring about furniture. Working conditions were reasonable and personalities seemed fair. Worked as a team.
good,The people there are very friendly and easy to get along with the work day normally flew by because there was always something to do.
good,"Days normally are fast paced, there were a few slower moments. Was familiar with customer service and stocking already prior to working. Management was very understanding and motivating towards staff. Having to continuously check your schedule online for changes was kind of a pain, nevertheless was greatly to be apart of a team with great energy and vibes."
good,"Big Lots was your basic retail environment. Not too pushy about loyalty cards. Management was nice and the work environment was good. Not mush room for advancement, but good for a basic job to bring in some money."
good,Working with Big lots has been a growing experience for me. The staff that I have work with or train has became apart of my family. We are a great working team to reach one goal.
good,"Dis-alarm store,open computers and registers for the day.Truck day, check computer for arrival of truck,set up rollers,dock plate and pallets.Ensure Dts crew knows their positions and which department they are responsible for.Compare paperwork from corporate to actual truck.Fill out Dts board with info on truck and times for unloading and stocking. Make schedule for Dts crew. Ensure proper areas ( aisle and or end caps) are cleared for new merchandise. Follow up with crew to ensure ticketing process and proper placement of merchandise is correct .I've learned to work well under pressure, to handle accidents and other problems expeditiously.My co-workers over the years became part of my family.It was difficult for me to deal with the new managers favoritism , with no backup from company.I most enjoyed helping customers and new hires. I have been told i'm a real people person."
good,Regular ins and outs of retail. What more could one expect? Had some fun experiences and some demeaning ones. Was told I would get 40 hours a week and rarely did.
good,I enjoyed working there I loved the other employees and it was real easy going..i liked my boss and he was always very understanding .
good,"Working at Big Lots was a bit slow paste, I learned how to get people to work together in times of need. the managers were great well-mannered individuals as well as fellow co-workers. i enjoyed working with customers."
good,"Typical retail store, came with a decent store discount. normal work days included either running the cash register and ringing customers out , or working the floor and stocking and refacing shelves."
good,The store had a family feel amongst employees for a long time until there was a change in management. Not a lot of hours for employees so store looked bad most of the time and tasks were left undone. No help from district manager when our store manager left at the peak holiday set up time. I was working 65-70 hours a week for several months but we got it done and it brought us together as a team. Once we got a new store manager it just went down hill. He wasn't a planner or worker so we were constantly being reactive instead of proactive. I was promised a raise but never got it so I chose to look elsewhere.
good,Great place to work at one time. Friendly co-workers and managers. Great hours and flexibility. Friendly customers for the most part. Learned quite a bit about supervising cashiers and working the truck.
good,"Very chill until holidays. Hours are not the best , give you four hours but a job is a job. Basically register greeting customers , cleaning while not busy. Asking for rewards. If you on the floor you do return and stock put items straight on shelves."
good,"Loved my dispatch employees were great and very responsible. But beyond that, most others were stuffy. Not a lot of interaction between departments as I was used to."
good,A typical day at work would be to pack the and unload trucks. The hardest part of the job was the mandatory over time and trying to balancing it with my home life and my kids.
good,The company is making many changes to be able to take it to the next level of business. New CEO and Regional Manager are sharing info and the training is what is needed to make programs successful.
good,Not very organized. I worked for big lots in west Nashville but moved to hermitage and had to find a job closer to home. They told me I could not work another job if it interfered with my current job and Big lots so I quit.
good,"Big lots is a very respectable company to work. The upper management restricts local branch managers as far as hours go, so minimal hours are offered to employees. very minimal pay rate is offered even for more demanding positions besides management."
good,"Opening and closing store."
good,At big lots I stocked shelves and kept records on the stock in the stock room. I worked on the cash register as well as was in charge of the furniture department. I learned anything from responsibility to how to handle money and taking care of our customers.
good,"I start off Mondays unloading the big truck of merchandise. Usually for the rest of the week, I help manage the furniture section of the store and I recover areas close by to make sure everything stays neat and orderly. I had no problems with any of my fellow coworkers, thus I generally enjoyed working with them. however, the management was much to be desired. The two Associate managers and the furniture manager did their parts very well. However, the Store manager and Assistant manager at times were very lazy and really only did anything if the District manager was making an appearance or if shelves needed to be moved. Most of the time, they could be found sitting in the office. One of them even showed favoritism to a couple of the female employees. With that said, the tasks I enjoyed most were helping customers in the furniture department and assembling new furniture. And as many could assume, the most grueling task was unloading the truck early Monday morning. Overall, management could be a lot better, but it was still an adequate workplace."
good,fun job good company nice products with good and trained employess and managers we all were trained in every department so we all helped each other
good,"Was ok for a supplemental job, not enough hours or pay for a regular full-time income.  No real benefits.  Good place to learn cashiering, customer service, working independently, introduction to some retail business."
good,"I enjoyed this job, my first job, a typical day for me was go in, clock in and count a till and run the register and on free time go on the floor. management was great never had a problem with them. My coworkers were always fun to work with we job the job done while having fun and most of the crew was my age. the job was pretty easy, just be sure to give people the exact change so your not short on the till at the end of your shift."
good,It's kind of hard to write a review because of all the changes Big Lots Cooperation has made for the stores. They do not offer full time positions and the benefits are not that great. It is an okay temporary job but definitely not a good career.
good,Worked retail at my local Big Lots during summer break to earn some experience and money for college expenses. I got along with every one of my co-workers and enjoyed my time there.
good,"Get to work and clock in . "
good,"Managers and co-workers have commented on high levels of accuracy and work productivity."
good,"Open at 7am"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,"Core responsibilities focus on expedient processing of freight in excess of 3000 parcels, independent and team project management, loss prevention, coordinating with and motivating night shift staff."
good,"A typical day for myself was generally ok . I learned a lot about how to interact with customers and store associates . The management of the store I worked in not very good . Some of my coworkers were good at their jobs , but most of them were just there for a paycheck .The hardest part of my job was dealing with a store manager that would not offer any type of support . The most enjoyable part of my job was having customers and personnel from other stores comment on how well I did my job ."
good,"how to organize things, co workers easy to get along with, hard part customers to serve at night,best part discounts on items."
good,"Wide range of job possibilities working in different sections of the stores, working with little to no supervision with awesome co-workers."
good,"Good place to learn the basic of warehouse management. Not very good in pay, but it's a start. Good benefits. 20% off on purchases."
good,I enjoy stocking. I can work at my own rate and get things done the way its needed to be done. Communication with staff can use some improvement.
good,"a typical day at work is going in getting a till form the manager, then switching registers with the other customer service specialist that's shift is over. After check the schedule book to see if everyone has had their breaks and lunches and process register transactions as well as exchanges and returns. At the end of the day after everyone goes home customer service specialist stays with a manager to count all the tills and deposit money to verify all till and deposit money is accurate."
good,Customer Service # 1 while I was working with them. I also increased sales by doing add-on sales. This was a hands on position meaning I did everything from checking out customers to unloading trucks.
good,"My typical day is I show up, sign in, then go to my department and do what ever needs to be done. Example, build and put out furniture, repair furniture. Other times its register duty."
good,The store was in a constant chaos because of the changing inventory but managers were not able to keep up which ended up costing the sales associates because were told had to do an extreme amount more than initially hired for.
good,Each day would include working on a strategic plan to help drive sales.Effectively lead and communicate company directive to associates and made sure each plan was execute.
good,It is a job. Not a good job. Not a bad job. No job is perfect. Big Lots is no exception. Each person will have their own opinion about the job.
good,I appreciated my time with the company. The 45 hour work weeks for Assistants was a welcome change in the retail world. Management weren't as knowledgeable as some Assistants that had been there long term but not given a chance to advance. Overall company direction was nice other then the retail trend of being open on all holiday except Christmas.
good,"Various job duties, cashiering, merchandising, customer service. coworkers are fabulous, we like to have fun and get the job done quickly."
good,My typical day at work starts with checking to see what need to be done  such as resets and stalking. Making sure that everyone know what he/she is to get done before leaving.
good,"Overall I enjoyed this job. I was able to stretch my legs and do all kinds of different jobs. The pay and the hours weren't enough and the management team was inexperienced and unprofessional. They like to hire young kids who don't take the job seriously, and are rarely reprimanded."
good,"Enjoyed interaction with over 700 general office associates; hardest part of the day: when the coffee machine ran or broke, leading to lots of grumpy associates; coworkers who will remain lifetime friends, saddest part of any week were the goodbyes when someone was leaving the company"
good,I learned a lot of great retail management skills I needed to advance in my career at a different place. My co-workers and manager was outstanding and our team worked together to accomplish the needed tasks.
good,"I was a Cashier, I worked with the customer to cash their items out. I would also work the floor helping customer find what they needed and straighten the shelves."
good,"There is always something to do, you will never be bored. Management and people to work with add stress sometimes, but its decent. The hardest part of the job is being able to work with my second job and school schedule."
good,"Learning the cash register, assisting customers, and getting familiar with a store's format was challenging yet exciting! Meeting new people was a learning experience on its own. Getting something right was an enduring moment!"
good,A typical day at work for Big Lots was busy. My areas always needed recovered and reorganized. I learned how to read and st POG's. There was nothing hard about the job.The most enjoyable part was working by myself and at my own pace.
good,"started by saying hi to everyone "
good,"Good job but now to much heavy lifting air conditioner .microwave ovens, also cat litter overall a good paying job and at a time rate Management very bad ."
good,Typical day consited of working on the floor stocking and customer service. As well as operating cash register
good,nice place to work  sells a lot of great things....i would talk to people and greet them in my area. keep my area clean and put stuff together.
good,"Satisfy customers requests. Did inventory control, responsible for entire furniture department."
good,company was good as long as Target was running it then was sold and went downhill till  the chain closed
good,Do not remember much it was four years ago and I was a volunteer..
good,Unloading truck in all weather was the hardest part of the job
good,"I worked both the register, and stocked shelves and a many other chores during the holidays. I enjoyed  the job but sadly ,it was only seasonal."
good,"During my employment with Big Lots I learned how to,"
good,"Big Lots is  no better or worse than any othre big box retailer.  long hours and heavy lifting, expect double shifts because someone always calls in sick."
good,"good place to work for a part time job or second job, easy going members of management and co workers"
good,"I enjoy working with the public. I love my customers, but I am wanting to get back in an office , medical or other."
good,I worked 40 hours a week without a job title. I did all Duties except a key holder to store.
good,"The hours are very long at this company, so be prepared for it."
good,I rather not say anything good nor bad about this job or anything related to this job
good,Overall decent company. The best experience I had for working with Big Lots were the employees.
good,"I would come into work and not know whether I would be cashiering or working the sales floor. Management just stuck us where ever. You could have an easy job one day and a hard one the next. The worst is furniture sales because you also have to unload and assemble the furniture while working the sales floor at the same time. The easiest job would be cart pusher but you'd rarely get that. Low hours, about 3 days a week unless there's a sales week. It had a very helpful work environment because everyone knew just how hard the others jobs were."
good,a typical day is a large volume of customers looking for deals refunds credits and an overall great shopping experience. Ive learned excellent customer service skills to handle any situation as well as using thorough excellent and comprehensive assessment of the customers various needs. My co-workers throughout the years were a great tool in meeting new people to share my skills and friendship. the hardest part of my job was accepting that not everyone left the store happy because of my inability to over-ride a management decision. The most enjoyable part that i feel to this day was the amount of customers that became like family and the ease with which i was able to through years of observing know what they were looking for as well as suggest products i felt they would be interested in.
good,"hard to get 40hrs a week. work 2 10hr days,2 9hr days then2-3 hrs fri day if at all"
good,provide customer service and knowledge of store products and inventory
good,"cashier,unloading trucks,pricing items,to work with the public,managment worked with you,hardest part was doing refunds,the fun part was unloading trucks"
good,i would greet customers as they came into my line and tried to make them feel at home
good,"Fast paced work environment, co-workers were alot of fun, what you learn is multi-tasking skills."
good,"A typical day at the distribution center for would be loading trailers. I load about 2-3 trailers per day at most. Operations run well but lots of clutter due to overly stocked warehouse. Our DC is the smallest and oldest out of all DC's in the country, but distribute to the most stores. What I can say I've learned working here is how to work well with others and hard work. My co-workers are respectable and know how to use their time efficiently. The hardest part of the job I can say is seeing how some associates are not really attentive when it comes to safety and cleanliness. The most enjoyable part working for Big Lots has to be being part of the companies growth. Big Lots has been delivering better products and better store visits when it comes to shopping."
good,"Good job, friendly employees and customers and great managers. Learned about stocking from great management team and had a fun time working there."
good,I was a cashier so i made sure to give great customer service and keep the front of the store nice and neat. very relaxing work place
good,"Nothing bad, nothing good. It is what it is. Truck days can be a little rough. Not sure if they expanded their warehouse or not but it was needed badly during my time there."
good,Nice place to shop nice place to wrk if ypu like to stand for 8hrs.
good,"Daily receipts, banking, computer entry, bookkeeping and cashiering. Got along well with coworkers and management. Dealing with returns when customer was unreasonable. Went from cashier to office manager in 6 months."
good,Well a typical day at Big Lots we get a truck on Mondays and then the next few days we replenish shelves and pull out of date foods. The hardest part of the job is getting everything ticketed and get on shelf in a timely manner.
good,the guys i worked with made the job fun. we worked hard. we were able to keep working all through the day and still have fun.
good,working at a fast paste to get the job done and i enjoy helping others get and find exactly what there looking for. and most of all saitisfying the customer is always a good thing to do
good,With the right manager the job is not bad. Company doe's not back the employee's.Not much room for advancement.Part time asscoiate's hour's are bad
good,"Big Lot's is a nice place to work if you are starting out and looking for a part time job. Be warned though the pay is not very great, hours can be horrible, and almost no chance of full time job or advancement. You may have to unload freight or do overnight shifts. Also you are considered a part time employee unless you are in a management position."
good,"My typical work day consist of re-stocking products and helping customers. There is not much to learn on a daily bases, except if there are new items and you have to figure out where they go one the shelves. The managers always know what they are doing and always direct the staff in best possible route to go. My co-workers are fine and don't give me any trouble; they let me do my job and  let them do theirs. The most difficult part of my job is when my manager tells me to find a brand new product quickly, and I have no idea what he is referring to. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i successfully help out a customer and make them happy."
good,"I felt like a low life working for BL. I did it because I had to, and was one of the best workers there. But hours in retail suck and with only a few Full Time assocites per location, advancing wasn't really an option. I have a retail background, and from day one, I never was trained! Thought that was weird."
good,"good environment, learned to work at a fast pace and in a efficient manner, management needed improvement"
good,"Cleaned up store, aided in customer assistance.  Responsible for selling and delivering furniture."
good,Answering 4 line phone system managing cash for cashiers filing paperwork keeping front end securer i enjoy the customers and my hard days are sometimes with unhappy customers but enjoy it overall   and keeping good customers service is a plus for me i love to help
good,"Every day was a new one you never quite knew what challenges the day would bring, requirements changed daily and sometimes hourly so you needed to be flexible and react fast to the changes. Learning was on going with process changes and always looking for better ways to get things done. Worked closely with my Manager related well asking for help when the job became overwhelming. Has great success with my distribution clerk who was able to take over in my absence and a good relationship with employees.hardest part of the job was the time and effort it took each day to maintain both the distribution floor and the shipping department and stay on top of the paperwork that was required. Although it was a demanding job I liked the fact that everyday was a new one and you never got board with it, it was always a challenge and just when you thought thing were settling down there was a new challenge."
good,"It was a good company,The picnics were great and i made some lifelong friends."
good,"A typical day of work was clean various parts of the store, cash out customers, provide customer service, counted my cash drawer at the beginning and end of my shift. I learned how to provide customer service in the retail world, I learned that Big Lots! intends to have people save a lot of money on things they can get at other stores, and that it never hurts to get a good deal on things you need to live with everyday. Management was okay. I wouldn't say they are 100% put together because it seems like every other person is a manager and it's not good because you can see that they do not communicate and work as a team; so it could be a bit tough working on something that one told you to do, and then another one barks orders to do something else because what you are doing isn't priority to them. My coworkers were awesome, I learned a lot from them. We were always there for each other, we always helped each other if we were stuck figuring things out, and also if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have learned the things I learned about the retail business. The hardest part of the job was satisfying all of mangement because of all the unorganization within the team, the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy customers, seeing my fellow coworkers, and also seeing new useful products come in every week. Nothing was ever the same when the truck came, we always had different things in the shipment."
good,got to meet new people stocked and unloaded trucks as they delivered to the store
good,"Very busy store "
good,"Great place to work, nice benefits, good working environment.  The company has changed quite a bit in the past few years for the better."
good,"My tasks at work can vary day by day. Usually I am either recovery, cashiering, or working the customer service desk and managing everything at the front of the store. If I am cashiering for the day my tasks usually include recovering the front of the store, working on all of the go-backs, and running price checks for the CSS unless my manager on duty has a project for me."
good,Six hours shifts unless you are a manger hours are always low.
good,"Training is almost non-existent, workload is overbearing on employees, safe work practices are not high priority, hardest part of the job is physically being able to keep up with the improperly managed workload, co-workers tend to be one of two types those who can and those who cant the later of the two being the more common"
good,it was a typical after school job! management took advantage of my youth. I received eye-opening training that I would take along with me on future jobs
good,Nothing special. Just the same ol' retail job. You'll know what to expect.
good,"Most days here were selective mostly. I was either working casg registry or making sure the items were front-faced and orderly, as company standards suggested. There was seldom traffic throughout the store so the only problem I had was voids with customers. The staff at the particular location was lively and positive, really a place where I attained the personality I have today. Met a lot of good people there."
good,I love working for the company. I was getting 20% off on everything in the store
good,I enjoy working with people as a team.. I also learned how to run a business.
good,"I walk in, clock in on the monitor at the cash register. Put away my items if it isn't a truck day, and look to see what needs to be done. Put away merchandise that was not purchased. Get Carts from the parking lot, etc. My co-workers were nice, manager was praising, and really liked that I was a fast learner. the hardest part of my job is truck. It's not that its lifting heavy thing, it was just they had people that weren't very fit doing the job. Manual Labor that is."
good,"I would get to work at 7am and unload the truck on truck days. I'd organized the unloaded items from the truck. I'd then go to the furniture department to work furniture the rest of the day, or I'd start off in furniture if it wasn't the truck day. Sometimes I would cover for people by working cashier. I also did a lot of the heavy lifting for the store because I was one of the only larger males that worked at that location."
good,"*off and on the register and stock multi tasking with answering phones "
good,"Retail business really never brings in much pay but the discounts are great and so were the benefits. When i went on maternity leave I got paid 100% for 6 weeks and then after that it went down to 60% and thats not having to buy their insurance, its part of fulltime benefits. it really is a great place to work"
good,"Nice and a safe working enviornment,my co-workers was good and knowledegable poeple to work with."
good,"Over all store performance, hiring, training, and staff retention."
good,"I have worked at Big Lots for more than two years and I'm currently a Customer Service Specialist. I love working with my fellow employees and providing great service for my customers, many of whom are regulars week to week. The medical and dental benefits provided for part time employees is excellent. The biggest drawbacks to working at Big Lots is that it is very difficult to advance. After starting as a stocker with 10 to 15 hours a week, I worked my way up to part time cashier and, finally, to CSS. I've been trying for about a year to move into the associate manager position, which is the next step up. Despite that about half the duties of associate manager have fallen down the ladder to CSS via corporate I and several others in my position have been denied the advancement due to lack of experience."
good,love the store great merchandise great prices. worked great with people mangers are also great. loved the holiday time at the store.
good,"fun environment, great store. great bosses. would work for this company again."
good,I got to learn new things and meet new people. Doing refunds and help customers  find what they wanted.
good,"learned front end management"
good,"what can i say, its retail, it is not enjoyable at."
good,I typically got there around 4 A.M. Once I got to work we went to the back and unloaded the trucks. We would separate them out into pallents and organize them to pull in sections to the floor. We would then break up into teams and each take a section of the store to stock the Items to the shelves as required. I loved that the work kept you in shape. Lots of heavy lifting. I didn't like some of the employees crying about their job. Some people just complain because they beleived they shouldn't have to work as hard as others do.
good,Big Lots is a great place to work. Employees are treated fairly and management teams are trained well.
good,"Typical day at work was very busy with making customer's happy! I learnt how to relax unpressured. Everyone loved to get their job done. hardest part of the job was saying good bye to everyone after gong out of business. The most enjoyable part about the job was, everyone knew what their responsibility was."
good,They are not organized and they never had enough hours for everyone.
good,I had no problems working big lots thought it was a pretty good job. I just feel like people that work there and get promoted aren't the ones that really deserve it.
good,Working as a cashier at Big Lots was a learning experience. I knowledge customer service.
good,"stocking shelves, retrieving shopping carts, assisting customers and employees."
good,"Get Customer love working with the team, Great environment"
good,Worked here when it first opened and wasnt a bad place to work. 
good,"My day at work consisted of many challenging tasks, constant change and invited innovation and ideas for productivity. "
good,"Work shifts usually lasted about 3 hours 15 hours a week which was not my favorite part about the job. The workers were much older and not as personable, but if you needed help with anything they always did what they could to help out."
good,"this place is disgusting cockroaches every where, in the food as well. I was fired because o\I went to the hospital"
good,While at Big Lots I have learned how to simultaneously manage and supervise several individuals. The hardest part of the job is the ever-changing schedule. I work the 1st through 3rd shift weekly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere created by my employees and genuinely being able to assist customers.  
good,"•	Achieving my budget goals for the quarter. I achieved my budget goals most every month."
good,"My job is awesome filled with opportunities. You can work your way to assisting manager or supervisor if you want the position. My co workers work together to get difficult tasks complete to give our store good reviews,reports. "
good,"part time, not enough hours, got new job at Tractor Supply full time."
good,"like when I get to build things"
good,"Fast phase, good workers and most enjoyable part of this job is the customer service. "
good,"The short time I did work at Big Lots was ok. The pay was good but the store was always very messy and unorganized. I was never really trained well on how to stock properly and the managers were always too busy to help. Every day when I would get to work, It looked like non of the co workers there ever took the time out to at least straighten up a single aisle so typically the work load would be put all on me. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the cash register and being able to greet customers and learning how to open and close the store. "
good,I was a forklift driver for Big Lots DC learned everything there is about forklift driver. Basically we took product from the docks to the shelves or from the shelves to shipping and we did that for 8 - 11 hours everyday for the busy months but work was usually 8 - 9 hours per day. There was really nothing hard about the job until we had to work during the busy seasons and first shift left early other than that I had no problems doing any of the work. 
good,"I was active MOD when GM was off,"
good,"Big Lots is a company in flux, current leadership is taking the right steps in seeking to define the culture and find the right CEO. They have a bright future."

good,Great place to work
good,the hardest part of my job was staying in the stockroom...i dnt like being closed in with boxes stacked above me
good,"I priced items, put them on shelves, unloaded trucks."
good,Big Lots a good company to work for. The schedule can work around you.
good,I would open the store count the tills and set the computers up open the store and work at the customer service area all day. i learned how to stock and recover. Some of the co workers were not nice at all. they went through to many different management. The hardest part of the day would be when we had so many customers and not enough cashiers.
good,"good place to work while in college, flexible and accomodating. Surprised there is no loss prevention though."
good,I normally work third shift Monday and Tuesday nights. I stock the shelves and put a lot of the bulk of freight up. I learned it's a hard job but there is always something that needs done so I'm always busy and that's a great thing because it makes the time fly. The management is okay. There are four managers at our store and I generally get along with all of them. I definitely get along with all my co-workers. We always have a good time but also get our work done. The hardest part of the job I'd have to say is lifting the big boxes full of items I stock. The most enjoyable part of the job is always greeting and seeing those repeat customers. It's great when you can make someone's day. I love making people smile and laugh.
good,"fun place to work .... good place to meet LOTS of people.. although i wasnt there very long, i had fun working there."
good,"The members of our team have a good working relationship. It is interesting to interact with customers from various backgrounds and cultures. There is something new to learn everyday,but most importantly we accomplish the task!"
good,Big lots is a pretty fast`pace job there is never anything not to do and for the most part we stay fairly busy
good,"was seasonal, co-workers where entry level so nobody has knowledge of anything"
good,I got to work and always knew what my job was. I loved talking to the customers and helping them around the store.
good,"A Typical day at work would be to pick up my daily agenda at the front furniture desk and finish everything in a timely manner line-by-line. Once done ask management where they would like me to work at and if they need assistance with anything else, throughout the day I would help co-workers load big furniture merchandise out the back of the store. The hardest part of the job would be on monday's when new stock of merchandise has made it to the store and we would have to unload with only a few people on hand in the morning with a schedule of a 8-9 hour day. The most enjoyable thing about this job was the discount I got from working there, and the co-workers that are friendly"
good,Comming to work to a big truck full of marchandise.Ready to lock and unload this truck. I learn that team work is the best thing you can have in good co-workers.The hardest part of the job was getting the product off the truck in a timely matter.I enjoyed the working with such great people I learn new stuff.
good,"In the role of Customer Service I am constantly working with customers and other departments within the company. Management and Co-workers are the best part about working at Big Lots. The hardest part would be the lack of advancement after three years of ""exceeds expectation"" on annual reviews."
good,a great place to go to gain experience when beginning to explore the employment world.
good,Friendliest group of people I have worked with. Able to work on some of the biggest software packages on the market.
good,"Opening system, over looking employees work, making sure everything was done. Co-workers enjoyable. Hardest part was not enough hours. Most enjoyable was tending to customers.I learned to open and close store, I helped open a new store."
good,As soon i as walk in gossiping he said she said weak store manager. I learned pretty much everything on my own. The hardest part of the job was knowing that i do 100 times more than the store manager and shes getting paid for it.
good,"It was a good part time job, while i was bartending. I learned basic warehouse skills. Its where i was introdused to rf scanning and forklift."
good,Going back and forth day to day is your typical job at big lots. You have you sweet and friendly customers along with your rude and angry customers. You will always have your ups and downs but overall its a good job to work at. Everyday is an learning experience.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers and recovering so the presentation of our products is always up to far.
good,The customers were a lot of the reason i keep going to work. My co-workers were also very helpfull. I loved to help them find what they were looking for.
good,I worked very hard and met some amazing and wonderful people at this job. I had left to pursue a career.
good,"cleaning of store, organized, stock, customer service...interesting people"
good,i work five days a week my manger was a good one and there was no hard part of the job it was common sense and my co worker was all good worker.
good,"Overall the job was enojoyable, however all lot of favoritism."
good,"working at big lots was such a great opportunity for me, i learned so much not only about the business but about myself. i realized how hard i can work and how much i can push myself. I started at the bottom and worked my way up to being a supervisor really quick. I loved my manager because she took me under her wing and gave me great leadership."
good,"typical day at big lots i would un load the truck early mornings. that included using an electric pallet jack, wrapping and un wrapping the pallets. Bringing pallets out onto the floor to designated area. I would also do recovery from the registers bacvk to area selling floor. I would sweep and mop the floors. Stock the shelves and make it look nice. I would assit in the furniture dept by assisting customers to their car or building the items for display."
good,Great learning experience with national chain. Learned different management style.
good,Enjoyed the flexibility of their product rotation. Good experience driving sales in the store by good product presentation.
good,A typical day consisted of me doing stock & recovery and cart retrieval. I would assist customers in moving furniture and other large items to their cars. I learned that being genuinely polite and doing the best I could to help customers they would be very appreciative and would continue to return to the establishment. The work environment was pretty typical of what to expect in a retail position and all of the managers and co-workers were really easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting there and the most enjoyable was being able to interact with the people that came into the store and the people I worked with.
good,Learned how to be a complete team leader at this place.
good,"a regular day a big lots is always productive. ive learned a lot about the ins and outs of ratialing stocking and handling a till. the management is very specific about the do's and dont's in the store. they are also very friendly and helpful to all the coworkers. my coworkers and i worked well as a team when everyone was on the same page. at times it was unorganized if the store manager wasnt clear on directions and the order of comands would become a problem. the part i enjoyed the most was helping people, because everyday i would learn something new."
good,"I enjoy my job at Big Lots, although its not enough hours to support my family and I. There's no room for advancement but I do enjoy going to work everyday and interacting with the customers as well a my coworkers."
good,"A typical day is usually cleaning the front area of the store, cleaning the windows and the floors, and standby your cashier area. When customers come in you greet and welcome the customers, and offer them help. Basically doing what your obligated to do. What I learned from working in Big lots is improving my cashier skills, customer service skills, and team work skills. The hardest part about this job is telling customer the location of our store. The most enjoyable part about this job is working along with my co workers helping each other out and the discount we get from working here."
good,"There is nothing bad I have to say about the company. Wife had a heart attack in Feb. and is doing great now, however, between that and driving 900-1000 miles per week and being away from home often, it was time to make a decision which was best for my family and pursue another path."
good,"A typical day at work is hectic, but mostly enjoyable. Things are often less organized than they should be, but the employees work hard to keep things running smoothly. While working with Big Lots I've learned that every person's contribution to the company matters. If one person slacks, it affects everyone else. I do feel that the management could be more prepared and knowledgeable about the things that need to get done in the store, however they are all nice people that try hard. My co-workers are easy to get along with for the most part but some lack motivation and common sense at times. The hardest part about the job is not receiving enough hours to support myself. I go to college, so I have a set school schedule every week, and my boss has not been very cooperative when asked to work around it. The most enjoyable part of the job is being apart of a team. We all have our faults, but we come together to get things done and I know that I can count on many of the people I work with."
good,it's a good place to learn. the are a littlebit old but they work really hard and is nice to work there
good,"lots of cool people to work with, the management would listen and fix any problems, the pay was not bad and you got good hours."
good,because i wasnt full time i didn't get any benefits so no vacation or sick days even though i worked there for over a year. but the people i worked there with were nice and i enjoyed it while it lasted.
good,"Overall, Big Lots was a good place to work for. The work environment itself in terms of the supervisors and coworkers was good, but I experienced some trouble gathering information with them. They also had a pretty high turn over, which cuts out on the ability to maintain professional references without offering people's personal information."
good,So I just want to say big lots is a decent place to work for they work around my schedule.  They give you time off if you ask.   The only thing I got to complaine about is the people that work there.  They are ignorant and talk behind your back.
good,Pay is great but the coworkers are not team players. A lot of building furniture year around. Merchandising is a must. Great benefits but you are definitely tired by the end of the day.
good,Big lots was a great place to work.  The management and employees are a great group of people. The store has lots of great merchandise. I learned alot of retail while i was there
good,"I have worked at Big Lots for over a year and within three months, I became Employee of the Month for five straight months. It's a very strong work environment, the managers can get distracted easily but don't let that take away from your own job."
good,With the time I've spent at Big Lots I have surely learned a lot. I love how I put in the work and was given the opportunity to become a manager at the age of 18. One part I love is that I never have the same type of day. I always have something new to do. It never gets old and I always lean something new. Something new to try and master along with the other stuff I learned.
good,It they paid better it would be ok the stores get over loaded with frieght and not enough room for merchandise they make it impossible to bonus the company almost makes associate lie to meet there demands
good,"Great management, terrible corporate. If you're a cashier you have to meet reward card sign up quotas that includes credit card sign up. If you're in furniture you gotta meet leasing and big coverage quotas on top of those rewards card and credit cards you fail to meet them and you're getting written up. Not everyone wants to go through the hassle which is the sign up process. 3 years into this job and the company is full of it. Great team but terrible company to work for but not as bad as Walmart. Overall 3/5"
good,Management is always on everything that goes on within the store. A normal day can have a medium pace with a steady amount of customers coming in. Employees are friendly for the most part. The hardest part is more so the physical labor from stocking and unloading trucks.
good,sometime it can be a busy place. i like working there. i done think there is a hard place to work if you want to work. The management are easy to work for. they are easy to talk to. the most enjoyable part about the job is meeting the customers.
good,It's okay for a short time period and for a beginner job but the hours and level of work become tiring after a while and the managers are not as trained as they should be.
good,They started me with a great amount of hours per week.. But after so long they started to cut it down.. I'm not sure why or they never told me why so I left...
good,Big lots is a decent part time job. If you put in the years the pay can get decent. You make your own availability. 20% discount. 30% on furniture. Four hour shifts for most of the time. Management expects the part time people to do the work while they get a bonus if the store does well.  No training or very little.
good,Management actually care about their employees. Unfortunately you cannot get very many hours. That is a corporate decision. Less than 20 they do not have to provide health insurance. No one can live on eight hours a week at 10.00 an hour. If they were able to give more hours I would go back in a heartbeat.
good,"hands on required daily turning more into a furniture store than general merchandise store  follows management rotating schedule, but does not work when not fully staffed"
good,If they could just go to each store and really see what’s goes on then they would know how we feel. You can put up a front in front of anyone. But until you walk in our shoes everyday then they don’t know . The saying one team one goal is never there. Maybe they just need a undercover boss to come in and really see how things are going . Yes associates are afraid to say anything anthey shouldn’t be
good,"There was lots of downsides. Hours vary and no benefits due to not being a full time employee which was only for management. Interview process was very easy, took a week to get a call back about getting the job. You got your typical coworkers that try to be in your business, but most of them became my 2nd family and even got close with some customers."
good,Gd job bad management from the time i started it was not going the way they told me in the interview nice place to work but management does not apply by biglots rules
good,"While I enjoyed my time working at BigLots! it was definitely more of a stepping stone in my work experience, rather than a passion. While I have no issues with the company itself, the location I worked at had some less than favorable customers and was typically not well staffed by other employees. While I think both of my managers, as well as my MOD's were excellent, unfortunately, the other employees were not quite up to the same standards. This made my experience less pleasant due to the fact that it placed added responsibilities and work onto my workload, rather than feeling like a well oiled machine, a team. So, I would say they're not the best, (at least in that situation) but also most certainly not the worst job I've had either!"
good,The job was pretty easy and i learned a lot and met a lot of nice people but they pay and lack of hours affected my life so i felt it was better to just leave.
good,"This is a temporary job. It has a very low pay and low hours depending on the day. The management is great, but the job will not advance you in the slightest."
good,A typical day for me at Big Lots starts with me showing up to work and clocking in. I would then take the place of the previous cashier on schedule and I would help customers with purchasing their items. After that i would work in the aisles and begin straightening them and putting misplaced items where they belong. I also helped as many customers as I could while organizing. Once that was done it would most likely be the end of my shift so i would get as much done as possible and then clock out.
good,The work is not to bad its productive and you get to help many customers. Has taught me how to apply customers for different financial options as well as learn about how insurance worked.
good,A typical workday working at Big Lots is very slow. Working at Big Lots is a fair job. Some people at the job are great to be around. The management there is out of place sometimes depending on the week and whose head that day.
good,"This compay used to be a bargain store which is in change over the last 5 years trying to be a small big box.  Buyouts are being replaced by consistantly receiving the same product for short to long periods of time.  More and more plan-o-grams are being used; standard operations for truck unloading followed by all stores, and higher prices."
good,"Regularly dealing with customers and hoping to meet their needs."
good,"Working as a cashier you deal with all the customers whether it's them walking in and out the door asking questions, or checking out their groceries. If you run into a problem whether it's to return or an error in price you have to call the manager if it's not something the cashier can fix and depending on how busy the store is you might have to wait a little. If you're the only cashier in the store and you run into that problem you might have to work on two registers and that wastes a lot of time if the manager hasn't came yet. They're hiring but seem to be picky on who they hire when people are needed."
good,"On most days, when It's not busy I would just recover aisles making sure they're clean. On some occasion I would do some freight, but that's rare since I'm a furniture associate. I would also be a back up cashier sometimes. What I've learned throughout the years of working at big lots, that It's a friendly environment. Everyone gets a lot with each other Sometimes management can be best at their jobs or not at some points. The hardest part is working and trying to get task done, when the store is busy, or is we're short staffed. The most enjoyable part is learning how to sell. I've learned good techniques, and I like to see a smile on my customers face knowing that they had good customer service and found everything they needed at the store."
good,"Long hours, high expectations of managers.  I came on board before the store opened and just before the holidays so it was pretty stressful.  Big Lots hires inexperienced management, perhaps to keep wages low.  Many young people with little experience being led by inexperienced managers trying to open a new store.  Employee conflict was often mishandled.  Store Manager wasn't equipped to handle a store of this size.  District Manager was sometimes hot headed and explosive.  Often times, when things didn't meet his expectation, he would give me a deadline to ""fix it"" because he knew I would get it done quickly."
good,It's like any other retail job. But with a lot of orange. Customers buy things and you have to help them buy their things. Sometimes people will put paper towels in the toilet.
good,"A typical day for me was unloading the truck into the warehouse. As a team we would unload at least 500-700 boxes, small to large off the truck. After unloading the truck we would transition to add the products off the track onto the store floor. The hardest part about my day was unloading the truck. I would wake up at 3:30am the days I was scheduled for a 4am shift. Rarely ever missed a day, maybe if i was tired, or sore."
good,this place would be totally fun to work for if you like to keep busy you can always find something to do. It seem that they hired the metally challenged and that's ok as well but when all the work is on your shoulders then it sucks. And for the pay you receive it's just not fair.
good,"I really liked working at biglots. The pay wasn't great . The reason I stayed 2 years is the manager was great and the hours flexible. I did everything from stocking , resets and cashier. I would work there again."
good,"It's a decent starting job if you're looking into retail. Paid 15-minute breaks each shift, and a 30 minute lunch breaks for 6+ hour shifts, with a 20% discount on every purchase. Along with being paid a decent amount seems like an average job. Friendly coworkers and customers are also a plus. However, trying to balance life and work might be a bit tedious. They REALLY want you to sign customers up for their reward card and/or BigLots Credit Card or else you might be terminated."
good,Depending on what side of management you are hired for will depend on your schedule. You will either open the store or close at night. Large expectations are required with often limited resources.
good,"There is always something going on at Big Lots! Although there is plenty to be accomplished, there really isn't much being accomplished. The Store Manager is a kind and generous individual as a person but I believe they lack certain managerial skills necessary to keep the store afloat. None of the managers there are bad, per-say, the correct word would be inconsistent. Because of this, associates there have learned to play the blame game or pass off responsibilities on lower standing employees. I've learned to help myself stay organized while attempting to keep the managers satisfied with my work. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the obscene amount of freight and floor demands while attempting to get done what currently is most important at that time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be clocking out."
good,"Great future but unwilling to accommodate transfer request"
good,"Big Lots was a great first retail job experience. I got more experience in a busier setting, I learned how to use a cash register, count money faster, stock shelves, how to remodel a store and best of all how to give the best customer service I can possibly give in a bigger setting."
good,"Customers over employees."
good,if i knew what it was like i would of never applied. they tell you up to 29 hours a week but you are lucky if you get 12-17 hours a week. management are only ones that get offered medical & dental and they are the only ones that get over 30 hours a week. i dont think they even have a ceo.
good,my work day consists of doing physical task and then managing my co workers to make sure the task at hand is done. I also have really good customer service skills since i deal wit customers all throughout the day.
good,"Great Customers and Nice helpful Co-workers, a very hardworking team  the co- workers are genuine we do have one the best team members ever. Good Starter job. Great experience!!"
good,I feel like big lots is a good place  to work but they need to give employees  more hours and days or working rent isnt cheap not just give up 12 hours a week no one csn pay bills
good,It was slow and relaxed . The management was very understanding and cooperative . Theres always opportunities to move up in the company. Its a good job if your in school but not to live off of.
good,Typical work day was of course taking care of customers and making sure product is on the floor at timely minor. Dealing with theft was interesting. Flexible hours was good.
good,"My review on this is that this would be a good start for a first-time job. Although the hours are not much the pay goes up sometimes. The job itself is not difficult. Either on the floor or stock, this place is not really difficult."
good,Fun place to work. Management is pretty laid back and try to work with your availability. I love that its like a big family. I don't like that there's NO HOURS to be given.
good,Very fast paced and no guidance what so ever . no training and no follow up at all.  Cant get no constructive criticism nor update on how to grow with the company
good,My review of big lots was management was not getting along with each other which made it hard for the employees to work with each other . Sometimes it was decent other times to stressful
good,Loved it but to little staff. on holidays or special days too little staff where assigned shift / that is all i have to say thank you for your time looking foward to new opportunities.
good,The job itself is easy but management team sucks such a hassel to get your vacation pay and sick pay they are strictbon attendence and heads up will be movein g to apple valley
good,"Working here was a great learning experience. Although the management doesn't seem to care about the staffs personal issues, the professional aspect of the job was great. If I had to do over again, I would. I would probably work a different shift, if possible, and work more hours. Also, I was hired in to drive a forklift and was thrown all over the building, nothing was ever consistent went it came to knowing what my job description was."
good,"at my time working there with 6 people in a team, it was aggravating due to lack of workers. "
good,"I stocked shelves, unloaded the truck, tagged items in my department. Sometimes it got stressful due to people I worked with. Everybody is different when it comes to working with them and how fast they complete their work."
good,"It wasn't bad,but there were a lot of things behind the scenes. Drunkard angry boss yelling at others in public,laziness on the employee's parts... Towards the end it became cutthroat with hours, I was down to 4 hours a dayx3 days."
good,the job was seasonal not a lot of stress management was easy to work with over all it was a alright place to work would have been nice to get more hours
good,Stocking unloading trucks cashier. Cashing out checkers. Opening and closing store store meetings in the morning. Pep talks. General outline for daily duties . Making sure everyone gets their job done. Making schedule for the week. Checking in inventory.
good,"Pleased and excited to serve all guests, sufficient work description, Great benefits, compensation and discount"
good,"its a very easy job."
good,"Working at Big Lots was different because a lot of my shifts started at three in the morning when it was closed to the general public. I wasn't used to that, but it didn't take me long to adjust. I enjoyed that it was a very diverse staff."
good,Working as team member. Always asking for help when need. Management great. Customers return and ask for you by name. Give great customer service when required.
good,"My work day consists of either being on the sales floor or being at the register. I learned a little bit more about customer service and retail. Managers are always being a helping hand assisting the workers with whatever we need and even the customers. Its a great workplace, everyone is nice and respectful. The hardest part of the job would have to be unloading the truck because some boxes are really heavy. The most enjoyable part is the people i meet and conversations i have with the customers as well as being able to help them."
good,it is a job in retail. amount of work is high yet pay is not high enough. hours are flexible and plentiful if you are ready and willing to work.Rated 3.5/5
good,"Typical day: Manage furniture department while meeting retail customer needs."
good,"not that hard of a job,it depends on the department you work in,its a company that is easy to become a manager,great discount for the employees and must of the things in the store is cheap"
good,"this job is what got me some of the things i desired such as my own car, place, independence but year after year the management started to decline for the worst and management has know type of acknowledgement for their workers."
good,"a good starting workplace that isnt too challenging, good start to learning the ropes and getting basic job skills under your belt. skill could include customer service, sales, cashiering, stocking, unloading trucks, coordination of employees, wearing a smile everyday."
good,Workin at big lots had its pros and cons. The pros were that the environment was good most of the time and customers on their good days. The cons were the lack of cleanliness and mice.
good,I would clock in and have to go straight to the register and switch places with another co-worker and start to ring up the customers' merchandise. I learned that you will have rude customers sometimes. There were some managers here that were easy to get along with and there were some managers that expected a lot out of us. The hardest part of the job is when someone is the only cashier and they are trying to ring customers up and train a new person at the same time and you have a really long line. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the managers bring in food for us to enjoy on our breaks.
good,not enough hours in the job is limited and not enough benefits i just didn't like it hated it thats all i learned nothing the hardest part was coming in i never received my first paycheck
good,"Longest job i've had. Corporate structure needs to be worked on, good company and good prices and products. Managers work wayyy too hard and they need to trust the cashiers and stock people. They need to work on customer servic and training if they want to keep up with the times. Loved my time there though. Nice, real people."
good,"Working at Big Lots for the past 3 years has been very educational for me since I had not been exposed to retail with my previous employers. "
good,"Everyday was usually pretty busy, especially after the flood. Sometimes it could get a little overwhelming, but there's was always someone willing to help."
good,"My job at Big Lots called for a lot of hard work and perseverance, but I was always treated fairly and I got along very well with almost everyone and when I say that I mean a very select few. The management staff was great though they were all very kind and understanding and all of them really liked me. The main reason I quit was it was only a 20 hour a week job that paid minimum wage and I just needed to make more money than that."
good,"manage the day to day operations of the store"
good,"The time i worked here was fun, but they didn't give you enough hours during the week. They didn't want to go past 30 hours. Most of the time the other co workers were friendly some had attitudes but that happens time to time. Management was ok but not the best, some were really great and others didn't seem to care about us that much. You done the same thing pretty much everyday which isn't bad either just some change would be enjoyable. I met a lot of nice people here though which made the days better. The hardest part would have to be have an angry customer for something we can't control and they don't understand that. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers making the day better."
good,"Typical day at work- unload truck and stock shelves with inventory. Help customers as well with any questions."
good,"Great part time job."
good,"The managers are considerate and understanding, but the overall business model is low level. They're selling the cheapest stuff at the lowest prices. Pricing the items individually is a hassle, and often the computer technology doesn't work. The workers there all know this, so there is a lot of tolerance, but it still makes doing the job more difficult than it should be."
good,Wish my current location offered more advancement positions for females. ..IV been here 3yrs and most supervisors are male and the openings  they had during my time went to males. So good job just disappointed in that
good,"On the job I'm always on my feet. I have to look for thing to do all the time. Whether its cashier, stock and maintenance. I have a healthy working relationship with my coworkers and supervisors. I enjoy interacting with customers making sure they had the best shopping experience. I've learned to be more organized and better customer service."
good,"	Receive and process shipping while up-keeping inventory."
good,"workplace sub par almost never meeting store deadlines, A typical day at work was hectic overcrowding work priorities  almost impossible deadlines. well working there i learned stocking and warehouse organization skills. management was great to a certain extent i suppose,very understanding at best.The hardest part of the job was throwing freight when the truck came in,certain amount of pieces of merchandise had to be off the truck at a certain time.Sometimes could be 1500 plus had to do it in about two hours.Well of course the best part of the job was getting a paycheck but meeting new customers was always a good treat meeting ad conversing with different types of people and learning new languages while at it."
good,I thought working for a small retail business during my short summer last year would change my outlook on that company. I worked there last summer and it was an okay experience. The other employees were cool and didn't invade my space at any time. I had to unload trucks early in the morning and stock shelves. If there was an opening i worked at the cashier register as well. The hours were low and i did not get to work as many hours as i wanted to.
good,As a member of management was unable push forward to benefit stores future with lack of participation from employees. Older staff was stuck in old ways of working store. Hiring pool was very limited and was a struggle to fill positions with a solid staff.
good,"pretty good place but does not offer many hours."
good,It wasn't too bad. Needs a better work environment. The management was okay and the workers weren't too bad but the overall environment was bad
good,"Manage and execute store operation duties including corporate plans and initiatives, daily execution duties, and customer service through leading a team."
good,Company was ok to work for did have numerous management changes.Day to day operations were tough at times due to a tight payroll budget.
good,"Good compensation and benefits.  Had some great managers and some not-so-great managers.  Job culture is good, small store teams, co-workers are like family"
good,"Always have something to do."
good,"There is always something happening within the general office; with software training classes, volunteer opportunities, on-site health club with a salaried trainer, breakfast and lunch provided daily in the cafe, and team development exercises. Friendliness is strongly encouraged by the CEO, with his hands-on dedication to employee enrichment and happiness."
good,The employees were fun to work with. The atmosphere was a place that I could come to and eat pizza. I enjoyed some of my managers. I was rewarded for my hard work.
good,"My typical one day a week work day was productive and repetitive, i didnt learn anything, management communication with employees needs work, my co-workers were always nice and helpful."
good,Great place to gain experience as a warehouse associate. i loved that most of the staff were young and enthusiastic about the job
good,"unload trucks, replenish the store help costumers."
good,I have enjoyed working for Big Lots overall. I have learned alot. It's steady paced and has a lot of long time employees in their stores.
good,"Typically work is busy with conversing with dozens of people daily. The hardest part about working here is dealing with people not willing to work with you, but I always get the job done and usually everyone is happy in the end, depending on the type of person."
good,"Having to labeling merchandise place on conveyor belt ,to be shipped out ,having to lift 50 to 75 pounds ,to heavy to pick at times .lifting air conditioners ,heavy tables and more."
good,"Pay is a little low, less intensive demands from upper management"
good,"It was nice working there, I have no complaints. They were always upbeat and nice. Great managers and fellow employees."
good,I started off as cashier only then i started doing recovery and now i do alot of stocking now. The co workers and customers here are very friendly. The two things about this job i cant deal with anymore is the low hours and the rude manager.
good,"Working at Big Lots was OKAY. I loved that I was able to communicate with the customers and make them laugh as well as help them with whatever they needed help with. My coworkers were great as well. I think the most difficult part of my job was being basically the only one unloading the truck every Monday but I didn't really mind it. What I didn't like about the job was that I was recognized as their best worker but there was many weeks where I only got a little bit of hours, lower than 20. And then when I did have to come in, it was at unreasonable times. For example I'd get off work at 11 at night and I would have to come right back in for 3 or 4 am. Horrible."
good,Flexible schedules and reasonable compensation. Management is relatively easy to talk too
good,"My experience with Big Lots has been overall well. It is a ""laid back"" company as far as being able to share your ideas and change the things that you think could impact your store. However, the ideas that you do have that go in affect, go unnoticed even when they show success. "
good,"A typical day for me would be me asking my manager for my task, work on my task, help out on cashier, sell furniture, assist customers in anything they may need, and help in any other task necessary."
good,"Everyday I would work an 8 hour shift and for about half of that shift I would be at the Registers as the Cashier."
good,Provides a great opportunity for young people. It was a good opportunity to develop communication and customer services skills being in a retail environment.
good,"I would begin my day at 1am, I would not get off until 10am. I would unload trucks, price tag items and shelve them. the team was great..hours were amazing, the work made the time pass by, although the management was awful. my employer had no idea what needed to be done"
good,The work at big lots was like a normal retail store. the co workers are all great and the management is a group of well rounded individuals who know what they are doing
good,"typical day- plan, customer service, balancing, receiving, etc"
good,A typical day started around 3:30am and ended at 12:00pm. The job mostly consisted of unloading a truck monday morning. The trucks required us to stack boxes on a line and then proceed to take those boxes to pallets and properly stack the pallets. Then we would take the pallets to the sales floor using pallet jacks. Finally we would stock the products. The mangers weren't the best they could've shown workers more respect. The co-workers were a great group of people. The hardest part was staying awake at the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part was the physical labor.
good,"I enjoyed working at this company but not enough hours"
good,Everyday was a challenge never proper management staff.  In a low income area.
good,You have to kiss behind to move up and get hours but overall a nice environment to work in.
good,What I didn't like about the job is that they said union free and you can come talk anytime you want to but everyone in the warehouse knew about it.
good,"Very laid back job, great customers and employees. Fun advertisements. Managers were very understanding."
good,"As a manager of Big Lots one of the biggest responsibilities is making sure that our associates as well as our customers new of the values of the products that we were offered and that we were not just an outlet, but that we offered quality items. One of the biggest obstacles that we had is that we received different merchandise on our truck on a weekly basis which means constant training of new products. The best part of my time working is when customers understand the value in which we offer. "
good,the most difficult part of this job is to not be with family on  hoildays
good,"My typical day at work was mostly stocking the store. I unloaded a truck every monday. I was also a part time cashier."
good,"A typical day at work involves performing miscellaneous tasks that need to be done around the store, including stocking and moving merchandise, assembling display furniture, and assisting customers with their items. I learned that making mistakes is okay as long as you learn from them and understand why they happened so you can avoid them in the future. The management is supportive, understanding, and helpful, as were the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to sudden changes from day shifts to night shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they were looking for and seeing them leave happy. "
good,The company in a whole was great! I enjoyed all the time that I worked there. You have to be willing to put yourself out there and work extra hard. The stress and long hours for the little amount of pay is why I made the change.
good,"i clock in, talk to see who is working at the moment, get to work, help costumers, help the register when needed, help assosiates when needed, not many hard things with this job"
good,"A typical day at work included opening up the furniture department. I would then do any assigned work like putting furniture together for display. I would help customers, answering questions, doing sales, writing up orders, running the customer's information for credit, calling other stores, and ringing up purchases."
good,gd place for a part time.. frist gd job expirence frist wearehosue expirence unloading comtainers
good,work together.talk to managment.get along with pires.always had easy job.
good,"It's an alright first job to anyone looking for quick employment. You'll get paid for what the job is worth, minimal wage."
good,a tipical day at work would be just to walk the floors and keep the store neat as possible as well as help customers with questions they may have. management was good they would have at least one manger on the floor and one in the back. and my co-workers were great they were very friendly and helpful when i needed help. they hardest part of the job was recovering the store on time. and the most enjoyable time was just talking with co-workers during breaks.
good,"My Day started at 8:00 at in the morning and usually ended around 5:30-6:00. what i learned is to be patient with customer and with the currency your counting in the drawers. have a very good relationship with your fellow employers, cause team work is definitely key. The hardest part sometimes can be the customer or when your employee cash register comes short and unloading the truck in the warehouse by yourself or with little help at all. But the good thing about being the job is meeting some very interesting people."
good,"My day of work was to stock shelves all day long, I liked my boss, he was cool all the time. The co-workers were the best women in this side of town, hard working women. The best part was when I won a $100 on the second week of working their."
good,"Handled returns, exchanges, refunds, complaints, issues."
good,need to be on top of your retail game for success. the store is continually changing for the sales and holidays. freight is handled daily and must be completely stocked for customers
good,If I had an issue it's not feeling appreciated especially when I go the extra mile. I dont need my manager to overly praise me but some praise would be nice.
good,"A typical day consists of lots of customer service, ranging from finding a specific item, to finding the right piece of furniture for the customer, or even just helping the customer with a question about some merchandise. "
good,"Big lots are a changing and growing company. I think it works their employees a little to hard and they have too many changes going all at once. Overall, Big lots is good company just needs to train employees better to help them succeed."
good,My managers were very kind and offered flexibility with my schedule on certain important events or sick days. Offered advancement after 6 months of working there.
good,"A good job enviorment to grow, easy learning and flexible scheduling. Staff was very nice and some managers were very nice. Hours are flexible and good discounts and fun work environment."
good,"Good if youre starting to look for retail jobs. Nice staff, nice customers. Hectic when youre a cashier as lines get long sometimes. Days move fast since many people visit the store."
good,"Answer phone, offer credit card, officer rewards cards. "
good,The money is decent but the managers made working there very stressful at times. A couple of the managers would also make you feel awful if you were sick and couldn't make it to work.
good,"Big Lots was a great place to work, I was happy there for a long time, however I was laid off in April with 67 other employees in order to cut costs. Very friendly environment."
good,"It was a fairly decent place to work at. I was never idle since there was so much to do in the store. Management and staff was friendly. Overall though, it was a stepping stone for me until I moved on."
good,Ok place to work. Good discount . I no longer work there and if I wanted to leave big lots a review I would go to there customer service web site. please let me finish my new application
good,I was associate stocker and it was kinda boring and slow. I didn’t really work that much because i can tell people are being favoritisms. I enjoyed working as stocker because it is easy for me. I love organizing and clean up
good,I worked as a furniture rep so a typical day is cleaning when opening making sure all pamphlets and advertising for the month is out. Talk to customers about are leasing and tell them in detail about the product. I would build displays and do holds for customers over the phone. I learned a lot about marketing myself and being able to know the product and depending on the customers needs. Workplace was great besides I got no help when it came to moving furniture and ended up pulling my back. The hardest part of the job was knowing the product before it came in. I loved that I made a lot of friends there.
good,"Low staff lead to heavy work loads and multiple store manangers within a short period of time made for confusion and again extra heavy work loads.  This used to be a fun place to work, now it isn't."
good,"This was a job in college for me, it served its purpose. It wouldn't pay my bills at the wage I was being paid but if you don't need a lot of money its a decent job."
good,slightly mundane but a fun group of employees and an excellent core of managers especially the General Manager. If you want to advance you have to be dedicated
good,"False advertising on incentitive program, not accurate. No guidelines for stock drivers. People I worked with were great. Equipment was always up to standards."
good,Unloading truck stocking shelves opening and closing the store when needed stocking the shelves when needed assembling products that needed assembled counting cash drawers and making bank runs.
good,"walk in an start working, running cash register meeting and greeting people as they walk in. without friendly customer service you dont have a business. every day if you need anything the management was always there to help. very friendly, very nice people to work around, once a week the truck would show up at 4 am an it would need to be unloaded. around christmas when all the decorations are going out or being on the floor helping others is a great time of the day an year."
good,"Fast Speed"
good,Not very high pay or advancement opportunity. Mostly sat behind the register for my 5 to 6 hour shifts. Management was very friendly and understanding but didn't offer much of an advancement to most employees.
good,It would of been fine If I was getting paid more the managers get all the hours while the rest wrk 20 or less and it's not fair we have 4 managers and they so unorganized
good,Good customer service   Employees work together and in timely manner   Management held meetings to know what was priority for the day. Merchandise arrived on the floor quickly schedule was adjusted to meet these needs.
good,"A typical day at work would involve working early mornings, or overnight to unload and stock freight.  I learned that there were more competitive positions available in the workforce.  Initially, poor management was in place and the workplace environment was very lax.  The hardest part of the job was the overnights.  The most enjoyable part was the people."
good,Management is okay and the staff is great to work with. There are alot of work on freight and alot of stock to work with on shelf aisles. The meetings are fun and there's alot of teamwork.
good,Great place to work very friendly staff and always something to do. As a salesman I was consistently working with customers talking to them and working with them to insure they leave satisfied.
good,"It's a part time job at a low-tier store, you get about what you would expect. Constantly rotating team of coworkers, stressed out management, hardly any hours, and hasty on the job training. Though there is the perk of employee discounts, which is nice since big lots has a wide variety of stuff."
good,"Nothing there was really hard, once you receive the proper training. Special sales and holidays are the most energy-draining, due to the volume of customers and, in my experience, the confusion that ensues when people don't get their breaks on time."
good,Its a very productive job that will mentally and physically drain you. You are expected to be their everyday and expected to give100%. You have to take advantage during down time so you can stay ahead
good,Big lots was a good place to work.  We all received benefits and paid time off for vacation.  It would have been nice to get more hours per week to keep up with the demands of daily duties.
good,"I was heavily relied upon to perform multiple task at one time.. Which allowed me to utilize my favorite and best quality; my versatility.  This would prove instrumental in my day to day success. As each day presented its own set of challenges.  Also, the ability to teach and lead others in their development is of particular interest to me.  The ability to complete a task by having a group of individuals all on the same page with one singular goal in my mind is one of  my proudest accomplishments."
good,I enjoyed directing customers and telling them our prices and cashiering and bagging up their items knowing they were satisfied and receiving points every time they purchased something. I loved the holiday times all the different types of merchandise we would get whether it was furniture or gifts for a Birthday party I enjoyed a day at work putting Items back that customers didn't want because I would usually buy them for myself
good,Busy and fast i've learn alot from the the MOD their hard working people always there to help out when you need nothing is hard to just got to set your mind to it.
good,a ok place to work a lot of heavy lifting vey hard on the body.  expected to keep up with fast pace. pays well  nice employee discount management ok to work with
good,This was a good place to work not only was it a good time it was also a very busy place to work so your work day would go by very quickly the customer's there were very awesome and so nice
good,My Experience at Big Lots was actually not that bad at all there's always work to do so you'll rarely if ever get bored the employees there were always willing to help you in time of need management would also be helpful or more than willing to take the time out of their busy schedule to lend a hand or show you something that you didn't understand. Though at times I will say that management wasn't always the most understanding when it came down to calling out for whatever the case maybe big or small.
good,i would help the customers with any thing that they needed. I would treat them with respect and kindness. I always greeted the customers with a smile.
good,Very flexible work schedule built around gaining the most out of your employment. Lead management is very helpful and intuitive whilst management may leave more to be desired. Physical labor is relatively demanding in order to stock merchandise and possible furniture. Great for those looking for their first job or if they seek a routine withe ease.
good,I worked as a sales person and then moved up to furniture manager .I was told I would have help in furniture and am the only one over there was told I would have one weekend a month off and don't get it my raises are 20 cents a year and more to handle
good,I loved big lots and everyone that was there with me. They welcomed me in like a family.  I miss them so much.  Everyone got along just fine.
good,"Few hours and low wage, but is really nice and peaceful place to work. scheduling is a disaster though. you dont find out about next weeks schedule until the day before the next cycle."
good,"A typical day at Big Lots is a goal for the day, be reminded to greet the customer at the door. Through out the day it stay steady and pick up in spurts. You constantly helping customer out. It can be from checking a price on a product to help load a product into their car. Most of the employees really come together, which make a world of a different."
good,"I feel as thu schedules could have been done better than they where, there was to many changes every week. The restrooms was not up to standards the smell bad. Just could no longer work there."
good,"I have learned to be friendly with customer and greet them in professional way. Also, learned to answer phone and transfer the customer to a different department."
good,"I liked the job, but some of the management could have done their job better they also needed more help on days we got busy and the management should have kept an eye on some of the Employees with cell phone use and not just pick on 1 person"
good,"A typical day at Biglots Store is busy and fast pace. I learned that customers are first and how to greet them in a more friendly and professional manner. Management can be friendly, but also stern and persistence in making sure that their orders or demands are carried out. My co-workers at Biglots are helpful in assisting others when needed and in working as a team. The hardest or most stressful part of the job is when you are working with a customer and run into a situation and there are other customers waiting in your line. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I've done something to help someone else, and the boss tells me at the end of the day that I have done a great job!"
good,unload the truck then sort the product then proceed to stock it out on the sales floor. Assist in customers questions and break down boxes as you go.
good,Good job overall but not really good at working around employees work schedule all the time. Coworkers were very nice and fun to be around though.
good,Great place to work if they would give you more than 5 to 10 hours a week to work. Management is made up of great people its just you don't get to work enough to make it week to week
good,"The people at Big Lots are really nice, especially the management. But, they tend to understaff when it comes to registers so it can get pretty stressful during busy times. I personally prefer stocking shelves and ticketing items, but when I'm stuck on register all day it can be pretty tedious, boring, and/or stressful. The best part about Big Lots is they let you set your own availability which you can change at any time. The bad part of this system is the computer generates your schedule a week at a time, so you only know your schedule one week ahead of time. The number of hours you get each week also changes."
good,active and fun place to work. On a regular night i would stock shelves and at the shifts end we all would clean the store for opening time and the beginning of another shift.
good,"I enjoy the part time hours with this company. Loading and Unloading trucks, Putting items out on shelves, stocking and Customer Service. It gives you good work out during your time at work. I really wish they would offer more pay though. They don't hardly pay you that much to work per hour, but if you look at the job as a work out and something that keeps you busy, it turns out well. Helping customers is always fun to do as it keeps you social and interactive."
good,I would work the register and help customers and after hours I would recover the store. The managers where wonderful and pretty good with the employees.
good,"i feel Big lots has a good and work environment.,i learned that if you apply yourself well enough. that you can be part of a great team."
good,You meet different types of people which is very challenging and sometimes fun. Things would be better if there were team playing.
good,"I came in and left. A typical day was that."
good,Working at this company made me feel that we have to but some effort towards our merchandise export import business. Bringing in better product and selling them at a low price can benefit the company in some ways.
good,"was given my duties to start day and when completed was given new."
good,No protection of associates Customers can violate you and you will be punished for confrontational ways to avoid a instance.
good,"•management was awesome I liked how they ran the place."
good,"It is a nice company to work with I was a Temp to Hire to be paid more once hired on full-time. I worked in Coperate, Customer Service taking calls. It was hard to have people yell at you at least once a day , but that is any call center. "
good,Big Lots is a friendly place to work with diverse customers to help. Management has always been available to help. Flexibluty with work schedule and hours.
good,"Greeting customers. Putting back store items in the correct spot. Providing customers with assistance when ever needed. Stocking shelves. Giving customers refunds from returned items, and answering calls. I had very easy going management, but they were also on top of things and very organized. All my co-workers worked together in harmony. My job wasn't hard. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with customers and closing up the store."
good,not the greatest company to work for. Unsure of direction company is going
good,"Stock Clerk, Cashier or Checker"
good,i was a customer associate and furniture assembler. i worked the cash register and loaded and unloaded furniture
good,"A typical day can either be a slow one or fast pace setting. I come across many of customers. Being a customer at other stores, I place myself in their shoes often. Working in ""higher priced department"", I believe in being an honest salesman by letting the customers aware of future promotions or deals so he or she can save more money and continue shopping at my store. The whole day must be worked at a fast pace, making sure that all of your task are completed. The most enjoyable part of my job is finding stumbling across old familiar faces (people I've gone to school with) and reoccurring satisfied customers. My co-workers are amazing, it's important to have a good healthy relationship with these people in spite of our different background because ultimately you're going to see these people more than your friends and family."
good,Good people. The benefits were good. Great stability. I love that job.
good,Pretty Good... Manager doing good job and lot thing work hard
good,Gave me part time job when I needed it the most I have learn so much about retail that it will be a valuable in future
good,"Helped Customers locate Store Items, Management Adequate, Co-workers were Team Players, Hardest Part for me was my Transportation ,Enjoyed Helping Customers"
good,"I was in charge of scheduling, also recieved, stocked, helped and checked out customers. Good place to work, position needed to be paid more."
good,"A tycal work day for me is, Opening the store, first thing in the morning counting the safe and deposit from the night before.Reading any emails sent from the District MAnager or Corprate.Then walking the store and making sure the manager that closed has the store neat and clean.After then offically opening the doors I look at what needs to be done for the day and give my employees their list of things to accomplish. All while running the everyday things."
good,never had a set place to be was hired as cashier but still manged to do everyone elses jobs...but i loved the cashiering part of it. managers were never on the same pages with each other its like they nevered talk to each other. but everyone i worked with was very nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job was never getting off when suppost to. i loved meeting new people and exciting new things everyday.
good,Big lots management needs more training Big lot management supervisor need more training they are slow to attend to help others in the store they sit back and look and will call for assistance with a lure case employee instead of helping the guest or customer
good,It's pretty laid back they only put pressure on you to make numbers if your slacking off. Pay is alright co workers are great easy to get along with and donate the supervisors
good,"A standard Retail position, just like any other. The only hire part time so hours fluctuated from week to week, usually around 20 but sometimes no more"
good,"I enjoyed enough freedom to do what i felt was right. From helping customers to arranging back stock room. I had daily goals. Supportive management. "
good,Its a good place just lack of hours. They work with you day wise the managers are cool and nice. They help allot man they are cool people and communicate well most times.
good,"I learned new skills, such as customer service cashier."
good,Big Lots has its moments where you love working there. The people are nice & fun to work with & so are the managers. The downfall is corporate likes to lower the pay when they feel we’re not working hard enough to get the store to meet its goal. Also the district manager will only speak to certain employees & ignore the others or new ones. If you’re on truck it must be done the day you start it within 3 hours or less. If your cashier then you must get a lot of rewards cards or they’ll keep bothering you about it unless you’re just really bad then they’ll take you off to stock only..
good,I really liked working there i got to learn different things like cashier and stocking shelves the employees were nice the pay was good the hours were good i got to work days more then nights it was close by to where i lived
good,"It’s a great place to work because of the coworkers and the atmosphere, but the cons start to outweigh that. Work days are short usually only 4-6 hours and not many hours weekly. Often understaffed but won’t give more hours. If you do not have open availability this is most likely not for you as you get barely 8-12 hours a week if needing particular hours (1st, 2nd). Discount is very nice along with being able to request off almost anytime you want."
good,"If you work hard and are reliable you can get promoted however once you get to salary, they work you to death. The reason being they were habitually under staffed.They did however pay pretty well."
good,It is a easy place to work. If you do your job well you will get hours. Breaks and lunch are fair. They do not like to do set schedules. Good part time job or second job.
good,"As a cashier I learned to develop social skills, problem solving and even teamwork and those are qualities that I gained while working at my first job as a cashier for big lots that I can always use for my future jobs and other areas I'm my life."
good,It was great experience for some looking for partime.The hours was one of the reasons why I left didn’t make enough money. I’m looking for something full time with great pay and time off.
good,Overall I had a great manager and awesome supervisor and I liked the people I was working with. The job was really stressful though especially since it was my first job and I was still in high school at the time.
good,"This is a good place to work, although sometimes you’re left with the bulk of the work load. The people are friendly, there is always something to do."
good,"A typical day at big lots would be me checking customers out at the register, constant face-to-face interaction with people. Recovering items on the sales floor less than five feet away from the register. Cleaning and dusting items. I learned how to attempt to figure out problems when the managers were unavailable and problem solve. Management was typically reasonable but a few of them were lazy. Everyone was pretty friendly but there were a few people that were not kind like most customer service-oriented places. The hardest part of the job was pushing through the way while having to stand the entire day and remain kind to customers while being tired. Most enjoyable time on the job was getting to interact with customers who were friendly."
good,In my time of working there all of the manager was amazing and nice and understading i would go back in a heart beat. I have never had an issue with any of the workers. Everyone is very friendly.
good,Big lots is a good job for college students looking for a little extra money or someone looking for an extra job. The managers are nice and easy to get along with. Just about everyone that works there is nice. The weekends are usually busiest. The hardest part about working here is the customers and how they are handled. Policy doesn't allow the managers/workers treat customers how they should (denying returns without a receipt).
good,The job was fun during peak season but got boring afterwards. The managers were easy to get along with. liked dealing with the customers but did not like stocking the shelves.
good,"Typically they had me working ever now and then, Mostly never worked, was only paid 7.25 an hour weekly. The management was wonderful and understanding of issues i have had."
good,Big lots was a fun place to work. All employees were pleasant. Some issues w management. Otherwise a great pplace to work. Employee discount s where a big help with holidays and personal use.
good,"Not a terrible place to work at "
good,The job was fun at times and stressful at others. Management never seemed to be in sync with each other and would have different ways of doing nearly everything.
good,It was an ok job but when they try to get rid of you they put you somewhere and don't help you in anything or assist in the customers.
good,A typical day at work for Big Lots was busy. My areas always needed recovered and reorganized. I learned how to read and st POG's. There was nothing hard about the job.The most enjoyable part was working by myself and at my own pace & knowing I only have to deal with working but only a few hours.
good,"The people were easy to work with, easy to get along with."
good,"Only worked there for a few months, it was terrible. New management took over and they had no management experience. They were rude to customers and staff. They ship off employees to different stores whenever they feel like it."
good,"Regardless of the hours I had acquired at that workplace, I enjoyed the interactions I had with my fellow employees. Everyone there was understanding and flexible and taught me new ways to do my job properly, especially when they asked me to work the truck and unload boxes of products. There were a few bumps in the workplace like the healthcare plans I was ineligible for as I already work with Blue Cross/Anthem as well as suddenly working early morning hours instead of the evening. Otherwise, it was pretty good working there and the managers were pleasant to work with overall."
good,"It's a fun place to work most of the time.  The staff and management are friendly and easy to get along with.  However, the type of customer (sloppy and prone to shoplifting) and the lack of proper management made it somewhat unpleasant."
good,"Reputable company,great pay, rewarding work but the hours were intense. Expectaions for store operations often did not align with staff hours authorized by home office."
good,As a supervisor at Big Lots distribution center I focused on increasing production and maximizing overall warehouse efficiency Being a hands on supervisor I worked all departments drove all equipment.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I had moved so I had stop working with this company.
good,Overall good job unexpected hours but compensated with great benefits.
good,"Customer service (i.e. cashiering, furniture sales, ect.) was the main part of the job. My co-workers were vey hardworking. i love working with the public so retail fit me well. My biggest complaint was that we were understaffed. This made it difficult for everyone to complete all tasks required by management."
good,the management and employees at Big Lots were one of the best teams I have worked with.  The management was always willing to work around my schedule and were understanding if anyone made mistakes.  all of my co workers were always friendly and happy to see me when I came in to work.  the only thing that was negative about this job was the fact that we had to close our dorrs soon after opening.
good,"not a bad company to work for.  typical grocery retail.  you're pushing carts, cleaning, working the registers helping customers working as a team, not a bad environment at all.  pay isn't so great but if you are the type of person that wants to advance in retail then it's for you"
good,"Working at Big Lots is ok but you need to be very patient if you want to grow within the company.  You have to be very motivated to work each day because its a lot of physical work regardless of the position you are in, which is what I liked the most from working there."
good,Worked for the company for 3 years. Enjoyed myself until I was asked to transfer to a new store as a promotion. The new management (from circuit city) was not very professional.
good,Best part: flexibility in merchandising
good,"a typica day would be covering the furniture dept. interacting with the customer, building repor, and helping to ultimately helping them with thier furniture purchase. the co workers for the most part were great and fun to work with. management at times seemed as if they steered of course as to what really mattered. (sales) the hardest part of my job was tryin to invent new and fresh ways to make our furniture dept. pop and look new to the buyer. the most enjoyable part of my job by far was getting to interact with all the customers."
good,The store runs great but the district manager is very hard on us. The corporation expects me to work full time and go to school full time in order to qualify for tuition reimbursement. Company cares more about reward sign ups than profit.
good,"Typical retail employment but on a slightly smaller scale. The thing about smaller scale means that employees do more. Myself and many others I started with could do every job in the store. We weren't paid like we could though. I could do everything in the warehouse, sales floor, front end. This was mostly because of the store manager who trained me. The work wasn't hard but got pretty demanding at times. Like being the only cashier for the whole morning shift Saturday morning during tax return weekend. I virtually couldn't get fired even though my store had a very high turn over rate. That also meant that people who should have been fired got to stay and force good employees out. Myself included. Corporate hypocrisy is another reason I left. I wasn't allowed to help customers when it came to refunds and exchanges, but was embarrassed time and again while upholding store policy. I couldn't exchange a doll for a grandmother who accidentally bought the wrong one. She had no receipt. We were made by corporate to give store credit to a guy with a six year old sleeping bag the my particular store never even carried. Because he complained to the right people. All other facets of work totally depend on management and coworkers. I had some of the best."
good,"A typical day at work involved me cleaning, stocking, cashier and anything else that needed to be done. I learned patience is key to a productive day at work. My co-workers would say that I am very dependable and helpful. The hardest part of the job was the early morning shifts from 3 am to 9 am for stocking. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to go home after my shift. They paid very little and I could not pay house hold bills."
good,not paid enough for the work required.some co-workers took too many breaks. as cashier you were lucky to get a break
good,"A typical day is driving sales, profit and ensuring associates are performing to the companies expectations."
good,"Begin by clocking in, talking to the supervisor on the floor and ask where they wanted me that shift. I would then proceed to either re-stocking shelves, or opening a drawer. I learned how to juggle cleaning around the cashier while working during peak times. I didn't really get to speak to management, but when I did, she wouldn't make things very comfortable and hardly reinforced positive behaviors. My co-workers were amazing, very warm and accepting and definitely helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with impatient customers since it was during peak season. However, the most enjoyable was seeing the ""regulars"" and creating a one-on-one relationship with them, getting to know them."
good,It was an ok job not overall the best but it was good . I preferred better scheduling and hours for the pay they gave. But it had good employees and management.
good,Its good but its not. It has a good atmosphere but the work and hours are a negative. the management at our location is stellar but the hours that they give non management employees is minimum.
good,"While working there the manager was nice and understanding, the co-workers was fun to work with, always had fun there every time I went to work. Always helped each other when needed."
good,"*Hours: 20 to 30 a week"
good,I loved working here that’s why I’m trying to get back in there cause some of my old friends are still working there and want me to come back so as well as my old manager
good,"I believe working at Big Lots was a learning experience trying to figure out where everything goes when , I was stocking the shelves.As I started working , I had intensity to helped other people out on unloading the trucks,and getting their job done.I loved everything about the job,and I was so happy I hung in there for 7 years."
good,"Working here was only part time for me, the management is amazing if you ever needed more hours they helped you out but not really much advancement you can do here. There is no raises."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo pero poca paga, en realidad las mismas tareas que desempeño en Walmart, excepto la remodelacion"
good,Teamwork atmosphere was good.  Timely freight processing was the main goal everyday.  Always lots to do but it was relaxed.  Great bargains for the customer.
good,what i learn at this work place was how to stock properly i learn how to carry out furniture the hardest part of the job was when the truck would come in to leave merchandise. To me there was nothing enjoyable about it.
good,Was a great place and alot of great people working there only problem was the long hours other then that they pay great and seem to care about the people who work for them
good,"Good company, however their policies were very strict, did not have a good work and family lifestyle balance. I enjoyed working with the customers, and there were friendly"
good,This store has it all electronics and food. Everything in the store is for cheep. You should always shop here. They also hsve furniture. This store is the best place to be
good,"My typical day is unloading a semi truck and stocking merchandise."
good,Store Management is the best I have encountered in retail.  It was a very laid-back approach to retail while still being productive.
good,"The best part of being a employee at Big Lots is being your own manager, I typically came in and do what was needed to be done. I kept my area cleaned and organized. Enjoyed serating and Organizing merchandise"
good,"I spent nearly 2 years at Big Lots from the time that I was 17 and still in high school until I finished my first semester of college. I then moved on to another job and double the pay. It was a no brainier!"
good,On a typical day I do paperwork whether it was inputting recievers and returns to processing payroll to making out monthly management schedules and weekly employess schedules. Then I would bank all registers and open the store with day to day customer service. I would unload merchandise trucks whether it be regular frieght to unloading furniture trucks i.e. mattress or upholdstery trucks. I would remerchandise the sales floor to best impact the business. I loved my co-workers and treated everyone equally. I was very tactful but made the job fun and interesting.
good,Working with the public is an awarding adventure to those who like to serve others
good,I Hated management they drew on the work schedule like it was a coloring book. Employees were not friendly and sexist.
good,"I worked different hours, sometimes a lot of hours and then sometimes a few, and worked over when needed and even worked when others called in sick. I worked where ever management needed me, costumer service main focus, cashier, stocking merchandise and cleaning. I worked with a lot of different people here their was a big turn over at this store."
good,i would work for this company in the near furture.it was a good company to work for and great people
good,"The company has initiated a program to improve and change the overall image of the Stores. There were many good changes, however, the old management cultures of the past still remained with some of the District Leaders. They never truly embraced the Company's initiative in improving the overall culture of the company."
good,Good part time job. Being paid weekly is nice. Very willing to work with you on making your hours work with your schedule. Pay pretty low. Atmosphere is friendly and relaxed.
good,"typical day here starts at 4 AM to unload the truck and stock the shelves. registers are assigned and opened, and doors are open"
good,"I have worked at Big Lots for about 2 months now and I have to say the management is excellent! The nature of the work is repetitive enough that is easy to learn for beginners, but maybe a little too repetitive for those that have more experience under their belt and want more engagement out of their work. That is, unless, you work in the furniture department, because then there is a lot to learn. Big Lots pays weekly which is great for cash flow, but at $8.25/ hour and with the fact that only managers get full time consistently, while associates average 22ish..the pay is simply not very good. Great company culture, a lot of fun, but as a 23 year old with expenses, it's time to get a second job!"
good,"Not really a good start because of its low pay, but its a relaxed environment. This job requires loyalty, and in my experience it was a lovely environment with characters i grew close to. The money is why i left, though."
good,"Get there log in start work"
good,I enjoy my jobs . Work Hard and don't let no one tell that you can't. Overall my job was very  back broking work .  You need to be strong to mover furniture around  everyday. People thought I can't do it but I did
good,"Work schedule can be insane, as you find out your schedule for the next week starting Sunday on Saturday night. You always need to be available."
good,"Big Lots keeps on moving forward with great planning. They have a great upper management that leads by example. "
good,"I was responsible for zoning the Decor section 6 rows, Rug Wall, Toys 2 rows, Apparal 1 row, Garden area 2 rows, and HBC 1 row. Large amount of work only having 5 hours to complete 2/3 of the store at the same time assisting the register. Learned how to manage time and move quickly at the same time giving great quality with out errors. "
good,Well it was my first actual job so I had to learn a lot when it comes to work ethics. The other co-workers were very nice and patient. when something wasn't working like lifting very heavy furniture they put me into another department. Great pay but not many hours at all. management was not very good but not very bad just in the middle.
good,I enjoyed going to work very much. I had to relocate which left me not able to work any more. In the mornings unloading the truck was fun. We worked on timed. Which made it more exciting.
good,I have had shoulder surgery they would not work with my restrictions so I retired from there. Looking for new job that does not have me unload furniture trucks by myself. No safe way of bringing in door without  lowering down to get in door
good,"Typical day included unloading trucks into stockroom, unpacking boxes, sorting items and placing price tags on them, and finally, placing them in the store on the proper shelves. Hardest part of the job was rearranging the shelves as they were very heavy! Best part of my job were the friends and 'family' we had become together. Management was friendly but stern as well, a perfect balance."
good,A typical day  at the warehouse unloading packages while making sure they have the correct count sent out everday for shipment. We also had to keep a total of damage goods.
good,"very nice friendly staff members made work fun and easy, absolutely loved it"
good,"I loved my position at Big Lots, I was always busy, however depending on what dept you are in it could get very boring so a lot of people dont like it unfortunately but as a manager u stay busy at all times!! NEVER a dull moment"
good,"always got something to do no time for sitting around."
good,"Usually only like to promote men, took some of us 10+ years before becoming management, some managers are just out to get you fired if they don't like you."
good,"clock in get carts ,unload the truck or freight then before the shift was over we help put whatever we can away onto the stores shelfs"
good,"I worked with Big Lots for close to 3 years. I was hired as a cashier, promoted to Lead Support (front-end supervisor) within 6 months and 3 months later promoted to Furniture Sales Lead (furniture manager). I enjoyed every bit of it until a bunch of corporate cuts and changes started happening. We then re-located and upgraded but the structure and organization was treacherous. My opinion stopped mattering and I was forced to do more than just my job every day I worked because corporate became more strict. I had to work through breaks and take late lunches way too often. I enjoyed my work environment and my customers so I stayed until I started being written up for not being able do what everyone wanted me to do all the time and manage my own department."
good,"every other weekend off , everybody got along . the company took care of its employees"
good,i worked mainly on the cash register. helped customers with purchases and the tranfers of money & credit cards. i was asked alot of times to come fill in on my appointed days off. most of the people i worked with didn't like me but i came for the job & not friendships. the hardest part was dealing with nasty co-workers. i loved my customers & when i left there i missed them & the job alot. i still do go shopping there cause of the great bargins i can find for different things i use daily.
good,First job moving to Fayetteville N.C from N.Y. Pay wasnt good but needed something to get on my feet..
good,It was not the best experience managers were stealing from the job they did not have LP and managers and associates were all careless and didn’t take there job serious
good,"the hours are inconsistent, the pressure to sell services to the customers can be tiresome but the other employees can be nice at times and the paid calendar holidays like christmas can be nice and the employee discount is helpful."
good,i had i good experience with big-lots i did not belief that they care about there people. salary manager would work more that 60 hours not because they want to but because they where under staff and manager did not care.
good,"I did cashier, stocking, pricing helped customer's and put things to geather as well. carried their food out to the cars and cleaned up the store and help close in the evening."
good,a cool job for summer youth or for someone who has just retired. pace is very slow then at times you get a very busy rush. truck day is worst day work so hard unloading truck there stocking
good,"Working at Big Lots is okay, the pay sucks for as hard as you work, very short staffed. Co workers are a blast to work with everyone helps each other out like family. Management besides the boss is wonderful they take the time to listen to you if you have questions or need help. Boss dosent really care at all very rude. Hardest part of working there being there working almost everything while being extremely short staffed especially during christmas. Ive learn alot working there customer service and how to use the computers to be a cashier. How business work. I love going to work and seeing the smiles on our customers faces when you talk to them being a cashier. Helping them and see them smile with joy is a reward within itself."
good,"Working at Big Lots was a very fast working environment, I have learned that even when a customer comes at you with attitude about an issue we can always control the outcome by smiling and doing everything to help the customer leave the store in a better mood than when they arrive, Most enjoyable part of the job was getting along so well with most of the co-workers and teaching new employees the right way to do the job, There were also times to have time to work alone stocking merchandise and making my department look great, The hardest part of the job was dealing with the mean customers."
good,great people but there wasnt any advencement at all .but i was happy to be there
good,Management was fair. Worked with a great team members. Unloading trucks was sometimes overwhelming. Restocking was good and sometimes frustrating. When you have to stop and cash-out people. Has great customer experiences.
good,"I worked here last year and was made to feel unwelcome by the peopel I worked with. Other wise a very good COMPANY to work for. Was accused AFTER i left of stealing and was ""banned"" from the property. Funny ive never had a cop talk to me about this nor have I seen paperwork stating i cant be there HMMMM"
good,"poor management The bulk of their work is a fast-growing While this leaves less room for you to influence This is about as legitimate as it gets A lot of people work there  based on three key components! uantity, quality, and recency of reviews and opportunity! Earnings falling, expected to work every weekend, staffing matrix broken, part time/full time ratio 95/5 (1 Salaried Mgr, 2 FT Mgrs {if lucky to be staffed}, 1 Furniture Premadonna/Lead, 1 DTS Lead) everyone else is part time. Call offs- you cover. 3 am alarm calls-you cover. Asst Mgr no shows-you cover. Both Asst Mgrs quit- you guessed it, you cover. 60-90 hour work week, and they have the nerve to write you up for …"
good,"I started out as a recovery person and loved it ,getting to help customers and making the store look nice.I quickly advanced to register and was so good with customers that i moved up to customer service specialist. I love interacting with customers. The hardest part of the job was the late hours an not being able to enjoy holidays."
good,"I helped take the furniture to the customers vehicles, and the most fun I've had on the job was putting the furniture together. Management was alright. the hardest part of the job was when my manager at the time put me on the cash register with no training at all."
good,You did not get enough hours. No chance for advancement (Women were not promoted). There were a lot of split shifts. Not enough hours given to properly do the job. Raised were based on computer evaluations. The most you could get was .20 per year.Business is now closed
good,was close to home but the hoursw varied and you could not make any plans depending on the manager du jour. Very spiteful managers
good,I worked in the store assembling furniture and selling furniture.The job was easy and was inside in the AC.
good,"You're considered just another body. Employees aren't properly trained and most new ones don't ask questions. Some employees just don't care and put the products wherever they see an open spot. They don't rotate the food products and don't check to see if there's overstock on the top shelf. The employees assigned to clean up the store barely do it. We'd be told we need to get the merchandise out faster, but they want us to rotate the food, and since the store hasn't been cleaned up, we need to clean so we can put out the product. Then we get sent so much products and just don't have the space for it. Some employees move super slow while I worked very fast and efficient."
good,Big Lots is not a bad place to work they gave me my first job experience when I didn't have any experience at all. I have been employed there for 7 years but there are no benefits and it was less than 30 hours a week.
good,"When I worked there, pay was minimum wage and that was that. Now, everyone is getting raises. I only know this because I have a family member still working here. You get a 20% off discount in the entire store, too, so that's great."
good,"The job has its perks like the discounts that you get but as far as advancement unless you are good at recovery there is no advancement. Some of the management staff care about the associates. You do get treated like family when you are there I wish there was other ways to advance other than just excelling in one part of the job. I would hope that people would learn more about the easy leasing and the the biglots credit card, but unless you ask management about both you really don't learn about either of them."
good,"While working at Big Lots, I learned the responsibility of having a job. It was my first job, and I tried to work as best as I could. I learned how to work a cashier, how to recover the floor, how to stock merchandise, how to deal with loss prevention and safety in a retail environment."
good,"A typical day at Big Lots is fairly easy, attending to the needs of customers and keeping the store presentable."
good,"Your opportunity for advancement is slim, and sometimes you're toyed around with about said topic."
good,I didnt have any problems there it was a decent place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people
good,I am looking for new employment and hopefully Indeed.com can help me. And I enjoyed working for this company and meeting new people and I love the job
good,"Get the daily tasks and do the assignments. Stock, unload inventory. Palletize make bales of cardboard. Help customers. Pull furniture orders and load furniture to the customers vehicles. Assemble furniture"
good,"Really it depends on the character., if you think you can’t you will not. You have to love people at this level of sales.. any this company relays on repeat business."
good,"I really loved working there. My coworkers were great and we have repeat customers that are great. Management was good but had trouble keeping up with the resets they have to do every week. Our store is a busy one with minimal employees. They hired a new manager who claims she is brash, we call it rude in Texas. She points her finger in your face and yells at you. When she did it to me I turned in my badge. Most of my coworkers are gone as well. Several have called corporate on her, but she is still there. Also I have a full time job. The other managers would work around my schedule. She used the auto scheduler and would not make adjustments for anyone because in her words it would effect her evaluation from upper management. How sad. It is all about her, not us all as a group. IT IS A GROUP EFFORT THAT MAKES A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS, which includes individual lives around it."
good,I enjoy working at big lots. there are a lot of issues currently because of the high turn over and lack of training . several company programs have fallen through the cracks and every one is fairly new. but there are some good people working there and they seem to be trying to get it right.
good,"The Store manager was great, however the assistant managers were hard to get along with. Especially when it came to hours. I would not really recommend working here while attending school. They will schedule you everyday you have no classes. Which conflicted with my study time and homework schedules."
good,"Most retail positions make good entry level jobs, Big Lots is no different. But what makes Big Lots stand out is that it's not a titanic company like Walmart, so the staff is pretty close-knit. You get to know everybody pretty well, and they do treat employees pretty good despite the less than desirable pay."
good,"Good job for younger people to work. Not enough money to raise 3 kids, or a family of 5. Hours varied by week and for me, I needed something more of the same times everyday."
good,No adult if not in management should try to live on the hours and pay offered. Definitely not worth the headache. Management sucks. No open door policy and they expect tou to already know everything vs trying to properly train u to do it right.
good,I enjoy my current employment with Big Lots. It is a friendly and casual place to work. It can be stressful when situations happen but if everyone on the Big Lots team work together it goes smothly.
good,"Big lots is alright, but the pay can be better and they should make sure their employees are getting enough hours to live. Also, they should improve on setting up the schedules around their employees availability."
good,good job  will worj again but more paid and benefits. Big lots is overall a wonderful place to work at and I dont regret it. Need more time to stock and good coworker .
good,"It can be a decent place to work, but you can gain and lose hours on week to week basis."
good,I like looking for Big Lots but my schedule is very open which has to be when you're working for retail companies most days. I love working with the staff that was located we had each other's backs each and every day they change management too often and like to relocate a lot.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but found that the managers had difficulty making schedules and had poor attitudes. Managers were hardly on the sales floor, always in back offices."
good,This company has interesting merchandise.I like working with the customers. The manager is not very good.The pay is good for retail.
good,hard to get full time hours if your looking for full time work. during holidays they give you full weeks but after the holidays they cut your hours substantially.
good,Friendly co workers and managers. Hardest part about working there is not getting paid much. Best thing is employees get 20 percent off.
good,the only reason I gave this job a 4 is because I love my manger she's a very good one and I love what I do there but you will never get anywhere here I had to get another job just to get buy they keep hiring more people when there's not much hours to give and since I been working here I want to say they have hired about 18 people and they quit because they don't give you much hours . Employees come late all the time because they no they are not going to get fired because they have no other employees to work they call me on my days off and days I work to go in and work because people call out. Some of the mangers don't even no what there doing But I have worked at another biglots and it was nothing like this one the other one in the east coast was very good I had way more hours and got paid more then here. I guess it just depends which one you go to
good,"Overall ok employment, as asst manager you are required to work 45 hours weekly however at this location you worked 47-50 and your time will be changed in the payroll  system to only 45 so the store will make payroll with no ot used. In a years time, averaging 2 hours lost per week, thats nearly 3000 dollars that you didnt get paid, but you worked it. I am sure it happens in most locations and a blind eye is turned. I mean its obvious when all the managements time is exactly 45 hours, not even 45.01 Every single week."
good,A typical day would become very tiring after answering to customers and using the cash register at the same time for long periods of time. Also the managers gave me a great deal of jobs to perform and multiple times the tasks would carry over to the next day. The hardest part of my job was closing the store. The part I enjoyed the most was helping other employees because I was a key holder and knew about the system.
good,"I would walk into the building, through a metal detector, and then continue through the building until I reached whatever module I was assigned to. I learned how to use a conveyor belt system. The management was rarely seen, and when it was seen, was not friendly. I never really got to see any of my co-workers while I was working. The hardest part of my job, was working the long hours every day and the weight of the products I was placing on the conveyor belt hurt my back and my knees after only a few hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was break time."
good,"Working there was great at first, but then I started to get treated differently when I was pregnant. it was very hard to get a break and I was stuck standing to hours without any rest. other than that it was decent. definitely a good first job."
good,Day to day jobs & environment was good. Enjoyed co-workers. Not enough hours or support from corporate level management to allow the store to be at the level it should be.
good,Its a good company to work for. Good work experience. good management
good,A typical day at work would be get up at 3am be at work by 4am on thursday setting up our warehouse for truck. Offload our truck and Palletize it in the warehouse being able to keep a good pace at work is important in a warehouse to get the truck done as quickly as possible. The hardest part of my job i would say is finding enough room for all of the merchandise that we have.
good,It was a good job i really enjoyed it untill they changed management
good,Big Lots is not particularly family friendly. The only day the store is closed is Christmas Day. Holiday store hours are 8:00AM -11:00 PM
good,i learned how to write up credit statements.co workers were nice.managers were nice
good,"Most of my day consisted of either being a cashier and ""refacing"" the items on the shelf, or I was stocking during the midnight hours. I enjoyed midnights as it was peaceful and not interrupted- you could grab a pallet of goods that were delivered in the most recent shipment and start ripping apart boxes/reorganizing shelving/ and breaking down boxes at the baler while listening to your music, and not have to worry about someone breathing down your neck wondering what you are doing."
good,"I liked working for big lots, but I wasn't offered full time and the pay rate is really low for the work you do.  The area I worked wasn't the most up to date. A lot of homeless people in the area would vandalize the bathroom and shrink was a huge issue."
good,"I work as a cashier and interacted with customers.  I did resets and restock as needed. It was just a temporary job to help me save money for my vacation."
good,"It’s a good part time job but not something to make a career out of. It’s an easy job, but some days are better than others. Weekly hours will vary depending on the week."
good,The staff and management are friendly and welcoming. The encourage hard work and getting the job done right. They also understand that sometimes people are under the weather. They are also big supporters of those who are trying to obtain higher education.
good,"Big Lots is a great place to get bargains on foods, supplies and houseware. Knowing where everything is located is a great ease to assist customers. Working to stock and keep organized at a fast pace makes the day go fast."
good,"Good for school not for a full time job."
good,Working here gives you a different taste of customer service. I learned a lot of different here. They give you a chance to learn as much as possible if you wanted to further your career in management.
good,"Woke up at 5am got to work at5:45 started woke at 6 then wouldn’t get off till 4-5 usual, I learned how to drive a stand up forklift and I really enjoyed that, that was a lot of fun. Hardest part was waking up at 5"
good,Big lots was a great start to my working career. It gave me some experience of actually being responsible of waking up fore work and getting there on time.
good,Its an ok job. it is only fast paced during the holidays. the customers are usually old and rude. Does not pay enough for a person with bills. people should consider this as a play job.
good,i enjoyed working there overall until my hours were cut for no reason to the point where i was barely making any money at all which forced me to quit.
good,big lots did help me improve my speech and customer care. not that many new people come in the store just the same people so its kinda low on customers
good,"Overall I like Big Lots.  Management, as always, is a challenge.  Apparently you have to be one of the favorite to get regular hours.  I have good attendance, am a good cashier with a register that is always correct, follow company rules, and am a team player, yet management does not manage, has favorites, has rude assistant managers, and I must fight for my hours on a weekly basis.  This job was supposed to be extra but in this economy has become a necessity and a good worker is not an appreciated commodity in this day and age."
good,"This was a very part time, get out of the house job for me when I started. Most of the employees who work there are close to my age group so in that respect I love my job.  After a life change I needed more hours. Some weeks I have more, useually not. Seniority does not matter. This store has gone through many managers, the current one can be friendly to employees. Is friendly to customers, but he is lacking in compassion and respect. You work very hard, but if you do become ill or hurt you are made to feel like you just do not want to work. Your hours are cut until he really needs someone for the busy seasons."
good,Store manager is great. Most other workers are nice and friendly. Hours worked per week vary greatly. Get paid weekly. Get a good discount on everything (excluding dairy).
good,Good first job for teen but... They really don't care about their in employees. They don't have good opportunity. They are nice workers in there... But the drama is really bad in there.
good,Working for Big Lots! really just depends on the manager you are working under. If the manager is promising then the employees work as well as said manager.
good,"This is a pretty laid back job, very easy but the management sucked. None of my managers were on the same page. they would say one thing but do the total opposite. The hours weren't good, it was never consistent. The pay isn't that good either its very low"
good,"Good place to work, good environment however barely any hours to work. Weekly pay but no raise and hardly no opportunity to move up in the company. Good for stay at home mom or someone that's retired"
good,"The managers are always being switched around. They give you nonsense hours, and give the new people more hours. I don't like working there. Its very far from where I live. The typical day at my job is me ringing up people, and sorting throwbacks. The store is always a mess."
good,Our store and one other store in the city were always first and second in our district.  We were always in competition. I loved that. I also enjoyed my job everyday.  There was a huge amount of work to be done and it made my days fly by.  I also respected my store manager.  He was always teaching us how to be better managers.  He respected people who worked hard!!
good,more organization . more benifits . higher pay also some security measures should be taken place there was a lot of robberies and employees were scared in there own work place
good,"great benefits"
good,"Cashier or stock."
good,"I liked most of the people I worked with, friendly customer service but the management was horrible. I was a stocker and they kept changing our shifts so it was hard on your sleep and every day life schedule. You didn't really receive more than 20 hours a week and they had unrealistic numbers for dock to stock at that location."
good,I loved working here and the employees made it better. Customers need to realize the cashier has no say in price or what the computer does.  Customers are rude and they have actually defecated outside bathroom.Stealing is a big thing but they can't do anything about it.
good,",when i was working with big lots.I knew how to work in group,I learnt how to sell the products.Generally I work in night shift in big lots, Which is hardest part of my job because in the evening shift I have to handle different types of customer."
good,"I really don't much to say about big lots, its was a okay job. I only enjoyed doing duties that didn't have me associating with customers. I enjoyed mainly unstocking and stocking the truck with goods from the store then after receiving the goods from the truck. I'd like to restock the shelves keeping it nice and organized. But as a associate I worked in every area. Cashier was not my favorite, it was a very stressful task. Its easy I admit, its just the customers. But I will say this I had a bad experience but its a great place to work at. Everyone's experience is different, so to anyone who gets the job do your best."
good,Great for felxabuilty on scheduling but no advancement opportunity in this work place.Some staff is favored more than others so they get more hrs instead of all employes getting equal treatment.
good,It was ok I just wasn't for me I love the people there nice but it was the hours that they give you its bad I can work 20 hours and only get 100 bucks
good,"I have a good time at work. Calm, some days like any job it gets extremely busy, but that doesn't bother me. Just wish the promote employees like they used to a couple years ago . the most enjoyably part of my day when im working is getting to physically stock merchandise, I do not like to stand in one place unless I have too."
good,"working in retail is challenging, having to deal with the day to day customer, management and changing environment presented a lot of challenges that you had to face."
good,"While working here you have to be able to load and unload trucks, stock, move furniture, and work a cash register. The people that I worked with were amazing and made the work day more fun."
good,clock in and straight to work. if there's a truck to be unloaded or freight that has to be stocked. customers are great and friendly. management are very tough.
good,"Big Lots is a fun place to work. Busy, busy place to work at. Getting experience with customers, stocking, freight, and customer service. Just not enough hours to survive on."
good,Helping all customers find what they need no matter if it's from this store or other BIG LOT stores that are just a phone call away. A smiling customer is a plus in My book. I learned I was great at multi-tasking and didn't realize it until working here. Management was pretty  fun to work with. I had some great co-workers; even a few that left. The hardest part of the job was being confined to the customer service desk when having to go to the restroom. I enjoyed every part of the job.
good,"Good part time job for pocket money. Overall pay wasn't great. The hardest part would have to be unloading the truck and getting everything on the correct pallet. I did enjoyed meeting new people, and the managers  were very nice and cooperative."
good,"Dealing with high volumes of customers solo, Learned how to be quick with scanning and getting customers in and out effectively. Management was constantly changing, no job security or advancement within company. Great learn as you go environment."
good,It was fun to work here during seasonal.. The managers were very helpful and hard working.. Hardest part of this job was unloading the truck.. Enjoyable part was putting everything out on the floor for customers to buy..
good,"co-workers are enjoyable and fun to work with"
good,it was a good place to work  just do my work and everyone does theres
good,"It was a pleasure to work for Big Lots, they strive for customer satisfaction and a clean, safe, store environment.  I gained administrative duties' experience as I worked closely with the manager and assistant manager and successfully mastered tasks I had never performed before."
good,"Well we started with just and open store nothing in it we received the shelves and assembled them, then came the freight sometimes two to three trucks a day , we unloaded them ,then stocked the shelves . I learned all about setting up a store for business . The management was very helpful and knowledgable . my co workers were a very great group to work with . The hardest part about the job was finding furniture orders  for customers . The whole expierence setting up the store before we opened and the grand opening was the most enjoyable ."
good,"My favorite part of this job was unloading trucks with a team of workers that made the job fun. I enjoyed helping customers find the items they needed and talking with them about future purchases. Seasonally, layouts were changed to keep the store looking different with new items everyday. Work shifts varied from days to nights when necessary. The hardest but also the best part was the flow of shipments during the holiday season. It was very challenging to get the products to the floor in a timely manner for customer purchase and was fun and interesting to work together with other associates to find the right space of the sales floor for the products. "
good,I like the work that I did but I feel the management could have been better
good,"A typical day at big lots for me is basically interacting with my customers, we usually get regulars so I love seeing them every time they come in. My Co-Workers are great I couldn't ask for a better group of people to work with."
good,"How to work the cashier , how to go about things when u deal with unsatisfied people. co workers were very nice and helpful. Hardest part of the job was recovery once the store was closed. The enjoyable part was working on the cashier."
good,The typical day at big lots vary from day to day it could be busy one day and dead the next. You could be running around from when you clock in to when you clock out or you could be cleaning shelves to find something to do
good,"Good place to work if it fits your schedule, pay could be better. Management is cool, they are helpful. great energy allways in store. could be more orginized"
good,Working at biglots was a great opportunity to learn multitask at once. In a short time I was bumped to lead support but being train for it I was pulled out of work for medical leave due to complications with a pregnancy and having preterm labor. After having my daughter I notified my boss and let him know in which he was suppose to put in my maternity leave but didn't. So I chose to later not return .
good,"First real job ever had. Got to learn how to use a cash register, to unload the truck and stock items within the store, and deal with customers face to face. There were many different types of management and it really just depended on who was there how the work day would go. The workplace however was friendly, nice, and productive for the most part. The worst part about the job really was the pay simply wasn't the best and still isn't."
good,The manager was good.  Employees receive 20% discount. Evenings and weekends required to work. Some potential to advance to assistant manager. Typical retail store.
good,Really good place to work too bad it's only part time. Very flexible schedule to work with. Between home life and work. Just need to make more money. Can't survive on part time hours. Not enough money to pay bills.
good,"good work experience, team workplace, positive people to work with alot of local traffic comes through to this specific Big Lots Store. familiar faces."
good,You constantly working make you day go by fast and you have to have a average of 95% every week miss it two weeks in a row you get counseling next time you miss it two weeks get wrote up the next time you get terminated
good,"Working at Big Lots is no different from working at any other retail position. It is what you make it, the better prepared you are with their system the easier things become. The 30% employee discount is awesome!"
good,"I Like Working At Big Lots .. Its A Great Place , Nice People , They Work With You , Its A Cool Place . Only Thing That Doesn't Favor My Opinion Is The Fact That By Me Being A ""Quiet Just Work"" Kind Of Person Some People Try To Insult My Intelligence And Take Advantage Of That ."
good,"My career with biglots was a good one, I enjoyed the team culture and drive. However the company lacks in investing time in training and mentoring their employees and is inconsistent from district to district on expectations."
good,"Come to work 8a.m. til 2p.m.typical day,learn how to do biglot customer layaway,management all depends on who""s managing,culture is alrite the worst part of jobs is not enough hours and the best part of job is I like people."
good,"slow pace, awesome discount, unreliable work hours, chill employees, and cool team work half the time ................................................"
good,At moments the place was fast-paced and slow pace and sometimes it was very stressful than no stress at all you also have to do a lot of loading and unloading you had to help organize you had to be the janitor you have packed stuff upstairs bring them back downstairs and get the cashier you have to play the stock worker and I did all areas of that store
good,It was a great place to work my first 9 years and than everything change. Every store manager is different. But I learn to adjust to what they wanted and some manager's didn't have they manager's under them back or support.
good,"nice people, slow work pace, pay is kind of low, paid 15 min break, not much room for promotion, when truck comes in unload time is  unrealistic with lack of stocking staff. people get hired then leave"
good,I Enjoyed working for Big Lots aka (Pic-N-Save) through out my Work Career. The managers that I have worked with have always been great and I have had the oppertunity to work my way up from stock and truck unloader to customer service and almost assistant manager.
good,"Hours were never consistent - sometimes I had 22 hours, whereas other times I only had 10."
good,Big Lots is a great part time job. i would clock in count my drawer and begin the day with building the new furniture to be displayed on the floor. it's a very simple job
good,"Loved what I did truck unloading,stocking,cashier,hated management!! Over all awesome place to work as far as the job duties are concerned..sucky hours"
good,This job was amazing. The managers were friendly and it was a awesome environment to be in. I miss working here actually. The managers listen to their employees.
good,A typical work day was very busy. I learned alot ofndifferent things from working in retail. Management wasn't to bad. The culture was okay. The hardest part of this job was maintaing all the task that was due for the day and filling a postion if someone called off. Makeing sure product was out on time. There is alotnof responability with this job. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my coworkers .
good,"Coworkers made working there bearable.  Management was tougher on the other hand; they would audibly sigh at the cashier when called to the front registers to deal with a rowdy customer or when asked to be more specific with a delegated task. On a good note, they were quick to approve time off requests."
good,"Most managers have positive attitudes, they let us know what our task is or the day.  We do customer service all day long with a smile and tighten up the place. The hardest part of the job is handeling a difficult situation in a good manner."
good,"great job for the field I'm in, learned new techniques to help advance my career. The company also worked with my schedule when needed. The company was a great experience."
good,nice place to work fun and interactive easy fast pace and always find good deals due to working in the store management could use some work but in the end great job
good,Was only working a seasonal position but the manager at the time was very nice and well spoken . Job had very little stress for employees . Nice customers
good,"Fun place to work fast paced always was busy loved putting out stock, unloading trucks and assisting customers. The hardest part of my job was the Christmas rush."
good,A typical work day for me is interacting with my customers. They ask and I try my best to give them an answer. My customer service skills improve with every one who walks through the doors. I enjoy seeing new faces and making new friends. My social skills are at it's best. It's a good day when my customers leave happy.
good,"Really fun to work at during the holidays. Always stay busy stocking, and helping customers out. Friendly co workers. Management was really friendly when i was there."
good,"A job for someone with limited time , and needs a few dollars. No future. Products that are sold are top notch at a real reasonable price. What a lot of retail stores should be."
good,"A typical day at work would include: stocking and organizing merchandise, assisting customers, working with the Point Of Sale system and hourly cart round ups"
good,"Most days I would go in and get the store ready to open. I also close as well.  Then I would check for any new tasks that need to be accomplished that morning. Then I would start on my normal everyday tasks for improving the store from a merchandising point. Get areas ready for the new merchandise coming in to include cleaning and setting shelves. Consistently checking on cashiers and giving them tasks when they are not waiting on customers. Continuously walking the floor and checking on customers to see if they need any help finding anything. Sell and load out furniture. Enter paperwork from previous day. Do the deposit from previous day. "
good,"Nothing spectacularly worth mentioning that was out of the ordinary of a cashier job. You clock in, count your drawer in your register, then you start checking people out. It was only a seasonal job, so I wasn't completely able to immerse myself as much."
good,Typical day at work was cleaning and keeping assigned area neat. Weekly unload trucks and stock merchandise. Fun place to work with great co workers. Not real run for growth and not a lot of hrs.
good,always willing to help they hired me fulltime after christmas and it was sure a great feeling it was stressful at time but we always worked as team
good,"very nice establishment, acquired more register experience and customer service also. enjoyed the people"
good,"Greeted each customers, handle cash at the registers, inventory, and sales associate"
good,I enjoyed my job at Big Lots. I started out as bookkeeper and moved up to Asst. Manager. We were one big happy family. I left to go another job where I made more and a lot better benefits.
good,I loved working their but the management was hard to deal with. I was employed for one year and when I had a family emergency come up the fired me. So it went to court they photo copied my signature on write ups so I won the case. The company I loved working for the manager over me was fired.
good,This job was a good team effort job.  Management was a bit cold but we came together to help and encourage each other.
good,"This was my fist job out of high school. I would come in and go strait to work. starting on the cash register, helping customers, arranging items, answering phone calls and more. management was pretty fair he saw potential in me. I worked hard and well.  the hardest part was during inventory week. the most enjoyable part was Christmas! I love how we decorated the store; while customers came in I would direct them to what they needed."
good,At Biglots I met a lot of very friendly people. They would only come to the store if it was a day that I was working.  A lot new me by name being that it was in my home town.
good,Ringing up customers and helping them take their items to their cars. Cleaning and organizing shelves and product.
good,Store associates weork hard and have fun. The company is closeout based in its buying so you get an ecclectic assortment of merchandise. The comapny provides a 20% discount for its employees. And has discount days for customers as well. I did not like the amount of hours that were provided weekly to run the store.
good,"I learned how to unload a merchandise truck, price it and then put that merchandise out on the floor."
good,"i worked in the front end merchandising, cashier, cleaning stocking"
good,A day at Big Lots. Having your name called every five minutes for customer assistance. Cashiers always calling out so now you become that cashier along with trying to be the manager on duty. Customers complaining because there is no one to help them. The hardest part of the job was trying to run a store with only 2 people to help everyone. The best part of the job was that my cashiers and associates were happy to see me everyday.
good,enjoyed the working enviroment liked the early morning hours
good,Wasnt a bad job because I love customer service but the management team was very unorganized.
good,I did many different things from customer service to unloading the truck.
good,"I had fun the first couple of weeks on this job, but when we got new management, she was mean to everyone, and she made up ways to get all the associates fired. She didnt like a lot of the associates because we were all family and we had eachothers backs."
good,I really enjoy working at Big Lots in general. My co-workers are really good people for the most part and they share my enjoyment in customer service and going the extra mile.
good,"Big Lots is a good company to work for. As a manager you work alot wierd hours. Most of thr Store managers and district managers have a unrealistic attitude. They are not in touch with the real world, they are just worried about thier bonus money."
good,"Both customer service and regular check-outs are in one area. When it gets very busy, it tends to be overwhelming. I did like how my hours weren't overwhelming, and I am able to enjoy my personal life. As for work culture and management, back when I used to work, it was awful. Everyone seems to be grumpy with on another; I would say ""hi"" to a manager, and they would glare at me. Now, when I stop by to grab food for my lunch breaks, the management there seems to be a lot better. Everyone seems happy and sociable. It often makes me consider if I want to go work at Big Lots again..."
good,"I learned how to move very fast during cashiering. My trainer taught me everything about cashiering and retail in the right way. "
good,My experience at Big Lots was fulfilling.   However the stress level was very optimal.  This led to suffering two heart attacks while at work.   The physical demands along with the stress level caused me to leave the company.
good,When I worked at Big Lots I enjoyed my time there. When my first manager was there I received lots of help and encouragement to improve. Although as time went on we got new management that eliminated the overall feel of the story and lowered employee morale.
good,"t is good  if you need extra money-part time job, good management flexible hours.lots of extra hours around the holidays & good pay on Sundays. met a lot of new friends.train to do stocking,& cashier,recovery."
good,"Working there sometimes you can go long periods of time without a customer so you have to be a tasker. put furniture displays together, stock among other things are always needing to be done. you get great discounts on everything in the store. management will work with your schedule. security is a bit of a concern though. people love to come in and steal so you really have to have eyes on the back of your head to catch them. Raises are not that great. you do get PTO so thats nice."
good,Great place to start your career in retail.I worked two weeks working part time then i was promoted to DTS Lead/Manager. Customer service is a large part of my day along with opening and closing the store. Making cash deposits during closing was challenging in the beginning because of the timely process. Building furniture displays is also a frequent task. Doing credit card applications and lease agreements can be very rewarding
good,Work got done but the management is questionable. The best part about my job is interacting with customers. The management makes the environment of the store feel unwelcoming.
good,Big lots is great as far as the direction they would like to go in and example they want to give to their associates. Customer service is very important and a top priority. However some process’s are stuck in the 1980’s as far as how they are handled. The entire truck and processing of a truck needs a lot of help.
good,I was with Big Lots for 2 years and for those two years it was a really different experience for me but taking on all the different roles provided to learn as much as you can in the store made for more hours and opportunities. Definitely a good place for those looking at part time. I wouldn't recommend working here if your looking for a career as it is part time unless you are hired as management. Even then it still a great place to work for.
good,"For someone who was going to school at the time, the hours were very flexible, all employees got 20% off. The managers world often do underhanded thing to get themselves or others ahead. My overall experience was OK!"
good,"Great coworkers,easy to use cash register and 30min lunch and 10min breaks..great funiture and loyal cutomers..I liked working here during the holidays cause you get to see all the new things that come inn"
good,Its a alright job. Meet cool people. Not a job to work at if you want to live on your own hours are not enough and you don't know if your hours one week will be the same the next week
good,"Every job has a manager who is not friendly, in this case, it was Big Lots In Kerrville, the pay raise is okay for a part-time job. They have remodeled Big Lots in most cities. Looks nice. Very easy work. Friendly staffed"
good,"Big Lots is a nice place to work. There is opportunity for advancement , but they are few and far between. The company is charitable and does participate in local charity events."
good,Big lots is a great place to work but the hours are to few. You get great discounts and you get to pick the stuff that is discounted before the customers get to it. I love the people and really need the work. I am torn between finding another job and loving Big Lots. It is a great place to work.
good,"Sold furniture,helped customers, loaded furniture, unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, most enjoyable part selling and loading furniture, hardest part was dealing with employees not helping and doing their part"
good,constant chaos with broad downward delegation of tasks. Nobody ever has the time in their day to become great at what they do. Everything is delegated and micromanaged from the top down.
good,"Big Lots was a great company to work at if you enjoy working and being around a lot of individuals. The work was flexible and the hours as well was pretty good. The pay isn't bad since the associates are paid weekly. Of course I was 18 to 19 years of age when I worked at Big Lots. If anyone is looking for a job that's not too harsh, stressing, and not complicated Big Lots is the place to be."
good,The nice thing about working for Big Lots is that whatever you want to learn they will teach you. Mangers love to be able to show anyone wanting to learn different roles of how the store works or functions!
good,"Company was a great placed to work at, but due to the less pay advantages and the less hours given to work. Wasn't able to support my family. Management was reasonable when needed."
good,"It was a job so I won't complain. I stayed busy because if the job I did so my day would go by pretty fast. Good work environment, easy to learn and nice coworkers"
good,"Like most retail you have too many things to do and not enough hours or payroll to do them in. There is not a lot of emphasis on training, so you end up training yourself for the most part. Technology is a little behind."
good,in my opinion i dont think stockers get paid enough for all the work the have to endure it sometimes takes alot of body strength and gets very exhausting
good,Overall a good place to work. A lot of work with little recognition.The year I was there we had three Store managers. I am aware of three issues employees had that were reported to upper management by employees and ignored. All three quit to find other jobs. Long as the store makes numbers they ignore other issues
good,come in and do your job and go home make sure my area and front end was clean and make sure my cashier money was right at the end of they shift and make sure the clean area they register and stock the bags before they leave for the day
good,I was a CSR with stocking and cashier responsibilities. I also helped unload trucks and sort inventory. The season's changed fast in retail and we were always setting up each one 3 to 4 months in advance. There was always something to do!
good,"Walmart claims to be family oriented but after working at big lots I can see who truly is."
good,"Your job duties at Big Lots are to run the cash register, stock shelves, recover the shelves, and assist the customers. The lead manager at Big Lots is flexible and worked with me between having college and working around my LPN job but his attitude is negative. He has said some very inappropriate and mean things to his employees which make working there less appealing."
good,If you have a good manager the job is amazing if not your days will drag. On a day to day you tend to just help customers in the best way possible. You also have to clean the store when and where its needed.
good,"very low pay and fewer than 20 hours per week,  I loved all I worked with (coworkers and management) they are like a nice family, but I have to pay bills and can't with the salary paid...sorry!"
good,"Unload trucks, stocking entire store with e to 5 people only making 8.00 an hour's.  Very very hard work for little pay. I would have stayed if they took better care of employees"
good,I work this job 2 days a week unloading freight trucks - Manual labor. Took as a part time job to occupy my time and for a little extra side money. I never thought I would still be here 10+ years later
good,Being a member of the stock crew can be a very unique and rewarding experience both professionally and personally. It gives you the opportunity to grow and learn and become a better person and make lifelong friends.
good,Is a typical merchandising store run by corp that is consistant with what they do but they need to have better communication with managment and employees otherwise it is a great part time
good,"That is exactly all it will be, a decent part time job on the side. Would recommend for students because it is not stressful and are very flexible with availability."
good,i work morning and evening shift. i unload the trucks and i cashier and its good place to work. the manager there are people to work with. i meeting a lot of new poeple
good,When I worked their I always had something to do...overall great experience working their.  Everyone got along well. Wish the managers where a little bit more flexible to students who have a busy schedule with school.
good,"Big lots is a good and decent place to work. Other than a slightly over critical store manager and the occasional low work hours per week, I have no problem with the company or fellow employees"
good,Not enough hours for full time job. Pay is low and hours are scarce and inconsistant.  The employees are very nice.  Training could also be better on new products and associate responsibilities.
good,They have you do what they tell you to and always work with your schedule. some of the managers at the time had a relation ship and that affected the whole work place. would be better off without them
good,It's a very good company but with every job there is always some people that have issues and try to get you into trouble or fired. You just have to learn to ignore it and do your best
good,This is a good place to work if you just need a part time job and are not relying on this as a sole means of support.  They do not pay well and there are no benefits but it is good for pt.
good,I learned how to use a cash register. I also got a lot more experience with customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,The discount was great.  I worked in several different departments daily.  Ranging from cashier to stocker.  My managers were very knowledgeable and wanted to see me succeed.
good,very cool job great people work there liked the continuous change from day to day got to meet a lot of people got to do pretty cool job
good,My typical day would be running register and striating store when not busy. I have learned from this job to stock merchandise on the shelf in a timely mater. management was over all good and fair. Co-workers was nice and friendly. Hardest part of job was making the work last until the shift was over.  what I enjoy the new people I got to meet.
good,Well this is a fun place to work i love my co workers and some of my management. The job has great pay and benefits. However the schedule is horrible i can not make dr appointments or keep them for me or my kids because my request get denied everytime. The hours are usually from 12 to 10 pm and they say so u can spend time with your family but fail to see its impossible when your there all the time .
good,"The company was good, a lot of issues with theft prevention involving employees of the company. Management turned heads to issues as to avoid them."
good,its was my first job so i had a tough time getting use to the environment
good,I worked morning I always unloaded all trucks put everything where they needed to be I stocked all merchandise. I did all carry out when customers would come in and purchase furniture. I also was the one who worked in furniture building them for display helping overstock I liked working there I was fun good time just needed to pay a little more. my co-workers were good helped when I needed it always gave a hand. I don't think there was a hard part about that job I could do anything they asked me to do.i enjoyed remolding the store I was great experience learned to do lots.
good,A typical day here would be to run the register and talk with customers. Also to maintain a safe and fun shopping environment.
good,liked working with the public and co-workers. managment needs work
good,"Working at this particular store was fun.  It may be due to a broad ethnic workforce.  Everyone get along with most.  We have pot lucks"
good,Was a very rewarding job being on the management team and leading employees the way that I wanted to be treated. Working side by side with the employees and have great relationships with them.
good,"I love my job, and what I learned,  it always different everyday. but I don't get full benefits. only full time employee can. I just work part-time. The hardest job its only holidays really kept me busy like crazy. But don't mind doing that. The most enjoyable part of the job is to put items back on the shelfs, that was in the cart with full of items. now thats fun. well for me yes..."
good,"A typical work day would be blocking food, recovery, and giving great customer service. Big Lots is a fast paced productive workplace and great for someone looking for a part-time position.Since I've been here I have learned point of sale system, Inventory counts, and how to give great customer service. Management is good for the most part but could use some adjustments. My workplace is very diverse and filled with personality. I would have to say the hardest part about my job is making sure every customer is completely satisfied. and most enjoyable about my job is making sure my new and regular customers are happy. Also, getting work done and having fun doing it!"
good,"A typical day would include counting and distributing money to workers and delegating task at start of shift, and logging in daily transactions on spread sheets."
good,liked working there and liked the customers but didn't get enough hours
good,"A typical day at work consist of lots of public contact, which requires  you to be able to cope with different walks, of life, overall the enivornment is pleasant and fast pasted. I enjoy my co workers, they are diverse and interesting to work with."
good,"Learned how to stock, and most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customers"
good,"Easy to work for, Kept me busy. Employees had a can do attitude and the management did there best and were very friendly. Everyone who worked there did there best to help the costumer and each other."
good,"taking of customers, answering phones, cashiering, other cashiers,taking of the service desk,doing refunds, tax except customers,change in the cash drawer,helping customers to find what they are looking for. Management always comes when you need backup.  The customers that were mean and rude.  Unloading the trucks and see what came in around the holidays"
good,"A typical day at work would be a laid back day not much customers."
good,day to day was always different one would go and start to bring out latest merchandise received and stocking it on shelves greeting customers helping them find their diamond in ruff. life in retail is rewarding and satisfying. Management was hard but fair.my co-worker hard working smart and enjoyed their work .Hardest part of job was inadequate tools to process in coming freight . Due to the new items coming in to store it was like having a different store every week
good,"Working here was one of the most relaxed work environments I've ever experienced. Goals were set high for all employees and if you met or exceeded them there was no shortage of praise and rewards. All of my managers and co-workers were very friendly and easy to work with, and I enjoyed coming to work every day. We had time restrictions for truck shipments, and although it was hard to complete it within the time limit, we always managed to get it done in time. The store manager was very strict in how he wanted the store to be faced, so we took extra time and care to make sure the store looked its best."
good,opening and closing procedures
good,Big Lots was a great working experience but I needed a change with a new more challenging work environment.
good,Enjoyed being a cashier and meeting and talking to customers. Like re-straightening the store and how they worked with me with my work schedule.
good,"recovering and stocking new items and meeting new people , the management was very understanding and loved their co workers,learned a clean store and well managed store attracts customers"
good,"I went through 3 mgr.while employed there. The managers themselves were good,It was people them under were not ."
good,"I assisted cashiers when busy, when not needed on register, I was on the floor assisting customers, working freight, unloading trucks, store cleanliness. The hardest part of the job was running all over the store all day if I was needed on the register or if there was a return needing to be done or if there was customer concerns."
good,"Arrive before big lots open count my money drawer. Take it to the manager get my lane cleaned and open the store. In between cashiering I would return the items that customers did not want. At the end of my shift I recount my drawer and sign out. I learned how to be a hard worker at Big Lots, with awesome co-workers. The hardest part of working for Big Lots was finding the right place to return items. What i enjoyed most was the smile of a satisfied customers."
good,i loved working there but the mangers where not very nice to the people that worked there i was just so tired of trying to talk to the dm to do something bout it but they never did so i just walked out
good,This was job gave me the flexibility to attend school and work. I enjoyed the work environment as well as helping customers.
good,"Ideal for someone who wants to work a limited number of hours but who is available anytime, anyday of the week."
good,Only full-time positions are managers and part-timers don't receive too many hours but it isn't a bad place to work. Most store managers I have met are pretty great and each stores team is like a small family.
good,"Great part time job for high school students. Was able to be flexible and  work customer service, furniture, and truck. Would recommend for those looking for easy retail jobs"
good,i wish they would have had more people working so we could focus on details. go into work get your till count it and put it in the drawer. ring up your customers as they come to the register. cash them out and clean at the end of your shift. count the money to make sure the drawer is balanced.
good,"I've been with Big Lots for almost three years now. There's definitely been ups and downs. Overall, I feel it has been a great place to work. I've been able to work multiple positions and it has given me the most experience that I have gotten from any job that I have worked."
good,Working for big lots was enjoyable being able to help customers the best i could being able to take control of the front end meeting new people everyday
good,"Long hours,nice environment, customer based, room to move up,hard work,uniform given benefits within 30 days, cash handling, discount for working there"
good,I liked working for the company just wish they listen more to the employees and work with them if they have kids or other jobs. And the benefits could be a little better then what they have now
good,"The experience with this job was great,the labor was not strenuous at all.This job required teamwork and I learned how to stock food and other goods in the store."
good,The experience was nice and taught me many new ways of business and good customer service. The people i worked with was very nice and helpful with everything and would always help when i needed help or had questions.
good,I started working at Biglots gaining 9.50 per hour and after one year I am at 9.79 per hour. Each year a raise is given to you. You can most likely move up I was working in two areas of the store but my main area is as a Cashier. The business is very family-oriented and working at Biglots has been an amazing experience overall.
good,"I enjoyed the hours and fellow employees."
good,A good place to work. Can move up if you show you worth in. A decent work environment and a decent amout of hours on low end and decent pay if you have retail experience.
good,"If you are looking for a job to get you back on your feet, apply for big lots. It’s a good job. Although the customer might get annoying it worth the pay."
good,A typical day of work starts at 830am and working till  430pm as opening MOD. Being responsible for daily operations from opening the store to closing the store at 9pm. Receiving DSD vendor orders and well unloading DC trucks once a week sometimes more. Being responsible for financial responsibility of the company and maximize the company profits.
good,I was a cashier and a stocker I was really good at everything I did there im always on time never have any problems with customers very likable person.
good,Working here was great when you can work your department but I constantly had to cover store manager duties because she would show up late or be missing. When i approached the district manager about this he waved it off and didn't care.
good,"Had a fun time while doing my work and the pay was fair.  I didnt like having to be scheduled a night then a day shift back to back because i didnt get much sleep, otherwise its a nice company to work for."
good,What I have learned at working at Big lots is that you gotta be confident at what you do and make the best out of situations. Because it can get really busy out of know where and 9/10 they gonna have you one the floor by yourself.
good,"An average day for me at Big Lots involves greeting management, looking over daily planner for designated jobs specifically for me. They could involve cashiering, floor associate, furniture associate, customer service"
good,Great management. Loved working there. I got the chance to learn about and work in most departments. I loved the atmosphere and the people I worked with.
good,"Layoffs, unstable over spending. Sadly I was laid off. Before the layoffs it was a great place to work. always fun events. the discount was also nice along with sample sales."
good,It was a nice not to busy job part time. Liked all my managers they were understanding and hour fit my schedule. Part time is ideal for me with 2 small children.
good,I really enjoyed the people that I was able to meet and the opportunity that they give me to work with me ! I learned a lot from this company and at this time I would like to do something different
good,"As I worked at Big Lots, I came to work closely with their friendly management. Training time could be extended a bit more to their employees but management and coworkers have great knowledge in their store and products."
good,"the days were long given the hours I worked. With the time I spent there, I really learned how the company was ran and it's really interesting to see how everything gets done. The hardest part about my job was the constant lifting of 100+ pound products for 10 hours a day"
good,It was fun and a good experience time for something new love the employees good environment nice place to shop and the prices are unbelievable great management
good,I really enjoyed working at Big Lots the people were great. I wish I was able to go back and work there. Unfortunately I worked to far away from my home and did not have car at that time.
good,Co workers were great.  Fast paced for the most part. The management team were great.  Everyone worked together as a team.  Very friendly environment.
good,Relaxed place to work. Fun people to work with. Always had schedule out. Management was good.  Discounts weren't bad for the company. Descent pay and hours.     😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
good,"I enjoyed working on rearranging furniture, stocking products, and cashiering. The management was fair and pleasant to work with. I would tell friends and family members to work there."
good,all staff are very helpful in teaching you the ropes of the establishment.  Very friendly staff.  Plenty of work to do but everyone does it with a smile
good,"I typically am a store floor associate, which means I keep the shelves stocked with freight and make the product look neat on the shelves. I help customers find what they need and answer their questions."
good,I enjoyed working at big lots I learned how to properly clean and organize merchandize and properly dispose of hazard waste and chemicals and learned how to assist customers   in a ordeal fashion
good,"Unless you are a member of management, you are not allowed more then 30 working hours in a week. It is VERY RARE that you actually get more then 20. Other then that it is a very easy going job. Management doesn't like to do very much and requires a lot out of the best workers with little compensation. Unfortunately as part time, you do not qualify for any benefits."
good,"I would run the front of the store being the head cashier. When the trucks came in, would start work at 4am and unload and then stock the floor till noon"
good,Great place to work at. You can grow in the company quickly. Great co-workers and managers and supervisors. Everyone is just so nice and always polite.
good,"Its a team effort, all have to be on board to get jobs done. Management support is very important and communication necessary on all levels. Good place to work"
good,When you clock in you ask your Manager On Duty (MOD) about what to do if it already isnt obvious. There isnt much difficulty to any of the jobs that they offer either being a floor associate or a cashier is easy work.
good,"I worked here for a few months as a seasonal position and was forced to quit to focus on my schooling career. The atmosphere was comfortable, my coworkers were pleasurable to be around, and my bosses were nice to work with and for."
good,Good job to start with  putting products on the racks help others unload trucks and put away enjoying work  b not bad for a good start I would work there again
good,"I would go in at 4 am,and end times would vary,it would be too early for me I had children,and daycare would not open til 6 pm,at the time.My schedule was 4 am - 2 pm,4 am - 10 am,or 4am-11am."
good,"My typical day included managing the front end of the store, helping customers with purchases, returns, and questions. Management and staff at the time of my employment were great to work with."
good,I do like my job at Big Lots. But the store Manager is not a nice lady. Nor does she treat my other co-workers very well either. There are 3 other Managers there that I get along very well with and help me out whenever I need.
good,A place that gives opportunity part time for extra income great environment professional and sticks to a good business plan and culture for part time workers and full timers that are in the Company
good,"The hardest part of the job was closing the location that I opened as a store manager, "
good,"I really did like working here, I loved the environment, employees, and the customers. The only down fall was the pay and the hours. If you aren't a manager you cant go over 29 hours unless they really need you too, so with that said the pay rate wasn't good either so the checks we're small."
good,"Depending on the day, some days can be really great. Everyone does their job and management is happy the day runs smoothly. If the manager is angry with their personal life, an event in their store, or a co-worker, they take it out on everyone. As long as there is a good manager on shift that does there job and helps everyone and puts past their personal problems its a great shift. Other than that good luck."
good,I wouldn't work there again honestly didn't make enough money or enough hours would constantly cut hours and send me home early if slow way to much down time
good,"Big Lots for a long time was an enjoyable place to work but in 2013 the climate changed with the naming of a new CEO, making work there very difficult"
good,"I loved the environment. Great managers, Not enough pay or option for paid time off or paid sick leave. I loved the pace and the great people. I loved working at big Lots"
good,I did enjoy working for Big Lots while I was there. Only reason I left was I was overlooked on a job promotion. It was given to someone that years on down the road was caught stealing from the company.
good,"A typical day in Big Lots consisted of carrying out furniture, and other heavy merchandise. Selling furniture in the furniture department. Using the cash register. Unloading the trucks in the morning, and organizing the boxes according to its type. Using palate jacks to move items in the warehouse. The hardest part was organizing the business floor. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers."
good,I enjoy working at Big Lots. Always lots to do and a variety of responsibilities make it interesting. Management team are approachable and willing to work with scheduling needs.
good,establishes new accounts by planning and organizing daily work schedule to call on existing or potential sales outlets and other trade factors. Adjusts content of sales presentations by studying the type of sales outlet or trade factor.
good,"Our location didn't get a lot of business, so it was pretty easygoing. I came in right after they found out the store was closing, so there was actually less to do than usual. I can't speak for other locations, but customers always said that they liked ours best because it was clean and the employees were friendly. If it hadn't closed, I think I would've stayed."
good,As a business major I needed to work in an environment where I would deal with sales hands on. I learned a lot of basic tricks and tips when it comes to directly interacting with customers. If I take away anything from my time at big lots it would be the experience and lessons along the way.
good,Kinda fun but looking for something in the automotive field. Big lots I mostly worked overnights which was fast pace movements it was fun but I didn't see it as a career.
good,"I enjoyed merchandising the groceries on the shelves but the bulk and how quickly the store manager wanted them out was stressful.  Overall, it wasn't a bad job but it didn't pay many bills."
good,"It is a part time job, Everyday it was something new to do so the employer will be able to learn something good from every department and become familiar with it just in a case some customers goes to the department to look for some product and the employer will have the knowledge of it and sell it to the customer"
good,The days where long. however even though we did work long shifts we got holidays off and a 3 day weekend which was nice. the most enjoyable part about this job was that i met a lot of new people.
good,"I enjoy working there. The people are nice, and it introduces me to new things. The management is also very good, they are good with teaching the employees good things."
good,"All in all Big Lots is a great place to work, pretty good work\life balance as far a retail management goes. The senior\executive leadership of the company is trustworthy and steering the company in the right direction. The biggest draw back is my Direct Supervisor who give inconsistent and often contradicting direction."
good,"The DTS process is not realistic AT ALL. There is no way 4-5 people can unload an entire truck in three hours. There HAS to be a better way to unload trucks, as this is the worst way I have ever seen. Never enough hours to get freight out. Pay is not the best especially for the work load"
good,"I appreciated the chance to learn cashiering better, It was good for me to learn to deal with the public. I enjoyed working for very good managers. Overall I liked it."
good,Working at Big Lots was interesting. I was a cashier and so I worked with money almost all the time. There were a few days that I was on the floor recovering the store.
good,"Management could have been more on point, a typical day was fast paced, hardest part of the job a lot of walking, Always looked forward to breaks. I learned a lot of jobs some of them with training others I was on my own. The place is dirty the further you go back in the warehouse."
good,"I had a great time working here, everyone is super friendly and corporative. it was learning experience and manager was very flexible with hours. Its a good job to have while finishing college"
good,"Productive work place, very neat environment also have very good workers that's always there when you need them. I also worked the truck, had a very cheerful and fast running crew."
good,Good safe workplace. Keeps you busy with many things to do. Managers are persistent and fair. Managers treat employees with breakfast and lunch. Co-workers are helpful and hard workers
good,I loved working there it was fun the managers worked well with you and make sure you knew what you were doing. Flexible with you on when you can work and was a great place to work everyone was nice and you were recognized for your good work.
good,Hard work is rewarded instead of being overlooked.  Great part time job if one is seeking to make a little extra cash.  Willing to give someone an opportunity.
good,Was not thrilled with the communication with management and downgrade of pay without any notifications or agreements. Bad hours and miss management of people and the ability to schedule appropriately
good,"I worked nights unloaded and tag merchandise .Learned to read planogram .mixed culture .hardest  part was putting all product away "
good,Nice for part time bc they don’t hire full time. Friendly co workers managers always hounding you tho. Nice environment. Easy work. Managers are okay.
good,productive and fast paced work environment with great teamwork within different departments. Great customer service and merchandise is of good quality
good,"Big Lots is a good job because the work is productive but simple. There's always something to do from cash register, restocking, to just cleaning up around the store. I always receive a good schedule for the week and the pay was moderate."
good,Big Lots is a good part time second job to have. Nice managers and good work enviorment.The business is steady so you dont have to worry about dragging days.
good,"My typical day was to operate the register, manage employees tills and breaks, stock and price items. the management was amazing the most enjoyable part of working there was the people that came in."
good,"it was an OK job not many hours unless you're management, the schedule is a complete mess though, the manager I worked for was very rude to both employees and customers."
good,"I enjoyed my training program at Big Lots.  I learned a lot of skills such as stocking, customer service and facing( this is where you face all products out so customers can see the label) .  The employees where very nice and very helpful training."
good,This is a great part time job if you're in school. Or maybe have another job. Not something i would consider long term but it is a good customer service opportunity.
good,you get to know knew people work on projects and displays everyone is friendly nice break rooms and they offer a lot of overtime. they're also very understanding to your personal life
good,"If youre not looking for too many hours and like an employee discount, this is a pretty lax and flexible retail job. Pay isnt great but if you have some retail experience theyll usually start you out above minimum wage."
good,"Was actually a very calm and relaxing environment, I would honestly still be working there if they offered full time with hire pay and good benefits then I would still be there!"
good,"environment was friendly and fun.  Enjoyed working with the public.   did not enjoy changing the shelves out every week,,according to diagrams set by corporate but everyone is going to that now."
good,"On a typical day, I would be helping customers finding what they need, stock merchandise, and help relieve the other associates at the other departments."
good,"If scheduled for an opening shift, bathrooms were to be cleaned. I gained skill in communication. It was my first job, and the managers were very hands on. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with employees and customers."
good,As a sales associate your must be able to multitask all assignments. A typical day at work is recovering store floor areas. meeting and greeting all customers. Must be able to problem solve customer service. As a sales associate you must be able to conduct your self as professional as possible.
good,Corporate really should provide more hours to work with for sales/stock associates. We struggle keeping them in my store because we can’t give them hours. It also makes it difficult to get merchandise on the floor in a timely fashion since we don’t have the man power.
good,"my personal supervisors were great, the main store manager on the other hand had a hard time dealing with. but for the most part it was a great place to work and I enjoyed my coworkers."
good,Working at BigLots was a nice place to work.  There was no room for advancement to management from sales associate in the store I worked at. I enjoyed working with the other employees. Teamwork was a plus.
good,But I was still sick and my dr took me out of work til they figured out what was wrong with me I had a fatty tumor on my nerve root I no longer have the tumor and I can now walk normal.
good,nice people and easy going just would like more responsibility and not so easy of a job I like to be challenged I think the pay could be better for the cost of living but over all the company is nice
good,This ia a good position for soneone whose looking just to work part time for extra money...manager is very flexible with your schedule just as long as you ahow up for your shift
good,"Providing exceptional customer service, exchanging currency. Providing training assistance to new employees to help them succeed at their job duties. Providing a role model structure for fellow employees to follow. Ensuring a safe work environment for our customers and fellow staff. Supervising the stocking team and ensuring that product is placed in the right areas. Opening/closing manager duties; running the store with a neat and tidy presentation. Store mapping and setting of displays."
good,Great customer service and good discounts. Not always a team player store. You have to deal with a lot of shoplifting in store with some customer's which takes up alot of time sometimes
good,"People are helpful. Managers are more like leaders, than bosses. They work on your level. Treat their employees as equals. Everyone acts as a team and are easy to get along with. However sometime people take advantage of the kindness of others and with that causes unnecessary drama in the work force."
good,Comfortable and rewarding place of work. You learn a lot about the retail business and there is room to grow. 20% off of your purchase and 30% off on employee appreciation days
good,"Lots of new direction and changes with new CEO. Job work/life balance is not quite on an even scale. Even with all the changes, still a good company to work for."
good,the staff I work with was great. no mess no drama...amazing just wish I could've stayed a little longer but due to some unfortunate circumstances I had to end my employment there
good,"I learned a lot working here under many different store manger's. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours to get all my things done. I liked that I really got to interact with my customers inn the food department, and how they taught me a lot about many kinds of food."
good,Biglots should have leveraged to keep Marquette MI location open. I enjoyed my time working there but began to sense the community and employees were not a priority.
good,"I enjoyed some of the people I worked with, I enjoyed the management as well, never had any problems with any of them. my problems more or less come down to the lack of hours to try and live on as a single mother, 15 hours is not enough to live on after being there 3 years. that's why I felt I had to leave."
good,"I love my coworkers and managers, but the scheduling system sucks and so do the hours. A computer does it for the manager by just the push of a button. there is no thought that goes into it no matter how hard i work."
good,Very outgoing workplace and friendly people. Handling money and making sure the customer is happy with their product. Mangement is great very nice people
good,This is a very boring job. This job I feel is for older people. the work is pretty easy and the staff is easy going. It's a very stress free work environment.
good,"I only worked there for a few months, but I really enjoyed it while I did. I loved my coworkers and I really have nothing bad to say about any of the management."
good,"Big Lots doesn't get too much foot traffic especially after 7. The store isn't very big so if you're working at a quick pace, you'll probably finish your duties early."
good,"Working at the register, checking out the merchandise for customers. Stocking or straightening merchandise on the shelves."
good,Concerns from employees and reports of verbal abuse should be taken seriously. Higher up management are rude and very disrespectful to people below them.
good,It was fast paced depending on the day there were days that were slower than others. The other employees were helpful when you didnt know how to do something at the beginning and willing to help you.
good,"A typical day at work starts off with clocking in, and checking to see what we are suppose to be doing that day. Which for me is one of he following; cashiering or floor associate. Cashiering involves taking care of customers needs or just simply ringing the customer up. A floor associate does what the cashier can't. If something isn't ringing up we're the one who hurries to find the price. If we aren't helping up front we are the ones who make the store look clean. "
good,Working for Big Lots was a lot like working with friends. Everyone is very friendly and the management team is very helpful. We always made sure that the customers that came into our store found everything that they needed and had a enjoyable experience.
good,"I liked working here because it wasn't just standard put things here, you some say in where to put items and it was kind of like a puzzle. Which I liked."
good,"Typical day consists of making sure the customers are pleased with their shopping experience while buying household goods and furniture. A couple times a week, vendors are checked in. Daily recovery standards are maintained."
good,"Workplace culture enjoyable, promotions from within. Benefits provided to full time associates. Great teaching programs."
good,"Great place to work but has a lot of overtime. Employees are great, easy to get along with. But you barely have a life outside of the workplace."
good,I had horrible work days. Learned how to stock and run a truck on my own with perfect timing. The managers were horrible though. The hardest part of the job was that we were basically working non-stop without even having a 30 min break for lunch. Barely got 15 min lunch breaks & they never let us work over time.
good,It was great working there. The only bad thing i would have to say is I was promised hours around my school schedule but that dropped me down to 4 hours a week.
good,It was the best job at the time while I was getting my bachelors degree. They were able to work with my schedule which was a plus. Sometimes balancing work life and school life got tricky but I was always able to pull through.
good,My time at Big Lots was heavily impacted by my education. Management was very flexible with my schedule and I am grateful. I would recommend to students.
good,Fun and respectable atmosphere. Co-workers and customers were all a joy to communicate with. The part i dislike the most would be the holiday music played over and over
good,is a easy job for me. standing up walking around good exercise for me. good environment too. That's in Big Lots Store. its a retail job.
good,It was a very simple and honestly easy job. When my availability changed they were very accommodating. I was fortunate to have excellent managers and co-workers who helped make my time there pleasant.
good,"Good environment to work in. "
good,Over all a good place to work. Has its ups and downs as far as labor goes. Definitely need to understand if you are not a physical worker then this job isn't for you.
good,"Multiple people who worked here often brought their personal life into their work life. One employee flirted with every woman employee who worked there so it wasn't really a safe environment for me. I felt uncomfortable around this employee."
good,"It is a Good place to Work, the environment is pleasant. Just not enough hours and no place to advance to. Muli-tasking is a must or at least helpful. Company is going through lots of changes"
good,"I love this job, everyone I work with are nice and have great attitudes. We all work together as a team, and rarely have any mishaps. Definitely only good for a part time job though."
good,happy with the management. I enjoy coming into work. good work life balance. co workers are in a good mood. management is encouraging.
good,A great work environment. The management staff worked well with you there were no scheduling difficulties the staff worked well together to achieve our productive goals.
good,"Indeed has a good work life balance. It is uncommon to see people spend more than 8 hours at the office. There is never a ""crunch time""; the workload is pretty consistent."
good,co worker were fun  to work with the company is good but store managers dont believe in the process they worry only about what DM  is going to say not whats right for the workplace
good,Good place to work. Supervisors were good at assisting you when needed. Friendly environment and overall a good atmosphere. I would recommend applying here for a job.
good,"They are great to work for. A typical day at work is always different and busy. I think it is very important to remember that it is a job and not to take it personal if a customer comes in upset, remember they are not personally upset with you. You are paid to provide service to the customer, put yourself in there place and think of how you would like to be treated. Kindness, understanding and providing prompt customer service and satisfaction is key."
good,"good place to work, communication skills are a plus. great customer service good fun and friendly environment. Great way to learn how to do different things"
good,I have learned a lot about furniture business and Big Lots has a great selection of and presentation of furniture. Easy financing and great customer service. Customer service is very good and prices are great on savings.
good,Great job to understand the meaning of a team environment. Work days are full of excitement and fun.
good,"I was initially hired on as a stocker/recovery, as well as a back-up cashier. The stocking hours are definitely not preferable if you are  parent. When I first started working here, I worked 9 am - 2 am. About 2 months later, the hours got switched to 4 am - 10 am. Working these hours took a lot of energy that I needed for my little one, but it was a job that helped paid the bills. If you are not a manager, you are strictly part time, which has absolutely no benefits... at least that's what I was told. The managers that I was hired to work under were extremely rude and degrading. They have been let go from the company, so that is a plus. There are ups and downs working at the store, but that is anywhere you go. All in all, honestly, I would probably go back. The management is better and I really enjoy working with the public. When I was transferred to being a cashier II absolutely loved it! Fast-paced environment."
good,"Perform typical store manager duties, managing assistant manager and associates.  The most enjoyable part of the job is developing a professional, productive management team and staff."
good,different hours at different days ( one day you work from 7am to 12pm) the next day you work 5pm to 10 pm) but it is a good place to work nice people willing to help if you don't understand.
good,Great experience in a fast-food restaurant! enjoyed learning new skills and learning again in food service as well as working with like minded employees and coworkers who understand the benefits of going further in their careers.

good,"learned people skills, hardest general public. making relationships with customers. stock and recovery was easy. holidays and weekends are busy"
good,"As a cashier come in for my shift and clock in. I enjoyed greeting my co workers at the start of each day. Everyday I learned something new, whether it was a new way to accomplish something or a new way to compromise with a customer. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with various personalities within the business structure who would lie and manipulate to accomplish their desire. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with regular customers who became part of the ""family""."
good,"I was most of the times utilize a cash register to ring up customers, also involve neatly bagging or wrapping each of the customer’s purchases. As a first time working as a cashier I learned a lot, and enjoyed the work.  Sometimes I worked in different aisle, restocking, organizing; my work was ensuring that products are easily accessible, visually appealing, and constantly available."
good,"At Big Lots I would count tills, manage associates and hand out tasks. I would perform day to day tasks such as re-merchandise shelves and products. Open and close store properly, handle any complaints from customers and any other task needed of me that day. Payroll and scheduling, perform write ups, deal directly with employees when they had an issue with another associate or customers. Follow up with re-training if necessary and help employees keep"

good,Big Lots was a fast pace job! We always had a plan set for the next day before it even begun! It was rewarding when we had everything crossed of the list before the next list was made and didn't have to add it to the next day! Team work is a must with every job but the larger the work load the much more you need it! I enjoyed the challenges I had everyday!
good,Big Lots is a good place to work for those who like fast paced jobs.  Staying productive pulling good percentage gets you good bonus pay.
good,This job is full of surprises and many different obstacles. Learning about the products that you sell also help you sell the product better.

good,"working in different departments helped me learn so much. Cashiering, stocking and bookkeeping was fun because the more I worked in these departments the more t learned"
good,The employees were really friendly and helpful. There was not enough store hours available due to the fact that it was just a overnight stocking job.
good,"Working for Big Lots was a very easy, laid back job. I quickly learned where things in the store were, in order to point customers in the right direction. My co-workers and managers were great and made coming to work enjoyable!"

good,It was a good first job to get my foot in the door for experience. All the employees were helpful and great to work with. Managers were always around to help and answer any questions.
good,"Clock in, cash in. Help put random items back in there place, answer customer questions, help them check out.  As well as early morning stocking and organizing shelves. Near the end of the shift there is a little bit of cleaning up and counting to do. And my co workers were always easy and fun to get along with."
good,Getting our pallet ready stock our sections. And helping our co-workers if needed or management cashiering if needed or backup. Overall the the its a very fast paced environment theres always something to do or that has to be done.
good,Work at Big Lots is easy and fun. I've learned how to accomplish hard tasks at a quick pace. My co-workers are always a pleasure to be around. The hardest part of my job is dealing with my schedule on certain days I need off. The fun part of my job is getting to deal with my friends and co-workers.
good,"I would come in and either open the store or close the store, counted tills, did returns, stocked shelves, loaded and unloaded trucks, book keeping, and schedules.  Management was fun but also serious about their job.  The co-workers were a variety of different people but were fun to work with.  The hardest part was getting co-workers to listen to you.  The most enjoyable was staying busy all the time."
good,I enjoyed working at Big Lots. The people I worked with there were friendly and outgoing. A normal day consisted of restocking shelves and introducing new merchandise to the sales floor. Hardest part of the work day would be when a truck came in that needed to be unloaded.
good,Nice people. Great place to work. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. No drama. Great enviroment. Understanding managers
good,"will recommend it to everybody, "
good,"On a typical day of work, after the “Store Manager” opens the doors and I punch in I ask her what I job is for the time being until they give me another job to do. I’ve learned not only how to take care of my work place as a worker, but also what to expect as a customer any time I go inside a store. Management not only helps the workers with certain jobs but also makes sure the job is getting done correctly and does a really well job with customer service. The co-workers are sort the same as the management as far as getting the job done and helping out fellow workers and customers. Except we help each other more by being there for one another and by being more focused. The hardest part of the job would be to stock the really heavy merchandise and to then organize them. The best part would be the last couple of hours of the day before closing. For instance, the fact that there are no more customers after ten p.m. makes the store a lot easier to clean and prepare for the next day."
good,Nice relaxed place to work but they only schedule part time hours. I worked their for over a year and I never saw anyone scheduled for more then twenty hours except management.
good,working over night and early in the morning to unload trucks. the co-worker were fun to be around and work with. Hardest part of The job is not having enough people to unload trucks.
good,Everyday was like walking into your house with everyone greeting you ready to start the day.  The people I worked with were very friendly and easy to get along with.  Management always had the customers and employees in mind and never had a problem with helping those who need it.  It was difficult when we short staffed and only had two people in the store to work.  The best experience I had here was the joy I had when I was able to successfully help a customer find what they needed.
good,Although being a manager was a very rewarding job it was hard work and my co-workers brought stress to the work place. I learned how to handle different situations and stress manage as well.
good,Flexible scheduling and the hours aren't too bad for retail.  Have learned a lot about planograms and sets.  Running a store on your own

Towards the end of my shift, I would stock shelves. I learned how to manage employees and handle angry customers with a smile. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers and keeping a smile on my face. I most enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing an angry customer leave with a smile because of me."
good,"I really enjoyed this store and was very sad when I left, Should have stayed.  I enjoyed my manager even though he was unique and after I got to know the seasoned crew I enjoyed them as well."

good,While at Big Lots I have learned how to simultaneously manage and supervise several individuals. The hardest part of the job is the ever-changing schedule.

good,wasn't to bad but isn't my ideal place to work. I worked register and stocked items as well. did some recovery
good,"The shift usually starts out busy and dies down a bit toward the end. Responsibilities included anything the store manager left to do in addition to work the Assistant Manager closing the store during your shift would have you do.

good,"Worked as a front-end Manager, handling Customer Service and staff assignments and duties."
good,Management is good with working with you if you have other commitments. Only time there is a lot of hours is around Christmas times. Other times sometimes only scheduled for 20 hrs in a week. There is no seniority.
good,"Working at Big Lots you are working with customers from a variety of different people where you experience something new everyday!  "
good,Big lots was a good story because of the people we work as a famliy there if people had a people at home or at work we could talk about it. You just cant do that any where Management made it that way. Some days i work four or six hour days that what made it hard for me because i wanted eight hour days but overall it was a good place to work at

I also walk around the service area but keeping it in sight for any customers, and re stock and straighten any areas I can."
good,always had something to do. People there where great to work with.
good,The store can get messy and disorganized so yo spend a lot of time recovering to keep it neat and picking up things that do not belong and putting them where they do. We check for experation dates on food to get rid of the things that may be outdated and we check to see if things usually glass objects are broken to get them off the shelves. There are employees that work really hard and can keep things fun and ones that work very little and it feels like you are picking up their slack. It is a team and everyone works together to help customers and keep the store together. It is fulfilling when you can get a customer totally lost and in distress and be able to help them find everything they need and calm them down as well as be surprised they are not paying as much as they thought they were going to have to.
good,"Work Customer Service area doing returns, runing register, helping customers find items, calling other stores to see if they have merchanise we are out of or don't care. I learned how they do things differently then other stores. Helped co-workers do different projects they were working on, came in on days that I was scheduled off if someone called out or if they were short handed. Hardest part of job is not being able to satisfy customers when we can't get them what they want or unable to do what they want us to do. Most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and dealing with customers."

good,aiding customers in their shopping needs and making the store presentable for the following business day
good,"Depending on who else was working the same hours I would either work the cash register or walk the floor cleaning and helping costumers and being a back up cashier. I learned how to work with different people and interacting with costumers. The hardest part was being able to juggle work, school, and sports. I enjoyed very part of my job since it was my first job."
good,"My days were long during the holidays. There was a time I felt I was the only one there! I am a fast learner, and can get people through the line quickly so my line usually had more people than the others!"
good,"It was always something to do stock,unloading merchendise ,work on the register or even put up displays.I worked even customer service met a lot of new people and employees."
good,this was a fairly good work environment but they only offered part-time hours...15-25 hours per week. i learned a lot about planograms and office duties.
good,"A typical day at work consists of moving stock, overseeing employees, and opening/closing the store. I've learned to become tough when it comes to a negative situation, not break down. Also made me learn that being patient in life makes things less stressful. Other than myself, management plays a important part in my learning. I've known to take the bad and the good with everything I do. Take their criticism and apply it to what I need to improve. My co-workers are all different and are easy to get along with, which makes for an easier environment to work in. The hardest part of the job is when you have a very unhappy customer and try to go about handling the situation on a store level, but also helping the customer the best way possible. The most enjoyable part of any day is when you can feel proud about how you have helped everyone you can and to see them smile knowing you did."
good,it was decent but no great gig. the hours fluxuated alot so you had no idea how much your were going to get on a regular basis.
good,My most enjoyable part about the company was working with the customers.
good,The company does not have any major issues. They run the same way most other retail stores run. The main issue I had was with the other employees. Most seemed normal but there were the few that caused drama in every aspect they could.
good,"A typical work day consists of servicing customers, merchandise presentation, store recovery and cash handling. I learned how to merchandise according to presentation and that signage is essential. Management must train and coach associates in merchandise presentation, safety, loss prevention and cash handling procedures. They work hard to promote and maintain the cultural environment. Co-workers are usually customer friendly, trainable, and courteous to others.The most difficult portion of the job was adjusting to associate turnovers and training new ones. Also, the constant moving of merchandise was hard, The best part of the job was learning new merchandising presentation techniques and servicing customers from various countries and backgrounds."
good,"I was constantly going, whether I was bagging up things or walking down the aisles straightening things up. I learned a lot about answering phones working with Big Lots. The management was great and my co-workers were amazing people. The hardest part was being on my feet so long after a long day before I came to work. But the best part of coming to work would have to be my co workers and the customers."
good,I didnt have any problems working there.I just needed ft at the time and insurance.
good,"The managers can be fun to work for, They try and take care of thier employees as best as they can..."
good,Flexible hours family-like environment acknowledged you when you went above and beyond management was always side by side they were our friends but bosses
good,While working at Big Lots it taught me speed and accuracy. It also improved my skills in customer service and dealing with the public. My speed and accuracy also improved while working with Big Lots.
good,"For the most part, the job is clear, precise and the people are great to work with. You'll deal with heavy lifting and team building in my department. I feel underutilised about half the time as if my skill and abilities are ignored and there is a somewhat sense of favouritism here."
good,"With big lots they are mainly just a part time job based company, they should offer more hours to their employees and some benefits to those who are full time."
good,Some days it is easy to roll through but when tasks at hand become overwhelming and not much payroll to accomplish tasks it can tend to make oneself very stressed and with a sense of being a failure.
good,"I learned how to properly be a merchandiser, recovery and how to do returns, how to be confident when speaking to customers while giving eye contact to them."
good,Fairly good i was working through a temo agency the temp agency is horrible southland employment dont go through them at all they have you get up at 6 am drive alk the way to work and ur not even on the schedule.
good,it was a fun and hard working experience. I learned it was a similar job to ones i have previously worked on as well. this made it much easier to learn!
good,Job was ok for maybe a college student but if you have bills to pay it’s not the job for you. 15-20 hours a week is all you get unless your a manager . It’s no where near enough to pay the bills
good,"Good place to work with great benefits and environment, they do have a few slow times of the year but overall would recommend this job for employment opportunities"
good,I only the worked there a few months. I got few hours from working there maybe 14 one week. I never got a full 40 hours from working there. The pay was minimum wage.
good,"Loved working here, very awesome co workers and managers. Just found a higher paying job. So I had to let them go.. would love to go back to work for them again."
good,"Flexible hours and very patient management.  Helpful coworkers.  "
good,I was hired before the interview. There was always work to do no matter what time or day. Stocking was before opening hours to commendate to customers and I loved getting off work at 11am or 12pm and still have my whole day to enjoy with family and the friends I met while working here.
good,would love to work with them again. I miss the job. Hopefully one day I will be able to work with them again. I would love for them to rehire me  I hope soon.
good,"Stocking, cashiering, merchandising. Management not so nice. Didn't like being yelled at by management in front of customers. Most enjoyable working with associates and customers."
good,"What can I say? My wife always use to shop in this store so I decided to work he. I was in for a surprise. Macro management (micro) was the theme of the day. I do want to make one thing clear ""THIS WAS NOT ALL OF MANAGEMENT""."
good,At least at my store no one worked full time except the managers. But it’s good if you are looking for a small part time job . Weekly pay is a bonus too.
good,"Big Lots was not a bad job and paid me fair for the simple work I had to do, but because of having school Monday through Thursday at 6 am and having work on the weekends from 2 am to 10 am was a tiring schedule and I elected to leave."
good,The managers are decent the hours are not so great you can work 8 one week and the next 25 .I think the employees that work productively shoyld get paid more as long as they keep working as good as they do .
good,"On truck day I would be in the warehouse unloading the truck with other employees. Then I would help stock the store, set up planograms and help on the register when needed."
good,"Associates work together as a team. Fast paced environment where all workers need to be focused for obtaining goals.  Goals include sales, donation requests from customers (for corporate programs), coverage programs and credit cards."
good,"Put out frat, ring on the register, assist in furniture, and help on truck, I learned about all the parts of the store through recovery, good management, friendly co-workers."
good,Perform a variety of tasks that needed to be done that day. Work with fellow employees to complete the tasks. Very enjoyable work climate. Management was very understanding and cooperative.
good,I enjoyed working there most of the time it was a nice learning experience. I enjoy working either by myself or with other employees and associating with the supervisors
good,"Big Lots , is a big store , and you feel like a robot, everything was the same , even as Management , they would not let you be creative on end caps. Everything was uniformed in every store, Plan-o-gram changes were done often and the set up was very disorganized. Managers were worked to much and they were very disrespectful to other Managers."
good,The management and coworkers where are fun to work with. But not payed that well and not enough hours. No full time work unless you are in management. Or bonuses.
good,"Very weird hours and wasn't very enjoyable. I know a job isn't always enjoyable but usually theres some good parts of a job, with this I had none....."
good,"The Big Lots location where I work isn't bad but it could definitely use some work. For starters, the location of the store is in a somewhat unscrupulous part of town so you have to be careful and aware of your surroundings. Working in the store is fun because the managers and co-workers are a cohesive unit. Because of this, the work environment is fun. However, there is a high rate of theft due to the socioeconomic area. The pay is way below other stores such as WalMart and Target"
good,"Big Lots was an exciting place for me to start my ""working career "" I know it's not what I wanted to continue doing for an extended period of my life but it brought me so many opportunities  that I wouldn't have learned elsewhere."
good,Many items put on plate with many due dates. Great working with teams to build store culture and DM partners. At first hard work/life balance but once you get the hang of it it is manageable.
good,"I supervised up to 10 employees, great team that has since moved up to become management for Big Lots. Enjoyed the process of teaching and working as a team."
good,Its an easy job. Management knows their stuff but I get told to do one thing by one manager and another tells me thats wrong. Again not a terrible job but there are better jobs for the amount of pay they offer.
good,"Depends on whatever the manager is wanting to accomplish that day ex.(unload truck, organize stock room, reorganize isles, stock product, tie cardboard bales). Learned  how to operate the cardboard baler. workplace culture was kind of toxic because everyone was afraid of being yelled at by the manager, and many of the women in the store had problems with one another for some reason. the hardest part of the job was organizing the stockroom and getting the heavy cardboard bale outside. the most enjoyable part of the job was to look at all the merchandise and stock product."
good,I was a seasonal employee but it was a good job while it lasted. everyday taught me something and it helped me in day to day life. the management was nice. they're understanding to your needs and are flexible with scheduling hours for you.
good,"It was a job between jobs, the management was ok and the people were good.  It was a go workout and they do take care of you and help out if you do get hurt"
good,A great store to work as your first job the atmosphere is decent. good customer service. Good co-workers decent hours. Cashiering stocking furniture sales
good,"it was good, the people were nice. my only complaint was i was getting very few hours. but i was getting along with everybody well. i personally wouldn't mind going back if they wold give more that 3 hours per week"
good,Big Lots was a nice company. The staff was friendly. The store was clean. Big Lots helped me to learn how to do cashiering and paperwork. I had nice managers that was willing to help me learn.
good,"During my time at Big Lots, my managers tried to accommodate my needs with my education and family. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks when the temperature was high. It was hot."
good,"decent job to have, minimal hours of work, could have definitely used some more hours, laid back environment, good job to have if you like working with the general public"
good,I always enjoyed talking with the customers. managment wasnt very understanding about not being able to work holidays. Pay sucked! They found it difficult to work around my schedule with child care with was open from 6:30am - 5:30pm
good,"A typical day at work will be easy going, very slow pace, no problems...come in do your job, go home. I was able to learn more about retail, management, merchandise display and costumer services. I feel the hardest part of the job was waiting for the hours to pass, some days it would take eternity for the watch go from one minute to the next."
good,"A typical work place, everyone is very friendly and there is always a helping hand if you need one. The management is very helpful and always there to back us up."
good,"Fun and friendly place to work, management is helpful and always ready to teach you something new. The hours are pretty inconsistent but they will work with you on scheduling issues."
good,The people here are usually laid back and friendly. That doesn't mean you can slack off though. The managers and higher ups seem to care greatly about their store and are constantly seeking out new ways to improve the store; as well as ways to improve the customers experience. Most other retail stores often makes one feel unwelcome. This is not the case here.
good,"A typical day consisted of working the register, maintaining order of the merchandise, ticketing items on truck day, keeping area clean. Holiday's are always busy and hectic leaving the store looking like a disaster zone that needs re-organized nightly."
good,"Mgmts great,love the work, customer freindly,works great with my full time job,small store. Flexible hrs.pay need to increase for experienced employees"
good,"Its a good company, but I am looking for something with a much more promising career. Work place is fun and has a good atmosphere, but upper management has no respect for the part time associates, so it makes it difficult to keep associates with the lack of pay."
good,"I love working with customers, helping to look for what they need. Stocking merchandise, cashiering, interacting. Helping other co-workers do their jobs"
good,"A typical day included restocking, assisting customers in need of assistance. My position included cashiering and can sometimes be pretty busy. However the location was permanently closed back in early January of 2018,"
good,"I was new in the customer service business so I didn't know much. But being there I was able to learn how to use a cash register, stock, price tag merchandise, mark down merchandise and gained much experience with customer service."
good,Big Lots is a good place to work. Full time or part time with opportunities  for advancement. Management always works with you & your needs for the schedule .
good,"Working for Biglots was probably the same as any other retail store.  At the beginning I worked unloading the truck, setting up pallets, and stocking.  Later I worked closing, and arranging shelves.  Closing was a lot more fun, and less stressful.  Unloading the truck and setting up pallets is a lot of work, and high paced.  The best part of working for Biglots was the discounts."
good,The hardest parts of the job is working with new people. The reason why I say that I like helping people. I also like focusing on my task. I like getting done on time.
good,"I had actually transferred from one location to another. My first experience was wonderful. The managers were caring and insightful, I had received a raise, and we all got along really well. However, the second location was extremely undesirable. Passive aggressive managers, poor working environment, lack of hours, etc. Personal experience at the company will all depend on store location."
good,Customers ask questions and to answer the best i can and if not ask the manager where they will be able to handle the problem and all the co workers get along and they're friendly people.
good,It wasn't a bad job.  I could have used more hours but I was pregnant at the time and was having a little bit of difficulty with my pregnancy so I went ahead and left my job.
good,"This was a fun and easy place to work, except on the truck days. Every Friday we got to unload the trucks  and it was very busy and repetitive workout."
good,"Its a good job, a great place to work. I just wish it could have more structure and balance to the people and persons in charge. With that being said at the time we had no real set person running things correctly with everyone following their lead. Instead it was a handful of managers running it there own way on set nights."
good,Big lots was a great place to work and I had a blast working for them. They also were very good working around my availability. They also give you free food and drinks when you worked there.
good,"Good place to work but they don't hire anyone to work full - time and you can't get more than 30 hours a week, therefore no benefits.  Easy job, good people."
good,the employees are great. I like the hours I worked. And was thought a great deal on how to merchandising. and during the holidays I loved the discounts we got.
good,i don't know if this is all of retail but the day or week can go based on the mood of the general manager or whether any pressure is put on any team leader.
good,Management can be difficult to understand at times especially when u get told to do different things by all of the managers and then when other people tell you how to do your job
good,"Typical retail. When I was there, you must be available to work nights and weekends. There were cashier and stocking positions as well as a combination of both. Mostly part-time positions."
good,"Cashier, Sales Floor, merchandising and helping customer located a specific item. Constantly changing shifts, working weekends and sometimes you are not, least 5 days a week work and 2 days off. Only part-time."
good,I really enjoyed working at big lots. My coworkers were amazing to work with. Only problems I had were not enough hours and there were a few things I was not taught at first but learned a few months in.
good,"Normally days can be either slow paced or moderate but come the holidays, it's very fast paced and can be a bit stressful at times. I learned how to make labels, how to set an area, and how to search up items through the system. Management wise, I got along with all my managers even ones I found difficulty trying to work with. Though one of the hardest things I had to deal with was furniture, I never was good at it and it was something I was not satisfied to deal with at all. I enjoyed being on the floor the most but it was my co workers who helped me enjoy the job more."
good,overall a good place to work part time. A lot of heavy lifting involved.Furniture department has a lot of back breaking lifting . Required to push high interest Big Lots store credit card.
good,It was a very smooth workplace where you always have things to do when there no customer ready to paid for their stuff. I find that it okay as long as you give the customer their right amount of change.
good,Big lots is a somewhat fun place to work at with good coworkers and management are all nice. You get okay hours. The pay could be a little better. Discount is good.
good,A typical day at work consisted of manning the cashier and taking care of daily customer needs and questions. Management was very good and competent at their jobs and performances. There was honestly nothing drastically 'hard' about the job. Maybe keeping the store constantly cleaned because of the the high customer traffic. I had the pleasure of working with some of the friendliest people known to man.
good,A good place to work.I stocked shelves. You could depend on your co.workers to help you. Management would help you if they could and respect you.Hardest part of the job was finding items in different departments. Most enjoyable was meeting people.
good,A typical day at work consists of selling furniture and helping costumers the way they need to be helped. throughout my year of working with the big lots company i have learned how to build on my communication skills and to be more confident. Management overall is a 7/10.The workplace culture is good. There really is not a hard part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling after you help the costumer that was needed.
good,"The store manager is all business, yet the sweetest person you will ever meet, working for her was a pleasure. The store has a great team of managers, very helpful and informative. Strict, yet, nice and pleasant."
good,I enjoyed working for Big Lots since they are very team oriented. An individual can advance rather quickly within the company and their efforts are rewarded.
good,I have learn how to work as a team to meet new people and to complete the goals that is set to be done on time. If you get stuck and don;t know what to do your teammate is there to help and show how to complete a task properly.
good,Nice place to work where everyone got along well. Customer service was always first. The truck team was great and we all had to work together to finish in a timely fashion.
good,"Big lots is a great company to work,you get paid weekly,work with both awesome customer's and employees. It's not very hard as long as you pay attention. You also get a nice discount as well."
good,"When I first started at Big Lots, I didn't have that much experience in retail, but as I started working my way up from a floor associate to css (customer service specialist), it felt like a great accomplishment. On the flip side, you really have to work efficiently to receive recognition. Most of the managers and co workers were very nice and helpful. When I was a CSS, I did get a pay upgrade but unfortunately I wasn't able to receive the proper benefits because I was part time. Later on before I left, the css job title no longer existed, letting cashiers be able to do returns. Thankfully they did not down grade my pay because of the change."
good,Nice place to work with pleasant management but too lax in policies which allows poorly performing workers to remain. It's easy to get a day off which is nice and they are forgiving of sick days.
good,My boss was rude and never liked to help us when we really needed it. The most enjoyable part was the associates. They hated the job like me but made the best out of it. It was really inspiring to see it
good,Truck days started at 4 we had a a set time to unload and then move the inventory out onto the shelves. As well as move and arrange all large furniture pieces.
good,Big Lots is a good place to work if you are in the right locations. The senior leadership is very organized and they are very ethical to work for. If you apply yourself you will move up rapidly if you are willing to relocate. Some markets do not attract the best associates and management resulting in high stress turnover situations. Sometimes very long hours are required and there is no compensation for this extra time. The energy in the company is the best part and the bonus structures are geared favorably to the management in the stores.
good,A typical at the job was first you must attend huddle meeting and stretches. You learn productive faster ways of doing work such as multiplying and how to handle picking up stuff the right way. Workplace culture laid back to a point. Hardest part of the job is going fast enough even when product such as desk being throwing on to a belt.
good,"The customers make it a fun and interactive environment to work in, the regular shoppers have smiles and laugh. the only thing is sometimes its boring to work there."
good,"I think this is a great job for someone that is just starting out. Everyone that I got to work with were very nice, and professional. The hardest part of my job was doing stock because sometimes things were heavy but it wasn't a big deal, also working in customer service can be annoying because of rude people hat come in but you also have your regulars and people that can just make your day. I made a lot of great friends with this job, and it was not a miserable place to be at, time always went by fast."
good,Management needs help...a lot of help. Managers need to be more patient with customers and employees alike. Too many employees not enough hours to go around.
good,"I either am helping unload trucks/stocking, cashiering or working on the floor. I have learned customer service thru this job. I also think some should get a job in retail just so you know what it is like to be on that side, and understand what they have to go thru. It's an alright job, I'm worked here while in school so it was something at least to help me pay for schooling. They were flexible with my hrs."
good,"A typical day was a breeze for me even though I was learning as I went, it came quite easy to me. I learned how to put a store together. I think I can put together a Wal-Mart, Target, CVS, or any type of store after this experience."
good,Not a nice store. It was not kept up. The shelves were dirty. Management was terrible. I got paid like six dollars an hour. It was my very first pay roll job. It was terrible. Unloading stock trucks moving pallets around.
good,Great place to work. Great location. Associates are very friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day and knowing that you were able to help them with their questions
good,"has benefits, customers are awesome, good work environment, I've learned a lot from employees, but experience is the best teacher, the most enjoyable part of big lots is working with people and helping them, the hardest part is satisfying the customers need when out of stock of a merchandise"
good,It was undergoing management changes while I was employed there so it seemed pretty unorganized and there was no supervision at times.
good,The job gets a little hard when your unloading a truck but other then that the job is great just needs to give more hours. They only hire for part-time I'm looking for full-time
good,I enjoyed working for Biglots. I enjoyed helping the customers with whatever they needed. My co-workers were great. It really felt like a team. The hardest part of the job was stocking or cleaning while cashiering. You definitely have to be good at time management. The most enjoyable part of my job was straightening out the clearance section. I would organize it so customers could find what they were looking for while also trying to make it appealing.
good,The crew at Big Lots was like one big family. I loved the atmosphere and customer driven work ethic.  We had a lot of regular customers that we had the chance to get to know very well.
good,They treated me wonderful for the most part. I learned many new things from them. They helped me out anytime I needed it. They had a few bad apples in the mix but overall I had a great experience.
good,it was a good place to work for. the management team was supportive to there workers. there was not a lot of hours to work.but i did have fun working there.
good,Good place to work. No much time for family. Long hours and overnight and weekends are a must. Coverage is minimal which means you have to do most of the work of 2 or 3 people.
good,This job was a basic retail job. You pretty much just stood there and rang out customers all day with a few breaks in between. Management was usually pretty good with how they treated the employees.
good,So a typical day at work is pretty much repetitive. I am a cashier and a stock person. I only make 8.00 an hour and ive been working here over a year and a half... i deserve a raise of some sort. They cut my hours for some new people that they hired. The new girls are makng 9.00 and up.... I dont know why or how that came to be. My co workers are all cool people.... I dont have any problems with them. Ilove working  where people are around i like to meet new people...  But i feel like ive been thru some much with the company i deserve some sort of evaluation so a raise can be givien and my hours can be given back to me.... I actually am off from sunday to next friday... Meaning i will only be working 5 whole hours... 8X5=40 thats all my check is going to be. I had to move back in with my mom after i started working here all because i couldnt afford to keep my apartment from my small checks. The only good thing i can say is that i get paid weekly so i can save and know that ill have a anothyer check ayt the end o0r the work week. Thats really  the only reason i am currently still working here..... If you dont have children this is the job for you.
good,"Mostly and enjoyable place to work. Sometimes the Politics of working with multiple managers becomes suffocating. Stagnate income. Ceilings are low even when advancing upwards within the company. However, if working in a High Volume store the bonuses are competitive."
good,"A typical day at work would start off at times doing all the go backs. Assisting to customers and doing recovery as in, organize the shelves. I learned how to be on the cashier and how to do NVO,s which is stocking items. Management was sometimes alright. Most of them are stressed some are in control. The hardest part of the job was the go backs and recovery around almost closing time. There would be a lot of customers going in the store so it was always busy. The most enjoyable part of my job were some of the employees. They are very friendly and nice."
good,A typical day consists of ringing up customers & standing all day. Fun enviroment. friendly staff & get paid weekly!! Cool management
good,Worked evenings. Recovery is an afternoon to closing position. Straighten shelves and return returned merchandise to shelves. Making store presentable for the next day. Most of the employees were nice. Provided customer service.
good,"A typical day at work consist of assistant customers with there merchandise and making sure there visit is pleasant and inviting, managing store, training associates on policies and procedures. Best part of my job is helping the customers.The hardest part about my job is it keeps me away from my family for long hrs of the day. but I love what I do."
good,"the 45 hour work week was a welcome change from most retailers.  There was alot of benefits, employee discount and special shopping days for employees.  A crew that was well rounded and worked well together.  Overall a very friendly place to work and learn."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, however, I do not enjoy being laid off without warning and given a paltry severance package."
good,Big Lots was a very good place to work at if was in school or had a another job. The manager's was great and would help with outside of the job problems. We order food some time an if people didn't have any money the would still order enough for everybody. I loved working there
good,"a typical day could be stocking shelves or moving product from the back to the sales floor. what i learned was inventory management, time management, how to deal with customers. management changed many times over 2 years. anytime with more then 1 boss got conflicting orders. fun coworkers that taught me things about work and ethics toward it. hardest part was either bad management or unloading of trucks in the winter. most enjoyable was helping people find what they needed."
good,"A typical day at work depends on the time I go in. Some day I am a cashier, others I am an overnight stocker. I have learned organization skills, improved my time management skills, and how to communicate with different individuals. My management is okay and i Love my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the lack of hours available"
good,I have learner a lot from all the management staff.  They are willing to teach if a person is willing to learn.
good,"Associate Manager: Managing employee's, providing customer service, checking  in direct store deliveries, unloading & stocking truck and sales as needed. All aspects and duties of Opening and closing of store."
good,"it was a fun work place because of my workmates, all of them were really welcoming, and really friendly. the management too was friendly, and also concerned about their workers, they helped the newbies when they could. the only thing i didnt like was the 4am schedule, i mean i could have asked for a evening shift but i prefered this one. it was too early, but i made sure to be their on time."
good,Working at Big Lots is an unique place to work at. My co-workers are nice and they all get the job done. They all respond well in pressured situations. I learned how to recovery and how not every item in the store has a designated home. They just go in the place that coorelate with the rest of the aisle. There hardest thing about my job is learn where some items are because they change some aisles around.The enjoyable part of my job is working with some of co-workers. They make work some much easier and make time go by faster.
good,A typical day at work when I clock in I would know to either finish a pallet I started the day prior or if one of the managers was in need of help I would ask Saturday was a busy day were i would be a cashier for the day the hardest part of the day would be doing carts in the heat or snow other than that it was a good well rouned job
good,"work was work"
good,A typical day at work would be checking customers out with their items. Talking to each of my customers like I have known them for a long time. Helping customers with their questions an concerns. Making them Happy!  I also worked well with my co-workers. We were a team. Management was great. Very understanding with a smile. The hardest part of my job was getting hours. The store was very slow out of season. Most of us would only get about 10 hr. a week unless you were full-time and full-time positions were slim to none.
good,"I learned how to correcting merchandise a retail store, how to read planograms & planoguides, how to process incoming freight, how to process damaged items and clearance items."
good,"Help customers"
good,"You better keep your eyes open, there are forklifts flying left and right. I learned how to use the AS400 database system. Management was very consistent in their rules and regulations. Co-workers were helpful and dependable. The hardest part of my job was working part time for a great organization. the most enjoyable part of my job was driving the brand new heavy equipment."
good,"I feel as a company big lots has favoritism.  There are some good aspects to the company.  First is the 20 percent discount on items. But the down side is the way they promote people within the company.  I knew an associate who applied for the part time CSS position. When the person found out that they gave to an individual who knew someone in management instead.  This associate was there for three years and had no write-ups, almost perfect attendance.  Also, biglots gives hours to people who do not do the work majority of the time.  mostly if you were a cashier you were given only 12.5 hours a week.  If you knew the store manager, you were given 27.5 because you are friendly with the manager.  I guess hard work does not go a long way.  They do have great sales, wonderful associates, and managers. But advancement is hard if you do not know someone within the company or kiss butt."
good,"loved my coworkers, they were like family, management was okay, store manager at the time had no clue what he was doing."
good,"I like working there, the people I work with and the customers.I just wish there were more hours."

Additionally, assumes responsibility of total store operation when acting as manager on duty.  Focal Points."
good,"Fun and exciting"
good,"At Store #4433 the Management team is terrible. The store manager doesn't take the time he should to learn everything. He refuses to learn how to run the furniture department, and he is always in his office, refusing to get on a register or do any work. He always takes 2-3 hour lunches, and often shows up late and leaves early."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Its a part-time job kind of place. The management is easy to get along with and they are all pretty reasonable. If you are a stocker, then your job will detail just that, stocking, pricing and properly displaying merchandise. As cashier your job include answering the phone, assisting the customers with anything they need, and handling the register."
good,"My Typical day at big lots normally consists of making sure that customers leave happy, keeping the the front end of the store neat and clean, and also answering phone call, handling returns. I have learned working at big lots that you really have to think ahead and prepare for anything. Co-workers and very good at getting along with each other: and management could use a little work with just making sure that all of the employees are on the same page. The hardest part of the my job is dealing with customers that seem like whatever you do to help they just aren't pleased. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i did a good job and seeing that i made someone smile and make the day ."
good,"Starting off in the mornings walk the store make sure recovery is in order and there are no safety hazards. Bathrooms, trash, assist with opening the registers and store. Make sure all my employees received their breaks and lunches accordingly. Greet and help every customer. At the end of the day I would help with closing the store assist with the deposit make sure the front end is ready to go for the next day. Management was great in the lower volume store but the higher volume stores could use some work. The hardest part of the job was during season change ( rebuilding displays and counters) it wasn't anything to challenging. The most enjoyable part of working at Biglots was working at Biglots. I loved the work I did, never had a bad day."
good,Working at big lots was fun for a while. I did learn to sell furniture and the most enjoyable part was assembling furniture. Most of the managers were friendly but some were not so much. My co-workers were all great team workers.
good,This is a good place to work.  The associates are very friendly and the managers are nice.
good,"Strong peer support.  "

Build and construct grand father clocks, bicycles, recliner chairs, bunk beds, computer desk, and many other types of furniture."
good,"A typical day would encompass dealing with unruly customers, happy customers, preparing the till's, verifying the deposit, and when required opening or closing the store. I learned how to properly execute a Code Adam and how demanding the retail industry can be. The management team was pretty good, but there was also high turnover with upper management. My co-workers did their jobs well and efficiently. The hardest part was when a customer suffered a heart attack and having to comfort a couple of kids that saw it occur, either that or Black Friday. The company during the first couple years that I was there would reward the employees with bbq's and with free food whenever we exceeded our goals."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and get a cart and was given a section of the store to place merchandise where it needed to be. (recovery) Then I was stocking merchandise and also running the cash register. I learned great customer service skills, due to this being my first job experience. Management was so, so. My co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of this job was dropping canned food on my foot, there was really nothing hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others and making friends."
good,cash customers out count out til stock shelf. meet new people not enough hours per week
good,"A regular day at work consists of running the front end as head cashier. Occasionally the store will get really busy, but this happens mostly around holidays. Other than this it is steady. At the end of the day we close up shop, clean up, and take care of the deposit."
good,I have a great manager who has shown me many great leadership skills and has made working for the company a great experience. I go in early like 4am I get my pallets and begin to put merchandise away in there departments on a normal day I can get out about 5 pallets. I usually do about 3 departments in 3 days then do odds and ends. I have to put out sale items and check add signs weekly.
good,"I worked at this location for 5 years. At times it could be very hectic, especially during the holidays, but it was always enjoyable. The management and my co-workers were all very friendly."
good,Always something to be doing and to get done. Learned much about customer service and merchandise. Fun place to work and shop..
good,"Typical day at work was bouncing between register, customers, and stocking. Truck days were just that we spent the day unloading the truck. Management was open door and easy to talk to. Co workers were fun and pulled their weight for the most part. I learned a lot about management and spent, six months in a management position. I would not say there is a hard part to the job. The most enjoyable for me was truck days cause we could dress in what we wanted and we had fun working together."
good,I got fired for not having adequate child care for a few non-consecutive days.
good,"Working at Big Lots is lots of work one works a little bit of everything through out the day, whatever the priorities may be for the day. I've learned the cash rigister, recovery, stock, how to run the warehouse, how to manage a team, and close the store. I've been logistics and associate manager with Big Lots. The hardest part of my job is that the day isn't long enough to get everything finished, there is so much that needs to be done and not enough people and time given. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I enjoy the customers the regulars almost become friends and I enjoy almost all the people I work with. I'm a very social person and general get along well with all people."

good,i liked working at this place and liked the people there also
good,The company is a fast growing company with alot of opportunities for advancement.The work load is very difficult in management with alot of days and nights. It is very difficult in understanding their reasons for the way they do things. Since it is a close out retail outlet you never know what to expect on deliveries with expectations for performance very high.
good,- Loaded/unloaded Stock- Work on the docks
good,It was fun to work here. Did not get a lot of hours. Not great ability to advance in the company. Great people to work with. Very good accommodating with your work schedule.

good,"I enjoyed working for big lots. We had our days but we did get through, customers sometimes got a little on the bad side but we always got through the day cause they were our first priority. Management worked well with us and were very easy to get along with . Hardest part of the job was really nothing we always got through the day with just a smile on our face and ignored the negativity. It was always about making the people happy."

good,I am really glad for the opportunity to work at Big Lots; it's great to be able to positively influence so many people and enjoy the working environment!
good,"Sometimes the employees were talked about by management in front of other employees. I felt like I wasn't properly rewarded for my hard work. I started off very excited to work there, but it got harder once I had to apply for medicaid and start to pack up boxes for moving. They said I was a good employee my attendance just wasn't acceptable, and I told them I understood and thanked them for everything they taught me and they wished me well, and said to take care of myself. I was a really good cashier they said. They taught me how to work a P O S system. If you open in the mornings you have to clean the bathrooms within a half an hour... which I thought was weird. They should do it at night before close. I loved my customers. I got so many good surveys of my performance."
good,"Nice place to work, good atmosphere,  management is great and the employees are nice also.  They also work around your availability.  The pay could be a little better but overall it is a decent place to work."

good,I had a really fun time working at big lots. I saw this as a job that I probably would have worked many years for.  It's a shame I had to move away :(
good,Not a bad place to work...had to wait a year for a 20 cent raise...very disappointed.  They don't give you alot of hours. They did buy lunch for everybody every so often and donuts too
good,The only issue I had with this job was hours. The manager wasn’t that bad it’s just the schedule they play with your hours of work. They always had a lot of workers there. Everything was very much in order. They always had security.
good,"Big Lots is a good place to work.  The work is challenging and the department that I work in is awesome.  The company is going through changes and with any growth, this does cause additional stress."
good,Its ok to work for the pay is decent.it could use some more leadership.and there no advancement in the company.you never know week to week how many hours your gonna get.
good,"A typical day at Biglot's consist of showing up to work on time, setting up the front of the store, displays, end cap's, furniture displays.  The next step is truck unload checking and unload the Bailer machine clearing and breaking down box for the Bailer machine. After the truck is unload stock the floor and shelves.  Everyday you learn something more about warranties and customer's services.  The hardest part of the job is multi- tasking and handling customers questions. the most enjoyable part of the job is balancing the truck load up to as many pieces as 2500 and verification of furniture shipment and other store items also prevent shrink items broken or damage in shipping cut down on damages."
good,"My time at Big Lots  was enjoyable, but  the hours restraint was too much. We were not allowed to work past 30 hours a week, so,I couldn't make enough to make ends meet."
good,There are lots of different items to buy. The store was set up pretty well. Some of the new items you get in are outside of the box. The customers are pretty nice.
good,"Big Lots is a good company to work for. A safe environment, friendly staff and friendly customers. I learned about inventory, I was doing a different activity everyday. Some days I was at the register assisting customers, some days I was on the sales floor assisting customers and other days I was restocking shelves."
good,Big Lots is a fun and learning environment to work at. It is great store to work at due to the fact that the management is easy to work with. It is an environment where you can creat great relationships with co-workers and customers.
good,The job itself was very fun and I had a great time working there. If I had the opportunity to stay past the part time/ seasonal position I would have.
good,"For a large store it's very relaxed, especially during the morning up until the afternoon.  I like the fact that even though we have goals for signing up people for rewards and credit cards, we don't have to low key coerce anyone."
good,It was a good working place I did a lot of work while I was there I remodeled broke down gondolas in walls and I rebuilt them along with shelves all throughout the storm then I restocked and unload a trucks but the payday go back down after night shift was over

good,"It was a lot of fun being able to work here. But it was not always just fun and games. We had to take care of our job, and what needed to be done. Fun and games came later. Everyone I worked with was so sweet and accepting. We had 3 managers. The hardest part of the job would be when I had to greet customers when I first got hired on because i was so nervous. I had a lot of enjoyable times their. we were able to just joke around, and not be so serious all the time."
good,working at big lots as a customer specialist was fun and demanding. In retail when it gets busy its really busy and you meet all sorts of people from all walks of life.
good,Good place to work.  I really enjoyed the fact that every has been there for so many years.  The average employee seemed to have over 15 years of service with the company.
good,Enjoyed being an auditor at Big Lots Distribution Center. It was exciting to see products that would be going into the stores especially aroynd the holidays
good,The store I worked in was very old and the main manager wasn't very professional. It was always a fun work environment otherwise. Loved it. The pay wasn't great and the hours could have been better. I tried asking for more hours or take people's shifts if needed.
good,"I have been employed at big Lots since February 2019 and at times it can really be enjoyable but when dale signs do not match the item or customers do not read the fine print for sales, this and only this becomes a serious problem. Overall not a bad place to work. Very flexible hours, wonderful employees."

good,The job can occasionally be stressful depending on coworkers. Good chances for job advancement. lunches can be too short or seem short only 30 minutes. sometimes tasks are given that are not realistic.
good,"I had learned a lot working for biglots. I learned organizational skills and most importantly is how to deal with the public on th day to day basis. also the employee discount is a bonus because yoy can use it on everything the store has to off, plus biglots gives out an extra 10% off towards furniture and seasonal products."
good,"I worked the truck, and it was a bit of a hassle sometimes but the crew we had was fun, and we always got it done in a good amount of time. The store environment was pretty relaxed."
good,"Management very easy to communicate with. Easiest part of job is waiting on customers. Hardest part of job is dealing with low hours."

good,"Laid back environment, work basically at your own pace . Not too much heaving lifting . They’re pretty good about giving you the time off that you need also ."
good,"Big Lots had a store manager and a furniture manager and were basically running 2 separate stores. "

good,"Great place for a quick buy on almost everything you need. Cheap prices and tons of stuff to choose from wether it be a DIY, food/snacks or even home decor"
good,This position allowed me to maintain a work/ life balance while completing my degree. I was able to be flexible in my schedule regarding my schooling.
good,Big lots has great morale. The people at work are like actual family.pay could be better tho . I have to work another job because the work days are inconsistent .Some days the truck is cancelled and i only work two days a week. Big lots supplements my primary source of income.
good,big lots was a fun environment during the holiday seasons I was able to connect with all the customers and  really enjoy working there with the community and staff
good,Since I started at Big Lots nine months ago I have learned quite a bit that I hadn't experienced before in the food industry. It was nothing like what I expected. I've been treated better here by management and my coworkers than in my last couple of jobs and enjoy it.
good,Many changes over the last couple years with the company. Learned many new ways to  manage with all the changes and making the store successful. Working with the many people was the best part of the day.
good,This is a job for people who would like to make extra money on the side. Short shifts and easy work. A typical day for a cashier is ringing up customers and keeping the front end clean and presentable.
good,"Management in Brunswick is nice."
good,"Loved working for this company, always something to do to keep you busy. Only reason I left was to become a stay at home mom to my newborn daughter. Management was always courteous"
good,Working at Big Lots is a great way to get into the wold of retail. People who would prep the store would go in the early hours of the morning to make sure that everything was neat and tidy before the store opened. Throughout the day your duties include stocking shelves and assisting customers.

good,"The hours were good, got a lot done but for the most part it was seasonal but for the time being and working there, their were great hours and a decent amount of work."
good,I loved working at Big Lots because i loved helping the customers as well as being in charge of the cashiers and store. I liked doing refunds and answering phones as well.
good,Lazy management made schedule according to her own personal life if she needed a weekend off she scheduled it but if you ask she would say we were too short handed to allow that
good,Home town feel with the regular customers came in the same time every week.Eployees were good and ready to work everyday.felt like a family atmosphere-
good,"every day was different , you had to be a great planner and have"
good,Big Lots was a very good place to work. There was a good a rapport between team members and management. The work was fast paced at times but everyone worked together to get the job done.
good,experience depends on what department you work in. The company is a very good company with great executive leadership and philanthropy. Some of the tools are a bit dated and this company does not provide the training that other retailers have. There are some wonderful people here that really support each other.
good,"On any given day it was a good job , there is always those customers that make you wish you were there but it wasn't a constant thing there. smaller store so you know everybody."
good,This was an amazing place to work! The only reason why I left was because i found a higher paying job with more hours! The staff was extremely fun and out going. Management was great as well.
good,"Working at Big Lots was a great experience for me, I enjoyed working in retail. All of my co-workers were great individuals and were fun to work with."
good,Supervisors only have limited knowledge of simple repairs. Not used to someone correcting more difficult problems without outside help. Started on graveyard expecting to move to days. Never happened. Longest I have worked nights since I was a teenager. Manager has but one goal and that isto get boxes in trucks as fast as possible as to not pay temps any longer that necessary.
good,"Most places are nice to work at, as long as you work and do not waste time.  The work can be dead to hectic in a matter of minutes.  You are required to work with many different customers and normally when working you must multi-task, since they are always under manned."
good,"I operated a cash register, assisted customers,rounded up carts,sweep and mop floors,stocked soda coolers,stocked shelves.Learned different techniques with dealing with difficult customers.Management was very helpful in training employees concerning stocking. employees worked well as a team and assisted others when needed.  I enjoyed working with customers and helping  them with there purchases."
good,"Its a well rounded company but still small and there are just not enough opportunities for advances, and the incentives to stay are not very encouraging."
good,"Big lots is a great place to work as a starter job or a retirement job. Certain days are slow and others are very busy, so you get a feel for the retail workplace in slow and fast paced environments. Management is friendly, patient and helpful. The associates are all friendly and bring something different to the table. Over all it's a solid place to work."
good,"A typical day involves a lot of stocking and organizing the shelves. I learned about merchandising and doing projects. The management was great, overall. The workplace culture was decent. The hardest part of the job was trying to put back returns in the right place because the store is disorganized most of the time. The most enjoyable was the discount."
good,i liked working there it was fun i meet alot of people. the management there is awsome and understanding. i never had a problem there i miss working there
good,A Typical Day At Work  : I would start out on the sales floor in the furniture department  speak with customers about what the wanted and or what they needed.  I would assist them with loading furniture they had purchased.
good,when I worked there I had great management.  I moved quickly from a stocker to management.  I was given training to succeed.  I enjoyed working there.
good,Fun fast paced place to work just not a lot of hours part time people can still do 401k and stock investments great management team hardest part of job is doing stock because store is not planogramed for everything so you have to find places for stuff to go the most enjoyable part f the job is the customers It depends on my work day sometimes I cashier other times I do stock so if cashiering I front and face shelves keep store clean and wait on customers if stocking you work at a faster pace put the stuff on the shelves would be a good job for a teenager or some one not wanting to work a lot of hours
good,"The managers aren't always on the same page, but I like how the employees are like one big family.  I learned how to properly throw freight. I learned how to sell furniture and how to give better customer service."
good,I've learned a lot about management and leadership here. It can be really slow then exceptionally fast on some days. The hardest part of the job is when it is really slow and there is nothing to be worked on so that you can be effective.
good,Big Lots isn't as technological advanced as some other stores. It has outdated technology but besides that it's a pretty decent place to shop and work.
good,typical day was me on the register unless they needed me to stock shelves or face products. i liked working with the public.
good,"A typical work day at Big Lots would consist of me greeting and ringing up customers, answering phone, and stocking and fixing shelves along the way. What I learned while working at Big Lots is learning how to deal with customers even if they are rude and disrespectful, by just carrying on with a positive outlook. The culture that was in Big Lots was very diverse, so everyone has an opportunity. There were no hard parts of working at Big Lots because it was a very enjoyable place to work."
good,"I love working at Biglots because the job provides me opportunity to interact with people daily. Also, the work atmosphere, work ethics, team work make the ob less stressful and fun."
good,Interacting with the public while saling furniture makes the day fun. I do enjoy informing the customers about the furniture they are buying. As well as seeing them pleased with their purchase. It is hard sometimes when dealing with an angry customer but it is understandable because they are clearly upset with their product. Management is positive and determinded managers.
good,"I liked working there "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of offering customer service, unloading furniture as well as other store products, assembling furniture, explaining and selling all products, and keeping the store fully stocked and presentable. Learned how to humble myself and maintain a strong work ethic in all areas. It was a fast paced workplace, but we always kept customers happy which was the most important. Unloading 2,000 piece trucks with one other person while organizing the items as we unloaded them. Knowing I did my very best to keep customers happy."
good,This was a great job. I loved working here. sometimes there was only 3 people working. No security leaving at night was scary. always busy. great workout.
good,"The company itself isnt too bad they give reasonable hours, but the managers and the fact there is no micro managing allows for bad business. The breakrooms are very basic and usually filthy, the buildings are outdated and falling apart, shipments for planogram updates always missing parts and your expected to work with what you got. I have personally seen 4 shelves full of heavy product give way and very surprised no one has been seriously injured."
good,"Putting furniture together, unloading truck trailers, putting things on shelves, sweeping and mopping the floors, helping other people bought out the store to they cars."
good,"Management gives employees a fair amount of autonomy to perform their daily tasks with the understanding that the customer comes first and frequently will take priority over other job details. "
good,"It was a small store, but there is always something to do at work. "
good,"Awesome, fun work atmosphere. Plenty of opportunities for advancement. Only downside is the hours. Too many overnight shifts for stocking inventory. But generally a pleasing facility for people who enjoy working hard to feel accomplished."
good,"Pros: Good people to work with at my location, hours can somewhat be flexible within reason and it is a laid back environment."
good,A day working for Big Lots was fast pace in the mornings. After the truck was unloaded the day was mellow. My coworkers was very down to earth. They made the day go by quickly. To me there was no hard part about the job. But what I found to be the most enjoyable about the job was unloading the truck.
good,"The job over all is pleasant. However, we have been short staffed and the high manager has yet to hire more people which in turn means more hours (plus side) and more work (negative side) for us all."
good,They work with your schedule and their is always work to do so you have to go out of your way to get bored. Everyone has a good attitude and cares about their work.
good,Asst. Manager was hard to work for. Rest of the team was awesome. Co-workers were hard working. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with daily tasks while trying to help customers and keep store clean.
good,Great place to work. Plenty of hours. Guaranteed job security. Learned to run several different types of machinery. The management was very good. Co-workers were helpful and effective.
good,Love all the associates that I personally work with. Management has trouble comprehending how much work we put in and don't appreciate how long the employees have stayed when they are scheduling all the work hours to the new highers.
good,"Good team to work with in a daily work environment. Improvement could be made in the Human Resource Dept., making it more employee freindly"
good,I enjoyed working here because all of the employees and management were like family. We enjoyed doing our jobs and we had fun and were productive as a team.
good,"Fantastic company that first gave me my first chance of being a store Manager, fantastic supportive upper management with a great culture and fantastic fun company image."
good,"I liked this company. The management was fun and understanding. Store was organized and the schedule was flexible. The pay was a little on the low side, but all duties were more than capable for me. Enjoyed working with the customers and the employee discount helped me as well!"
good,"The management is good. Hardest part of the job is unloading truck. Most enjoying part of the job is cashiering. Co-workers are friendly,and easy to get along with."
good,enjoyed my job and getting to know my employees and regular customers. I did not like working the extended hours in the summer and 3rd shift stocking but that is to be expected with a big company.
good,"I had worked for Big Lots for almost a year as a Retail associate and Stocker from 2013 to 2014 in Diamond Bar, CA. I only worked weekends which consisted of coming to work on Friday from about 4am-7am and then Saturday and Sunday from 5pm-9pm. The work was fairly simple: unload trucks in a fast pace and stack the inventory onto separate pallets. I remembered one time Our crew had to unload in the rain so it was a bad call for a day to unload a truck. Around the holidays there's the occasional two trucks instead of one, so you'll be able to score some overtime. The sales floor is a whole different story as you have to organize everything on the shelves in the aisles and make sure to put back all go backs. While doing this, you must help out any customers. During my job, I've had to answer the phone while our cashier was handling customers. Always memorize your aisles and where everything goes because the aisles can change based on the season or what Big Lots has selling. There have been occasions where I've had to look through the whole warehouse to find a item for a customer and not know where it is. This job can either be the easiest job or most annoying job. I do recommend this as a first job to those either seeking part time work while in school or etc. Most people that shopped there were equally nice, but sometimes you can get the easily upset customers or the ones that ask for a item to which you don't have or that simply don't exist. There were even customers shopping with a cart full of stuff and then leave because they either couldn't afford it or just wanted to pretend"
good,"Big Lots is a good company to work for. They give you good employee discounts and they make sure that you as in employee are  "
good,I enjoy worker with my co-workers and management team.  I have worked for this company for four years and built great working relationships and a routine work environment.
good,"This is a good first job. Depending on what position you're working, your day could be a number a different experiences. Management is good, they make sure you have your breaks, the people you work with a pretty cool too! There's never a dull moment. "
good,the employee are very nice and very helpful. It very clean and things are always where they belong. I had a great time working there.
good,"My typical day is work is to come in and at 8 am and clean bathrooms. Then at 9 am the store opens and I go to the register and begin to help customers with items that may need to be purchased. I handle returns also. I am the only cashier in the store for about 3 hours. My co-workers come in and help with placing items back that customers have returned. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers select the the items that they want or need. Every Thursday morning I come in at 6 am. I come in to unload the truck in warehouse, back of store. After unloading the truck we then begin to separate items that to out on the shelf. I get help from 3 co-workers to separate items. It's myself and one other co-worker that places the boxes on the belt while unloading the truck.  I am a store associate. We don't always get a lunch break, it depends on how many hours you are working. I am a part time worker so sometimes I only work 6 hours. There is no lunch break for associate working six hours. All in all I really enjoy the job."
good,"Big Lots is actually a pretty cool place to work for. Before I worked there, I shopped there. Being a wholesale buy-out store you see a lot of different items that come from various stores at a lower price."
good,i liked that i had a job and got to help people and make the place a little bit of money but i also just didnt like the changing my hours and the crazy hours that i was given
good,"All of my co workers were very friendly and my managers helped me whenever I had a question. Everyone made the work environment a fun place, but we were always working hard."
good,I spend my days ensuring our freight gets worked out and planning for the next truck. I also take interviews whenever I find a suitable candidate to possible hire for the team. Other members of management are friendly and helpful. The job is fairly easy I find but can get difficult when other fall behind in their work. I do my best to complete my work and help them complete theirs. I find that my favorite part of the job is the interaction with the people.(Customers and employees) I strive to provide the best customer experience I can as well as make it my store the best work environment possible.
good,I Enjoy Working At Big Lots Because Of The Relaxed Work Place And Pretty Cool Managers Also Because Of The Paid Breaks And Very Patient Customers
good,"bad management, not a happy, fun environment to work in, but was a great learning experience for myself. My time there I made the best of, also the job kept me on my feet and active."
good,Overall everyone was nice. Job was primarily furniture sales. Other duties included general cleanup at the end of the shift. Shift hours varied from week to week.
good,I began my career as a manager here. I experienced so much from sharpening my customer service skills to expanding my knowledge and vocabulary to set myself above my peers and proving that I can be a successful manager. Most of my job responsibilities were very hands on from unloading product to processing merchandise and setting floor plans we were very involved in teaching a lead by example management style. What I enjoyed most was understanding how location can effect results and realizing the effects of upper management guidance and how being positive and hardworking will naturally lead a team to success. I took all of these lessons and attributes to my current career at Stage Stores.
good,Good place to work with managers you can get along with without losing that sense of authority for them. Get along great with other coworkers and enjoy the vast array of customers with colorful personalities that come in
good,"I started there as an order picker, then moved to the receiving department in order to obtain a full time position. Now I unload and receive anything from chips and crackers, to lawn chairs and furniture. Once unloaded and stage I must label the product properly and from there the product gets put away. Depending on the type of trailer you need to unload we use the stand up forklift, the clamp, or the slip sheet."
good,The job was fun and i love meeting new people and learning new work skills. It was great work constantly moving furniture and walking around meeting and conversing with customers. The co-workers were mostly nice and the mangers there were very understanding and easy to get along with. The hardest part about the job was trying to make every customer left happy and got what they were looking for.
good,"I felt that Big Lots was a good place to start a career.  As though a lot of places they began to feel the economic crunch, and drifted away from the customer aspect.  I thought we were traveling in two different directions."
good,Great people to work with. Understanding to personal situations and willing to work with me. Love the atmosphere. I am sure there is opportunity to advance I just need to find the time to apply on-line.
good,We would unload the truck and place all the product in the warehouse and break it down and price tag everything. Learned sales and customer service and rotating products. There was no hard part in this job and the most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they were looking for and see the satisfaction on there face.
good,Enjoyed meeting all the customers. I learned new skills all the time. The management team is great. Co-workers great. Just not alot of room for advancement.
good,"It's usually very fast paced and there's always something to do. If there happens to be a lack of customers that day, well then you can always clean around the service desk or do other duties that are required of you on a daily basis.  Overall it's a nice place to work."
good,"Management was very nice and understanding. For part-time employees, they are very flexible with your work schedule."
good,Loved how he coworkers worked as a team and acknowledged each others weak points and hleped out. Management always there to help when needed.
good,"A surprise in every aisle, and a new adventure everyday! Five years with the company, and I've been promoted twice. I've been blessed to have great leadership on my journey."
good,"Had various duties, kept job challenging...Great prices, excellent discounts always there to score the awsome clearances..."
good,"I loved working here, the managers were so nice and made everything easy to do."
good,"Good balance sheet."
good,"Fast Paced during Christmas time.  No chance for seasonal help to be hired on, even though they said I would be."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job at Big Lot's. On a day to day basis, I am allowed to communicate and interact with costumers that you get attached to. My co-workers are easy going people that make the job a fun place to go to on a daily basis, but the hardest part of working here is the unset schedule and the low amount of hours that each person is allowed to work."
good,Love the upper management team. They do what they can to help you and your endeavors.
good,"typical day would be very long with short bursts of customers. i learned to deal with cash i large amounts. my co workers were just that co workers. most of them didnt do their job correctly or at all. hardest part of my job would have to be the stand around waiting for a customer. since i was the css i would have to stay at the front desk to answer phones and take care of customers. most mornings i was the only cashier and would have to wait till noon for a back up. the management could have used som work, most of the time they werent around when you needed them and when they were they werent happy about it. the part of my jopb i enjoyed most was making the customers laugh. the majority of the customers had a full cart and would be a the register for 5 to 6 min."
good,"open store, stock aisles with product, run front register, handle returns and exchanges"
good,"A typical day in this job includes assisting customers, putting out merchandise in the store, cleaning up the store, and cashiering."
good,"I really enjoyed Zellers because I was always doing something different, I was either Customer Service, Merchandising or on Cash. Over all Zellers was a fun place to work and the management was also good off and on, I had 3 different managers well I worked there, 2/3 were good. The one that wasnt just needed more training otherwise she was good. Zellers was closing and that was the only reason why I left, the hardest part of the job was I always had evenings and weekends and I either had great hrs or none. Overall great place to work."
good,"A typical day for me at work was overall, great. I had good co-workers, I liked the customers, and the learning experience was fun. Management had it's up's and down's but, was all right. The hardest part of my job was the Health and Beauty Care center. It was one of the hardest to keep maintained and organized. The most enjoyable part was learning something new and different."
good,Big Lots has become more customer focused than in the past and this has really helped create loyalty in their shoppers
good,"Started the day with a huddle meeting, safety was on peoples minds and addressed quite often."
good,"The company was constantly growing. Always changing and bringing in new ideas, willing to listen to associate feedback and adjust things accordingly. "
good,"I enjoyed most of my time I worked there. I usually unloaded truck, stocked shelves, got carts, and did maintenance. Some days where not so great as the service desk would interrupt one so much for carts that stock counts fell below ones needed amount. Basically, one would get in trouble if not enough stock was put up or one did not answer the service desk needs in order to make the box count."
good,"A typical day at work would be to manage co-workers.  Getting everyone situated and making sure they are performing their duties as per requested.  I would also get coin, do pick ups for the cashiers.  Recovery is an important asset, making sure the store is clean is an important thing.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with some of the best people i have met and learning from them as they learn from me.  This job can be stressful sometimes but that comes with any trait of any business.  It doesn't matter what job you have the stress always comes with it.  It's how you deal with it that matters the most.  I love, love my customers, dealing with the public is a tricky trait but so worth it.  Meeting new people everyday is rewarding most of the time."
good,I just stocked shelves. I learned to be patient. the co-workers were in their own world.
good,"Management was good seemed like everyone was on the same page.Biggest thing I learned work here was trying to help customers with their needs, merchandising for upcoming ads. I loved the fact that my staff and myself always reached are quarterly goal."
good,Big lots is a good starting place for a career in retail. they maintain fairly small crews so I felt welcomed and part of something special right away. Their compensation/benefits leave a lot to be desired but I still have enjoyed my time here
good,"I have learn to relate with peole."
good,"everyday was mapped out,  but sometimes frustrated with mishaps,  employee call-ins,  technical issues taking away time for tasks,  manager not always fair on week end rotations,  most employees hard workers,  keeping up with changing sets and seasonal sets always a challenge but when when sales are good and we're #1 in district thats good"
good,"Great learning experience, I had great training. Great people and team. "
good,"Atypical day was helping customer with there purchases, cleaning my area, always having a balanced drawer and help with customer service."
good,"at work cleaning and recovering the area and cleaning any mess is on my area, at the front cashier having a good day treating people the best posible and smiling and doing my job right the only thing would be when some one gets mad when they have to return something, but cashier is a good job and fun, you get to talk to people and get everything right"
good,everyone was so nice and fun. everyone worked as a team. they would work with your hours with you.
good,"I loved every aspect of my job with Biglots other than most employees do not get full time and part time is considered 12 hours a week, and that was not enough hours for me at the moment."
good,"Room for growth within company, friendly and helpful co-workers, reasonable pay rate, very flexible scheduling for employees with other jobs and those who were attending school."
good,"the work their sucked the co workers was cool the manger was a pain in the you no what the hardest part was the production period that you had to pass. getting strap to a harnest was pretty fun,"
good,there is no typical day at work everyday is different and there is something new to learn everyday which helps you grow more everyday.
good,"Provide leadership skills to insure associates had knowledge,tools, and resources to accomplish a successfull store closing. Takes the initiative to carry out any assignments without direction. I openned and closed the store. I also was the leader of the trucks. I am a very active worker who sets goals that are reachable. I am always wanting to learn more and go farther then expected."
good,"Would come in count the drawer and get my work space cleaned. I learned how to deal with my customers, managers, and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my day was to meet new people and make them smile and laugh."
good,"On a typical day I will unload and put away a furniture truck, call customers to follow up with purchases, assemble new items, handle furniture sales, answer emails and complete administrative work, and merchandise department."
good,Learned a positive way to train an employee. Management and co-workers were exceptional. The hardest part of the job was learning to not take complaints from customers personally. I enjoyed working with people of the community and helping to serve their needs.
good,Able to move up fast and great management staff.
good,I started out as an Assistant Manager and was promoted to Store Manager within 6 months of starting with the company. I worked many hours. I was involved with the overall operations of the store. It was an extremely busy store. My store was in the top 3 stores out of 15 in the district. The hardest part was keeping associates since the company only allowed me to hire part-time. Most people need to work more than 2 days a week.
good,"A typhical day consisted of reading e-mails, reporting to coperate and planning the day for myself and all associates."
good,My coworkers were hard working people who took pride in their work and enjoyed working. Being able to buy all different items for low prices is a big deal no matter the day or person rich or poor. I appreciate the time I had with this company.
good,"During the time I worked there, I just got to work 1 day a week and I tried asking manager for more hours and he would say ""I'm not fast enough"" and would not give me more hours of work, but the job culture was good, there was light security to none so I didn't feel safe at times, I felt like I worked too hard for what I was earning, there's not many employees working there throughout the day."
good,While working at big lots i got to know what kind of customers are really out there. It was a comfortable environment. I learned a lot about customer service
good,Fun place to work.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Management was good to work for.  It was very laid-back and you didn't feel like you were being babysat.
good,"I cashier beginning in the mornings, usually at opening, and continue into the mid-afternoon."
good,It is a fun environment. Management is supportive of its employees.They employee discounts are great and at the location I worked at Management provided complimentary lunch and food around the holidays.
good,"Hardest management job in the building"
good,The Winchester VA store was much better then I expected. I was reluctant to do retail but the employees made it better. The managment was awesome too. The pay isn't great and you cant really survive on it. The hours were very flexible and everyone is willing to work with you. I would've stayed if I didnt move away. Good times
good,"They really try to make sure that you feel like you belong in the General office and overall, is one of the top places I've worked. It is definitely a place where you could make a career there."
good,It's like any other retail store you come in click in read the daily board to see what's your position on that day go to talk to a manager to double check if it right then start your day
good,I enjoyed talking to people both employees and customers. I liked the closeness I have with the employees. I was in charge of the cashiers and the customer service that they provide. I know the job of everyone from stockers to the managers
good,Family oriented. Everyone works as a team.  Some of the work can be stressful but that comes with any job.  Management works with you when you need time off.
good,having new projects every week is helpful to make the work day go faster. new projects means there is always new items for the customer to keep coming back . working with the same team members helps make a good working team and help work go smoothly and efficiently.
good,Great place to work for a part-time job. Not so great if you need full-time hours or want to advance in the workplace. Very understanding and wonderful management. The only issue is moving up in the company or switching to a department you would excel in more.
good,If you enjoy working retail and customer service then the environment and work culture here is great. The right mixture of associates and the right managers makes all the difference.
good,"Big Lots has been like a second family for me. My manager is always concerned about the health and safety of her workers. She is compassionate and reasonable. She is not a pushover either. She listens to everyone who needs to share and considers all aspects. Most importantly, I feel very safe at work. I am grateful to work with the people around me."
good,"The Big Lots I worked at had a fun work environment and they payed more than eight dollars. The work drama is little to none just mind your business and do the task assigned; the most difficult part was moving furniture and cleaning and dealing with certain customers and when it gets busy it gets busy so be prepared to work but, I guess that goes for any job.."
good,Difficult job. Well compensated. Team oriented. DTS process is all hands on and usually happens in the early AM. DM was very experienced and knowledgable
good,"Customer service. Assists customers as the walk in. Great people to work with. Stock merchandise. Focusing on the customers, making sure they have a good shopping experience."
good,"Big lots is a good experience job , you deal with customers. Learn customer service , and learn to deal with money. When I started working there I was very shy and didn't talk much but interacting with customers helped me a lot with that."
good,My managers always support me in everything. They encourage me and help me to finish my task. I've got very cheerful management. My managers are so welcoming and always have positivity on their face.
good,"Working for Big Lots gives you experience in many different ways such as working as a register operator, floor associate, stocker, and a furniture sales man."
good,Every day is different..always something to do.. people are usually good to work with . It is hard work and enjoyable if you like to be busy. Management was very helpful in my years of work as training me .there is constant change .
good,"Learning stocking produce was fun espically since i am very OCD and have to be organized and always stayed on the out-dated foods/drinks. Learning how their register worked and answering the phones, multitasking was a bit much for me but i gotten the hang of it."
good,"A typical day at big lots consists of opening, walking around to ensure store meets their expectations, you learn to communicate with customers properly and answer their questions."
good,"amazing people and awesome company to benefit from and they are amazing well-organized and jolly people, very fun and good vibes. i enjoyed being a cashier here"
good,Good company to work for when you want to work for a living. Wish they had more full time positions other than just managment but overall a good company to work for.
good,"Nice place to work at, started 2013 to 2018. The reason i quit not good pay, for a person that has a family and needs to support , that has a house and bills. I love working around people and doing customer service’s always have a smile on my face and always made customers come back to our store. Would of stayed for more pay."
good,"This is a typical day for me. I am a Lead Support for management which means I act as MOD when they are in conference calls, or busy assisting customers. I assist cashiers when they need change, an override, etc. I also assist customers on the sales floor, do carry-outs, assist co-workers when needed and put out merchandise."
good,Very productive and you can move up fairly easily. The training is 12 weeks which can feel like forever but it is worth it.  Your coworkers really make your experience.
good,"I liked working at this place it;s laid back no one is down your throat trying to bash you or anything it;s safe and a very great place to work. The staff members are great people who love to laugh, joke and show how much they really care for there job"
good,Your typical retail job. The management staff I had to chance to work with were great. The atmosphere I experienced was fairly easy-going. There was the random customer that was over the top but that's everywhere.
good,"Great place to work . good benfits,good pay, good product . Most days worked 7 to 3 pm. Lots of freight trucks every week. Furniture is good and fairly priced"
good,It’s a good laid back place to work but not for the long haul. If you want a good career move. This is not the job. I do enjoy the people I can’t act with but for a family man this is only a pit stop.
good,"Prior to frelanceing and contractual work, I was in several department stores and performed above average tasks. I'm very computer and tech savvy. I grew up playing the piano and I know how to handdraft. Everything falls into place in due time and i would love to have a desk job with some on the floor in the house duties as well."
good,"Big lots was a fun company to work for except for having to clean the bathrooms. Overall , i had an amazing time working at big lots and with the people there but with the hours per week i was receiving I knew I had to get out of there as soon as i could."
good,Good place to work positive atmosphere good management managers and coworkers our team members great opportunities to move up in management and become team leaders
good,You can make your own schedule and the workers are very friendly. Sometimes it is hard to get hours but they try to give you what you want. Breaks are convenient.
good,Big Lots is a great place to work if you are going to school and need a place to get some extra money. The hours are flexible and they are good about working with your schedule.
good,I enjoyed my time at Big Lots they don't require anything unreasonable from their employees. It's just a part time job but if you're willing to work they'll give you hours.
good,"if you just graduated from high school and need a place to start your life, well big lots is that place. good people, great attitude, and great policy."
good,Not enough payroll allotted to get the job done correctly.  The majority falls on Managements backs!  Restructuring should be done across the board.  Good pay!
good,You would come in and log in and get with a manager to see what they need you to do for your shift. I would come in as a cashier to the front registers and ring up every customer and do returns for the store. I would take payments.
good,Excellent job for beginners in retail. You learn how fun and stressful it is. The managers are super helpful and will work around your schedule. You get holiday pay and even get mini gifts like a gift card for doing a great job.
good,Customers are friendly and I never get overwhelmed. Management is very professional and trustworthy. Coworkers are very reliable and the energy is very positive .
good,A typical day generally consists of replenishing the floor and preparing for a busy sales day. Delivering excellent customer service  while recovering for the next day.
good,"Big lots a good company to work for. Employee friendly. Have jobs asdi3to you like stocking shelves unloading trucks,. Company very big on safety. 1 hour lunch."
good,"Management- Communication  is poor and abuse of Authority"
good,"I had the duty of unloading trucks while selling furniture to customers, often taking their furniture out to their vehicles and loading it up. I also ran the registers while answering phone calls and delivering excellent customer service to customers that walked through the doors."
good,Great place to work if you need a part time job I loved it just didn't make enough money for me or my family but I would highly recommend this jobs to anyone needing a part time position.
good,Lots of opportunities to learn retail and operating business. Some good fun and people.Like family . If you work hard it pays off. You can show what you know and learn different  jobs.
good,It's easy to thrive if you are a hard worker. The new store manager does s good job. You always stay busy.  They just need to more selective of the people they hire.
good,During my time at Big Lots I enjoyed working with many different people and meeting all the regular customers. I was a cashier and was always busy either checking customers out or straightening the area around the registers.
good,"BIg Lots was a nice place to work. Great environment, with awesome people. Customers are always gonna be customers, but with great management and employees seems like a decent place. Great for a temporary getting on your feet job."
good,"This company gave me more headache and heartache than aby other in history. I will put it bluntly, some of the senior management are a complete bunch of moronic goons, but senior staff above them are wonderful. Most employees and management staff at the store level are more than willing to go the extra mile to help and the staff they hire on are quite friendly and will work hard as long as you respect them. Wish we were paid more."
good,"I currently work in the Hicksville store. I have had my moments I just want to walk out and feel like working here isnt worth it. Most of the associates have im sure. The reason I stay even tho the pay is HORRIBLE is because its a nice EXTRA job. Everytime I have had a problem the managers have tried to help me. They try very hard to keep to me happy (other associates too will find them extra hours if they need). They work around schedules from my other jobs. I can put in mt availability months ahead of time. When I left my other job all the big lots aasociates welcomed me to the family. We bring in food for each other, treat each other to smothies and try to help each other whatever way we can. The customers are usually very friendly and patient very nice work environment."
good,"Working through the different departments of the store, you learn what different requirements are needed for the store to be successful. When working for different managers, you learn different work styles and how to improve your own."
good,"Not a bad job except its only part time. You are not going to support a family, or even yourself really, on only this job. The management at my store was competent though."
good,Big lots is a good place to work. Especially if you have two jobs or just want part time. But overall a pretty good place to work. The management is easy going.
good,I loved working for Biglots until I needed to change my position. The company is a good starter job. It’s offers a discount that most jobs don’t. And you get paid every week. Only hires 18 years of age or older.
good,"Come into work and clock in, and begin setting up your register for the day. Recovery (setting the shelves) takes about 2-3 hours for the whole store. But they would still rather you go back over it repeatedly, while also working the register, this isnt hard when low on customers. "
good,"This is the perfect place for people who have a good work ethic, flexible schedule, and want less than 20 hours per week.  At times it can be really fast-paced, specially during Christmas time.  Customers were a joy. Lots of regular shoppers.  Made a lot of friends and some of my co-workers became part of my family."
good,Fun place to work. Hectic during holidays.  Pay was okay. Paid vacation and sick days.offered insurance. Manager was okay to work with. Good camera system.
good,I would constantly hear others talking bad about others. I was supposed to get trained for furniture but never did. I was fired due to being new and not being able to make it due to bad snow
good,Working in a warehouse we were always on a time schedule and had goals that we wanted to meet everyday. Our team worked close and trusted each other in order to get things done right the first time. My managers were always clear on instructions and offered assistance when needed.
good,Store is fun to work at. Can be very demanding especially during the holiday season. open door policy allows you to feel comfortable addressing any situation.
good,"The truck would come at about 5am, we would work together to unload boxes off truck. I would then start taking product out of boxes and creating a UPC for each item. From there we would go and place new product on shelves and take old off if needed."
good,"During my time there, I assisted in a remodel. A typical day starting out was moving product shelving and cleaning. After the remodel, I was a general store associate. A Typical day would involve store recovery, cleaning, and product presentation on store shelves. Managers are fairly flexible."
good,I worked there basically the whole time that I was pregnant. I went back after I had my daughter but was considered a re hire and it did not pay me to drive that far for the pay. I got a job closer to home. I left on a good note and still shop there. I love that store. Most of the employees are friendly and always talk to you.
good,"Always on your feet, constantly busy, you can keep up with it and your teammates always have your back when it gets busy. Just call for their assistance when you start to notice the lines get long. Customers are always kind."
good,managemtn was nice. working at big lots are like a family. goods are having to have a 20% discount at this store. its someone good because we saev money.
good,"I worked on and off at Big Lots for several years. I had great managers but some pretty questionable coworkers. I tended to keep to myself, only becoming close to managers and one or two coworkers. It was typical in a sense of retail work, the store was a mess every evening and we were expected to work as a team to clean it up, though most often it was myself and one other doing most of the work, as your manager gets to lock themselves in the office the last two hours of the evening doing reports. Management opportunities are given based on who you know more than what you know or do, and compensation is minimal."
good,"Working here, the pay is decent and the hours are 90% good. The Store Manager is a good person to get along with and he is straight forward with everything. The Assistant Manager how ever isn't all that great. He isn't really in my opinion Management material, but again, just my opinion. The staff is 50% good and 50% alright. Some staff members aren't the best to get along with. But all in all, I loved my position not necessarily the job."
good,"Assistant Operations Manager	"
good,Management was very nice and cooperative. All of the employees got along very will and the customers were mostly friendly. I would recommend for a friend to work here.
good,Great place to work if you are not looking for hours. You may start off with a decent pay grade but you may not get enough hours to show what you are worth.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Big Lots.  Like everywherer you work, you can find some fault but, they were very good to me.  I was able to transfer to different locations from Florida to California, then to Virginia.  Management was always willing to work with me.  I left because of a medical disability, or I would still be there"
good,never really worked over 20 hours a week and more hours weren't available unless you wanted to put out truck which I did not enjoy. You will have to work holidays and most of the time I worked closing shifts. Its pretty laid back and my coworkers were always friendly and supportive.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Big Lots. I got along with everyone, especially when I was Team Lead. I was ad to leave but there had been some communication errors and I was not given what I had been promised."
good,I've learned that improving my social and communication skills better. The most enjoyable part of the job is that has me motivate to complete tasks and seeing people smile.
good,"I loved working for Big Lots. Everyone grew together as a family over a short time due to everyone being friendly. I was forced to do most of the hard lifting and running around making sure everything was going smoothly. Working here for two years, made me grow and mature as a person and not only learn to care and help others, but to help myself in life."
good,"Went into work at 4 am unloaded freight truck, put away as much merchandise as possible in a short amount of time. The manager hired me was an awesome boss understanding that I had a past back injury and let me go slow to see if I could handle unloading the truck. I would have stayed working there if the current general manager would've kept his promise to move me to strictly cashier since since unloading trucks was just too much for my back."
good,"I have been with Big Lots for about fifteen years. Things have changed quite a bit in the last four years or so. The computer system is very used friendly. The new system that makes the schedule is nice. You just tell the computer when you can work and there are no longer problems or requests to the management team. You automatically get 8 hours holiday pay after a certain amount of employment, they do have benefits and  paid vacation for full time employees. It's not difficult to climb the ladder into a higher position, as long as you are dedicated and have a good attitude."
good,They are a wonderful company. I would recommend them to anyone looking for job. It is a fast pace working place and fun. The customers are wonderful and so are the employees.
good,"I enjoyed working for Big Lots."
good,Big Lots was a great first time job. Great to get started in the work field. Safe and fun work environment. I Learned many important and worthy attributes for future jobs and a variety of positions.
good,"Big Lots offers a flexible schedule and good benefits to it's employees. "
good,"a typical at work at big lots would be; clocking in and start fixing the shelves, and when a costumer needed help in furniture i would go and satisfy their needs. I learned how to talk to someone and persuade them to get coverage. Hardest part of the job would be when the store would get crowded with costumers"
good,Management was okay and just wanted to moved i was not getting paid enough wanted to move and find something a higher pay . I mived from where i wad living at and wanted something better and higher that what i was recieveing.
good,"I enjoyed Big Lots. Everyone was laid back and we had everything pretty much, at the store. The breaks were long enough. The pay was alright. For what it was I cant complain about it."
good,"Great work, awesome people to work with. As long as you do your job and sales go up , at the end of the day nothing but smiles leaving from a workplace like this. Communication is the key."
good,My managers were some of the best always working to make sure they put their employees first. The employees were great as well whenever something came up they were the first to step in and help.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Big Lots, the associates and the management worked together very well. The job itself wasn't to difficult, it was just very tedious at times."
good,"Big Lots is an enjoyable environment to work in. The coworkers and managers are very friendly people that make working there more tolerable. My complaints are the low pay and the lack of full time opportunities or benefits. Other than that, I enjoy going to work at Big Lots."
good,Go in at 4 in the morning and start putting the product out on the sales floor. Get as much done as we can before the store opens. Most of the time it's easy going unless its a truck day then things can get a little hectic.
good,"Was store manage for over 10 years , traveled through out the market helping stores clean up and prepare for visits , was  market support trainer on all new programs"
good,Lots of fun. Made a lot of new friends. Did a lot of overtime during the Christmas season. Promoted several times. Used what I learned all over the store.
good,i enjoyed getting to meet new people and learn how to stock and such but wasnt a big fan of how i was taught things and got yelled at for doing somthing wrong when i have different people teaching me different ways to do somthing like stock.
good,When I was working with Big Lots I keep this job for 9 to 10 years. I have good customer services and did cashiering and worked the floors. This job help me how be patient.
good,"I enjoyed working at Big Lots. They offered full-time employees health and dental benefits as well as paid time off. It was a fun job. This is a place where if you are a people person, you would meet lots of people on a daily basis."
good,"I like my job, but hours vary week to week, need more hours.  I would like full time and benefits, but not available unless your management."
good,Biglots has a very friendly environment for both employees and its customers. The company has a very flexible work schedule for those that may want to work part-time or may be attending school. It's a good organization to be a part of.
good,"What is fast paced, and somewhat routine.  Even with routine there is never a dull moment and the store is consistently changing.  Although change is interesting, it can be stressful consistently making room to merchandise changing merchandise when other merchandise hasn't completely sold.  A lot of work and the pay may not make you feel like an essential part of the Big Lots family, but you do get paid weekly.  Hours are sometimes low and the way to pick up hours is to always be on call.  They are open just about every single day of the year which isn't exactly fun for those who are family oriented, but my fantastic managers usually posted a volunteer list before picking people to work."
good,"There a lot of opportunities to move up in the company, however it is a very stressful environment.  Not enough hours for part time associates, which means management has to carry a lot of the weight of the workload."
good,"During seasonal work hours, a typical day includes, unloading shipments off trucks, keeping shelves neat and presentable. Also, assist customers with anything they ask."
good,"I only work one night a week and it is usually cashiering and or recovery, to which is a recovery specialist as I know where everything is in the store and if something is out of place I go and straighten the shelves, pull everything forward, and put things back where they belong"
good,"I was an overnight merchandiser, we worked long hours, we're locked in over night with no fresh air. Manager at the time was kind of rude. He was focused on quantity of product moved not quality of placement of product."
good,Management was good though would like to see and incentive for selling furniture. Unloading process could be smoother if they weren't so cheap about things.
good,"Big Lots provided a wonderful environment for both employees and customers, it was a very enjoyable place to work. I always looked forward to going to work."
good,Working with Big Lots was fun. I loved my coworkers and we all got along. I went from learning to unload freight off the truck in the mornings to stocking them the next. I also ran the register and helped load up furniture in customers vehicle. On top off all that I recovered the store.
good,"Overall the store I worked at changed around drastically and was overall a great store to work for. It had its flaws, like low hours, but I would recommend to anyone looking for a starter job"
good,"Hours were varied, Awesome employee bonuses, They took care of the employee, Made the employee feel apt to work, Fast pace work, Love the customer service aspect of it"
good,I worked as a Furniture Sales Lead for 5 years. My management was great from the DM to the Store Manager. The new computerized scheduling system was the reason I had to leave. I would be scheduled until close just about every night which doesn't do much for my home/life balance.
good,"Great company! Flexible schedules, quick advancement if you want to. Corporate tends to have unrealistic expectations, but local management can work around most of it. Great benefits for FT people."
good,"A typical day at Big Lots is cool. Iv'e learned that work is what you make it. Management is great, they are very helpful and caring. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck, it gets overwhelming at times but it gets done. The most enjoyable part of the job is helpful friendly co-workers assisting to make things easier for the individual."
good,"Pearl store has the best people, very friendly and nice to all customers."
good,"Working at big lots was very interesting. You eventually end up working more positions the longer youre employed with them, which i liked. I learn to do inventory and set displays working here"
good,"As the furniture representative at Big Lots, I established a basis of teamwork that allowed me to serve customers in an efficient manner. During my time at Big Lots, I lead the region in sales for a consecutive three months by providing excellent customer service and utilizing my people skills to make sales that left customers feeling satisfied with their purchase. I enjoyed working with customers in deciding what to purchase that suited their needs best."
good,"Fast paced fun environment, unloading trucks, stocking sales floor and maintaining store room, assembled furniture for display and handling layaway and sales receipts."
good,Business management changed often. The policy changed too much. Got used to something they would change and then a couple of months later change back. Hired people who didn't want to work as soon as they got their foot in the door. Customers lived the store because of the cheaper prices and the few positive associates there.
good,First I observe my work area is set for a very productive day. I greet costumers as come in assist with any questions for a better shopping experience . I have a great support system which makes for a positive work environment.
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable majority of the time. I learned about the retail market, and strong work ethic. Management was very helpful and friendly, and usually pretty lenient about how things were done around the store. Co-workers were also very friendly, helpful, and overall very enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job was learning how to properly run their registers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact and assist the customers everyday."
good,"Loved working here but I just couldn't pay my bills with the amount of money i was receiving. A Typical work day consist of stocking furniture, building and sales of furniture. Boss was great I have nothing but respect for Big Lots!!"
good,"I do a lot at the store. Stock, unloading truck, recovery, cashiering, greet customers. The managers are cool and the store is organized."
good,"very slow sometimes but mostly busy, all employees have different duties that needs to be done so very independent, if you need help the manager is always there to assist you."
good,"Daily routine was pretty standard for running the daily business, very few challenges. It was a good company to work for, I just didn't feel there was enough challenging factors to help drive personal growth."
good,Was fun working there lots of advancement .Had lots of fun with workers did learned about shipping themerchandise out and bringing into the workplace. Also work in the stores first .Stock shelves . Hardest part was the overtime 10 to 12hrs days sometimes.
good,I enjoy working with the people here. I enjoy checking out the customers and talking with them. It is neat and clean. The hardest part of the job is selling the BUZZ card because I do not see the benefits of it.
good,Open and closed store. Enjoyed the people. Always learning new things everyday. Management were very nice. Hardest part was loading and unloading trucks. Most enjoyable part was meeting and greeting customers every day and knowing that they were going to come back.
good,"This was a very enjoyable job. Management was willing to get out there in the ""trenches"" with the rest of us. That made it so much nicer to be there. The interaction with the shoppers was always a pleasure for the most part."
good,"Good work place with supportive management. It's all about helping the customers, and team work. Co-workers we nothing short of hard working.The hardest days are usually when we are short staffed, the enjoyable days are when everything goes as plan."
good,"a typical day working at Big Lots was very productive, you have to meet certain goals through out the work day. the management is very good about working around other co-workers schedules such as school or other jobs."
good,"Loading and unloading weekly truck, stocking of shelves, cashiering. Very easy work, enjoyable, if you like retail. The hardest, at least time consuming, part of the job is shelving merchandise, especially when there seemingly is no place to shelve more product."
good,Was fun being a cashier. Got to learn how to deal with money and customers. Sometimes messed with my scheduling and did not tell me so my hours were cut and money was less.
good,It was a good job to work at but the manager was rude. The co-workers were nice to work and so where the assistant managers. I enjoyed the customers that would come in.
good,"Big Lots Stores has dramatically improved its culture since 2014 with the on boarding of a new CEO. The new focus lends more opportunity for empowerment of the entry level associates and more support for senior staff and management. As is always true in retail, a great deal depends on your District Manager but I saw the changes from both corporate and DM levels and the impact they had on the culture and staff. This is a great company to learn big box retail standards and management. There is a great deal of opportunity for hard working people with a focus on customer service, quality work ethics and non stop productivity. Mediocrity exists but no longer is it rewarded as it once was in this company. Excellence, hard work, dedication, professionalism and a desire to constantly learn and improve are the keys to success with this company."
good,"Dealt with customers on a daily basis. I learned to provide the best customer service possible. Setting up the department to company standards. "
good,"I would show up and receive my list of duties that included unloading the truck, putting the product away, stocking shelves, building furniture, and helping customers. I enjoyed my time and the people there. I learned a lot and respect the people I worked with. The people I worked with were friendly and the management was on point with what needed to be done and fair with everything. They ran the store very well. I wouldn't really say there was a hard part of that job and I enjoyed everything except stocking haha."
good,"It was hard but i learned a lot not only about my job, but myself. My co-workers were what made the job fun and positive. Because of that stepping stone i have acquired great customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours of operation, being understaffed and the physical labor. but i loved the exercise and i became stronger for it. i would do it again in a heart-beat."
good,"A typical day at work consists of organizing and stocking the shelves. I worked as a Customer Service Specialist so I was responsible for returns and exchanges also for delegating jobs and responsibilities for other employees. I learned how to work as a team player and also work unsupervised. Working here also helped me learn how to handle and dissolve upset customers/issues. Being part of the management team for some time was a great experience, with the turnover rate as what it is, sometimes it was difficult to maintain a stable and secure line of communication. With that being said, retail is about change, changing with the market and evolving, but I feel too much change disrupts daily life; business or otherwise. Everyone got a long pretty well, there were instances of problems, but there are problems anywhere you work. The hardest part of the job was the high stress levels especially during the holidays when there is a higher volume of merchandise and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers that I got to know by name and their families."
good,"cashier, customer service, stocking, great for first job experience, worked during high school company worked with me for homework, school functions, etc. learned how to sale furniture"
good,"nothing neg to say Biglots has been very good to me and my family"
good,"I was one of the lucky ones that got to advance quickly. I started off in Aug 2010 scrubbing toilets and cleaning the floors then by Oct 2011 I was promoted to Manager. I really enjoy my role. It fits perfectly into my lifestyle, I feel that I may be a born leader. The people are extremely friendly and we all get along quite well. I have had 2 sales bonuses in my time as manager."
good,"A growing company that strives for the best. Friendly associates who work hard and expect nothing less from other workers. I really enjoyed the mobility and energy that i was forced to improve. I enjoyed making my manager happy because i knew i was working hard, so to see that she was proud of me made it all worth while. It made me want to stay consistent or even work harder."
good,People from all over working in various positions throughout the company.
good,great experience in warehouse loading. fast paste environment. physically demanding
good,"I loved working in a more administrative environment, while running a store, going city hearings for the company,and getting involved in store buy outs"
good,"Fast and exciting place of work.  Always changing and never a down moment.  Challenges self to make quick and smart decisions in a customer service market.  Learned the market for retail is always changing and that the store most change to meet the shoppers needs and wants.  Having a great team that works with you and not for you is important to generate an overall great moral for the store and company.  The hardest part of retail is the future, not knowing what the economy will want next.  I enjoy working as a retail manager because of all the new people and interactions I get to make on a daily basis."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of either handling opening / closing duties of the store. I learned a variety of things from merchandising, to stocking skills. Interpersonal skills to customer service. The best part was working with fun, cheerful and friendly co-works. The hardest part of the job was being part of a management team that did not take part in teamwork as a management team. Instead of working together, everyone was more focused on not."
good,"Work days went on without complications, all employees worked and got along with each other."
good,Very little training given. Management were all nice however not always the most helpful.
good,good environment to work and learn the basics. have become a better and more skilled employee and ready to move up to a better job
good,"My day at work includes coming in and interacting with regular employees to interacting with managerial staff.  I learned how to stock shelves in a more timely manner from my manager.  My co-workers and I share some common responsibilities like stock, recovery and cashier.  The hardest part of my job is to continuous lifting of heavy boxes because I am a female but I do hang in there.  The most important part is working in unity and independently together for a successful finished product."
good,"manager was good, associates were all nice. i worked on unloading and loading of trucks and graveyard ship stocking the store."
good,Held all duties as active manager when he was absent. Managed 36 employees and trained them as well.
good,"I have worked 3 different positions with Big Lots in a nearly 3 year span; CSA, CSS, and stock associate.  I actually really miss this store!  I started as a CSA where my day involved running the cash register, assisting customers to find merchandise, and recovering my assigned zone.  Not even a year later I was promoted to CSS where I ran the service desk, processed returns, and oversaw cashiers.  When medical issues came into play for me, I took a voluntary demotion to a stock associate where I processed freight onto the sales floor and ensured merchandise was correctly priced.  I always received a great deal of encouragement and challenged to better myself.  My coworkers  were amazing and even after leaving, it feels like one big family.  The hardest part was poor scheduling, shifts were often short staffed and customers complained about long lines.  Some would get very angry and yell to call someone else, but there wasn't always someone else I could call."
good,"I had a lot of fun working there. My co workers were amazing, the management wasn't so great"
good,"worked there pt while my mom got treated to chemo,they were very good and considerate of my schedule,very flexible with me,and everyone worked as a team."

good,I  like working in this field  its easy fun. we just fix the iles and mark the prices
good,great atmosphere. good pay and great managers. I really enjoyed the time that i spent there.
good,everyday is the same thing and it depends on the location but most of the time its big turnover job meaning most employees don't last long or they move on
good,"Good work hours, on-the-job training, etc..."
good,"Fast paced job with many learning opportunities and advancement options. I learned how to supervise my own area within the store and was able to move up to CSS. The hardest part of my job at Big Lots is when I had to leave. The best part of my 11 years there was the customers, the Leadership team and the many co-workers I was able to work along side."
good,Enjoyed working as a cashier and help customers finding and item. Enjoyed working around nice and friendly co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and prizing merchandise.
good,"The average day at work involves either unloading trucks, loading furniture into vehicles, operating cash registers or fixing up the store.  Coworkers and managers taught me that work can be fun and productive.  Their genuinely friendly natures is highly conducive to a positive working environment.  The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is attending to costumer needs, it can become more difficult depending on the attitude of the costumer.  However the positive environment helps everyone get back to work with a positive mindset."
good,"Learned more management skills and bookkeeping, also enjoyed my co-workers."
good,Always asked to stay help out and supervise over other co-workers to clean and organize warehouse and store. learned customer service and hard work paids off
good,"Work day"
good,"I worked at this company straight out of high school, it was my first job. I worked 40 hours or more in a typical week, sometimes without days off and this taught me that hard work can pay off in the long run. I found that management would ask more of me because of the dedication I showed while working and my willingness to come in when they needed someone to cover another employee. Management was always good to me here, my coworkers and I got along."
good,"Fast paced. New challenges everyday. No two days are alike. Keeps one thinking and moving. Management is knowledgeable, coworkers are fun. Not enough employees to efficiently serve the customers. Helping customers and making them happy."
good,Typical day of my job was to clean and stock shelves and make sure no item was out of place. My co-workers and supervisors were very nice people. The hardest part of the job was only dealing with big crowds of customers.
good,A typical day for me now is recovering the store. I'm in charge of making sure the items are where they need to be as well as straightening.  My co-workers are very friendly and everybody gets along.  We all have humor and that's what makes it fun to work there.   There isn't much room for advancement but is possible at times.  I loved being a furniture manager due to the fact I was able to move around in my area and building items was a big plus.  
good,Big Lots was great to work for the team members were the best. the store was keep in excellent shape we won award after award for the best loss prevention and the best kept store. this store was by fare one of the best places to work and to shop. the management was the best!
good,very friendly family enviroment..just didnt pay well really not much else to say about that

good,"great people, need to get upto date on some of the computer technology on the store level."
good,"Greeting customers, Building furniture. Hepling customers find items. I learned patience, and understanding how to manage other employees. Cooworkers will work for u if u lead by example. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different people with different attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing at the end of the day I was able to help someone or put a smile on a customer face. And when u are helpful most employees come back looking for u and sometime remember ur name."
good,"Responsible for the operational performance of the department,"
good,You will be asked to work on multiple shifts throughout the week but they will generally try to work with you. The managers are very friendly and there always seemed to be a family-like environment amongst all of the co-workers.
good,a typical work day would be six(6) to eight(8) hours working and assisting customers. The highlight of the day would be knowing some of your regular customers by name and being able to greet them with a smile.
good,Friendly environment and busy but not difficult work.

good,start doing my work i learned to be a leader with my co- workers there was no hard part of the the most enjoyable part was meeting new people

good,"Doing recovery,pricing items, stocking shelfs and getting carts"
good,I love working for Big Lots. I have learned a lot and I've become more patient. I started off as Recovery and then Cashier. Now I'm a CSS and I've only been there for almost 2 years. The managers are very nice and I couldn't ask for a better work environment. The only thing I don't like is working during Christmas season but I think everyone feels the same about that.
good,"The work environment was relaxed and friendly. One of the managers liked to take personal calls while I was closing my till, forcing me to stay later than scheduled. My main complaint would be that I had no clear job role. As a cashier I was expected to dabble in different positions without any instruction as to when I was expected to. I had no problem filling these roles, just that there was an expectation for me to have done them without being told. If I did fill these positions on my own I was told that I should be back at my register."
good,"Big Lots was a great store to work for. I worked with very outgoing people who always new how to joke around appropriately while on the job. Although the benefits and advancement were almost non existent, it was still one of my favorite places to be."
good,Not bad it's retail and the location I was at wasnt great but the people there more than made up for it.
good,"Overall Big Lots was a good company to work for. The store I worked in, in Lake Jackson was always above the projected numbers. our team was very efficient and very customer orientated. A typical day at work really depended on the day, because of the nature of the business, there were typically a lot of resets. During the week we may recieve 1 store side truck, typically 2500 cases,which came off piece by piece, very few palleted, which I was the manager over this. And up to 3 furniture trucks."
good,"A place to gain management experience. Especially helpful for new managers or those who have no formal education in management. For those looking to start out in management, this is a great company to work for and provides lots of teaching. Benefits are excellent though."
good,"It a fun place with good people.Its very active and open place,their was nothing u couldnt do.You always stay motivated and could of wait for the next day bring you."
good,its a good work place very nice workers work at a fast past work area
good,Great job to have it's just the pay wages i disagree with. The managers are helpful and respectful to employees. My managers would even bring breakfast some mornings.
good,"Big Lots focuses on their customers.  They always treat the customer number one. They provide a well rounded experience in every department.  Divide specific tasks for every employee and hold them to a higher standard,  which makes the company excellent."
good,"Amazing managers,  great place to build a career,  and the employees are nice and willing to help ans a great work place with many oportunities to learn now traits"
good,"Cashiering/stocking/recovering/etc. is easy to adapt to and learn to get used to. Management is the absolute best, and communication is very strong. As always in customer service some days may be rough, but it is still worth it."
good,Big Lots has given me the opportunity to explore my first job. They have shown me what it takes to be a hard worker and what it’s like to be around others.
good,"The staff are great and helpful. They greet you as soon as you walk in the door, and the sale are great. The store is clean and neat. The shelves stay stocked."
good,Amazing to work with such wonderful and friendly group of people. They are great at fitting your schedule around your personal life. They are always friendly and willing to help.
good,"Great company to work for. Friendly working environment, friendly staff. Hard to get hours but descent pay. Managers are great and easy to talk to. I enjoyed working there."
good,"I dont have anything specific to say about my time with big lot, it's like any other retail company, it offers good pay, great benefits, and excellent training"
good,"Operate forklift, clear out receiving docks, put pallets and furniture up in"
good,"No complaints really. The company just had lack of opportunity for advancement. The work/life balance was good compared to most retail companies. Only thing I think needs improvement is the help on the floor. Often times your are the only manager trying to man handle a fireplace, a mattress, a couch, etc by yourself. That part is really rough"
good,"Overall I like working at Big Lots. The only downfall is since I am part time, the pay is not great and the hours are inconsistent. I have worked here for 16 months. The earliest I have had to be in was 7 am, the latest was 6 pm, and the latest I left is 11 pm. I get a 20% discount off regular items and 30% discount off furniture."
good,"A great place to work, with employee discounts."
good,"Working at Big Lots was great when I first started. I got about 30+ hours a week and being paid weekly is amazing. However once the seasonal rush was over things slowed down a lot. There was almost nothing to o besides make the shelves look pretty. With the slow down hours went from 30+, to 15 a week, to 8 hours a week. It got to the point where I wasn't scheduled for weeks at a time and when I was it was it was once a month for a 4 hour shift. The manager was really kind and treated the employees great, but micromanaged and it was so annoying and stressful. The company had this unrealistic standard of how many pallets should be cleared out a shift by one employee. Hours were great but only if you had open availability"
good,"a good place to work if health and vacation benefits are not important to you   part-time hrs.only, your shifts and days of work will vary week to week the pay is minimum wage to start"
good,"The job is good to work for part-time,full time is stressful."
good,Big Lots is a good place to start working. I've learned a lot about customer service and working with others. It got stressful at times. The management was great and very flexible.
good,"Great people, u become part of the family, u can move up, always busy so times flies, but as a stock associate u work hard and dont get paid nearly enough nor do u get enough hours"
good,"Got me through college and some extra. Not a hard job at all, you learn how to do all kinda of retail stuff and deal with all different kinds of people. Management is okay but changes a lot."
good,Working at Big Lots has been fine.  I owe them a lot for they have been good to me.  Especially the store manager.  They are a stable company that would be a good fit for almost anyone.
good,"A typical day at work. Placing item anywhere from 5 to 70lbs on a conveyer belt, for 10 hours. Two decent breaks. It may get extremely hot in the summer months."
good,"The job was over all good, they only offered part time position but I worked a lot of overtime. They were very flexible with scheduling, kind and nice. I did a little bit of everything in my time there and really enjoyed it"
good,"My job was hard I had to unload truck and I thought I could handle it but I wasn't able to the furniture and very heavy items took a toll on me. The discounts were great, most of the people I work with were great. The main manager I had is gone now which is a good thing, the new one there is very friendly. I still shop there all the time"
good,"Manager worked around my full time job schedule and if i needed more hours than he did what he could to provide hours.  Pay isnt bad for a retail job. 401k for part time is ok could be better but its something. I loved the atmosphere and the people. The other employees were great. I highly recommend employment with Big Lots, Inc at Seymour, IN store."
good,"We went through many managers but the most recent is amazing. I would work up to 64 hours by choice until district got involved and had to cut me back down. There is room for growth here as well. The customers are the only thing that makes this place challenging because you’re so close to Taunton, you get your certain crowd. It is hard to keep staff because of the pay unfortunately. But it was a very fun job to work at if you enjoy retail !"
good,Big Lots truly taught me about working as adult. Everyone was friendly including the managers which were great by the way. I had a lot of there however it didn't pay much and just wasn't a long term thing. The hours were very flexible and the breaks and lunch times were also appreciated. As a starter job I would recommend this to anybody. Just don't expect it to be pay well unless you've been there 6+ years.
good,"Very strong interaction with both customers and store team members.  Strong planning by day, week and month.  P and L management.  Daily review of sales. metrics and CSAT scores."
good,"Big Lots had to be one of the most enjoyable jobs ive ever had. Very nice environment, and my coworkers were the best. very good hours and ok benefits"
good,nothing was hard about unloading trucks and putting stock on shelves. it was relaxing and good exercise without trying or acknowledge of it.the managers were never on time to unlock the doors for employees to go in to start work. when truck days were around. but it happened every week. employees would be waiting on the manager to get there and some employees would be running late and the manager would still clock them in ontime when they were not there.
good,"With certain managers, it worked for myself. Those who I worked with were very helpful in support and interaction. The hours fit my schedule.I also learned a lot about the different departments."
good,Big Lots is very fast paced but at the same time a great place to work great team atmosphere and close knit for the most part. You do have to work as a team or it's almost  impossible to get things done
good,Big lot's is great company to work for they are very caring and accomodating to it's workers with a decent wage.
good,In working with BigLots I experienced a good level of satisfaction in my daily tasks. They need to be more competitive with their starting pay for new employees.
good,Good job and is fun to work for offers I great discount t and is good place for advancement friendly atmosphere and lots of good prices well knowledge employees who will help find what are looking for
good,Management and co workers are friendly. I am only getting 4-10 hours weekly. I am unable to qualify for insurance because of this. I enjoy the relaxed environment and the discounts.
good,"I really enjoyed working here at Big Lots. Ive met some really cool customers that are now my friends. I've worked with an awesome crew. And when i needed help, team player are really used in that place."
good,Another day at Big Lots isn't bad at all. The days I've been working there I always get a good workout and always try to help my team out. I do like the fact that we have 20% discount and the management is pretty decent. If they just paid a little bit more to their hardworking staff they probably wouldn't normally be short staffed.
good,Love the work itself.  Kept busy most of the time.  Contact with customers was one of the best parts of the job.  The customers were other employees of the company.  Working together as a team meant the job was very organized and smooth going.  There were a or of perks to the job.  The company supplied many ways to make their employees comfortable.  From free coffee and tea during breaks as well as many vending machines.  Also there were many days they would supply some sort of brunch or snack just to say thank you.
good,"Similar tasks to Gordman's.  Big Lots consists of merchandising, offloading of store inventory items, and sales.  Associates provide excellent customer service and satisfaction."
good,"Big Lots Warehouse is relocating and I don't want to go. It is 60 miles away from my house now. I cannot do the commute. It takes too much money, too much time and causes too much stress."
good,"My manager makes the job fun and laid back"
good,Big Lots isn't too bad of a place to work at. I enjoy working there and get along with my fellow associates. My managers are always willing to help if you need anything.
good,"Fellow workers are easy to get along with. Lots of under-staffing that seems to occur. thus those who are shifted need to gather that slack,  but that is what work is."
good,Overall big lots is a very wonderful job and I really liked working there.  My managers were very well mannered and didn't treat everyone like trash..  They always tried to help you out no matter your situation.
good,"I love the environment, its slow and calming. the hardest part of the job is during the sales events. honestly the job is great for beginners or even slowly retiring elders. I love interacting with customers as they look for hard to find items."
good,Love the people and the atmosphere. Very easy to learn how things are done. Management crew is awesome and very easy to get along with. Flexible scheduling.
good,Very good people and good work environment  and great atmospher. There is never a time where nothing is happening which makes all the workers great at what they do and their willingness to help one another
good,"There was only a total of 3 breaks far as I remember and they only sold snacks in the break room, no full meals. There was not any sign of extra activities available to my knowledge."
good,I love working there! it doesn't get too busy and my co-workers are really awesome and the managers are all really great. Everyone helps out when needed so things go smoothly. My only con is the hour's wish I could get more.
good,"The best part of taking a part time job at Big Lots is you find accomplishment at the end of the day. The staff is generally friendly, even at the hectic times, but there is a huge sense of satisfaction when you look at a full stockroom at the beginning of the work cycle and seeing a sizeable amount of that stock on the sales floor at the end of it. There is a lot of hard work in moving the freight, but this work never goes unnoticed by the managers and always thank you for your effort at the end of the day."
good,Small store with a relaxed and welcoming environment. I was lucky to work at a store with a very friendly manager who was flexible with my second job.
good,"Friendly co workers, helpful management, learned customer service skills, decent hours and flexible hours, understanding if you have a schedule change"
good,It was t a bad or really good job. It was alright for my first job and everyone was nice. It was just to far from where I actually lived so I needed to go.
good,"a typical day at work waiting on customers which you meet new people everyday. "
good,the management was great and very helpful. It was a medium paced job with comfortable work scheduals. Unloadind trucks was easy and stocking shelves was easy. The staff was overall friendly and kept the store in great shape.
good,"The work environment was fantastic, great management  team will help train and advance in fairness, willingness to help with job duties. Came to meetings with great ideas"
good,Overall good company to work for with good benefits. The hours could get a little overwhelming sometimes depending on your particular position in the company.
good,"The Big Lots that I worked for was a wonderful, fun place to be.  The employees and management got along.  The job kept me busy with all of my responsibilities.  I built the furniture and large products, worked stock, unloaded trucks, and enjoyed every minute there."
good,"Big Lots is a nice place to work at, people are friendly, and the work is not as stressful. It offers different benefits and discounts such as free workout facility, discount shopping at Big Lots stores, discount for theaters, and Ohio State fair."
good,"It was very fair to all workers and customers. I'll like the work environment it was very clean, respectful, easy, etc. I'll work for Big Lot's again it I had the chance."
good,"Big Lots is a fast pace environment. Big Lots has developed a culture to always give great customer service by greeting them as they enter the store and always thank them as they leave. Big Lots acknowledges associates for a job well done by giving out "" Go Big Cards"" and awards them at the end of the week for getting the most cards.  The most enjoyable part of the job in Big Lots is being competitive and making our sales goals."
good,Working at big lots has been a great experience for me because it helped build my social skills and customer service. It a great work environment and I intend to keep working there
good,"Find the items that need to be stocked, recovery in every departments, the hardest part of job is miss communication on what to stock and when to stock."
good,"I enjoy working at big lots.  Our store has very positive management and everyone is helpful, accepting and willing to teach the new guy.  I have learned so much from everyone and feel like I am part of the team."
good,"I really liked the company culture at Big Lots.  I left this company to pursue a challenging opportunity at Value City.  I would gladly return to this employer, given the chance."
good,"great, understanding managers. Everyone puts their part to help you succeed more whenever you need it. Great place to work at, really flexible with schedule making."
good,Big Lots is a great place to work. There is always something to do and no one should ever be bored. Management is willing to teach you if you are eager to learn. There is room for advancement. During the holidays it can be quite demanding as retail can be. The hardest part of the job is covering for people who constantly call out. Most enjoyable part was always learning new things.
good,This is a challenging position which I enjoyed. The need to balance both internal and external managers was the key aspect of the position. The area I managed was the key conduit between the two portions of our business.
good,Great first time job. I enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with. I would recommend to anyone that needs a first time job. Great employee benefits.
good,Competent leadership with bright future of change.  Bright future for this company with the visions of current ceo.  Good benefits package for associates.
good,"busy every day"
good,I go in and clock in then I ask the MOD what is my task for the day and then I get started on it. I help customers look for certain items i go to the cash register to help the other cashiers when the lines are getting full.
good,Big lots is a good starting job for those who don't have much experience in Retail. They help the associates understand there job and how to do it correctly. They offer great benefits to there staff and even a 401k.
good,My Big Lots is a good place to work. Managers have a open door policy and I feel comfortable and safe working there. Also helping the customers is the best part of the job.
good,"I had a great group of co-workers who were friendly and helpful.  "
good,Managers are very nice and helpful Worked holiday season here was my first experience in retail I would work here again Simple environment. Must be very aware of your register
good,"big lots is a good place to work, i did cash stocking and unloading. the customers are all older people and polite, the management was good the stores pretty clean as well"
good,They could start off by paying attention to their employees more often. They need to work on getting enough hours to people. More hours to help put out merchandise.
good,"A typical day at work is engaging, unpredictable, and at times challenging. I learned various aspects of company operations beyond the scope of my role that allowed me to accept more administrative responsibilities than my position required. Management is knowledgable and experienced however there is room for improvement in management/employee relations. Culture in the workplace is balanced and amiable.  Hardest part of the job is the unrealistic timeframes placed on certain aspects of daily operations given limited  staffing and time to affect assignments.  Most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with customers."
good,"This is a great place for first time workers, or PT employees. The company works well with the schedules of their people. Management overall does a pretty good job of taking care of their team and the daily operations of the facility. Senior levels of management do not brow beat the team when visiting. Time off is easy to ask for and get approved, although not too many paid days. Management salary versus job responsibility is mediocre but lack of serious threats of stress offset it. The company fosters a team dynamic and learns all their employees names which is pretty impressive. Regular time off after so long, 401k, and other benefits for FT members of the team."
good,I absolutely love working for Big Lots and I'm sad they don't have a store where I'm moving to. I will stay on one day a week at Big Lots and commute.
good,Enjoy the group of people I work with very hard working fast paced atmospere.great management team work is hard but fun an fair.you learn to drive different equipment and use Manhattan Voice pick.
good,"Helped customers with questions about products and where to find them."
good,"Big Lots is a good place to work at if you need a job to get you back on your feet. They pay weekly and offer a 20% discount to it's employees. Break room is a bit lacking. Company seems to do very little to better the employee's jobs. Usually do the opposite (sending wrong trucks to wrong store, trucks coming in on unscheduled days)"
good,"One of the best companies I've ever worked for in terms of culture. However, the size makes it hard to have true career mobility. If you want to feel good about where you work and don't plan on switching things up too often, then this is the place for you."
good,"I loved my job there and most of my crew. Store manager needs to learn people skills and needs to be more friendly. I would go back to work for Big Lots if I could."
good,"just a normal busy day, stock and unlock truck ,it is a good place to work, hardest park is no one comes to work so you do it all by your self, every one works together"
good,"Big Lots was an exciting place to work especially if you like helping customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, checking out items, stocking shelves, and assisting in locating items. the management could have been better due to the fact that it was hard to get in contact with the general manager when she was needed. Things I learned was how to deal with an unsatisfied customer. the workplace was a very friendly environment. I got along with everyone who worked there. The hardest part of the job was when I could not satisfy a customer under no circumstances. The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with a lot of people."
good,big lots was a productive workplace that was enjoyable learning how to work with customers and being a team player people were great management was great I would highly recommend working for big lots it was a great starter job.
good,I learned a lot while i was there. The management was stern but understanding. They are a nice clean facility. Very efficient with how they handle their business
good,Good company to work for good paying job. Good benefits. Get to work  at a fast pace environment learn different departments and skills meet a lot of people .
good,I liked working there. I worked there for 4 yrs. Car mess up n I got to work to many times late. The boss tried hard to work with me but my ride kept on getting me there late. But it's a nice friendly outgoing n fun place to work. Bosses n managers were all awsome to work with
good,"Very fun company, always chances too move up, good pay, never over look employees, alright Management, some favor tisome, work hard always noticed, some managers letting there family get involved with store issuse and issues with costumers"
good,Big Lots was one of my favorite jobs. Like working with a happy family. The customers were great and the environment was always welcoming. Not to mention all the great prices.
good,Great job just no future due to small pay and limited to few  full time employs. Small staff need more people but don't have the pay or hours to bring in good ones. So they keep a few core employees but overall they lose the good ones to better jobs and have to go through multiple bad employees due to lack of hours and pay.
good,"Selling furniture was my number one objective along with giving the best customer service. Assisting with any needs and questions to the best of my abilities and making sure that they felt satisfied with their visit. Showing them around the selection and letting them test out the furniture was something that was done on a daily basis. Learning about furniture and putting it together was something that I never saw myself doing. It taught me great hands on skills and following directions to make sure the product was in the best shape for showing. Managers were always quick to help, but it was far in few in between. Making sure that the area was in the best of shape appearance wise. Lifting and loading the furniture was the hardest thing to do, big over-sized couches were never easy to deal with. Though having a great team or manager made it so much easier."
good,"A typical day for work here for me is cashing people out, straightening up the front end of the store, and sometimes being the person to go straighten up product displays throughout the store. I have learned better communication skills from this job; how to communicate with customers, management, and other coworkers, to ensure the customer is happy and that all duties can be done efficiently. My coworkers are friendly, and that helps keep everyone happy. The hardest part of the job is not being knowledgeable in the furniture department; as a sales associate/cashier, I was not trained for furniture, and many customers will ask me furniture questions that I can't always answer because I have zero training in that department. The most enjoyable part of the job is certainly when I get to help a customer (or sometimes a coworker) by finding something, being able to find price, help them get something off a high shelf, sign them up for a rewards card, or answering their questions. It makes me happy to know I can be someone my coworkers and customers can rely on."
good,"I really enjoy working for Big Lots. A typical day at work will include product recovery, cashiering, and assisting customers with their shopping experience. Since working here I have learned how to count change back (which school never taught me). My supervisors are great to work with and coworkers are easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the most difficult customers the ones that are never satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people get what they want and them showing gratitude and happiness."
good,"A typical day I would put out product, check customers out and assist customer find merchandise. The most enjoyable part was engaging with customers everyday"
good,"clock in an start your day always try to stay busy, I've  learned a lot about merchandising and replacing items, I have learned about unloading the morning trucks looking up item numbers to see if they are in stock. the management is great they will help you out any way they can an help you find what ever you need help with. the employees are friendly an the customers are nice, always nice to see a familiar face. There really is not a hard part to the day ."
good,"As retail management positions go, this company is as good as any. Must work weekends, evenings, and holidays.  Pay is ok, but put a lot on management, including hand unloading freight trucks."
good,This job is very physically demanding and expect to loose a bit of weight. drink a lot of liquids and eat foods that are very nutritious to sustain you and your well being .
good,"The Big Lots in Ballwin was a good first job. The managers and employees were genuinely helpful with any questions from either customers or other workers. Even when tired, there was generally a positive attitude within the workplace. I felt safe and respected."
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading freight and getting it out in a timely manner, would also be called upon to cashier on occasion. The management was great and my coworkers were all terrific people. The hardest part of the job was pushing out rewards program, as the benefits of said program were lacking and consistently questioned by customers."
good,I enjoyed working there the pay wasn’t enough for me nor where the hours. I did enjoy the people I worked with as well as the customers. It was more being the only one in the store doing everything like except furniture.
good,"Your typical retail store it all has its ups and downs. fast paced as a customer service supervisor you are in charge of the frontend making sure all the cashiers are all set, answer phones, taking back returns and cashing out people. A good place to work!"
good,"Utilized my skills and experience."
good,"friendly employees and managment, good training and relaxed work enviroment, learn a lot of new work tasks and you can feel comfortable talking to your managers about issues,"
good,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants. Discussed type, quality and number of merchandise required for purchase. Recommended merchandise based on individual requirements. Advised customers on utilization and care of merchandise. Provided advice to clients regarding particular products or services. Explained the use and advantage of merchandise to customers. Answered customers’ queries and concerns."
good,"It was a great workplace, my employers were very helpful when I didn't understand something. And mad sure our work environment was safe."
good,The hours and pay were not the best but the management was superior. I enjoyed working there a lot and would have continued if It paid enough.
good,Big lot's is a fast paste work place yet a very friendly environment. management was very friendly and the workers were all dedicated in their job.
good,Management team is friendly and works as a team. Work place is not so serious which makes it easier to work. Tasks are always completed and not passed on for someone else to do.
good,"They are good to work around your schedule. Even part timers get a few benefits. Pay is not too good but you do get a discount. It takes a long time to get promoted because the employees tend to stay. Also, they tend to hire management from outside companies instead of giving promotions. Sometimes it is boring if business gets slow."
good,My typical day would be running register and striating store when not busy. I have learned from this job to stock merchandise on the shelf in a timely mater. management was over all good and fair. Co-workers was nice and friendly. Hardest part of job was making the work last until the shift was over. what I enjoy the new people I got to meet.
good,"It was a fun job overall, some days were better than others, Co-workers were fun and helpful sometimes. The store in January 2015 and that's why I'm not longer employed at this company."
good,I had a grate time with working with every one there. Was given the hours that I needed and liked what I had to do. Had to lean how to deal with mad customers.
good,"Typical day was walking the store taking notes of all areas of the store, planning the work day, delegating, reporting financial data to corporate. Worked there for many years, learned the concept of management, dealing with people which serve as a broad learning experience."
good,"Unloading trucks and breaking down the pallets and putting the items in the right location, stocking the items and rotating them so the newer expiration dates are in the back on the shelve, building displays."
good,"Good company to work for. Management is always there to help when needed. Overall, never had a problem working here although the pay could have been better"
good,"A typical day at work can mean anything from selling furniture to throwing away boxes. I learned basic Retail experience such as blocking organizing and facing during recovery. As well as distributing stock onto shelves in a timely manner while attending to customers in the meantime. Management did a great job instructing me through the process and pointing out the rights and wrongs and the causes of those wrongs. The co-workers also did  a great job putting in a team effort and making the work environment enjoyable to come into everyday. This job wasn't in particularly difficult because i tend to enjoy a challenge but i would say the assembly of furniture takes a lot of focus but is also time consuming and rewarding in the end. Overall, the part i enjoyed most from this job was the friendly productive work environment and the great customer service."
good,"One day of receiving product within the store."
good,"during my years at biglots i've learned how to properly supervise co-workers, lead the team to get merchandise to the shelf in a timely manor. the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers and turning it into a positive experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates and the customers and making a positive inpact on a daily basics."
good,"Big Lots is an easy place to work at nothing really hard about working there. The management is okay some mangers are , rude and unhappy but overall its an easy job to do. The most enjoyable part you get paid weekly and the hours are flexible, I would say the only problem is getting the hours you want."
good,"Arrived on time, checked in deliveries, unload deliveries, managed employees, produced the schedules, store operations and assisted customers"
good,"-Check sales"
good,"I looked forward to going to my job every day !"
good,started each shift with clocking in and going to my assigned position to complete my daily duties and assisting with store needs
good,I as a member of management I love working here over all. on a typical day I would come in contact with many customers who are very friendly and sometimes not so friendly. But I always try my best to make things right by them and try to make sure they leave the store happy. as far as Co-workers being in a member of management I believe that over all I am far to there needs and I am always willing to teach them new things. I was always asked questions and happy to to get them right answer. The Hardest part of the job is that you aren't an equal as a member of management I would believe that if you had been at a company longer then another co-worker that you would be at a higher pay rate well that isn't the case with this place i believe that if you put the time in and work heard you should be compensated for it well sadly that isn't the case with this company...
good,"Big Lots is a very outgoing and fun place to work.  The management are very helpful, and enthusiastic to help the associates to learn and increase the work potential, by giving the associate new tasks to learn while under employment."
good,"Spemt 16 years there, progressing through jobs and llocations. I really hated to leave,"
good,A great company if you don't like to walk in a different job everyday.  Team members are great and friendly
good,"Great staff n management"
good,great place to work friendly staff and room for advancement.
good,"energetic place to work"
good,Great company to work for. I am in need of full time employment and there are no current openings for full time with Big Lots so unfortunitely I must look for alternative employment.
good,i love it ....the leadership is open like Robert (manager) one person i do respect. He does not tell you to do your job but rather help you in motivation and working along side by side with all the employees. Helping the customers in all ages/size or whoever they might be from being a child or an elder person. My goal would be to provide the best and up most best customer service.
good,Good company to work for. Great benefits. good working conditions
good,During a typical day at work I ran the cash register. I learned how to run a cash register and credit card machines. The management was great. I got along great with all my co-wokers. The hardest part was making sure I counted my money. The most enjoyable part was getting to socialize with the public.
good,"you always knew what you would be doing when you showed up to work. Excellent time management, very team based company. Plus I have always enjoyed working with my hands so the days that I was scheduled to build furniture were something I always looked forward to."
good,"Opened the store on the computer, submitted payroll, checked the daily task manager, closed and opened daily inventory adjustments. Set up registers and frontend for business. Worked on merchandising assignments. Hardest part of the job was unloading trucks, having to walk over pallets and handling up to 50 pound boxes. There was always a turnover of Managers as we were the district training store. Co-workers were very sweet people who had been at that store for 4 yrs."
good,i loved the job i did there and the people i worked with... it was a very positive and productive place ...a real management learning process for me. the hardest thing was the schedule for me . my family life suffered to the point of my rarely saw my children due to the schedule i kept ..and during the holidays it was especially difficult . but the company made up for it but having a  lot of family friendly  events.
good,going in attending costumers and learning how to solve small issues and my co workers were easy to get along with and the hardest part was to no know what costumer wants and i enjoyed staying over nights
good,"Getting our store ready for Labor Day weekend is fun.  Everyone is looking forward in getting together to enjoyed a pot luck. Is fun, we start prepping the store like there will be a visit that weekend, an every morning there is a meeting of encouragement, reorganization for the employees and there departments.  Our sales start increasing and we start getting a large customer flow. What I have learned from this, is that when our employees feel appreciated they go an extra mile for the company.  There is no hard part of the job, when we enjoy what we do."
good,"good place to work, fun, and productive place, as long as you do you job no one gets on to you, I enjoy it  cause I get along with everyone, and I do my job with out being told to do it. When I needed time off they gave it to me with no problems , said see you when you get back, that was cool."
good,Very fun and productive work environment. Friendly co-workers with the ability to get to know your customer's needs on a personal level.
good,"Big Lots is a good place to work. Benefits are great, pay is ok. A typical work day can vary, since it is retail never know fully what a day can bring. However the week is generally started by unloaded a truck and making sure it is out on the sales floor in less than 48 hours after (sometimes less depending on the size of truck). I usually still have to run register when the cashier needs back up and run the sales floor. The hardest part of the job is of course lots of time not having enough coverage and running 2-3 departments by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a customer come in and they can't find what they are wanting any place else and I have it for them."
good,"My day begins with opening the store,and preparing the store for the day.Check emails and task manager for any sets (planograms) that may be due or upcoming. I assign work tasks based on freight flow and set sales goals for the day. I cashier as needed and help customers throughout the day.I handle all customer concerns and complaints. "
good,"sales,cashier,stocking shelves,unloading trucks,stocking pilates,fun place to work."
good,"when there i stock,unload trucks, stock shelfs use bailer.management is fine,co-workers are social the hardess part is the hours of stock and whats is enjoyed is location and hours."
good,I did a lot of physical labor and it help me to get fit. I interacted with all kinds of people from different walk of life. I went from part-time to full-time in 3 months.
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in and going to my assigned register. I learned how to use the register and once I learn how it was great. Management was great and caring...no complaints. Co-workers where great to and friendly, besides one or two negative people. The hardest part was being to only register open and having 10+ people in line angry but I got it done. The most enjoyable part was making and meeting new people and personalities everyday and figuring out how to deal with them."
good,• Maximized sales potential through identifying new ways to drive sales.
good,the job was great i really enjoyed the prices and the employee discount recieved. the hours were the worst part of the job some weeks you get 38 some you get 9 it just wasnt secure enough to raise a family
good,"With the fast paced work environment that BigLots has to offer, it is touch and go when it comes to reinventing the wheel. A long standing company that really doesn't have a structured training program. However, the opportunity of growth is vast and anyone that can understand the basic concepts of retail could have a career possibility within this company. With starting pay just about above the standard minimum wage, and the management staff to make a decent weeks pay, the time spent and endured within the walls of the BigLots brand is overall fun and exciting. This job is not for the faint of heart or the week minded."
good,"Left this store for an increase in wages, wish I had stayed. The marketing concept and bargains offer substantial benefit to the customer in a wide range of items. Cater to all income customers. Project a very successful business in the future."
good,"This company is really interesting you get all types of different personality. You keep yourself moving and i really enjoyed it. I was a cashier, cutomer service, stocker and recovery."
good,great coworkers to work with mangement was ok could have been better
good,Easy and laid back enviroment with great communication from the management department.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job when you know that you have gone out your way to make a customer smile.
good,a typical day at big lots is fun and show great costumer service. i learned to manage money and train new employees.. my co-works are like family and have fun working with them... the hardest part of my job is not having enough time to finish each projects...the most enjoying part if my job is meeting new people everyday...
good,"This is where I got all the training I needed to work retail. I first learned how stock the shelves and tare down end caps and make new ones, break down pallets,load and unlaod trucks. But most importantly this is where Iearned to put customers first, this is where my passion for helping others comes into play, it's all about the customers and what you can do for them to make their lives a little easier."
good,"Company constantly states they want to promote from within, unfortunately this has proven not to be true. I am on a high potential list for upcoming District Manager positions. In the last 3 years I have not seen one Store Manager or even District Training Manager promoted or even interviewed. Very disheartening!"
good,A great job for work and family life balance.
good,"Asst Manager merchandising store,shrinkage, customer service creating loyal customers"
good,"The day were always fill things that had to been hi-pressure but good. I learned a lot of office and showroom managing, Selling, Buyer. the hardest part of the was trying to take a normal lunch break. Co-worker and bosses were great to with. I always looked forward to going to work"
good,Very task driven. Management must work along side hourly employees to have a successful store. This is a labor intense position for anyone interested. If you enjoy creative merchandising then you will find this quite rewarding.
good,"Working in retail is no easy feat. The employees I worked with at this particular location were family and friends. During the busy season you might want to learn restraint and meditation! Regular customers are the greatest, but in other cases people are harsh on the employees for things they can not prevent."
good,"This company was one of my favorites. It allowed me to start learning day-to-day business. This store allowed me to work at every level of the business (cashier, stocker, team leader, salesman, etc.) It was a fun store to work and learn good responsibility."
good,"Of all the places I have worked in my life, Big Lots was my favorite. All the eployees got along and showed concern for eachother. You always felt safe and knew that you were taken care of. The managers and supervisors were very flexable and understanding when it came to family issues. I would love to work for the company again."
good,"I have worked for this company for 2 years and I am only part time, but the managers are willing to work around your full time employment schedule to give you hours."
good,It was only part time work and i needed full time work i unloaded the trucks and was a stoker and worked with the furniture the hardest part was runing I'm sad I was up and down aisles
good,I really enjoyed working at Big Lots.  I would love to go back since the remodeling.  It feels good when I walk in there.  And it doesn't get boring to me.
good,Productive and I'm fun i like to work with other I have a good attitude and  like to play basketball I'm a fast worker I know how to get the job done i'm a great communicator and a good listener
good,Work hard have a great additud and be willing to succeed always have an opend mind to new opportunities. Be able to make decisions asking is the major aspect of been great at the job you have on hand. Handle situations that can promote your future education or possitionsto grow in the company. A possitive mind can take us far.
good,"It is a retail job so you help customers throughout your day, whether its to find items, price check, sell furniture, or check them out at the registers. The managers are there to help you whenever need be as well as the long time associates."
good,Weekly pay and fair hours depending on work productivity and as long as you do your objectives it’ll be a fair career..simple dress code easy to find a black shirt and khakis or black pants
good,"At Big Lots I was able to stock shelves, and be a part time cashier. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers. The customers generally knew what type of products they were looking for, but I was helpful if they did not."
good,"I like it, it’s a good opportunity to work with different people and extend my people skills. The job helps me learn to be more flexible. Also having the opportunity to work as a team."
good,Ok I liked working here you learn alot reward program cashier ware house  pricing customer service people are nice  help customers set up the store you know where stuff is located
good,I work well with others a fast learner I be on time I’m a good listener I’m ever hands on I’m a head worker  all you have to do is show me two times and I’m going to get it right.
good,"Everyday it can be a new challenge for an employee in terms of keeping maintenance of the stores at their peak, or attending to any and all of the customer demands or attitudes. It honestly takes a certain personality to work here and understand that BigLots is far from perfect and it may take sometime to get to liking the job.  My co-workers and management are the reason I can come to work relaxed and ready to serve the community.  This is a factor that can make or break a store, I am just fortunate enough to have the best of the best."
good,The workplace is productive and fun.  Having and achieving goals everyday is great.  The truck unload process could use a little improvement.  Overall this is a good place to work.
good,"The coworkers and managers are all very friendly, and several positions means you can get flexible hours and work that suits your skills. The work becomes much easier with practice and tasks are finished easily when everyone cooperates."
good,You never have the same thing to do 2 days in a row. You get to showcase items and make the store incredible. I  had to make sure everyone followed procedures.
good,The pay is decent and they have a good home/work life balance. They could give a little bit more payroll and up date the order system. Orders are 3 weeks out which could lead to outs and/or overstock.
good,Great first job to get into the working environment.  This is a good job for high school students who want flexibility in their schedule with work and school.
good,Sales associates are only part time. Management is the only ones that get fulltime hours. Fun easy place to work. Management averages 40 to 45 hours a week
good,"If anyone is looking to getting their foot through the door for starting out on applying for jobs, and want to start small, I recommend Big Lots for those wanting to start in retail."
good,When I worked at big lots the only issue i ever had was when I told my boss I wouldn't be able to work the trailer anymore since i was about to go to college. She said she had hired me for the trailer which was incorrect since the position was for a cashier.
good,"As long as you adhere to company policy and do your job, you won't have any issues. A good place to work. A decent employee discount. Flexible hours. A good career move for students"
good,"I loved working at big lots.  Iowa's fortunate to get along with everyone I worked with,  and get pretty good hours.  It was a nice flowing place to work."
good,Very easy to keep busy and virtually no time to waste.  Enjoyed the work and the people.  Did shelf recovery and Go Backs and Cashiering.  There is always more to learn so you can alway grow in the job.
good,"Your either on the sales floor or cashiering. The company takes Big Lots Rewards Sign Up's very serious.  So the sign ups are when you sign up customers for the rewards program. You must reach expectations of their goal percentage of sign ups every week otherwise the manager has to go over goal expectations with you consistently. Corporate is serious and takes on it when it comes to those reward sign ups. You have to sign this sheet being aware your manager spoke to you and they fax your signature sheet to corporate. Kinda annoying how serious they take reward sign ups. but besides that the job is decent. Just cashiering or on the floor straightening up shelves, or stocking. Christmas season gets extremely busy and tiring if your a cashier."
good,I loved working for Big lots . I worked for a couple different locations and got to know management and other associates at other store location. We all help each other and encourage everyone to keep up excellent customer service and store standards.
good,"Typically you would start your shift by checking by checking with the manager on duty to see what they needed done. This would usually be doing ""recovery"" (straightening up the products on shelves and returning ""go-backs"")  or restocking, rounding up shopping carts, sometimes manning a register for a bit if lines get long, Helping customers find a product or suggesting an alternative item if the store didn't have what they were looking for. None of the managers where I worked were overbearing in any way and one thing I really liked was that the store's General Manager was good at finding out what someone was talented at. Assembling furniture was something I enjoyed and was always asked to to when needed. So in a way it personalized my role there.  Unloading the weekly delivery truck was the hardest part of the job but it was only once a week."
good,"Very exciting and enjoyable job atmosphere. Home life and work life balance was perfect. They were very big on internal promotion. Company was definitely growing. I believe they hire District Managers from outside too much, when they have great store manager talent to choose from."
good,Everyone got along and the managers and supervisors always worked with you on the scheduling to make sure everyone was comfortable...I would definitely recommend them
good,"A typical day at my job consist of checking emails, task along with my schedule and mapping out what my itinerary for the day is. I learned how to prioritize task based off of there due dates and the timeframe it takes to complete them. Management I feel is a rewarding experience. It motivates you to mold individuals into the perfect associate. The workplace culture is pleasant and you get more opportunity to interact more with customers and your staff. The hardest part of the job is working with fewer associates with more of a demand from customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the progress that has been made in regards to associate development and company goals."
good,It's a nice place to work. Everyone is so friendly and a good working environment and the relationship that you build on with the company. You can work your way up in the company.
good,"Great place to work. Always opportunity for advancement. If you have a good store Manager that is fo used on your development, you can easily move up."
good,"Swiss army man, I sell furniture help people pick their dream sofas, love seats, ottomans and storage. Unloading early morning trucks hours before we open than loading the freight into the stock room."
good,I enjoyed the direct communication with the team and problem solving. Daily tasks were reviewing sales numbers and tasks. Also reviews were completed for each associate on performance weekly.
good,"I worked for them for many years I left due to needing new opportunities but they were and amazing company that’s why I stayed so long with them"
good,"It was hard work, Lack of team work, Poor management and the store looked like it was never pick up after a crowed had went through it."
good,"Kind people, mixture of cultures, learned how to use a pallet jack, unloading trucks, closing time, cleaned bathrooms, kind customers always helped out"
good,Management is competent and friendly. Work hours are very flexible. There is always something to do so you are kept busy. It is a great place to earn experience that isn't overwhelming.
good,"Meeting, work, break, work, lunch, work."
good,It ran like a machine. They had a good training program. They pay well. I learned to manage my time better at this job. The store had decent goals and liked to motivate the staff.
good,Biglots is good for a first job type of position I wouldn’t call it a permanent job because of low pay but for a first job it’s great. The managers get along with they’re employees
good,For sometime who needed experience it was a great job to start with. I learned a lot and was cross trained almost immediately. Very busy store always something to do.
good,This was a good job.  I wish that it could have lasted longer.  This was more of a temp job which they didnt tell me at the time.  Once the store was setup they started laying off.
good,"Empower and customer service, stocking, signing, unloading truck, cash and inventory control, register operation, local advertising  Not a bad place to work but has very little local opertunity for advancement"
good,I regret quitting but had to due to un for seen personal reason everyone got along worked as a team if personal time was requested was always approved just a great place to work for at least for me.
good,it was a good place to work managers made sure there was on top of you doing what your to do. they bare friendly and work with you on days you need off or need time
good,"I liked the management, they are willing to communicate what is needed within a typical day to ensure that the stock can be unloaded and stocked efficiently."
good,"I worked at big lots for a period of 8 days as a part of Vocational training, and the entire time I've worked there, the employee's are friendly, and the manager is a hard worker and takes care of his employee's. And every other employee worked hard, as they were also moving stuff to the new location."
good,"Depending on some days, work would either be busy or the opposite. I remember during the seasonal periods, the store would be crowded.  We had pretty good management. They would make sure everything was organized. I learned a lot from one of my managers. One of which was attaining a good education so I could rise up the ranks of getting a better position. There were really no difficulties and the most enjoyable part of my job were making displays."
good,Restocking the merchandise and also labeling NVO and General Merchandise. I also maintained the furniture and back room. I also kept the bathroom And outside store parking lot clean.
good,The managers are great and are always helpful with anything you need. Co-workers are always helpful when you’re new and even after are always looking to help you out.
good,"Busy place,always something to do."
good,Great place to work if youre needing a job to hold you down until you get a better one or wanting a second job. Friendly faces never really any trouble but theres always one in every group who can casue trouble
good,The job was good. The benefits were great and there was room to advance within the company. sales are big in this company and they reward you for that.
good,I loved the way Big Lots rewards their employees with like “stars”  it notes of accomplishments. If more jobs did this I believe more employees would contribute more then what they do.
good,I got to work seasonal for this place it was fun experience I did stocking and some cashiering I'd say their prices are fair and they paid good nice friendly people
good,"I feel out of all the retail stores I have worked at Big Lots is by far the best. Management and employees can easily communicate and any issue that may arise is taken care of. Hours are pretty much up to you when you select your availability. Changes can be made though. Being a cashier can get boring, and there is a huge pressure to push benefit programs and credit cars. Deffinetley the down side of working. Only people with a lot of credit card sign ups really get recognized. Working on the floor however you are kept busy and the time is enjoyable almost."
good,Sometimes intense if not enough help. I loved working there when it wasn't stressful. A lot of times I was the only worker besides manager. I did learn how to close while helping managers.
good,"Its a nice place to work. "
good,What I would be doing at big lots was stocking or cashier they were always short staffed and there hours just wasn't enough and the pay wasn't good for me to be well off and the management sucked.
good,My experience at Big Lots was very entertaining in a positive way. Co working were very friends to me. I learned levels of stocking. The hardest part of my job was giving it up.
good,It was a good job but being a manager its very clear that the higher ups don't care to fix any problems as soon as sale goals are being made. I loved the people I worked with though.
good,"My time at Big Lots was pleasant, the staff and management was well taught and the store functioned well as a unit. Schedules were fairly regular and opportunities  would be given for extra shifts when available."
good,"I would recommend, just not exactly what I am looking for. The benefits are good and fair. Shoplifting is rampant and nothing is being done to prevent. Sometimes felt in a dangerous position because of that."
good,It is a place where you can work and get to learn a lot of different things. If you need help with anything there are managers there to help you with your needed to help a customer.
good,"Exciting and not stressful environment."
good,"Greating customers,ring up items,stocking shelves.I only work there for holiday season so its not much to tell. I like working with the staff and meeting the new people that came in and shop."
good,"They was a good company to work for, giving the employees chances to move up in the company and even transfer to different stores if needed. You really got a sense of community within the organization and a sense of family within the individual stores. I would say the hardest thing was unloading merchandise from the trucks. Most enjoyable was getting encouragement from the managers."
good,My time over the years working here were nice I met alot of people I loved the people I worked with Including management it w I sent the greatest pay but the atmosphere made up for it
good,Overall a really decent place to work if your looking for something part time and not too serious. I found that there is always something to keep yourself busy with throughout the day.
good,When I first started it was a wonderful place to be employed.  Over the years with changes in the company it limited my hours to where financially I couldn't continue working to make ends meet.  I learned customer relations how to display product for the consumer and made it efficient stocking decisions that benefited the company.
good,"Big Lots provided a fast-paced work environment which required employees to stay on task, but allowed freedom for fun and self-guided direction. It provided ample opportunity to improve customer service skills and professionalism."
good,pretty much did something different everyday. people do not show up for work so you fill in where needed. it's good because you stay busy and learn new things.
good,Everybody treats each other like family. We work closely with each other. See days can be stressful because of the work load but we don't mistreat each other.
good,This was just a short work experience.  Not really an employee so I cannot truly answer this question.  I enjoyed my time there and had a good work experience.
good,"It's productive place to work. The job is great for people who need money weekly to help with bills. Also, it's a good part-time job for people who are in college or looking for a second job."
good,"I've worked for Big Lots for a year now, and it has been a pleasurable experience. The only real complaint I have is the lack of hours. The managers are easy to get along with, and the work is very simple... by far the least stressful work I've ever done"
good,Good Place with Good people. I really have nothing else to say other than that. I guess training was nice  and did a good job of getting you prepared for the real thing.
good,"The work environment is very fast paces and you're overall pay is based off of performance of the varous duties that are provided. I was with Big Lots for 2 years at the Montgomery, AL warehouse, and I'd say that if you work hard and have good management then you're time at Big Lots will be overall fairly great!"
good,i struggled workin there because of my asthma but other than thag they are a good company to work. i had an amazing supervisor who took care of me when needed. they have high standards but pretty easy to accomplish.
good,"Aside from not getting the amount of hours I preferred, I loved working there. I was taught how to maneuver through the store from stocking, furniture, to cashier and  wherever else I was needed. I liked the thought of being knowledgeable of the store in all of the departments. I feel the pay was decent for the position also. Very supportive team and an awesome manager who really went out of his way to help and kept an upbeat, happy vibe consistently. Overall, I would work there again."
good,"A typical day at work is greeting customers, proper store function and merchandise recovery. The Challenge to focus under pressure and stay positive is a key. Managers communicated suggestions to employees and team was motivated to do their best. The hardest part of the job was multitasking, However, you obtain personal satisfaction by assisting customers and resolving their problems."
good,"The store was no different from any retail company I have ever worked for. The pay was o.k., The register was slightly different from what I am used to, but I was able to catch on quickly."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is looking at the food the expr and put the in the cart and fix the stuff and put the where stuff belong togethers,"
good,Customers squat on the floor everyday then run out.  About 3 people a day pop a squat like it’s normal and they don’t clean up after themselves. If you don’t like seeing blind people missing the toilet in public don’t work here.
good,Work hard and stay focused on getting big lots cards. The customer is always right. Be productive move at a healthy pace for yourself and finish the job
good,Lacks in the training hours for new hires.  I would suggest each store to have a training associate to be paired with for 2 weeks. All associates are part time.  A full-time front end CSS would help balance the upper management teams roles and responsibilities.
good,The management team I worked for noticed my ambition and moved quickly to the next level for my performance. worked as a cashier for about 3 months through grand opening in Lewisville and moved to customer service and it was I loving place to work
good,I make my own day up as far as what I do. I love the position because it allows me to meet different people everyday. It's not a very stressful position. There's a great deal of lifting heavy furniture.
good,"sometimes i miss working with some of those people. i learned alot from a couple of people. management was decent. hardest part was black friday, most enjoyable was closing."
good,Great job and always willing to listen to work improvement suggestions along the way.  Long hours but good team to work with and great customers to sell stuff to.
good,At big lots they really care about the customer. Working there no matter what position you are if you see a customer in the store you must check on them making sure they are have the best shopping experience possible.
good,"The particular Big Lots I worked at in Eastland Shopping Center had an unusual cast of characters. While my first manager was there, it was like a family. He had many children and knew how to solve problems logically and mostly without aggravating people. When he died, they put a total opposite in place and I was glad to move. That store is no longer there. "
good,"it really wasn't a bad place to be a part of managers were great, great working environment very pleased with  the decision i made to be apart of such a great establishment"
good,"-Fast paced environment"
good,This a great place to work they are always trying to improve the store and the staff for he customers to have a great experience in there stores. They work for the people
good,I like working here it just that we don't get paid different then the morning crew. I would like to work more hours. I like the people that work there as well.
good,"Good working atmosphere, love working there, just not enough hours. I love working with employees that do not discourage you and are disrespectful, not all employees are respectful though."
good,I enjoyed working there. The manager was fair about flexibility of hours with enough given notice. I people I worked with were fun people that helped you out if needed.
good,It was a fun place to work with about half the managers being awesome and the other half just being misrable. The problume lyes with the fact the dm will let a manager get away with anything they will always side with the manager never the lowly employee.
good,"Casual attire, stressful, low pay, fun meeting new people ans helping them. Staff is pleasant but lazy.  Raise will come after awhile. Room for advancements within company."
good,"I enjoy working at big lots, it is fun. All the employees and managers are friendly. The job is fun I love working with people. The pace of the environment can get intense, but overall relaxed."
good,"Successful Approaches To Resolving Problems"
good,its only part time unless your in management. can either be really busy or sometimes slow. the staff is friendly and helpful. its harder to get promoted in a timely manner. job is fulfilling but what they ask of you should be paid more.
good,"Introduces you to retail a pace that you can understand. If you plan to stay you can eventually move up. Nothing bad to say, it was my first job. Hope this helps!"
good,"Typical day at work unless its the weekend or Family weekend. It was okay, learned leadership skills. Register is always a need to know skill or else you cannot work there."
good,"A typical day at work here is pretty laid back, not crazy busy, which leaves times for other tasks assigned by the manager on duty usually straightening the items on the shelves near the register or marking down prices on items that are close to expiring. The management team is nice but will make sure you are always doing something and staying busy because that's their job to do. It is a great work environment as everyone is accepted, no matter how diverse."
good,productive workplace made to both impress the higher ups and the overall customer experience.  an exceptional environment to make the associates feel both fun and enthused to stock and merchandise a variety of products from toiletries to furniture to both increase sales and lower shrink levels.
good,"Great place to work, great starting point to learn customer service, management is great, everyone helps each other, clean store, somewhat organized, great hours."
good,"it was nice to work at the big lots i worked at. the management, co workers, and everyone else even the local everyday costumers were nice i really liked it there."
good,"i had an excellent experience working in customer service representative, assisted member to update the medical id, benefits explanation, prior authorization  and grievance."
good,"I enjoyed working at Big Lots but they couldn't provide me with enough hours. I really need about 20 hours per week, but I was only working 10 to 12 hours per week."
good,big lots was a decent place to work. the only problems were some of my co-works would speak nasty to me or behind my back and get others to do the same.
good,"The Benefits of having a 20% off discount for furniture, foods, seasonal items was a GREAT plus! I would also say that the bonuses for both Managers and Hourly associates is a huge plus for those wanting more than minimum wage!"
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Big Lots, I worked with a lot of great people. Danville Big Lots was a very fast paced, busy store and it kept us hopping. I looked forward to going to work everyday and seeing my favorite customers."
good,Big Lots is a good place to work and advance.  Management team is  fair and knowledgable.  Work is hard and physical.  Good benefits and pay. warehouse work.
good,it was a opportunity to participate with a team of hard working individuals performing activities form stocking shelves unloading shipment trucks to assisting customers.
good,"Why am I doing this? "
good,"Great place to work for minimum wage relaxed atmosphere, management very friendly. Mostly fast paced when the store is busy on days like friends and family, the summer time as well as holidays the only holiday off is Christmas day."
good,Working as teams with all the stocking and unloading trucks.  Everyone worked together and had a good time doing it.  Customers were a lot of fun and seeing new things come in all the time.
good,Big Lots is a company that definitely rewards those that work hard. overtime and career advancement are given to those that strive to meet company standards.
good,"It’s good for someone going to school. They are willing to accept any schedule. You can also do overnights.  Management was good. overall, the company's benefits were not that great."
good,Management was nice. They preferred part time employees that had other jobs so management just worked around the employees' schedules. The employee discount was one of the reasons many people worked there.
good,The management there were great people. There was a sense of TEAM or Family there. You were treated with respect and given all tools necessary to preform your job. when it was deserved you were recognized for you performance.
good,good hours good management team good work enviroment great work experience and great costomer service to the consumer helping the costomers to there vehiles
good,Very busy. Lots of stocking the warehouse gets full real fast. The truck is unloaded manually so it makes it hard with the hours that are allotted for stocking.
good,"I liked Big lots a lot, but it was lil bit tiring for me, only because we were under-staffed, if there was more workers, the job would have been a breeze."
good,"Just working register, stocking shelves and working with public. I love the public and was good at my job. The manager was great and worked with me alot when my son became sick."
good,excellent company to work for! The commute was awful everyday!I enjoyed every person i worked with and they enjoyed me!! great enviroment to work in and great customers !
good,Easy work besides carrying couches and mattresses wear steel toe boots and something comfortable because you don't want to be uncomfortable bending and moving big items
good,"I worked at Big Lots for almost 2 years. I learned a lot from that store. I unloaded trucks and restocked the shelves at work. I was also a cashier and a floor associate. The manager at Big Lots offered me to be the DTS (Dock to stock) manager, but I turned it down. I felt as if I wasn't ready. I was still a new retail worker at the time and wanted more experience to become a manager. I was also working in the furniture department as well. After being at Big Lots for so long the workers grew on me. We all became family."
good,"If you can get a good manager and a solid crew, Big Lots is not a hard job at all, and it can be a lot of fun. The environment and infrastructure are every evolving and the benefits are pretty great."
good,"this was a good part time job, this job was very productive but also fun, this was a good job to have as a part time because they work with your schedule and people their can be understanding."

good,"Honestly it’s been over 20 years since I worked there. I don’t really remember a lot to say about big lots. I was job and always worked hard, regardless of where it was at."
good,I would go back to Big Lots if I were not retired. It is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to work hard and move up in the company. Great group of people to work for.
good,"A typical day at work at Big Lots for me consists of stocking items , putting items on shelves , picking up loose cardboard and arranging the warehouse . "
good,started here when I was in college pretty good work area people friendly didn't really get the pay that I wanted but in the outcome it was a good starting job
good,"good environment with friendly coworkers, the job is pretty easy and its great for students that don't have many bills to pay, down side is that there no much to benefit from this job."
good,"Good environment to work in. Management were very nice people. "
good,"A workplace where everyone's a teamplayer, and excellent customer service. Its a great place to get excellent buys that are inexpensive, and of pretty good quality! Customer love that I made them feel important and the hardest part of the job was when I was off, I missed making the customers smile!"
good,Good part time job to have and you get 20 percent off in the store plus you get to unload trucks and get into shape!! Work at a Big Lots store before and I loved it
good,I enjoyed working for Big Lots and also enjoyed the other employees it was like a family we all got along well and helped each other out when needed or asked. The hardest part of my job was when I had to leave (transfer out of state).
good,Worked on salesfloor as well as warehouse. Receiving and shipping daily customer service as far sales. Could be fun. Certain days were long. As with any retail job high turnover ratio.
good,This was my first job right out of high school and the entire management and my coworkers made me feel like I was family. I was there 3 years and loved every bit of it. I learned so much being there and it helped me on my journey to current jobs. I would recommend thos place to everyone.
good,Basiclly help customers with mainly furniture because that's the department I was in. Keep furniture neat and clean for customer. Hardest part of the job is we had to more big sofa through the front door and not the back which furniture was in the back of the store.
good,"good place to work "
good,"This was a good job for my at the time opened the store, moved up quickly the management was never push and the work was good. Until they closed the store."
good,"Typical day involved cashiering and customer service related skills. I learned that its so much nicer doing bargain shopping. Management was wonderful! Workplace culture was mutual. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was just right. Working retail is all about visuals for the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, staff, and management. I really enjoyed working for this company."
good,"from what I can remember big lots was a okay place to work,i have no bad memories of the job.the pay was typical for the time and the job was easy to do.being cashier/stock person was okay for me,wasnt there a terribly long time about 6 months so I am not sure what advancements or opportunities were really like.everyone was friendly and personable and the place was clean and neat.management seemed competent and able to perform their duties.a typical work day wasn't too long,5-7 hours and I learned some people skills.the hardest part of the job was stocking top shelves and the most enjoyable part was getting paid."
good,Walking in at 3 am to unload a truck.. your new shipment arrives at 4 am you need to unload the new truck in 2 hours and palletize everything. then you have to bring it into the warehouse while your stocker work the pallets out. day ends about 2 or 3 in the afternoon.
good,"its a cashier jobs, anyone can guess what you have to do, the discount is totally worth it though and the credit card. i used it to furnish my first apartment basically"
good,Good Place to work at. Good people. I like seeing the people at different companies. like to be on my own and getting things done. I never mind the help at all cause I am a people person.
good,"My favorite retail management job.  good work life balance, managers only work 45-50hrs week, descent store hours, descent pay.  pretty good retention for associates"
good,Employees is what made this job fun. As long as you love working with the public you can handle upfront. The stockers is where all the fun happens. Management worked as a team too!
good,"I would put furniture together and put them up for displays, stocked shelves and would help customers as much as i could. Management was good. Most enjoyable part was working with team and working with customers to help them with their needs. I learned a little bit about the retail sales."
good,Very challenging and being able to make decisions on your own without being micro managed. Very professional and communication was high. Was happy working for the company
good,Great Company with Amazing management. I'm sorry i had to move and quit this job. Only issue was the Constant inconsistencies with the inventory. When we sold out of a Item it was hard to say when or if we would get that item in stock again.
good,"Should be easier to higher people, competitive wages to compete with rival companies in the area.  Hard to get small part time jobs also.  This puts a damper on the store."
good,good to work at learned how to customer service better worked there for a little bit but it was a great experience will go back to visit recommended to everyone that would like to work
good,"Great place, great co-workers, were all like a little family, just wish they would give opportunities to the people who deserve them. Other than that, there isn't really anything wrong at this work place."
good,I would come into work clock in and be directed to my task for the day and attempt to finish them while also assisting customers if I needed to.  The hardest part of the job was probably unloading a truck that was completely filled up because many of the unloading associates would then leave early before the truck was unloaded but I would stay later because management asked me to.  I was of course okay with this but it was not easy.  Most enjoyable part was my coworkers they were friendly and willing to teach.
good,"Worked there only as a part time employee. Good working environment, great customers. Good people to work with. Breaks and lunch always on time. Co workers, offers help when needed."
good,"Banking"
good,"Management was fantastic. They completely understood when I had to go into the hospital and was able to cover my shifts. The management was friendly, they helped me understand something with stock. I got my truck training while I worked here."
good,"Was a good, productive place to work. I enjoyed the time I spent and skills I learned, but I feel as though it was time for me to go on to new challenges."

good,My time overall at big lots was very fun and hardworking. The customers are great and the management was very helpful. What I learned from Big Lots is strive as soon as you get in because there is growth there. The hardest part of this job was walking away when they let us go.

good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. Especially the Schererville location. Management is nice and they actually know your name and appreciate your hardwork. I loved stocking the store and making the aisles and shelves look good. I love seeing all of the new products that are coming in! Being a cashier can be annoying because of difficult customers, but that's to be expected. I really appreciated the employee discount especially on the 30% off days they have a few times a year. They always have really good clearance items. My dock to stock leader was very helpful with the early morning deliveries. She was very nice, but also firm when she had to be. She appreciated our hard work more than other managers I've had in the past and she would thank us after every shift, which I appreciated. I think the company needs to pay the stockers more because it is often very laborous and can also be dangerous the way the trucks are loaded. I only made minimum wage for busting my back and sweating too much. I never complained though because I love the work! I just think I would of loved it more if the pay matched the efforts. Overall, my experience working for this company was very positive and I would definitely work here again because of the amazing people you meet and the work that I love doing!"

The managers there are amazing and are very understanding of any situation. The hardest part of the job is probably the 4 am stocking shifts, but I love to do it because I can get my products put out in a timely manner without having to worry about getting in the customers way. The part I like best about my job is that I get to deal with the public and help customers find the product that they are looking for."

good,Overall a ok place to work. I started as a part time worker and learned a lot and got promoted to a manager. Management is not easy you are responsabile for the whole store and your staff and even when things get stressful you have to stay positive. MOst enjoyable part is the one on one interaction with your customers as you see them come in the store each day.

good,Unloading shipments from the company truck. Separate shipment into the different departments that they belong to. Then begin to stock the sales floor with the shipment that we received from the week. Also work as a furniture customer assistant. when customers want a product i would carry it out from he warehouse and deliver it to the front of the store for them. Part time cashier when cashiers are in need of assistance or when the store gathers a long line. This is to help coworkers get their job done with better and to keep business flowing through the store.

good,"The environment throughout the corporate office is friendly and welcoming. I have learned to reach out to leaders as mentors to help guide the path of my career. The CEO is focused on understanding the perspective from all of his employees and is one of the most inspiring business leaders to work with. His philosophy is contagious and he maintains a small card with written values of leadership that he gave the staff at the corporate office. My co-workers are hard working, efficient, and dependable. Due to their personalities, it is like working with family or trusted friends. The hardest part of the job is the difficulty in career advancement beyond your current department. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with a vast variety of cultures, age, and experiences in the people throughout the Big Lots organization."
good,"My experience as a Sales Associate and a Customer Service Specialist were very influential to my customer service skills. I was able to learn new hospitality skills as well as perfect my personal skills at this job. The management team was as helpful as they could be in my daily job responsibilities. The hardest part of the job was having to work the head cash register while answering phones, greeting customers as they came in and left the store, and assisting customers with questions they had while in the store. I did all of these things simultaneously on a typical day of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to satisfy each and every customer that I can in contact with individually."

good,"you learn so much about customer service, it's a great place to work at."
good,"I enjoyed everything about the job,I never had any problems ,I enjoyed working with all my coworkers and my bosses ,"
good,"I loved making sure that each customer that entered the door of Big Lot's were all well taken care of. I often asked questions like ""How is your day and what can we help you with?"" I will come to see if they found what they were looking for. Making sure that everything was organized and taken care of was the most important part of my job that I enjoyed the most."
good,"As I would start the day, the first thing I would do is review the scheduling and sales goals for the day making sure that I had the appropriate coverage for the day, including breaks and lunches. Then I would review progress from the prior day noticing how many assignments were completed and how many more were needing to be completed. Then I would make a plan for the team working that day to complete any jobs that were needing to be completed. What I learned from this job was to have realistic expectations of my staff with project completion. My co workers were hard working and dedicated to the plans I made for them. The hardest part of my job was inventory control, because we didn't have security and the company policy didn't allow management to intervene with theft. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customer happy. That is what the job is all about!"
good,"No two days are the same at Big Lots. Things are are always changing, with new products coming in and different sales displays you never know what you might find. The people are helpful and upbeat, always willing to teach and share ideas."
good,As is to say about most department store jobs it was what it was. You know what you are walking into when you are given the job offer and you know what is expected of you. Point Blank. Period.
good,"Big lots is a fun place to work and a great place to learn the ways of  a retail job. Being on time and working hard really pays off when you need hours, the harder you work and the more you prove to your managers on how hard you work will benefit you in the end. Since it is a small retail store and there isn't a lot of hours sometimes the store looks a mess but with the little hours the store has to give employees, I feel that most employees do there job and do what they can to make the store look store ready. At times the managers can be hard on you but its only to help you do your best. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy with the service I provide for them."
good,"loved the people there, still do.  the only real drawback was the lack of hours.  working with the public was great and I really cannot say much negatively about Big Lots.  If there had not been a cut in hours, I would have stayed longer, I think."
good,Always ready to clock in and work i learned many different tasks working for this company management was very understanding and helpful the job was a breeze the most enjoyable was the customers they really kept me going.
good,i assist customer on when needed and purchases and anything they needed
good,"Big Lots was a great place to work during the holidays, even if the hours were long because of the holiday season. The people are friendly and care about the customers. The work is pleasant."
good,My typical day was always good. Some days slow some days very busy at times we had to jump on the registers but overall good.
good,"It was fun. The most challenging thing about the job was that it took hours for it to be done. Besides that, I have no complaints about the job. I enjoyed it."
good,Assisting customers with questions and merchandise. Maintaining a clean and steady environment for all employees and customers
good,"I worked for the company twice over the last seven years. Most of the time I have a great time at work. It was only when I return to college to advance my career that there was a problem with advancing because of being a female. This is not the view of the corporate office but of the GM. The company did work with me and transferred me to another store. Overall, I love retail and customer service. I am glad that I had the experience of working for Big Lots. I am more confident about getting many different crews to achieve their goals; all at the same time. I loved it so much that I went back to college. My bachelors degree next year will make sure that I am successful from now on. I can say that I did this because of my time at Big Lots."
good,"I spend half my time managing the store as the manager on duty during store hours, and half the time running freight & merchandising teams. Basic duties include but not limited to reconciling cash, sales, inventory, and trailers (Freight). Maintaining a high level of customer service and managing the stores employees, freight flow, scheduling, and driving profitable sales. Hardest part of the job is working product onto the floor as a buyout store without the luxury of a back stock room. Everything must be out on the floor which makes things slightly difficult when the floor is full. There's the only true challenge to me. The rest is basic management"
good,"A typical day of work would be helping customers, opening and closing the store with cash handling. I have learned how to run a store as the manager on duty and acting as the store manager making company based decisions. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with rude customers."
good,"A typical day at work changes from day to day, but they mostly include providing great customer service while resolving any customer issues, processing freight, and maintain a clean merchandise presentation. I have learned how to read numbers to maintain our company/store goals. I try to learn as much as possible to widen my ability to be a better employee/boss. The hardest part of the job would be the things I have no control over such as: company advertising, pricing, policies that customers don't agree with. The most enjoyable part of working here would be the ability to make my customers happy and want to shop with us again."
good,"Count in my register, go to office and find out which pallet I was pricing or which section of the store I was stocking. Co-workers where helpful if I needed help."
good,"Fast moving environment. Plenty to do, from stocking items, go backs as well as cashiering. My co-workers and I work together as a team to perform and get the jobs done that is expected of us. Enjoy meeting and helping customers in a daily basis."
good,I stared as a floor salesman and was promoted to Furniture Manager with in a month of my employment.
good,Meeting and exceeding goals for the furntiure department could be tough at times. What I have learned is sometimes even though the work maybe hard (unloading trailers) it is will worth it. Management was always very helpful in assisting with the trailers. The hardest part of that job was making sure to scheduling was done especially when trailers were due in and having limited hours to do so. My most enjoyable was meet and assisting the customers. Learning about them is exciting.
good,Work keeps me busy with misc tasks and the customers.
good,"It was nice working here, you had to work really fast at time due to store opening"
good,A very fast paced and interesting place to work.. Associates very adaptable with very little coaching.
good,love the people their. Management was goog. would work there agian .
good,"I loved working for Big Lots,I was promoted twice in 1 yr.I really like my position,i was in charge of merchandising all seasonal merchandise and my staff was excellant."
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers with their product selection. Mostly helping with furniture products, but also making sure all other customers get the equal amount of support. I would make sure all ""Ready to Build"" items are stocked on the correct shelves, and assist customers with loading items into their vehicles as needed. I regularly do cashiering duties and recovering the store at the end of the day. Management is always very supportive, and co-workers stay on tasks. Thus, making it easier for me to complete my duties. The hardest part of the job is assisting multiple customers when I'm busy taking large items out of the store to others vehicles. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with a variety of people throughout the day."
good,"Always have things to do, never bored. They give you a lot of freedom to merchandise if you have the time."
good,"A typical day at work consists of cleaning the front end and assisting customers with questions or purchases using Point Of Sale systems. Making price tags for items without prices on them. I learned how to use the Point Of Sale system to make price tags and log information into individual log books, and i learned how to rent the Rug Doctor available in the store. The management are pretty much laid back and give compliments and detailed instructions. The hardest part is dealing with the arrogant customers, though the customer is always right sometimes they seem to have a attitude because they cant get their way as far as the prices of the items. The most enjoyable part is being able to bond and laugh with co-workers and few customers when the time is right. And being able to help people."
good,A typical day at work went by real steady rarely had any customer complaints. Working with Big Lots Inc. made my customer service ability more stable. My co-workers were all so friendly got along with everyone and had a great relationship with many.
good,Company has good benefits. Company will advance employees before hiring outside for position.
good,Fast paced environment and the opportunity to interact with hundreds of people during a shift.
good,"Job required multi-tasking which you had to keep an eye out on the customers on the floor, Cashier, and keeping things organized"
good,"I was hired at Big Lots as a part time seasonal hire so I expected the short work period. While working at big lots I found it easy to get along with my team members, my supervisors, and other managers. We never met the owners although we've seen him around the store. The managers in charge of scheduling were great as far as working with me with my availability."
good,"A Graet Place to work for a student and someone seek part time, the management is attuned with life and the many mysteries included. At times very fast paced and many of interesting people to meet and associate with."
good,they want the customer to have a great shopping experince when they come through the doors also the management lead the store to make sure it is doing what it is needed to do i fell the hardest part of the job is to keep our customer happy all the time and when they leave our store the happness on the face tell it all
good,"Role of ATLM is very demanding. Necessary step to becoming STL. Ultimate prize!!"
good,A typical day at work includes interacting frequently with customers and learning their needs. I learned sales abilities and keeping track of various metrics. The hardest part of the job is unloading furniture trucks and loading heavier pieces of furniture into customer's vehicles. The most enjoyable part of the job is having satisfied customer's needs and having them return for future purchases.
good,BigLots is a great place to work. I was front end manager. I made sure cashiers had great customer service and the sales floor was recovered and furniture mgr kept furniture straight and full.
good,"You get to learn a tremendous amount of things and get to develop as a leader. Staffing is light,but the ability to advance is good. Big Lots has a lot of programs that are available to get into. Benefits are also good."
good,With this job it was good i liked it i learned alot in a little time and i like to listen to music and with this job i was able to listen to my music and work by my self i love doing merchandising and with this job it thought me how to do that job and now that is what i have come to love to do.
good,"What I learn is to listen to the customers. Make sure there happy and let them know they are welcome back.  Seeing them smile and know my name when they walk in the door makes all the matters in the world, knowing they can come to you if they need anything"
good,"Overall the job was nice, but I had to quit because I was myself and others that were working (on remodeling the store which had ended early) was just there to restock the store"
good,"It was a very nice job to have at the time, I just needed something with a little more pay."
good,Great place to work. People are outgoing and a strong sense of community service drives the stores success. Great advancement opportunities to advance.
good,"Easy place to work, just organizing, register, answering the phone and using the intercom to page other employees. High turn over, but that's because people want to get paid to do nothing."
good,"Friendly staff, and great management. Easy tasks and nice work space with an overall good atmosphere. Very flexible hours. I highly recommend working here!"
good,"Got screwed out of a promised management position twice. Loved working there and my coworkers, just couldnt live on the very low hours and below average pay and being led on with empty promises."
good,"I have learned about many important things while working at Big Lots, for example, customer service skills, merchandise, stocking, and unloading merchandise."
good,"Great company to work for, just not enough pay for the job. When you literally do everything in my opinion the pay rate should be $12 per hour I would recommend this."
good,"I had a pretty good experience working at Big Lots. Management was reasonable. Coworkers were fine. I worked everything from unloading/stocking to register to floor. It is a quick paced job on floor and stocking/unloading truck. At the register we always were told to push rewards cards, credit cards, receipt survey, and when we had them, donation drives. If you don’t like “selling” things to customers, it could be frustrating. But if you’re fast enough with your hands, you could be kept on truck (4:30 am on Thursdays, maybe 20 hours/week). But if you’re okay with people, expect to be on floor or register. I averaged only about 28 hours/week so it was not enough to be your only job. Overall, okay job, fast paced and lots of selling though."
good,I liked the culture it was a nice place to work just make sure to check dates on the food you buy a lot of it was out of date and even made me sick at a few points
good,"Nice atmosphere to work."
good,"It is a great place to work for, but I had instances where they went back on their word. I was told I was going to leave not only with a excellent recommendation, but I was going to get a gift card for excellent customer service and attendance promised by the store manager. Never received."
good,Management is help when you have the right people. Second to that when you have the wrong management team things can go down hill pretty quickly at Big Lots.
good,"Many different Departments within the warehouse and everything mostly works together, there was inbound and outbound. SO that being said inbound left closely at the same times and outbound the same for their side. Work is easy, pay is fair for the area, but not much advancement opportunity due to no one leaving management (pretty decent management). I got to wear sweat pants and basketball shorts to work everyday. CO-workers were generally really great."
good,"I love working here and I love the employees they’re so nice and chill I get along with everyone including the managers but one thing I don’t like is they started to cut everyone hours for no reason, I was working a 20-22 hrs a week and now I’m working 8 hrs a week. Usually around 5:30pm the some of weirdos come out and start to steal from the store."
good,"This was probably the best I've ever had because the crew is always there, and the managers were really laid back but got the job done with you. I would transfer between York and Bloomsburg due to college and the company would never have a problem."
good,I loved working here personally. The only reason I left is I wasnt being paid enough for my area of living. The job itself was simple and easy to do. The people I worked with were amazing
good,"a typical day at big lots is fun yet competitive and productive"
good,I miss my job at Big lots so bad. I unfortunately was very much in a vacation town and when it closed down for the winner the hours were few and far between but the rest of the year I was getting almost 30 hours a week and the job was not difficult. They start people at 9.50 an hour and you get 3 vacation days a year from the get-go. since I've worked for Big lots I did have to relocate to a different state but I really wish I could get back into working for that company.
good,"Biglots taught me what was most important about customer service and cashiering: Always being patient, have a smile and to never rush. this job has the greatest work-environment among co-workers as well."
good,it is a fun company to work for very friendly  and enjoy the company all the workers work together with everyone the managers are all good to get along with
good,"Big Lot was a great place to work because of the people who worked there everyone was family.But the work was much more then expected for the pay that was doing given. a typical at work is okay because it into you have to unload a trunk with just 3 or 5 people and this trunk bring 800 or more items and maybe two or three pallets that mean the rest is single boxes.Some boxes are big and some are little and we worked 4 hours straight. That's 2 people in the trunk and 3 out of it"
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, a solid company that has deep retail roots and gives back to the community as much as possible."
good,Great job in retail. Love helping customers finding items and setting sales.  Unloading freight from trucks to see all different type of products and meeting new peoples
good,"My manager was great, the days went by quick. Extremely positive working environment. Allowed a couple of breaks per shift, paid time off, and room for advancement."
good,it was typical morning like pack or busy hours just depend on customer and sales . I learned how to be a casher to count right how to almost run the store and it as a good management team that was real great and the workplace was fun and good vibes from the employees  the hardest part was to build thinking with out direction but managed to google the instructions the best part was working furniture and unloading truck...
good,"All the managers are great and my coworkers are fun to work with. During the week it's a steady stream of people, but on the weekends it can get crazy."
good,I like my job it’s just not enough money for my lifestyle or life period . The manager was very cool very sweet and fair my co workers was very respectful I love them. They are like my second family.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service and the patience you must have, especially with the difficult ones. I would say the most difficult job task would be to unload a 3500 piece truck in a certain time frame. The almost 5 years working for Biglots I had 6 store managers because the demands of the store managers jobs are not easy and not for everyone.The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing finishing task I had done, such as endcaps, planograms and furniture setups."
good,unloading tucks supervised the stockers doing paperwork for the trucks and using a cash register. Open and closing the store at least twice a week. Running furniture dept. when cashiers goes on break
good,Good job with great benefits. Full time is hard to achieve for associates because there wasn’t many full time positions available. I always worked in management positions and there were opportunities for advancement. It’s the best job I’ve had but decided I wanted to go back to college.
good,I had a pleasant experience with the company and would definitely recommend them as an employer.  Associates and supervisors are treated fairly and equally.
good,"Big Lots is a good fast paced work environment, busy work lots of customers. pay is average. This is a retail job the culture is the same as any other retail store. not an uptight employer they appreciate your hard work"
good,"Working at big lots would be good for me, I like unloading trucks and putting the items where they supposed to be. Stocking is what I use to do at big lots it was relaxing and it made me stay busy"
good,"I liked working at Big Lots, the manager was nice and the pay was good. I appreciated the accommodation they gave me like a locker and water. Overall, the place was nice and had a friendly staff as well."
good,Each day we must provide great customer service on a daily basis. I continue to maintain company standards and follow company guidelines. Big Lots has a positive culture and believes that all associates should be recognized for a job well done.
good,Atmosphere was very good. You knew what your job was that day. very punctual about breaks. people were easy to get along with.  They cross train you in every department of the store.
good,"I love working at Big Lots. I am constantly able to keep myself busy, and my co workers are wonderful and very helpful. My management team cares about my success and continues to challenge and encourage me with new things."
good,"Go in clean restrooms, Wash windows, Take trash out, Start cashiering. "
good,I loved working there great people and management. They do what they can to help you learn what you need and manage work around your life schedule. I would go back to work here definitely.
good,"The job here is easy, the management is easy to deal with and they have a system you can use to fill out exactly when you can work and they stick to it tightly. Was offered management after 4 months (didnt take it, should have) You can do shirt shifts or long shifts, they will call to ask if you want extra hours frequently because people just wont come in but they don't get upset if you turn them down."
good,It  good place to work . It just not  a balance place to work. What l mean is that you are not guaranteed 40 hours a week. Overall it's a good place to work.
good,I was a sales associate in the funiture department i worked hard everyday i by had great costumer service skills and i also help carry and build funtiure for other customers.
good,I liked how management treated employee's. Also plenty of advancement opportunities. Wonderful coworkers loved the teamwork environment. Fun relaxed environment.
good,"The management team at Big Lots is quick to acknowledge good workers, they promote those who work hard as quickly as possible and get everyone in the position that best suits them."
good,"I worked at this company for 6 years and enjoyed every moment of it.I increased my overall knowledge of sales, customer service and merchandising every day. Established some notable contacts and made some great friends in the process. There was a lot of physicality in the warehouse that made for some exhausting days, but overall it was a rewarding experience."
good,It was a decent job after high school but could do better pay for those for put in more effect and need holidays off like thanksgiving
good,"There is no typical day in retail, but at Big Lots we bring the fun daily. It is truly an awesome place to work. I've learned allot about doing more with less and this has defined my skills as a leader in my store."
good,"Typical day was to clean, help any customers, move furniture around in the back for shipments. "
good,overall the job was great but we did have slow days but other than than it was good. they also had great sales. the team was so helpful and the manger was also helpful.
good,At Big Lots there was always something new every month making it a interesting place to work. It is also a great place to start out in the retail business right after high school. I really enjoy my stay at Big Lots.
good,"I was very happy to see such a supportive and wonderful management team that took good care of it's workers. I only applied to be a cashier but within a week they were willing to move me up after seeing how fast I got the job. Management was always open to talk to, communicated well with others and really encouraged open ideas to boost sales."
good,"clock in "
good,The culture at Big Lots was fairly laid back.  The sales goals were realistic and the amount of support to achieve them with was acceptable.  A fun place to work.
good,"Help customers, assign task to Employees, set Displays to Plano-gram Bank Deposits, review security Video."
good,"I've worked at Big Lots for about two years and I've had a great experience at first but things changed before I quit and things changed even more after.  The typical day for me as the Furniture Manager at first was checking the calender for any pick ups or deliveries, finding the tagged merchandise in the stock room or trailer (worked in a small high volume store so we used outside trailers for furniture storage). After I just cleaned the department and made sales to customers who browse through the department. I also had to maintain signage on all the furniture.  That's basically all the furniture manager had to do but at my high volume store and my work ethic I did more.  I managed truck processing which simply helping the truck team unload the truck. I had unload furniture and stock them.  Any new merchandise had to be built and put out to the floor.  And beyond furniture I would open or close the store depending on the needs.  I especially did this when the manager team I worked with started to fall through.  I had to delegate tasks to the recovery team, start projects, especially if it's summer as furniture becomes the selling point in the seasonal area.  A plus about this job was the amount of overtime I was giving.  My payrate wasn't the best at first but with 20 hours of overtime I was bringing home about 800 a week.  My assistant manager bought in over a thousand with her pay rate.  (Yes overtime was extremely easy and believe it or not extremely tolerable) Unfortunately we rarely took our breaks even though we inserted them in our time sheets so our DM wouldn't complain"
good,I had a good time working at big lots but it's not a good job for the most forward thinking of people as there is not a lot of room promotion and advancement. It seems like most of the higher positions there are filled laterally. Although if you're not looking to climb your way to the to top of Big Lots and just need something to get yourself off your feet this is perfect.
good,"very nice co workers, most enjoyable part of the job just to go in and get the job done,  learned alot about all the jobs at big lots"
good,Big Lots is a great place to work. They have a new CEO and the company is heading in the right direction. I enjoy being a servant leader and sharing the company vision. The hardest part for managers is that we can not post our schedules until Saturday. This gives on time for associates to plan there lives.
good,"It was a fun place to work but unfortunately closed and left Canada. management was great and the staff was a decent group of people to work with. I learned how to follow planograms, time management, being more of a team player and how to manage stresses."
good,Great place to work at with Job Benefits and Job Security. Been with the company for two years. Over great company with benefits including discounts at all Big Lots stores.
good,Work usually goes by smooth. I have great customer service. The people I work with is full of energy and always stays focus on what are task may be at the time.
good,"Its A Great First Time Job"
good,"Every thing that a manager would have to do to open the store. "
good,"A typical day at Big Lots was busy. Duties for the day consisted of: - counting tills"
good,"My manager  was the best you could work for"
good,Big Lots is a good place to work. I learned many new skills while employed there.
good,"Great customer service. Always busy stocking, unloading trucks and cleaning."
good,"Nice environment to work."
good,"I work part time in the evening , doing stock assisting staff  and customers. sometime during holidays we work longer hours and I am now stop, but I do enjoy working with my co-worker and helping customers"
good,"worked independently , helped others reached their goals ,"
good,"A typical day at Big Lots was morning huddle meetings, stocking and merchandising. During my time at Big Lots, I learned how to give great quality customer service as well as how to contribute and be a team player. In terms of management, they were professional and fair. My co-workers were easy going and diverse which I found to be a plus. The hardest part of my job was training others. The most enjoyable part of my job was the flexible hours and schedule."
good,"Merchandising products for quick sales, setting up sale sign for sales."
good,I put my 100% ans till room for expansion. I usually am the manager closing so the I start my day with checking my sales. If there low try to encourage small items at the end of every purchase. Make sure everyone is greeted and check out time is fast and efficient. The things I learn I believe there's always improvement to be done and it's my job to keep my team positive and teaching them great customer service. Hardest part of my job would be that it is not a full time position and with out benefits. I love to work with others and teach as well as to learn.
good,"In the year that I worked at Big Lots I was able to advance two positions. My Store Manager was very helpful in training me to read and understand spreadsheets, as well as how to schedule for optimal coverage. I learned the behind the scenes marketing and sales trends for the company, and how to optimize sales. The hardest part of my job was working around the minimul hours given to us by corporate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experiences. I was involved in Manager Conference calls weekly to help other stores increase their sales by offering advise, and marketing strategies. I handled the Dock-To-Stock proceedure to ensure that our warehouse was empty and our shelves were full. Creating plan-o-grams to maximize shoppability. "
good,I started working here in April 2012. I liked working here. Management was professional and very nice. I was pregnant at the time I was working here and they never gave me any hassle about my schedule. They even provided me a stool for when I got too tired to stand. The only thing I hated about the place is that some of the employees caused a lot of drama.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job with Big Lots, was they allowed you to conduct your investigations and reports without a lot of micro-managing. They were top notch when it comes to training, and spared no expense when it came to equipping stores with the latest technology in CCTV."
good,"A typical day would include ringing at your register, pulling the till and counting what is in your register, putting away items back in their proper place that have been misplaced, putting price tags on items and putting them on the shelves, reorganizing areas that have been messed up, and knowing what the deals are in the ad. I learned how to manage with customers and how to use customer service skills, answering telephones, and how to work very fast and get everything done. The co-workers were great and easy to get a long with and very friendly. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything that you are told to do by the time you have to clock-out. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and meeting new people."
good,This company has many locations and at the specific location i was at i had a great time and loved the compnay.
good,"I prefer not to write a review about this company. My decision has nothing to do with the company, it's all me. I have nothing good nor bad to say. In general I do not write reviews."
good,"Easy atmosphere to work for, really enjoyed working there. Tasks were made simple and easy to follow task manager. Use your time wisely and work was a breeze. Use it poorly and tasks will stack up quickly."
good,"I loved my job at biglots, my coworkers and managers.. I met many new friends and had many returnin customers... I learned to build things I never thought I could build and I enjoyed bein a manager"
good,the overall size of the store is a big aspect of how well the store will function. All aspects of the store relay on a 1/3 ratio of back room sq ft vs sales floor. store operations and overall sales is 100 controlled by freight flow and processing. if this is broken so is the store. This is one of the major aspects that the company is focusing on within the next couple of year.
good,"A typical day at work was your basic retail day, I usually went in to do a cashiering job. I had the tendency to work in furniture as well, it was easy."
good,"Unloading trucks rain, shine, cold or hot helping customers stocking and running a stock crew managing money and paper work it’s a physically hard job stock room has to be empty within a week to prepare for the truck the week after"
good,Big Lots is a great place to work for. They consider their associates their number one priority. Its very productive and fast paced. Management works well with you to ensure you understand and like what your doing. They love to promote within the stores.
good,"A typical day consisted of reviewing the schedule, meeting with department managers and teams. Customer service relations and interacted with sales associates.  Overall operations."
good,I really enjoyed my job there never had any problems. I don't know if things have changed since I've been there but I think it's still the same. I just left to gain a different kind of experience but I really thought it was a very nice job.
good,Looking for full time employment.  Big lots offered me a part time job when I needed one.  This is not a career choice for me.  It is a part time job till i can get a full time job
good,The management here is nice and friendly. A lot of times though I find myself working 8 hour shifts without a back up for register. People working there are pulled in all different directions.
good,Big Lots is a great retail job and a great learning experience. The experience and skills you gain can be used for personal ideas such as staring your own business.
good,a typical day at work unload trailors of merchandise then transport them via a forklift.  Hardest part of the job was unloading heavy items.    the job was pretty enjoyable always kept you busy!
good,"I had some experience working in retail stores. Unloading freight trucks, sorting merchandise, nightstocker, cart pusher. Was good for the time being I was there. Ended shortly due to an injury that I'm willing to discuss in an interview."
good,"I was part-time at Big Lots for about three years and the job I had was good for a first job, but not something I wanted to stick with long-term. The management and most of my coworkers were friendly, and the work environment was pretty low-stress. I started with just operating a cash register and organizing shelves, but as time went by I also learned how to run the furniture department, and unpack and move stock around the warehouse and store floor."
good,Very good company to work for and I had enjoyed working everyday and learned a lot. Very good management and was proud to work for Big lots. Work place was very good.
good,"Big lots lacked organization. It started out as a great job and learning experience but as knew roll outs and systems were implemented things got a little gray. We didn't have the ability to sell the way we wanted so it was more of a walk around the store and be friendly type of deal, after all your behind the scenes work, like planograms, was completed."
good,I lived working here. I met a lot of new people. It was a fast working job but easy. My managers and coworkers were very friendly. I had overtime every week.
good,It was a place to build yourself up in the work places you got to meet different people in there and i learn so much. I was very comfortable there didn't have no problem with my staff. the manager made it real welcome there.
good,Everything was all so laid back and I enjoyed everything about working there! Only thing that would have been nice would have been more hours but what can you do when you only work part time.
good,This company expect to much out of one person. Payroll was never there. Truck process was a joke. Company is always making changes. You don't get all the information only half.
good,Fast pase  . you need to price every one of your products and place them onto the shelf . so that everything is marked and placed into the right spot before the store will open.
good,"In a typical day of work in my last position i fulfilled all my task and as well helped others, i develop my skills and experience in numerous ways. Meanwhile i was there i learned a great deal about handling customers and help them in anyway as possible  ."
good,This job was more of an in between job for me but ultimately it grew on me. The management really made me feel like I had been there for years in my short time. They were very knowledgeable about everything going on in the store.
good,"Overall a wonderful company to work for.  Was fortunate to have"
good,I enjoy my time when I'm there and my food is served in a timely fashion. All the workers and very friendly and accommodating. It is super clean and smells good all the time and I feel right home most times I'm there.

good,Very nice place to work a very work friendly environment supervisors are very encouraging and helpful in every day assingments
good,"Big lots is filled with great customer service and respectful co workers. There are opportunities for seasonal work, part time and even full time. The best part of my day was being able to assist customers with accurate customer service."
good,we did a lot of unloading trucks sorting the warehouse and stocking the show room floor and they had a good safety program
good,Working at Big Lots was a great experience the management made me feel right at home when I started at their establishment.
good,A typical day  in big lots is helping customers and keeping the floors clean and counting money every night even the weeking are good sells
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I am very personable and enjoyed developing my store staff. The company's core values maintained a strong team.
good,a typical day is starting out by opening store getting all the registers and paperwork done then it was on to tasks to be done for the day vary daily. I learned a lot about retail and all the work that goes into running a store. The management is disorganized they like to pass responsibilities off on others. I had wonderful co-workers many which I became close friends. The hardest part of the job was I would rather not comment on. The most enjoyable part was the customers and co-workers
good,I enjoyed working with the people that I worked with and enjoyed some of the customers that I dealt with.The management had us in the right direction and had us knowing what was expected everyday. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with customers that weren't satisfied with the product or having to deal with another employee's mistake if I wasn't there. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the bonuses for meeting our plan and some of the customers that I had to deal with.
good,the hard thing to do everyday was when it was time to leave 8 hours was not enough to do and take care of the customers and making sure everything was ready for the next day thats why i was happy coming to work the very next day.
good,Big Lots Canada is ceasing all operations in Canada early 2014.
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences at Big Lots. The company values employees and treats them as such!
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier, I was always busy. I liked getting the discount in the store also, that helped me a lot. Hardest part, was displeased customers."
good,I would come in and put go backs away and cleaned the store then straigtened the store. And worked the register if it was busy. The management is very good there they are very nice people to work for also the co workers. The hardest part of the job was when I unloaded the truck and had to be there at 3:00 am. The best part was we got a pay check every week
good,"Working at Biglots i learned how to deal with more customers, I looked forward to going to work everyday. My co-workers was nice and real helpful. There wasnt anything hard about the job it was a good place to work."
good,They had me doing alot there which i loved. I like being busy alot
good,I enjoyed working at Biglots. It was a productive and funfilled team environment. The managers of Biglots worked around schedules.
good,"It's a smaller company, but that's where it has it's charm. A great place to work if you enjoy that kind of atmosphere. It's like a mini Walmart, and great place to learn a basic retail foundation for workplace skills."
good,"it  is a fun place to work"
good,"Big lots is a great, relaxing atmosphere. I loved working there, but unless you want to work 6-12 hours a week, big lots is not for you. It was a great summer job, but when you can barely pay your bills."
good,"doesn't pay very well, hours are ok, so if u plan on attending any community colleges close to a big lots it's a great way to earn some money while also attending school."
good,"Working at Big Lots is great! Employers and employees are nice. They are very lenient as far as flexible scheduling. You pick the times you are available and they work around that. Most of the time it is only 2-3 people on the floor (1 cashier, 1 sales associate). It is a very quiet, relaxed work environment. They also provide a 401(k) option here."
good,"Working in the Big Lots corporate office is pretty much like most corporate jobs. You spend more time in meetings that you'd prefer, some of the management is terrible, some is great. Lots of exciting things happening within the company with re-branding and the launch of the ecommerce website. I had good work/life balance and returning after maternity leave (no maternity leave benefits, just short term disability and FMLA) felt like my managers were flexible and understanding with me. "
good,Before you get to clock in every on walks through the medal detector and show identification. Go in hit the floor. Greet everyone. Then get assigned to your station for that day.
good,"Work was alright, nothing crazy, it does get pretty boring if you aren't keeping yourself busy with something to do in the downtime, only issue is there no real way to grow or increase pay so there not really any incentive to be at 110%. Management was very understanding and very cooperative of scheduling, and was really organized about it."
good,Had a couple of different Managers while working at Big Lots. The District Manager was on top of any issues and resolved them. For the most part it was a good place to work with hard working employees.
good,"I enjoyed , working for big lots my manager , was the best one i could've ask for . I could easily go and talk to hi m about anything , whether it had something to do with the job or not . I loved working for big lots ."
good,"Since the new managers have arrived, the work environment has become more structured and professional.  Everyone works well together.  There are virtually no conflicts among employees.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, but again, professional.  They work around any schedule you may have outside of work such as school, religious obligations, family needs.  They are not condescending or uncaring about unforeseen events that occur which may cause one to call in on their shift."
good,"Not a bad place to work and the customers are great. The hardest part was explaining our difficult to understand sale signs. Direct management is really good. However, upper level management is disconnected from stores."
good,Usually early morning shift. Planned work day. stocking freight on Friday after receiving truck. open the store at 9am. go back and forth from stocking and making sure stockers are stocking merchandise properly. setting planograms. keeping store neat and orderly.
good,"Great Management team, they took the time to help you in your role and answer any questions you may have, they explained he processes and how it applys."
good,This is a good place to work if you like retail. Most of the time is focused on unloading the trucks. Customer assistance . As well as cash register duties. Lot of work some days but management made it really cool to work there.
good,"Continuously examines productivity effectiveness and seeks better procedures, such as time limits on task to be completed and coaching. Seeks to effectively communicate expectations and goals with all associates."
good,This was one of the best job's i've ever had. People know the customer's and pay attention to their need's and  want's. Fun working environment and loving people.
good,"The hardest part of the job is how much of a work load that is put upon you and expected to complete.  This takes away from customers and staff needs."
good,"good place to work "
good,"Overall, the job is decent.  Management needs some work though.  For the jobs we are doing, I feel as though we should be paid more. I also feel as though upper management shouldn't fight with associates when they want days off."
good,"Excellent place for growth and Excellent Benefits"
good,The managers have been great to work with. Most of the time it seems like too much work for our little staff to complete but some how we get it done. I think with the staff we have had in the last year that the store has come a long way and looks 100% better.
good,"There really wasn't any real communication skills there, not everyone knew what or how to do a certain assignment. Which brought down production speed, but other than that Big Lots was one of the best jobs I have ever had."
good,"Great place to start working and move up."
good,Big Lots is a great company to work for. I've learned more about life in and out of work working at Big Lots than I did the two years I attended college. Big Lots taught me to love people and accept everyone for their unique qualities.
good,"mangement is ok, the customers are great the job is fun and the enviroment is good, the employees are great and you get learn new things every day"
good,I love that the co-workers were very friendly and helpful in guiding me of what to do. The supervisor was very friendly as well. But I didnt get paid as much as expected.
good,Great Place to work. Co worker were friendly. The job there was no complete order unlike any other store I used to work at where you had to place products into shelves. Never had a bad night.
good,"Worked every day to provide the best customer service and insure that all associates are properly trained. "
good,A typical day at work is meeting different people and giving great customer service. I have learned to work at a fast pace while satisfying the customer. The management department is exceptional and willing to help with any problem that is brought to there attention. My co-workers are wonderful and caring people to work with. The hardest part of the job is the volume of customers during certain seasons.The most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction I receive from the customers when they let me know that I have full-filled all of there needs.
good,It was a really fun place to work at i was in need of a job and they gave me an opportunity. All of the workers there were really nice and helpful if i needed help with something they didn't hesitate to come over and help me i wouldn't mind working in more places like this one
good,"Pay is comparable to similar jobs for management.  For a successful store to operate all members of the team must participate.  Very hands on job, heavy lifting.  The hardest part especially being a female is having to load sometimes 100lbs + furniture and gazebos sometimes alone."
good,"-A typical day at Big Lots consisted of stocking shelves, training new associates, helping customers with there purchases."
good,"Greeting customers, bein a cashier, stocking, straightening isles."
good,"unloading trucks, selling insurances on products. i learned how to sell products. i got along well with others. the hardest was learning all the functions on computers. "
good,"Open store with 1 manager. Get all registers ready for the day,any task left on counter from previous evening take care of..Usually have morning stockers on the floor make price tickets if they run out .Go over days plan with manager On Duty.. Give Co-Workers daily task if management tells me..Hardest part of Job Is Standing in one place all day and getting a break or lunch is like pulling teeth.Enjoyable part is meeting new people every day and making my customers happy with a smile when they leave the store. If you close its the same other then you have to do the nights deposit fill pop machine front and face shelves sweep ,vacumn rugs get trash ready for recovery person to take to ware house lock doors and finish up our paper work.."
good,A typical day here will keep you occupied. Great family atmosphere. The hardest job here is being lazy. The most enjoyable is you will not be bored.
good,Productive very resourceful always up for learning easy to work with. I'm determined to always succeed and to make myself and the company better.
good,"I worked at Big Lots in Meadville, PA for a year during my last year of earning my BA. I had to juggle commitments for school with my job at Big Lots, and the managers were more than willing to work with me as long as I told them what I needed. I loved the people I worked with and the job was not too easy or too hard (cashiering, recovery). I learned a lot about how businesses work and if you are loyal to the company you will move up fast. I had to relocate for grad school, but I would have loved to continue working there if possible!"
good,"The people that I worked with at Big lots was great. They helped me complete the task as a team. The mangers where very helpful, they helped me understand working with the computers and learning where everything was located at."
good,Very faced paced. Usually short staffed. Associates and management are very approachable. Always fun to see new merchandise. Multi tasking is a must. Guest service is # 1 priority
good,"I do wish we were offered more hours. But other than that I have no problem working here. It can be either a fast pace job, or a very relaxing pace. Depends on the day and time."
good,"Its a good place to work you always on your feet. Its a good environment the people is really friendly, they'll help you if you need help. the most enjoyable part about working at Big Lots is that you get paid everyweek."
good,"This is my second time working for the company, and it's one of the better jobs I've had. Management works with you to provide flexible schedules. The management team makes working there enjoyable, and there's plenty of room for advancement in the company!"
good,"I am a floor associate and a cashier, as a floor associate I restock and pull forward items in each aisle. I also assist in helping customers find items and prices of items. As a cashier I greet customers and keep my area clean and free of debris. I also answer phone calls and customers questions."
good,there great i was layed off but over all there a great company its a great opportunity to grow in your future to become more i was always ontime never called out
good,I really liked Biglots I loved the customers...  I'm a people person/....    the only bad thing is its parttime.   I met some great people and even became friends...
good,"On a typical day of work you have customers asking you for items , you have to manage calls, cashier. Stay on the lookout for thieft s if by any chance you spot one ."
good,I loved working for big lots. I am sad they closed their store here. The management was amazing and the company was just a good company overall. I loved it there
good,Very enjoyable place to work with a great crew that is easy to get along with that has a good work structure with a great management team. Always putting the customer first.
good,"This was my first real taste of Retail, and I learned a whole lot. For example, I now know what an end cap is (the display rack at the end of the aisle). The list goes on and on. Bonus was that it was enjoyable, and not a lot of folks can say that working in retail."
good,"Co-workers get along, loving customers majority of the time just another job managers are great but being full time would be better. Some days are busier then others. It is always something to do. As long as you work managers love you."
good,no security at all job was okay not what you wanted. I learn that it is messy and unorganized. They need reliable staff. because everyone that they hire never comes to work
good,While working at big lots I met a lot of people.
good,I loaded trucks here and it was not for me. I did do it for 6-7 months. I worked through the hot part of the summer. They did however provide us with water .
good,theirs always a bi lots no matter where you go in the united states
good,I loved working there. I wish they can take me back. I enjoy working for that company. I always dedicate myself to make it to work there. I would like to get back in that company.
good,I love working at this biglots because of the fact that I am so close to everyone but it is time for me to leave because I need more money than what I am getting. I cant take care of my family with the amount that I am getting paid.
good,this store is always changing so look for something new or closedout they will not surprise you you can shop for some cheaper items here
good,Just worked for a little extra cash and i mean a little no way to move up only people in management was going to get promotions work hours like 4 a day so it would mess your whole day up you did get 20% off of your purchase when shopping there
good,The company has great discount and hours to offer and the atmosphere is pleasant. You can find great deals and save a lot of money on certain items compared to some groceries stores.
good,I would recommend anyone who is looking for part time work with a little competition this is a good place to work the people there are very friendly.!
good,The Job was good. It paid me well. But unless you were looking to become a Store Manager or above. It could prove to be difficult to work with the District Manager.
good,"I really enjoy working at big lots because I like the inter action with the customers"
good,Great job for helping customers and holding events. Good training program and colleagues are friendly and helpful. Lot's of resets and sign changes but overall a great job.
good,i really loved working here everyone was really nice and the job wasn't hard to do i wish i could have stayed longer but i had to move. would definitely recommend for a first time job
good,"This is a part time position. You meet people on a daily basis and you have to learn how to deal with people differe3t personalities. Management is always willing to assist.  my coworkers are all tram players. nothing is hard about the job.  The most is enjoy about the job is being able to meet and greet customers, offer assistance, bring the customers to their destination,  make sure customer know me by name, and enforce company policies and procedures."
good,A good company to start out with. Great values. Benefits are iffy at best
good,everyone was nice and productive. The manager was very understanding of my school schedule. there as no room for advancement and the pay wasn't nearly enough which is why I had to leave
good,"I enjoy working at this company. my pay was low, but that does not mean that other employees are the same."
good,I liked working at Big Lots. My store manager was very nice but some of the other managers where just slightly off their rocker sometimes. they acted like they could talk to you like you where a dog when they felt like it. I needed more regular hours. some weeks you would work 25 hrs then the next week it would be like 5 hours.
good,It has been a pleasure to work for Big Lots. I have enjoyed the work relationships that I have made and I believe that the company has a bright future.
good,"I unloaded trucks, tagged merchandise, and stocked shelves. I enjoyed the work. I am hoping to obtain another job of the type."
good,Start of day I would go in load flat carts for stockers to stock merchandise. Monitor how much stock their stocking per hour. Document how much and tally up numbers to get the next week stocking hours.
good,cleaning and greeting customers also show them where deals of the week are. as a cashier you count a till at the beginning and end of your shift.
good,Enjoyed the enviornment and working in sales department encouraged me to speak out and provide information on product to customers.
good,Working for big lots was a fun and energetic environment. I stocked selves and ran a cash register.
good,It's a great work atmosphere the employees and customers are awesome. The managers only listen to other managers not their employees at all. I did learn a lot there and I thank them for the opportunity.
good,I liked working for biglots while I was there.  I wish they had more hours to give but they only hire part time  but I liked working in the mornings and getting work done
good,"Working at Big Lot was a pleasure. The employees we're team players, The management was  fantastic and a team player. Recommend Big Lot to anyone. Schedule was always flexible."
good,Let’s be honest most people do not going to big lots anymore. The staff gets really close to one another because we have a lot of free time. You also start to befriend the regulars that come in
good,Started in Feb 2018 and am leaving because of  personal reasons. I love it here and enjoy my job however with only getting 8 hours for the week its time to move on.
good,I feel that the environment at big lots is very exciting and they make you feel at home. Working here has felt very positive and the others are very collaborative and easy going
good,"My typical day was spent maintaining and balancing a cash drawer.  I also stocked shelves, cleaned, and did public relations. The Upper Management was very professional.  The lower management could use some work in professionalism."
good,Didn't like management. Job was slow paced. Didn't like the being stuck in the building. Management was rude anunattentive. And unhelpful. Pay was awful
good,I enjoy working here and I love what I do. I got hired as the merchandise manager and the day I started we lost one of our managers due to an illness and since then I have been doing the job of 2 managers. I feel as though I have no help and therefore it is hard for me to manage the job I was hired for while maintaining the other job as well.
good,"	Completed merchandising for new shipments"
good,I love this job but they only over part-time unless you are willing to relocate for mangement level.
good,Big lots was a great experience for me I worked around some good helpful coworkers my hours was flexible for me I love getting paid every week and it was a good part time job for me at that time
good,"Making friends was super easy , get along with everyone, always have a great smile because that is what customers look forward too, greet everyone when they walk in, make everyone feel like there at a second home"
good,"I was with Big Lots for 17 years and would have stayed but my store closed in Paris, TX. We were the very first store in Texas as the training store. I had a great management team  and everyone got alone. The pay was great; paid weekly with great benefits. I hated the hours scheduled because it always changed; worked long night hours some times and the store hours was terrible and stay open 7 days a week. I hated working on Sunday's and we were always short handed."
good,"I started working here as a truck and floor associate where I helped unload the trucks and stocked the incoming merchandise. I also kept the store neat and tidy, occasionally cashiering as needed. Later I was moved into furniture and helped customers pick out furniture that fit what they were looking for as best I could and loaded up any purchases into their vehicle. Coworkers are rather easy to get along with and willing to help if you ask. It gets busy rushes at times, but it isn't so bad so long as you keep calm."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Big Lots but was unable to get full time."
good,"Working at Big Lots is a learning experience everyday because of the people you satisfy and help. The management, coworkers, and the position you work in. Overall, a typical day would consist of clocking in, getting into your position and performing your tasks. Meanwhile, helping customers on the sales floor as you go and answering calls in a timely manner. However, what we do sometimes are just not enough or meet up to the customers standards, but to out knowledge the customer is always right. We can always keep our day going from the enjoyment of satisfying customers needs and wants."
good,"A typical day a Big Lots was waking up in the morning at five o'clock get off around 12 o'clock plus a 30 minute break or a hour break depending on the hours. I really enjoyed helping people and talking to the customer's about item's in the store on online. Plus helping with bigger stuff like table's, chair's, and like stuff like fireplace and bed's."
good,"Everyone does what they are instructed to but not everyone can be spoken to or bothered. Most wouldn't leave problems at the door. Managment was great, he was a very tough guy and very responsible, he's not a manager there anymore."
good,"i learned alot about helping people, i learned about customer satisfaction, alot of experience in learning how to type, learned about book keeping and drawer counting. how to compromise and how to make people satisfied with their shopping experience"
good,"great place to work"
good,Typical work day is a 4 hour shift. cahiering and helping customers.Fun place to work when the right people are in . management is not the greatest well one of the mangers.
good,depending on the store but  does face inventory issues but  pretty good place to work  I don't think the computer systems are the best sometimes they  freeze and give out  nothing bad but depending on the store they also do every year  Donations to the National Children's Hospital  helping pay for in some cases life saving procedures  its a very amazing  program to donate to
good,"always something new to do every day"
good,"A typical day at work I would start off my clocking in at scheduled time, once I clocked in I would go to the daily assignment book to check my duties for the day and proceed with what is instructed. At that job I learned how to do returns, create break schedules, how to override a transaction when  needed, how to check inventory. The management in Big lots was fair I really liked the store manager she was awesome, so were the assistant managers. They were there when needed and overall were very nice people. I must say that the hardest part of my job was dealing with the customers because some where nice but some were very rude and nasty. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I had great co-workers we all got along pretty well and worked good together."
good,"Biglots was a fun place to work because I learned how to do everything possible in the store and was one of the few employees who actually knew things others did not. I also had a lot of fun building furniture, rather than being stuck behind a cash register all day. The downside of working at biglots was that there is little to no advancement in the company. They raises weren't that great either. So, as much as I enjoyed working for them, I wish that they could've given me more hours and paid a better wage (it probably would've kept me from leaving them for Sam's club)."
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  I would have stayed if the pay and hours were better.  It is hard to move up in this company.  People I worked with who had been there for years still wasn't in management.
good,"Start of my day is signing in, working on recovery, floor sets, customer service cashiering, working in the furniture department selling products to customers, answering phones as well as stocking shelves and customer carry outs. I have learned what a great team I have to work with and if you have a question it is always answered and if you wanna learn to do something they will teach you. Management is good they are very fair as well as knowledgeable. My co -workers we bounce of each other we are always there if someone needs us to help out. The hardest part of job I would say is loading furniture. The most enjoyable part would be the people I meet and my co- workers."
good,"Nice place to work,but Management was not trained well at all.they were kind of all over the place.not much else to tell...I will still shop there of course!"
good,I really enjoy my job and the people that I work with.  The management staff is great.  I love helping all customers even the difficult ones.
good,"During the holiday season, I always stayed busy and managed my time well to provide assistance to shoppers and cash people through my line with a smile."
good,I liked working because I would do different things all the time. And was able to use my Bilingual services when needed. Great team workers. And always meeting new customers.
good,very busy backroom with very little staff. the expectation of the management was not conducive of a teamwork plan. The hardest part of the job was being short staffed. The best part of the job was the staff that was present working above and beyond.
good,"a typical day at big lots was always a busy day. My most enjoyable part of my job was my customers that came in day by day. My co workers were, well i can say good and bad about them."
good,"count my draw , cashier, take care of the customers , returns too , putting stuff back where it goes , give employee breaks , "
good,I enjoyed myself working at the Monroe Big Lots. It was a awesome first job for me before going into the service. Just a lot of hard labor for little pay
good,I learned a lot about and how to stock items in the back room and in the store. Also learned what and how to face front items on the shelves. The hardest part of the job was lifting furniture by myself
good,Great experience here at big lot for my first job. Great team members. Very easy and cool job. Everyone was so nice and friendly with great customer service skills.
good,it was a great experience and i have learned a lot working for big lots.The environment and the employees are great as well as the managers. what i enjoyed the most was stocking.
good,"As a normal cashier employee it's fun, when you get to management it's a bit stressful and overwhelming but if you know how to do your job your good. You can always have fun working here."
good,I was tranfer to the location i have now. The team is nice. All managers are always  willing to help me better myself and they never had much problems with me as i try my best everyday.
good,A typical day at work includes checking people out through the register. Placing items back upon shelves when a customer returns or changes mind about item.
good,"It's a great job. I like it very well. i am working in Stock crew. Only part time,That is the only disadvantage. i need more hours. The company is not aloud to hire fulltime employee's. Just need more money. Looking for a better paying job. To get by more and be able to take care of my family better."
good,I loved big lots we were all family. Very good place to work if u dont want more then 18 hrs a week. Thay just dont give you everything that you need to do ur job correctly.
good,I loved working there but no one gets hours there. Instead they hire 20 new people instead of giving the current employees more hours to work. They also don't allow full time which is ridiculous!!!
good,"Good work environment hardworking people, excellent customer service. strong management positions, great hours, and very good benefits. i enjoyed working here."
good,"I enjoyed working at big lots because I was able to do multiple roles. One day I was on the register, another day it was stocking inventory and then I was able to promote to the safe room."
good,"Every thing was good, I like their action in helping when first starting it was a very very easy job for me. Thanks for the chance because I really enjoy new work."
good,"Yes I was very young when I first worked for big lots in Akron Ohio ! And I loved it "" also in North Carolina and I would recommend it to anyone , I'm in search for stocking crew like at Walmart or any openings willing to give me a chance ? Thank you. Mrs Justice"
good,When signing customers up for the rewards cards big lots should  make it  easy for customers especially for old people who doesn't  have email address.
good,I enjoyed helping customers and seeing all the new merchandise we would get in the truck. Some of the work was tedious but the managers always kept you busy and up to date on things going on in the store.
good,"A typical day at work consists of working hard and assisting customers."
good,I Was A Cashier Helping The Customers That Came In. I Checked Them Out When they Were Ready and Helped Them Around The Store. The Customers Always Had A smile On Their Face.
good,"Typical at work can start off rough, but turn into a adventure  "
good,It is a good company to work for. Training is hands on learning. The company is great with teamwork. I enjoyed learning new task and working with people.
good,BigLots taught me a lot it's a good company the people are nice the corporate team is nice and they really look out for their employees BigLots giving room to grow and be better any train you good.
good,Positive atmosphere. Great management team. Great career building skills. Employee discounts help our associates. Good customer service. Great prices on furniture and competitive prices.
good,"I love my job there I just need to make more money to make ends meet "
good,I actually wanted to work for Big lots from the beginning and the staff and my boss are amazing. She is great. I would feel lost if I had to leave the place and not be here. One thing I like about working here is the hours. If only got a few hours here and there than it would be different. Great staff.
good,I loved all my co-workers and the company offers advancement opportunities. You're offered limited benefits as a part-time employee. They're very understanding and flexible with your schedule. You'll do a wide variety of tasks which breaks up the mundane boredom of doing the same job on a daily basis. You have a online portal where you can select what days and hours of the day you're available. You can also request your vacation time off on their as well as check the hours you've worked that week.
good,i just wished they paid a little bit more. But the work isn't just making sure you get your rewards card and credit cards was the biggest and hardest things  sometimes
good,Big Lots was a great Company for me to work for! I must say the best so far! I really enjoyed my job. The environment was gra to work in. The pay raises i received annually and for advancement was wonderful. The benefits were great.
good,they have great management and great associates i wish i could return but i was dumb and took a better paying job that fired me for putting my daughter first they never did that though
good,This was where i stared off and got my experience form as well too. i got to learn a lot and as well hoe to deal with all sorts of people. I had great managers at the time that i was working there. They all thought great things that i still till this day i place into practice.
good,"Fast paced working environment with stocking boxes fast, helping customers when needed, greeting people while they come into the store. Know the store policies, rules, and get along with everyone."
good,If your looking for a side job to make a little extra money while attending school or something this job is perfect. not many hours to give which is perfect to stay focused unless you need the pay this isn't for you
good,"daily tasks were the same everyday."
good,working at big lots was very interesting it was very slow paced and quiet it was fun considering which manager you worked with everyone had their own styles of managing
good,"Easy job, unless you have a condescending manager who barely helped and constantly hid in her office like I did. Aside from that I loved it, the work was straight forward and the pay was nice."
good,I loved the job I did and really liked the people I worked with didn't want to leave but didn't have a choice. Would really like to get back into similar work.
good,"Started off fine plenty of hours, opened new store. Then hours kept dwindling. A lot of times, not enough people in the store to support it. Kept getting menial jobs, Cleaning bathroom, meeting rooms, but nothing productive."
good,"Overall, i loved Biglots! They were very flexible hen i was ill. They were always friendly. The job was just at the right pace and i enjoyed working with the customers!"
good,An amazing place to work! The environment is positive. jobs was a little heavy and pay wasn't great but a great company to work with! Very Good Benefits.
good,"Some days were fast paced, while others were slow. Enjoyed working with my coworkers and the customers. Hardest part of the job is providing customers with the right service or help they are looking for."
good,Little pay but good experience  they have good managers too. Its not very easy to lose the job its a nice work environment with mandated breaks and lunches only downfall is its part time with no benefits unless you are one of 3 managers in the store
good,Big lots is a great place to work. the bosses are great and listen to concerns or issues. My daughter came into this world 5 weeks early and they helped me get all of my paper work together. i honestly have nothing bad to say about this place.
good,"Great company! "
good,A typical warehouse working environment. Not for everyone. Very physically demanding at times. Fast paced job with great benefits. Hours are there if you want them.
good,All staff helped each other out especially when busy. Must bag items at the register and also clean up and stock items when you are free. They give discounts but there are brief 15 min breaks only.
good,"safe place, clean and quiet. fairness, friendliness.. professional..inviting..warm. I really enjoy working for BigLots My other job can be pretty stressful. to come here its a relief.."
good,Worked here during the holidays they worked with your schedule. If you worked at nights sometimes you would leave earlier than expected because everything was complete.
good,"Great place for you to grab groceries and household products at the same time. The prices are cheap and the environment is friendly and loving. The customers that I enter acted with every day, made my coming to work more joyful."

good,"The management and employees at Big Lots took good care of me. They took the time to teach me what they were looking for in an employee. As a stocker, they trained me well: they showed me how they wanted certain items to be stacked, where certain items were supposed to go, etc. Everyone was courteous, polite, professional, and patient with me, and I deeply respect them for being this way. There was always work to be done. Therefore, we were (and still are) definitely a productive workplace. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Big Lots."
good,Supervisors are caring and helpful. Co-workers work to get the job done. I stock. I work usually early morning til late morning or late morning til early afternoon. I work part time.
good,"Great place to work. Wonderful friendly staff, and guests. "
good,i would recommend this place to work because i really enjoyed working here. it was one of my first jobs and i enjoyed it very much. if i had not moved i would have moved up to management.
good,Big lots is a nice company to work for. They give you good benefits and it's a very friendly environment. Supervisor are good team leaders and show good example
good,"this place needs a lot of work starting for their managers, at the begging was a fun place to work, however when time passes you can tell everyone does what they want and the managers don't really do anything and leave everything to their employees."
good,"worked there for 6 months, enjoyed the people and staff. Learned everything about the store, cashiering, stocking, loading and unloading, Enjoyed meeting all types of people."
good,Been with this company for 21years love the surrounding of great associates and customers. I am here for a purpose everyone loves me and I love what I do.

good,"I absolutely loved every aspect of working with Big Lots from the work itself allowing me to constantly stay busy and on my toes, as well as my coworkers who made each and every shift enjoyable. They were very flexible when working with my class schedule."

good,"I love the people I work with. They are very helpful in guiding you through the work day. Everyone works together, so its nothing to hard about the work day. Its a good feeling environment, and I never dread going in to work."
good,"positive enforced environment, fast paced hard working employees,"
good,"If you like to keep busy this is the place to be especially on the weekends! This is a fun job, but it does require a lot of heavy lifting."
good,"Working for Big Lots was an enjoyable experience. My coworkers were great people, and the customers always had something pleasant to say about the store or the associates. The downside to this was the ever changing management and lack of working hours for their part time workers."
good,"Over the course of my time at Big Lots, I was able to encounter numerous situations which tested my learning ability to better my experience within the retail and customer service industry. Taking away valuable lessons from my employment at Big Lots, I feel even more confident when I step into a sales environment."
good,"Big Lots is a fun place to work, it can become caos when you have a bad Store Director that seems not to care. The rest of the managers have a great attitude, friendly, and truly care about each employee both on the job and not."
good,"The company worked around my school schedule while I was gaining an education and diploma. They knew school was important and made sure I knew that, and they made a work schedule that fit my schedule."

good,"I was hired to organize an overstuffed back room and keep it neat enough for other associates to find and sell the merchandise. I loved working at Big Lots, until my wife died. Then the need to have a job faded. A few months before her passing the store got a new manager, while my wife was in the hospital I requested time off, and was denied. That action quickly eroded any loyalty I had to the company. After I left, I found out that the manager was let go for ineptitude. I would gladly go back to work for Big Lots."
good,"There training program was as bad as all major stores, to much video, not enough hands on, and put on the floor too soon. My particular management team was good."

good,"I worked at store 455. The store manager and her assistant are AMAZING, but I cant say the same for the rest of them. Company policy seems to get in the way of productive and happy work though. I don't think the people in corporate have ever worked a retail job in their life. Otherwise a fun job."

good,enjoyed doing something different everyday with the same people
good,"I enjoyed my time at Big Lots andhad fun building a depatment from the ground up, though with a management change it all became a much different place to work.

good,Good work life balance all shifts are usually 4 hours rare when you have an 8 hour shift. Good job to want if you just want some extra cash. People who work at Manteca big lots are supper friendly and welcoming. Need to have a lot of patience for customers who feel entitled.
good,"From my experience in working at another retail job, Show Dept, I'd say Big Lots is a big step forward in every way imaginable.  Management is fairly competent and actually shows an interest in maintaining the store and with helping increase sales.  The schedule there is flexible enough that they can help you find suitable work hours even if you have school to attend or are a parent.  They also have shown an interest in what your best at and because of that I was able to determine that I'm decently skilled when it comes to selling high cost product or just plain furniture in general."
good,I would get my share of stock plus others done before it was time to go home. I worked as a sticker/cashier for 2.5 yrs then I got promoted to dts lead. Which was in charge of trucks and stocking. After 6-9 months I was promoted to assistant manager of merchandiser.  I had to switch positions of asstistant manager of service at the beginning of this yr.
good,"I was very excited about this job and loved everyday on the job, unloaded trucks, stocked pallets and then broke down boxes priced merchandise and then brought to floor and was over the advertisements in the sales paper and where to stock!"
good,Its a good job to work . Even with No experience in retail or sales they will work with. But for the work you do it would be nice to get more pay and more hours weekly for those why familes.
good,I enjoyed working at Big Lots and would have never left if I had not have had to move away for personal reasons. got along well with mgmt and coworker
good,They always have what I need and there good to work for but they dont pay enough not offer benefits unless your full time. I need 3 jobs to live because Big Lots doesnt offer enough. Other then that it's a great company.
good,"Every job has its ups and down. Been with the company for 19 years and have seen many ups as well as some downs. Unfortunately it seems hours never go up and stay up for the part timers. It’s hard to make it when you don’t know if you will have hours next week or not, plus there is no room to move up with the company at least not for me. But I do enjoy working there and have met a lot of interesting people. Met the love of my life there too so I am very happy."
good,Great place to work. The management is really good . The pay just wasn’t enough for my needs at the time. I needed my i was a college student who live off campus
good,"I enjoyed working at Big Lots, liked the other employee's. Had a problems with store manager.  She was hard to work for, lots of complaint from other employee's about her work ethics. She was fired 3 weeks after I quit.  Otherwise I would return to this work place. I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with."
good,Management will not give you more than 28 hours a week. Will work you to the bone and make you do more than they originally tell you.  Coworkers are friendly
good,its a good workplace i enjoyed working there. the people there where great to work with. a typical day would be stocking and straighting up around the registers. and hanging more merchandise in the empty pegs.

good,"Big Lots is an amazing place to work it is not a permanent job amazing co-workers love the management, other than don't get enough hours I don't have a complaint"
good,"same position as a wal-mart cashier, but with the business being a lot less hectic. Workplace is relaxed, never chaotic, and all of the positions available are extremely easy to do for entry level."
good,Great place to work just need better communication between the managers. Need to offer more training for the managers. If you do your job quickly and effectively you get more hours just don't offer any overtime
good,Pretty fun place to be and management is fair. It can be a really fun place but boring at times. The pay is not so good unless you're a manager. It's just a starter place before something better comes along.
good,a typical day at work was productive. I learned a lot about customer service. management was wonderful. workplace was clean and quiet for most part. hardest part of the job was being there early. most enjoyable was my coworkers.
good,"This store was a fun place to work..the manager was polite and good at his job, and I learned more about retail than I previously knew. The hardest part of the job for me was the physical lifting of heavy boxes when working the floor. The fun part of the job was the constant influx/turning of new products. It's also a fun store since the prices are reasonable and they have periodic special sales days during the year! I would have liked more hours, but they did work with my schedule, which I appreciated."
good,I'm not a fan of retail but this job wasn't half bad. I learned a fair amount and even got some salesman experience. While I don't feel retail is for me I would consider working for the company again.

good,A good place to work. Works with your schedule. A busy store with committed customers. I enjoyed working at big lots and still love shopping at big lots.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job when i worked there is my customers leaving happy and always returning because of the great customer service and our great team work we all worked together. I miss a few of my co workers.
good,"I only worked there for about two months. My store manager was wonderful, and most of the shift managers were great too. My co-workers were helpful, some of them had been there for a long time.  I left because I felt that I wanted more out of life than to be a cashier forever."
good,"The position I was in was very interesting we worked with clients in HONG KONG and China and you really had to have the ear to understand any of the clients, We did pre ticketing for there merchandise for there items coming to the states."
good,A typical day here is busy and productive. I learned that I enjoy stocking but that I love interacting with customers more. The management here is hard on you and keeps you on your feet in order to get what you need to get done. The workplace culture is great. The hardest part of the job is stocking in the mornings nonstop until the back room is half empty. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you surround yourself with coworkers you enjoy talking to and it makes the work day go by faster.
good,"No benefites as an associate, except the 20% discount."
good,I would walk my floor with my team to see what needed to be worked on and then we would push out the stock to make the floor full and then wait on customers.

good,"There was not any room for advancement with this job.  The hardest part of the job was getting the items from the truck to the shelves in a very limited amount of time.  I enjoyed my co-workers we worked as a team to get the required job done.  Management mainly stuck with themselves unless giving orders for the jobs at hand.  A typical day at work would include running the register, stocking shelves and working with the public."

good,big lots was a learning job i learned a lot how to help customers with any questions about the store and the merchandise we carried
good,"I've only just started working, but so far everyone has been very nice and if I have any questions about anything I'm able to ask anyone."
good,"The start of my shift begins with a team meeting. We review past performance and how we can improve. Then proceed to the loading bay to assign people for jobs that would best suit the teams goal. After that we start to unload the truck, separate merchandise,and replenish the store. I enjoyed the chemistry the team shared. I enjoyed the attitude my co-workers shared toward work which made for a very successful work environment. The time limit that we were given made the task highly difficult how ever with the teams high sprits we always got job done."
good,This is a store where customers can spend hours shopping and find things that you wont typically find in other department stores.
good,I like that we work as a team and help each other and have fun doing our job got alone with everyone.

good,"I loved working at Big Lots, though it were only seasonal employment. I would take inventory and stock the shelves mostly. Make sure all the isles were clear of items on the floor and make sure that each shelf was full stocked and neatly. I would be the first one chosen to do a store check which required me making sure everyone has done their share of the job. I answered questions for customers as to where they may be able to locate an item. The part I liked best about that job is the stocking the shelves and having a big work space as opposed to being in a tight work area. Loved putting prices on items too."
good,Big lots is a good company to work with.  I was working there and enjoyed working with the community while employed there. I loved every bit of it.
good,"providing good customer service, and working hard as a team."
good,Typical day at work would be:
good,"i would describe a typical day at work very active with lots of heavy lifting.i learned grat customer service skills,hard work,and persistance.management was very poor.My co workers were very good hard workers.the hardest part of my job was truck unloading and lots of heavy lifting.the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,Not much to say here. Only worked during the Christmas season one year. Management and co-workers were great to work with.
good,"I learned to use register and count tills, I learned to unload trucks and stock shelves. I learned to clean up and be nice to people and work as a team member. I enjoyed working there and management helped out a lot. I liked the diversity in employees. But I couldn't get full time or benefits."

Have learned how to merchandise new items coming into the store weekly. Able to check for merchandise for availability for customers. Able to direct customers to find items in which they wish to find. Overall I enjoy working there. Looking for a change.
good,"Very family oriented, nice and fair managers. I get along with everybody and if i didn't i will still remain courteous to others. Very family oriented, nice and fair managers."
good,"Loved working at Big Lots but 15/20 hours a week was not enough, the rules about rewards wasn't laid out. They wanted you to do more than your job which wasn't a big problem but the pay was okay. The co-workers were nice and respectful. Love to interact with customers and love the good deals.c"
good,"The company policy is good but depending on the store management your working with, it could be stressful. The employees are prideful of their job and joyfully to work with."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting into the store, clocking in, and depending what i am scheduled i would either be on the floor or the register. If i was on the floor i would be focused on recovering, helping customers out with questions, finding things they need, and reaching higher objects. If i was on the register i would be focused on ringing people out and giving them the  best experience before they leave the store. Being at the front i would occasionally help out people with furniture questions."
good,"I was a DTS stocker for nearly three years at my local big lots. We had fun, it was a relaxed environment, we got our work done, and all around it was fantastic."
good,"Good place to work at but the management isn’t the best. I love going to work most days mainly because of my coworkers! The main problem is, not enough hours given out no matter how good of a worker you are."
good,Ejoyed working for Big Lots. Management and co-workers were very helpful in training. Unloaded stock truck. Ran cash register Cleaned my work space. Helped customers.
good,Relaxed/competitive environment. Management and associates have great one on one relationships . Work load is light for most . Over 20 hrs a week for most .
good,"A typical day at work would consist of indulging in conversation with the customers, also making sure they find everything to their comfort I learned that everybody has different out look on employees so making sure your consist is key. Management was very entertaining and also very efficient in handling situations. The hardest park of work was wanting to leave after the shift was over. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming in and enjoying the atmosphere."

good,"Cashier, customer service, data entry, Microsoft Office, printing, copying, scanning, fax, phones, manage money,  filing "
good,I made several new friends there and enjoyed working there when I first started. The reason I was seeking other options was because of the change in management. The first store manager was great and very laid back. The current store manager is not dependable and isn't willing to work with me on schedule issues.
good,"Hard working associate atmosphere. Friendly management, employee discount. Lots of unloading freight trucks and lifting, along with stocking of merchandise. Must be able to operate a cash register."
good,A busy day and fun at the same time.  I learned to balance the credit card machine and do refunds.  Management was spectacular.  The hardest part was dealing with stressed customers.
good,I provided customer service and performed markdowns and returns while cashiering .Management was great and easy to communicate with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy or rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting friendly customers and I enjoyed the holidays.
good,"This was a job that could be easily balanced, was not as stressful as most other retail stores. I had some times during and when it was closer to Holiday's where it got busier than usual, but more often than not it was very easy to get help when needed to to direct anyone in the place they needed to be."
good,"I loved working at the Auburn Big Lot Store. However, I had to leave to accept more shifts at my full-time position. Awesome Store Team Leaders. Good working hours."

I even learned new things such as stocking, pricing, unloading truck, moving products around to promote sales! You really had to show team work when working to keep customers happy and satisfied. The hardest part about this job was the pay. It is hard to keep up this your finances with little pay. Overall I enjoyed my experience!"
good,Managers are easy to work with and the staff members are very easy to get along with. A typical work day has mixed in levels of difficult customers...
good,I liked working here alot the people we're great the pay and hours we're good I just didn't have relaible transportation wich I do now I always got hours when I needed them and always got time off if I needed it

good,"I enjoyed working here for almost three years had a wonderful team to work with and the 20 percent discount was amazing. "
good,"The little time I did spend here I enjoyed the recovery and the environment. I just needed more hours and they were not able to give me that. I enjoyed the less face to face with customers, because I was mainly on the floor recovering put backs and fixing areas."
good,"I received the proper training for all positions and the managers in general were very helpful.   I started out in recovery and within 2 months was training for customer service. I learned just about all aspects of opening and closing the store."
good,This job taught me how to endure long hours and challenging tasks. A lot of people were constantly quitting because of the stress but I overcame and I grew up in the process. When I transition to another job I will carry the work ethic I learned from Big lots.
good,"I liked Big Lots its a great place to work. I enjoy meeting people and helping customers find what they need, I liked keeping the store neat."
good,Loved my job here. Sadly full time positions are no longer an option with this company so i had to say my good byes. Great part time job. The customers could be rude but your coworkers make up for it.
good,"Exciting"
good,I really liked this job because it was such a friendly comfortable job environment. if i had to pick out of all the jobs I've had and pick the best one it would be this one. the people were nice. i caught on to the job fast and it wasn't hard to learn the way their process is set up.
good,"Strong company with great benefits for management, super approach to customer service and retaining customers. Advancement opportunities for hard workers."

good,Management give you the opportunity to use you skills aquired in the retail field to make a department look as good as it can. Also a great team of co-workers and management.
good,After clocking into work you would report to the manager to see if you will be working on the floor or at the cash register. each position requires you to greet the customers and maintain a satisfying shopping area for the customer. Co-workers are great and enjoy working with fashion merchandise. The most exciting thing was knowing the new fashion coming to the store before it appears on the store floor to sale.
good,Start the day off getting paper work then going to dept makeing sore everything is in order then start the day.I learned alot about furniture and how to sell it.The management was very nice.The co-workers were very productive as well as i.The hardest part was lifting the furniture.The mostenjoyable part was helping customers.

good,If no boss or manager was around the staff worked together to find solutions to get the job done! The flexibility was good considering I have a kid and go to school.
good,"Amazing coworkers/managers, great work experience, only downside is the hours are kinda unstable."
good,"Love the job and management but the only down fall is you dont get enough hours in a week , great discounts and great company to work for id go back if it was a permanent full time job !"
good,"Really great management.  Positive,  for the most part, environment.  Only employs part time. Fun to work there, though must be diligent. Advancements encouraged."
good,Great place to work for part time hours. Although some times hours can be very low. Not really good for someone who has lots of financial responsibilities
good,"Good managers, great company to learn and grow! Great company with a solid future, new remodeled stores in some areas all going over time. Not much room to grow due to restructure of district team leaders."
good,"As long as you have good managers it's a good place to work. I loved the work and my co-works. Management was terrible at the Asheville, NC store. They treated my very poorly."
good,"It wasn't a bad summer job before going back to college. The managers were nice and worked well with my schedules and my other job. Morning people clean the bathrooms, take out the trash, and pull expired foot all under an hour. At least that's what I did."
good,"Big lots in general is a good company to work for.  Our store had issues we needed more detail oriented people. Managment had an number in mind as far as our programs went, but they never took the time to address the issues when we didnt hit our numbers.   It was just do it or else."

There are some good days and there are some bad days but you can get through them as long as you keep a constant workflow and you create relationships. Whether it be with customers or your coworkers. Everyone likes to talk a little and sometimes talking to someone can make your day a lot better."
good,I would call a typical day at big lots fun and productive especially when I had amazing co-workers to help make the day go by better and fun with laughter.
good,I loved big lots because it was one of the only ones that ever gave me the opportunity to cashier and prove I was more then just a janitor and muscle. I loved my managers and my coworkers. Unfortunately my Grandfather passed away at the time and I was put in a difficult situation. If I could have I would have kept the job but I had to our family first but I will always be grateful to big lots.
good,"As a sticker, I was responsible for merchandise placed on the shelves correctly. The environment is fast paced and retail organized. Management was not as organized as need be but were helpful in many ways. Scheduling was difficult at times, and supervising a crew was a learning experience."
good,"For the time I was there I really enjoyed myself. The job isn't hard at all but at times it can be demanding, so you must know how to keep up, always ask questions"
good,Always have something for you to do so time goes by fast. Very flexible with the scheduling as well as understanding. Most supervisors were easy going and nice.

good,"I’ve currently been with big lots for 25 years... I have grown tremendously with the company.  This company offers amazing benefits.  I started as a recovery associate but quickly moved up.  The management team is amazing, and very easy to get along with.  I don’t generally have too many hard days, the days are easy as long as you do your job and keep everything on track."
good,"Time went buy quickly on days when it was busy. If you like staying busy with fast paced work, it wouldn't be a stressful place to work. Most managers are understanding and helpful. few are not."
good,"Fast paced place to work, lots of fun interacting with customers and employees. Love that the customer comes first. I loved the managers they made the atmosphere fun."

good,Great company to work for. A lot of opportunities for advancement but the goals that are set are impossible. They want more work done faster with less people than is realistically possible.
good,All employees were very helpful and friendly. Weekly paid period. Would recommend to others if looking for a minimum wage job. Would work there again if I had the time.
good,This job was not that bad. I was able to continue perfecting my communication skills. It teaches you to have organizational skills and to become a pretty detail-oriented individual.
good,"Co-workers are all very friendly and willing to help, hours are flexible, managers are very helpful and it is sometimes very fast paced and sometimes pretty slow"

Early morning shifts usually consistent of stocking merchandise, you have to be fast, 45 cases per hour are expected by each person. Usually schedule 4 to 6 hours per day. Other scheduled time are running the register, greeting customer on the way in and out. Cleaning areas and stocking up. Some times your a furniture associate. Answering questions and selling furniture to customer. Overall you need very good customer service. Floor associates clean and recover floor, while helping and assisting customers"
good,Big lots is a nice retail store to work at with good management.  From past experience it is usually a balanced work place. The district manager is what you usually have to look out for.
good,"I love being there! I love coming to work everyday. I enjoy the people there. No one looks to stir you up as far as the team goes. Friendly and fun to be around crew. Hours are there if you want them. Managed very well. Responsibilities are not overwhelming or tedious. I love to work in the backroom, that's kind of my domain. I love to organize and straighten it up. Truck unloads are early in the morning most weeks, however, with a good crew like the one we have it is not hard to get lost in what you're doing and time seems to fly. Hardest part of the job? There really is not one. I do just about everything there and find it all to be easy work. It's just the attitude you have that can make something as simple as unloading a truck or stocking shelves an easy task or a nightmare."
good,"Really great management.  Positive,  for the most part, environment.  Only employs part time. Fun to work there, though must be diligent. Advancements encouraged."

good,"Everyone was always nice and we always helped each other get things done. Management is always  helpful. They work with a flexable schedule, so they will always work around your schedule"
good,I usually place things back in order and ring up costumers. I've learned how to give better customer service than before and how to work better as a team. The management there is great. They are very pleasant and know how to get work done and their message across without coming off as rude.
good,They are a very flexible place to work. i enjoy the co workers and customers. very easy to learn and to move up if you show initiative.  Or if you want a few hours a week because you have a busy life then this is the place.

good,"My day begins with a smile and greet the customer and see if they have found everything they needed to get in the store. That I'm there to help the customer and that they are satisfied with the products and the service they receive. I get along with management and my co-workers. The hardest part is bringing in carts from the cold, but enjoy the environment."
good,Big lots is a great place to work I learned a lot of things there management was extremely great my big lots closedown Sandy Spring store in Georgia...
good,"A regular day at work consisted of cashiering, stocking, and recovering merchandise. I learned to be very clear on every rule. Most of the managers were amazing there were only a few that weren't nice. The coworkers were amazing and they were all extremely nice. The hardest part of the job was stocking. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers."

good,Everyone gets along. The store is always kept neat and the customers love coming back. I enjoyed being able to do almost every job in the store. Sometimes I cashiered other times I made sure all the shelves were cleaned and straightened. Being able to do more than one job in the store was refreshing. I was stuck behind the counter for a few hours. The only downside to working here was the benefits and hours. We didn't get any healthcare benefits and the hours fluctuated weekly.

good,"The relations between coworkers, customers, and the whole team were a big part of my life. Some of the people are some of my best friends even now."

good,"Enjoyed working there and understood tha the pay was minimal because it's retail. Liked part-time and the physical labor of lifting, stocking, and carrying merchandise from the truck and for customers. Loved helping customers on the floor. Good merchandise and prices are competitive. Performance is based on retail sales, credit card signups, leasing, and rewards cards. Great management at my store!"

good,"Awesome experience, awesome people. Love the atmosphere. Great communication. Workers like family. Manager was an awesome guy and a friend. Could have used more consistent hours"
good,"Big lots was a laid back place to work. It was sales goal oriented. Was largely based on customer service. When I worked there, even as management, they didnt offer many benefits. But that was a long time ago. Eventually my (only furniture) store was phased out because they were building a closeout store near by that had the food as well as furniture. I closed the doors at my old store for the last time. I was offered a transfer to the new store but when I went to see the store manager at the new location, he informed me that my pay would have to start over. He also made me feel as though I was going to be an inconvenience since I had a small child. So I declined the offer for furniture manager."
good,Big Lots was already a discount store so when they offered an employee discount it made the store sweeter than it already was.  When you were cashier and you werent permanently placed at the register it was a great work place.
good,"I still for the most part enjoy my time at big lots although i feel like the horse from animal farm. Being in my position (DTS lead) i would have to receive the trucks unload them and get the items to the floor. For some reason DTS hours are always low and it stresses my team and me personally. MY DTL was aware of that and told us at a meeting look if you need 2 hours to get it done just call me. I never had too many problematic customers at big lots you will have a few but they are pretty reasonable if you are as well. we all make mistakes, many of my coworkers i had great times with and would say that big lots has been the best job i have had thus far. The pay might not be as much as i would like but the environment is great"

good,"A typical day at work consisted of working on the cash register but I also learned how to put up signs and celebrate the changes of seasons within the store.

good,"I unload the trucks and was in charge of the stocking crew."
good,"I enjoy working both days and nights at Big Lots. The day shift requires more effort pertaining to lifting and moving. You use more of your body on the day shift, unpacking boxes of product and stocking the shelves. The night shift is a little more laid back, it consists of putting misplaced items where they belong, and making sure the product looks good on the shelves from the chaos of the day shift, also known as ""recovery.""  You must have a sense of organization when it comes to this job, which comes easy for me, but unfortunately not for all. That is what I would say the hardest part of this job is, fixing mistakes and having to re-stock a shelf that wasn't stocked properly in the beginning. The management in My Big Lots are all amazing, they are up there with best managers I've had. They listen to you, and work with you and treat you like you're part of the team instead of just some person that works there."

We are the leading Closeout Distributor in the world, marketing brands in categories, like Toys, Books, Electronics, Hardware, Automotive, Tabletop and Domestics.  At any one time, we have between 7,000 and 8,000 different items available to sell.  The most enjoyable part of the job, is researching and then matching a particular item to a particular customer and convincing them to buy, based on  captured market research, my developed presentation and their sales history, harbored by the selling conversation where I probe for opportunities.  Big Lots Management has decided they no longer want to be in the Wholesale sector and will be closing their doors in December of 2013.  I am responsible for the second largest volume territory (of nine) for the division, with focused on both large and small retailers, charities, internet businesses and distributors worldwide.   I sell my products at 13 fast-paced shows a year, at account headquarter calls, through email and on the phone.

The management has their act together for the most part (with a few exceptions). The coworkers are all relatively friendly and easy to work with in teams. The hardest part of the job is trying to detect possible theft in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is forming bonds with customers who come back, in most cases, just to see you as they become a part of your life."

Vague policies."
good,"If it weren't for the awesome people I work with, I don't think I would still be there. It's been a year. The review from management went well, the teeny tiny raise was just that. Management is pretty awesome. They work hard too. I like it."

Having gone from three years of mental abuse and pure stress from Walmart to a warm, welcoming environment that is Big Lots. I love my management. I love my coworkers. There is always help when you need it. Customers are much more patient with you. The only negative that I have is that part time hours are only at 30 hours maximum.

good,"Overall Big Lots has changed since I originally started in 2002.However the company is wonderful and does take an interest in it's associates from the store level management to the top.Like most retail, physical work is par for the course and being in moderately good shape is a plus.Overall a great company to work for!"

I learned how to work as part of a team, that it is okay to ask for assistance when needed at the workplace, and how to operate a pallet jack. The management at Big Lots is a well structured team. The management truly cares about their employees and is willing to accommodate to their needs. The workplace culture is relaxed. The hardest part of the job was setting up for major holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help customers find what they are looking for, recommending products, helping customers find the right furniture for their style, and helping the company expand."

good,"I love my job! I love my fellow employees! Management is great! Would love an opportunity to move up the ladder. However my managers arent going anywhere. I dont blame them. The only way to get full time hours is to be a manager. My manager does everything he can to get his employees as many hours as the company will allow. He works with ours schedules. He patient, kind, and understanding! It is so hard to a place of employment that has that kind of leadership! Over all couldnt ask for a better work family! Would appreciate if corporate would consider making more full time positions available so the struggle to live isnt so much a struggle."

good,It's a wonderful place depending on which location you join. Not all of them are the same. I wish I could've stayed at this store longer. Good managers and easy work.
good,Never stressed even with the early hours new it would speed by due to the kick back attitude. Everyone always did there jobs and minded business. Communicated with one another positively and was never to bus or much. I really enjoyed working here would even consider just going back to make extra cash.

good,"Work was fun if you like to lead and make a difference.  Customer service is a must.  You have to like to Merchandise and get dirty sometimes.

good,I enjoyed working for Big Lots. The store had good management and overall awesome co-workers. Very friendly staff. I learned customer service skills there through working the register dealing with customers daily.
good,"Best, least stressful retail workplace I've ever worked. Never had trouble with drama. Of course being retail and how corporations have learned to squeeze more work from less employees makes everything a bit more challenging, yet still not as much so as other retail."
good,Over all my experience with working for Big Lots has been a good one. I have been with the company for 10 years and it has allowed me to provide for my two children. I feel like I have learned a tremendous amount from my years with company that may help me further my career as well as helped me grow as an individual. As a manager unfortunately they do require you to have open availability and there is no set scheduling which can put a strain on your home/family life. For this reason I have chosen to leave and look for something that can provide more balance between work and family .

good,I have worked for big lots only for a few months but i have observed that the Management is great and big lots is a good company. However hours and pay could be better.
good,"It started off great,  until everyone started slacking on there job.  I was in one spot every time I came to work,  workers were really lazy. Managers will make you do the same thing over and over, then get mad once they see you standing in one spot. Other than that I loved it, even though it was just pocket change."
good,"I love this job, and my coworkers! The work day is typical, make sure the store is neat and have good customer skills. I would not leave if they offered FT.

What I learned while working for Big Lots is how to work with a team. My Co-Workers were amazing. They helped me on my first day, they answered any questions I may had. They were really great. The most hardest part about the job was unloading the truck. The truck as I said was 2,000+ Items and it was very difficult. What was also diffcult was the overnight. I had not been use to overnights so I had to adjust. the Most enjoyable moment was working with my amazing co-workers, like I said they helped me each step of the way.

The managers are all great. Work responsibilities are divided among the team to everyone's liking. There are many learning experiences provided pretty much daily. I learned about merchandising and re-merchandising. I also learned how to read and utilize a planogram. I learned more effective ways of communicating with the public. The hardest part of the job was merchandising without a planogram. It really wasn't that hard, but I am very meticulous, aka O.C.D. so, for example, every St. Patrick's Day sign and decoration had to hang/fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The most enjoyable part of the job was also merchandising without a planogram. It was a challenge that I was definitely up for and the store manager, was so happy with my work that I was actually very proud of myself."

good,Big lots is a great place to work and has great growth potential. The salary is fair and in line with other companies. The work environment is good because of the direct communication from general office.

Management was pretty good all around when it came to helping there employees. There weren't any hard parts about the job to be honest.  The most enjoyable part about the job was that the location was in the perfect area. When you needed to go to lunch you had plenty of food options.

good,Big lots is a great company to work for.everyone was nice and if u needed help they answered it if not they found it out.we got 20% when we shoped. Store was always clean
good,"My typical day at work started off with me clocking in and getting items stocked on the shelves or cleaning up aisles. Management was great, there were a few bumps and hiccups here and there but nothing I couldn't handle. The hardest part of the job had to be organizing some of the aisles, some of them were utter chaos like the usual toy aisle. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually getting paid for your hard work, no one gave you sympathy and the job helped me get more in touch with my hardworking personality."

good,"A typical day usually is easy going and more relaxed. I learned how to better sell product to a customer as well as how to better keep things looking presentable. Management is fantastic, they're all so friendly and helpful and willing to answer any questions I have. The hardest part is having to move furniture because you don't always have someone to help you, and I barely weigh 135 pounds and it's difficult moving certain furniture items alone. The most enjoyable part though is just how relaxed management tries to keep the workplace while still making sure you're being productive, it's a nice balance and they certainly take into consideration certain things when they schedule you, like who you work well with versus who you might not work well with."
good,"All pt associates with no clear path to be full time get prompted.only 4 to 18 hours a week for pt that are struggling to paybills.the next week schedule is put up till the last day before the new one starts. Never can plan your life for the next week."
good,"Days were not typical. Every day brought new adventures, joys, and sometime frustrations. A lot of work went into each day to make the merchandise appealing but like your kids' rooms, they always needed straightened the next day. I learned a lot about checking dates on merchandise and keeping the earliest to expire in the front instead of putting the new arrivals on the shelf and pushing what is already there to the back, and keeping SKUs together making inventory easier. Unfortunately, we also needed to be aware of shoppers who might not be acting quite right. Approaching a customer and asking if you could help them could possibly prevent shoplifting. The most enjoyable part of my time at Big Lots was interacting with the customers and trying to help them locate what they need. When you make eye contact with the customers and make conversation while checking them out makes their shopping experience nicer...and my day nicer too."
good,"Big Lots is a closeout warehouse. The people there are friendly, and management is good to you if you're nice to them. Their performance incentive was really good if you worked hard,"

What I learned at this job was how to manage and the culture was neutral. The hardest part of the job was getting the other mangers to help or come in to take in truck. I enjoyed this job because I learned a lot in the management position."
good,We all worked together to get our jobs done correctly and on time!  I loved my position and furniture sales supervisor. I enjoyed the both pros and con's. The cons made me better at my job after I learned them.

good,"I was able to go through college to finish my degree. The management was very in depth with my training, not leaving me to figure it out. Working with customers and making sure that the store looks the same in the morning just as it does when we close in the evening."
good,Working at Big Lots taught me how improve my expectations to be a cashier and to be respective to are costumers. A typical day at work would be as any other day such as doing my duties and helping our customers. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing our customers with the satisfaction of getting what they wanted for a good price.

good,"Management is so easy to get along with. Very flexible schedule for other jobs, school, etc. At store 1399, there were so many reasons to stay. After I had my son, I needed a more steady schedule with promised hours for my son's care and upcoming new expenses. I was very sad to leave! I have never worked with a more amazing team, both employee and management, within my past decade of working for various employers."
good,"You not doing just one task you cashiering or stocking and clean bathrooms and answer telephones etc. I love working here wish it was full time that's the only down side to working this job , but its good if you just want extra money or can't work full time. My co-workers and managers are awesome and funny i love working with them."
good,I loved working at Big Lots. My managers were nice and the job was simple and easy. I would recommend someone to work here. I loved it!
good,"A typical day consist of unloading merchandise from truck,taking inventory of merchadise.I also tagged and stocked merchandise on floors shelves.I thought management was good,they were always helpful.I got along well with my other co-workers.I never had any problems with my job or anyone on the job.The hardest part of the job was unloading the merchandise because you have to be very careful not to damage it.The most enjoyable part of the job for me was tagging the merchandise."
good,"Worked my way up from cashier in only a couple of years. Great people to work with, I loved the work there. My manager was a good leader."
good,A very fun and enjoyable place to work. The management seems to actually care about its employees. They are more than happy to give hours to its employees and are willing to be flexible with scheduling.

good,"I was a store associate, I recovered; by helping to keep the store clean for the next day business, making sure the products were where they belong. I also was apart of the Freshness team, making sure that the food on the shelves were still fresh and not expired. marking down food product near the expiration date. I was recongized a few time by the district manager for buzz club sign up, which i was on the register just one day a week for a few hours and was top of the district for this. I had some great co-workers and some were alright. the hardest part of this job was the physical side of climbing the ladder, and lifting which I am not able to really do. the most enjoyable was taking the pride in the work and being recognized by a person who doesn't do that much, but he did it for me about three or four times. The managers were great and when they would ask me I was there. If someone called off I was there."
good,"I worked at the Big Lots in Round Rock, Texas. A typical day at work can range from being hectic to relaxed. It depends on the amount of customers in the store. Generally, the work environment is relaxed. At this job, I learned how to use the cash register with an electronic Point Of Sales system. I also learned how to handle stress in a quickly paced environment due to the days that we had a lot of customers. The days go by quickly when there are lots of customers. Generally, the management will know if the day is going to have heavy foot traffic because of holidays or the 20% off days for buzz club members, so they'll put in more hours for other people so that you aren't the only cashier available in times of a busy store. Even if there's a randomly busy time during the week, there's always a second till open so that someone else can hop on a help manage the crowd. The management I worked with was mostly friendly. There was one manager that was kind of a pain. She got there after me and had a problem with giving people their breaks. If you tell the store manager about problems with other management (obviously don't complain just to complain), he'll get right on top of that. I did, and I had no problems with getting my 15 minute break after that. The co-workers are pretty great there. They include everyone and they like meeting new co-workers. Most of the workers there are teenage-college age kids. the furniture manager and the assistant managers are a bit older, late 20's to late 30's. The store manager is pretty great. I worked hard at this job, so they gave me the time I"
good,Customer service was the #1 priority. I provide direction and support to associates on a daily basis to achieve excellent customer service.

My co-workers are great people, we all get along and help each other whenever needed. The hardest part of my job is organization. I would barely fix up a whole area and it gets ruined within the next hour. I don't really have a problem with organizing but it happens almost too often. The most enjoyable part of my job is the environment. I've never felt uncomfortable or misplaced when I'm there. I actually look forward to working because I look forward to what the entire day has to offer me."
good,"Unloading truck, and insuring proper placement and pricing of products. Always driving to hit a higher productivity level. Management was very friendly and easy to come to with any concerns.

The most enjoyable part was when I exceeded my goals and felt a sense of pride and ownership."

Also I learned how to assess what they department needed to have built and how to polish my communicating skills to effectively communicate with the customers. The management was amazing they were very fair and easy to work with. I had the furniture department manager who was a energetic hard worker and he effectively communicated what had to be done on a daily basis. I looked forward coming into work and working with him. The store manager was a very rigorous worker but was extremely helpful in telling each employee what she wanted done from them. The co-workers were great people who worked extremely hard, and couldn't have been more nice. The hardest part of my job was getting up at 3 am to unload the truck of orders in the store.The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers with whatever they needed."

good,They have some of the best deals as an employee. You must spend a lot to see the discount but it does come in handy when you are spending over 100 dollars a month. It's a team place. If your not team oriented not a  job for you.

good,everybody gets along management is great learn new things constantly very busy on holidays and during special events working in furniture department can be hard if we dont have enough employees to help in the back
good,Overall BigLots is a good company to work for.  I think they should reexamine the policy of never making associates full time.  In management the benefits aside from the health insurance are nice and relatively competitive and even better than some larger retailers.  The in-store management team with either make or break the store.
good,I loved my job. I worked grocery. I also unloaded truck and rang up customers. I loved meeting new people. Most of all I LOVED my management team. They are all amazing and would go back to work with them if I move back to tenn.

In the morning, sweeping, checking the restrooms, and cleaning the front end. In the afternoon, one would arrive and relieve and take over for the previous associate. The previous associate would inform the next one of tasks that he or she has not completed and inform others of employee related news. In the evening, one would arrive to take over and relive the previous associate much like he or she would in the afternoon. Towards closing, the associate would begin getting ready to close by cleaning, putting products away, and making announcements to let customers know when and how soon the store would be closed. After the store is closed for the evening, the associate would put away any remaining go-backs and check the bathrooms for any remaining customers that did not leave the store in time as well as cleaning up the bath room."
good,It was a few bumps with an employee. But overall working at Big Lots! was great! I loved my Managers and former employees there. Plus it was very close to home.

good,"my days usually went by pretty fast because i challenged myself at work and  chose to carry heavier stuff. employees are all very nice as well as the managers, i learned how to unload trucks quick. the hardest part of my job would be lifting the boxes but like i said i like a little challenge in my work. i enjoyed making new friends at my work."
good,"I have learned everything but management material and furniture, a good part time place to work, which you get full time when management. The worst part about this job is dealing with rude customers which there's not much, and the way the store is managed is not perfect but it is better than most out there in my opinion. I really like it here and have been here for 2+ years"
good,A great work place culture. Management is very nice and supportive of you in and out side of work. Big Lots is very supportive of your schedule. Big Lots is very understanding of other needs of extra income meaning if you have to get a second job.
good,I have worked for Big Lots four different occasions and each location was a great experience. Their management teams are wonderful and associates were friendly and easy to work with. Discounts on merchandise is a great benefit!

good,"I have been with Big lots for little over six years. We have had a variety of management within those years, so I have learned to adapt to changes in many ways. I was hired to help open and the stock the  reopen of Big Lots and I was hired on to  open the store as an CSS (customer service specialist). I have assisted in remodeling of stores, training new employees, learning opening and closing paperwork to just everyday customer satisfaction."
good,I was looking for a place to work. And when I saw Big Lots was hiring I applied. Got called in for an interview and was hired on the Spot. Spent about 4 months there before I was offered a new Job. The people are great. And the Managers really take the time to get to know you. Your not just an employee. Your part of a family. The job however does have its moments. Especially when you are not in furniture or Cashiering it can become boring. And hard to keep busy. You get a 15 minute break for every 4 hours you work and a 30 minute lunch (unpaid) for every shift over 6 hours. Pay is decent at 8 an hour. And you get paid every Friday. The only thing is that you work 15-25 hours a week. Which isn’t too bad. Overall this is a great starter job. And if you need some extra cash it’s perfect. The 20 percent discount really is cool too. Just be aware of friends and families days. You do also get holiday pay. And the only day BL is closed is Christmas.
good,"It really was a nice place to work, really good management and coworkers who are very helpful. My typical day included waiting on customers, checking them out at the register, and normally ticketing products and helping management with markdowns. The store typically wasn't busy during the hours I was working, and when we did get busy we always had back up cashiers available, so it never got overwhelming. It was a positive experience and gave me a chance to learn how another company operates. The company doesn't schedule their part time employees to work many hours, which worked out alright for me because I had another part time job, but I could see how that could be an issue for other people. I always enjoyed helping the customers as they checked out the most, the company had some very friendly customers come through the store and it was always nice to see them leave with a smile on their face. All and all it was a great place to work, company gives its employees a 20% discount from day one, which is good for anything in the store, the management was friendly and the coworkers was very helpful."
good,"I loved my job, my store and management. I loved helping customers. It was a very fast paced environment, I enjoyed multitasking. I took my job very seriously."
good,Customer service cashier  and also floor help. Also sometimes I would arrive early and help unload the truck . I would also do recovery that was my best quality
good,"I enjoyed my position here. There was always something to do, I enjoyed my co workers company as well. I just would've liked more hours. Overall good experience working here"
good,I loved everything about this job except the upstairs employees room it's very hot up there the last time I was there... so the trick to this is do your job get on the floor
good,"My management team was amazing, Every single one of them. The only reason I left this job was because of the pay. I loved everyone at the job. There was never any drama, everyone enjoyed everyday."
good,"I started out as a Cashier. I remember one Day ,a child pulled a 100.00 dollar bill out of the strong box of the Cashier who was stationed in front my Area, He was on break and had evidently not pushed the $100 Bill down far enough to drop all the way into the strong box.  It was later in the Evening and no one was around, I put the Bill in my pocket and when the assistant  Manager came out from the back a bit later I gave her the Money and told her what had transpired . I think that, combined with my Friendliness got me promoted to CSS.  (Customer Service Specialist)  I Loved that and my Manager liked me for the Effort and Good work ethic I displayed."
good,"This place is a really great place to work at the pros are that the discounts are pretty good, the only cons to this workplace is that I have been working there for quite awhile already and my pay rate isn't fair enough."
good,"Copesthetic, active, and time management was stressed for overnight stocking."
good,"ive worked here for a little over a year now. and its honestly the best job ive had in working retail. my boss Ben is awesome, very kind, will always work with your schedule and still make sure you keep your hours."
good,"The time i have spent working at Big Lots has been one i will never forget! When i started working at this company; i wasnt trained on how to unload a truck or stock shelves properly. But once i got hired on the team, my fellow employers taught me everything i needed to know about my position. I have grown very fond of the crew and management at Big Lots that i consider them all my family! I will dearly miss it over there and I am very happy with what I learned from them all!"
good,Love your customers and remember their faces Christmas was the best black Friday also and i cleaned up at night i loved that job
good,Keeping Busy is more important to me. I work hard for my change. I prefer a full time job. I would recommend a friend of mine to work for Big Lots. There's opportunity to move ahead in the company if you want to stay in retail.
good,"Assistant Store Team Leader"
good,". The most enjoyable thing about working at Big Lots is the people I work with, they make going to work fun while still being professional and geting the job done."
good,"This job was an awesome experience. I was hired when I was around 7/8 months pregnant and despite any health issues they never failed to be kind and help me when needed. "
good,I would go in and get the store ready for the day. I learned a lot about management styles and how to motivate others. I also learned what it takes to operate a store of that size.
good,Fun fast paced work environment with great co-workers. Management Leaders are helpful to all workers.Everyone gets along well with others overall a great place to work.
good,"It was a very fun place to work! Everyone was very nice! Although, pay wasn't that great at all; it worked out. I loved the environment and the customers! It was pure satisfactory working for Big Lots."

good,Always enjoyed working at big lots. Great management and co-workers. Job was always at a fast pace. the best part is when you were done with your assignment how beautiful it looked.
good,A day at work was very interesting as I was able to meet many different people from different kinds of backrounds. I had a wonderful manager who made things fun not hard. We were always thanked for a good days work which says so much more to a employee
good,"Big lots is a great company to work for.I was fortunate to work with excellent managers and crew.Unfortunately,our store closed due to lack of business."
good,"I looked forward to work every day, everyone was kind and they were all sad to see me move away. They helped me when I needed it, even without asking. They invited me to help them with jobs around the store if I needed something to do. The managers were very helpful and never complained if I needed to hear something multiple times. The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours.. but the best part of the job was feeling like I was a part of a family!"
good,Always busy never to slow to work. People get mad when u tell them that they cant get a refund for not having the papers with them. the best management ever was the best job. they was the best works you could ask for did as they was told no fight. try to pick up the store after a big sale. Knowing that I did my job.
good,"I was a cashier for Big Lots while I was in college. The flexible hours gave me time to also focus on my education. The management was fair, they were very nice and would help the associates if needed. Associates get a %20 off of any merchandise they buy. They were a little too pushy on the rewards program in my opinion however I understand they why they are doing that. The only downside was that my store closed, I would definitely work for this employer again if they needed anyone in the major that I studied for which was IT"
good,"Great positive environment to work at with an easy day and evening shift, only complaint is low hours given normally. I love the atmosphere working at big lots, great place to work on your customer service skills."
good,A typical day at Big Lots was productive and interesting you stay busy everybody doing something I enjoyed helping the customers my co-workers were excellent people we all got along just fine worked together to get the job done the managers were also great people.
good,the job was long not worth the pay they did not seem to care for the people that worked for them  i would go over the top and others would take the credit but the head of management did see and was good about letting me know that he knew i did well
good,"Big Lots is a very customer driven company. We have sales goals to meet or beat everyday to keep us motivated. It is also a tasked driven company. Having stock from truck to floor in 48 hours ,resets to complete, and ad sets  to be done in a timely manner. Having and coaching the right people to complete these tasks makes the job much easier. Sometimes that's the hardest part."
good,nice place nice people and nice customers great deals nice place for my first job
good,Its very unfortunate that  the company has closed down otherwise I would have loved to still be working there.
good,"Outstanding!"
good,"A typical day of work for me included counting my drawer and then getting on a register. I would ring up customers the majority of my shift. When it was slow I would recover the front end of the store. At the end of the day I would count my drawer, and help recover the store."
good,"A typical day at this job was always making sure your employees showed up. Putting out freight. Making end caps. Helping customers. I learned that you must work at a fast pace to keep up with everything a manager has to complete. Management in the store is great. We all work and communicated to make sure everything went smooth and got done. My co-workers were always hard workers. I had no problems with any of them and they always done their work right and finished in a timely manner. The hardest part of this job was having to work every other Sunday being the only manager, but I always got my work done. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was being friends with my co-workers but them also knowing I was in charge. Also finishing all my work."
good,Company grew from 200 stores with $300 million in annual reviews to 1500 stores with more than $4 billion in annual revenues over 18 years.
good,"Entered product received into inventory using the company computer system and continuously monitored inventory stock for re-order, etc"
good,"I love my first job and I'm extremely grateful that they gave me an opportunity to show that I work hard because every where I went you either needed to know someone or had to have a lot of work experience to be considered there. Work at Big Lots always changes, one day it can be very fast pace since of all the customers and other days it can be slow. I work as customer service and I'm a cashier also, so I know how to handle money well and know how to treat a customers well enough that they come back. The enjoyable part is that everyone gets alone and customers always nice when you treat them well."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers and managers."
good,"we would have a meeting"
good,Checking out guest. Dealing with returns in customer service. Salesfloor making sure the store was clean and nice when the store was closing.
good,"typical day at work is very rewarding; good part time hours, friendly employees/ customers, very enthusiastic line of work."

good,"I absolutely admired the store manager who was gracious enough to teach me what he has learned in his many years experience. I am very grateful to be able to learn the knowledge I have over the years from my employers. I learned being a manager that some employees do not always have the same idea of customer service as I do and it was harsh, and disheartening to find out that other people don't always take pride in their work or ability's. Management duties were delegated between the store manager, associate manager, and myself the customer service manager. My co-workers were very intuitive as far as being able to answer customers questions, and help them find products located in the store. I was also happy to know that the cashiers were very well informed about the products and merchandise we sold. Now lets talk about customers!!! I have never worked for a store that was so dignified, thoughtful, and compassionate. It was as if the customers seemed to follow this unspoken set of principles! Together everyone seemed to have a heightened sense of enlightenment when interacting with on another. The aura in this store can only be described as merciful, humane, tolerant, as well as benevolent! I am proud to have been such a big part of the stores tenderheartedness. The hardest part of working at Big Lots was freight day. I was sometimes very uncomfortable, and exhausting to unload the whole freight truck and then put all of the merchandise out on the floor. The best part of working at Big Lots has to be the managers and employees the serenity, unanimity, good will, and friendship"

It don't matter if you are really sick or the weather is really bad for more than two days they want you to be at work no matter what. I was told that they expect you to be at work no exceptions only if there is a state of emergency.I think they should change there policies because some people cant help that they get sick and the weather in the winter can get bad where people cant even get out of their driveways."
good,"I have been working at Big Lots for more than two years and it’s been my longest job. I absolutely adore my coworkers and managers because of the familial sense we have grown as well as the customers.

My 401k and paid holidays (a 4 hour day) were introduced at 6 months of service. You ALWAYS get an employee discount of 20% off your purchase everyday of the week. The only downfall is getting people to sign up on the store rewards program. They ARE sticklers on this program & will be ""on your butt"" on the subject. Not every customer wants to sign up on the rewards program, some just wanna shop normally with no ties to a program. Overall a good place to work. All the managers at my store are nice & understanding."

good,Enjoyed my positions.. You can be promoted quite fast! It's a really great place to work.
good,Very busy around the holiday season. Was a great first job. I learned that you have to be completely work driven to get all of your tasks completed on time. Management helped a lot and did a really good job at giving directions. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was the long breaks.
good,"Great company to work for. I enjoy working with the customers and coworkers. The hardest part of the day is unloading trucks, as I also help with that. I enjoy when a customer is happy."

good,"Loved working for Big Lots, great people.  Learned alot from everyone there and that is how I became a manager."
good,"I loved my job at Big Lots.  This was my favorite job that I have had thus far.  I started out as a cashier, and worked my way up to Assistant Store Manager.  We made work fun everyday.  We could come to work, laugh and cut up, but still get the job done.  The hardest part was not having larger quantities of ad items, and heavy lifting of furniture. Everyday was like Christmas when it came to stocking.  We never knew what we were getting until we started putting merchandise out."

good,"Typical day at work was if I was on the floor, I had to do a lot of work with the truck, restocking, making sure signs were right. Had to do inventory prep. Help customers get merchandise off top shelves. As the customer service, make sure other registers had change, did returns, write off merchandise if damaged or defective took care of customers all day. I've learned a lot about retail. Management was excellent except one she never did what she was asked of higher management and always made CSS (my position) do her work, or she would go out side every 10 minutes to smoke a cigarette. If called for help she would walk right by you or take forever to respond My co-workers sometimes didn't do there jobs corrected, that made me work a lot harder when stocking the shelves. There was no hard part of the job to me, very easy money. The most enjoyable part of the job was the higher managers didn't make it boring. If i had asked to do something they would find something for me to do. On big busy days they would order food for all the employees."
good,I learned eveything from how to run a register to selling furniture to my work ethic. I have no cons but the low hours during certian part of the year and people being laid off just because the funds were not alwasy there. I unloaded trucks sold furniture ran register cleaned store stocked shelves.
good,"Being a Big Lots employee is great, especially if it's your first job! In my experience, both managers and co-workers were fun to work with. During the holiday seasons, the store is busier than usual. At the same time, it's not hard to deal with because everyone is on the same page. So if you're behind on your work and someone finished theirs early, you can count on them to lend you a hand. As a Sales Associate, duties include being a cashier, stocking a variety of things (tools, toys, food, etc.), customer service, and store maintenance. The environment is very laid-back which makes everything that much easier. It's wonderful!"

good,"Everywhere has it's drama, I was liked because I was always on time early and I worked hard I just had to quit without giving two weeks notice so I can't go back or I would. Two people kept undoing what I stocked and leaving it in the floor so they could put their stuff out. And I'd have to do it again, which upset me that they got away with it. I know they got away with it cause it was not isolated."

You do your own thing and no body really bothers you."

good,"It's exciting to work here if you like organizations, which is some of the things I do. Having a big group of people all trying to achieve the same goal is neat, especially when everyone working there are happy and able to help and answer any questions you have. I think the hardest part of the job is trying to time yourself to a task, because as much as it's better to finish a mission with speed, it's knowing you did a great job at it and with speed. It helps a lot when the team gets together to complete a task together by helping each other to the end of that mission."
good,Daily routine at work is customer service 100% Producing sales and staying on track with inventory control. As a retail manager I learn everyday from challenges I run to on a daily basis. Co-workers are great to work with as I train them on the furniture aspect of the company. No job with customers or furniture is hard but more of a challenge to embrace. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and co- workers and also providing great customer service to generate sales.

I would open or close the store depending on the shift I was scheduled. The management was AWESOME and my co-workers were just as amazing."
