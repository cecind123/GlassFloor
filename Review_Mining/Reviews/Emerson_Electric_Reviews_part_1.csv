rating,review
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,Mangment is a joke. People want to run to the office just to get you in trouble. Its like working at a daycare center. Some people act like little kids cry if they're icecream is to cold. If there was a negative score to give Emerson would get the lowest  negative score there is. Company doesn't follow their own rules in they're hand book. They have retaliation there as well.
bad,Worst management and leads its the blind leading the blind manager comes in 9:30 and tells everyone else to be there at 6am cause there's so much work but spend more time standing around. If you want a lazy job this is the place!
bad,Skip this place unless you like being treated like nothing... less than nothing! They will scream in your face every day and act like they own you and act like they're doing you a favor.
bad,Terrible place to work wouldn't recommend to anyone. Management's expectations are way too high. I thought Management was mean to their employees. Supposed to provide training but never did.
bad,Don't expect to be at home ever. Plan on living in a hotel & never getting the vacation you've earned. you won't be able to use it. The culture is cut throat there's a lot of backstabbing.
bad,"The accounting department it’s not an equal department. The abuse for the AP clerks is beyond any I’ve ever experienced in my 20 years as an AP clerk, and the worst part is that the manager could careless about the clerks, I literally walked out because I couldn’t take the abuse anymore!!! One year of it was enough for me and the $15 an hr was not worth the stress!!"
bad,"I wouldn't let my dog work here it was worst place ever worked in my life "
bad,"Culture does not facilitate new product engineering.   If it requires engineering work, it will be sub contracted out or out-sourced.  If there is an investment to be made in a new product infrastructure for engineering, this is not the place for you.  Run if you want to develop anything that is new.   Management is interested in purchasing a product and the reselling it at huge profits.  Management has no talent for organic product development."
bad,"I had to work hard which was fine if I would have been paid more than 11.50 an hour.  I worked harder than most the people there,  and got hurt on the job and was let go do to the doctor having me off work."
bad,"i worked for this place for almost 3 years, until i got hurt! then, they made up every excuse they could to fire me! i literally bled for this place only to be fire because of their negligence! director of operations and human resources manger are back stabbing liars to the highestpower!"
bad,"they never took the time to help you learn, no bodey spoke english,no team work, never seen my boss and the lack of care when a issue was brought up. not enough pay"
bad,I had virtually no support for my job that I could count on. Very little direction throughout the day. Always had to go ask or just guess. Mamagement is poor and creates a hostile workplace
bad,"Management and workplace culture is terrible, pay was low. Long shifts that they make mandatory with very little pay raise.  They take to long to hire on permanent and have too many lay offs."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend.  Moving jobs to Costa Rica and Reynosa.  Constant uncertainty in retaining your job.  Don't go, don't apply, don't consider.  I loved the company before we were bought."
bad,"Just not a great place work if you care about advancement or need mentorship regarding promotions. You have multiple senior managers to report to, none of which are on the same page."
bad,"no communications skill on managements, poor working static on all shifts, favoritism, machine had never run an 8 hour shift, machine always down and no teaching skill from manager, no direct communication from manager, no change over shift,"
bad,this job is not a place I would ever reccomend to anyone unless they were desperate for a job. Granted they paid more than minimum wage when I worked there ! The type of people they employee do not bring harmony or balance. they tend to be over dramatic and petty The union is a JOKE ! The benifits were no better than having none at all.
bad,"Knowledgeable engineers to learn and work with. Incredibly low pay with meager vacation time; 2 weeks starting then 3 weeks when you hit 5 years with the company. HR will call your supervisor if you're sick more than 2 days. Management is all about bottom line numbers meaning they aren't looking out for you or your career. They sell profit sharing, but the new president limits it to 8% while historically it's been capped at 15%. Evidence backed course of action suggestions fall on deaf ears. Nepotism and the good 'ol boys club prevalent within this company. Hardest part about the jobs was striving for excellence then at the end of the year be rewarded with 2.7% to 3%. Best part was meeting lifelong mentors and friends."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,"I worked here a year and couldn't wait to leave. I loved all the residents dearly but  management  sucked. They treat you so bad, for nothing just because the state is up their butt for what isn't done on their end.  I would never go back!"
bad,As a new employee I was left to stumble around with little to no help.  They had an abusive amount of H1B visa holders who  were the company darlings.
bad,"Management only cares about bottom line, they do not care about the workers or their needs! If you have a family, you'll never see them because they will change your shift at any given point with no regard to your life."
bad,"Nada a declarar. Não foi uma experiencia positiva, tampouco agregou profissionalmente e pessoalmente."
bad,"Overall I guess its an okay company if you are into trouble shooting products not many people know that exist. I mean it wasn't a job fit for a person like myself, but aye could be perfect for you."
bad,I would not recommend Emerson to any of my colleagues. There's no structure and management is poor. There is blatant favoritism and people are placed in leadership roles with no idea of what they are doing. The entire management team needs to be purged from the company.
bad,"Nare sfeer "
bad,"It is a dead end job, with no chance of advancement. the company has no vision for the future. they will be destroyed once Tesla batteries hit the main stream."
bad,"Too Many meetings and reporting's."
bad,"reunión de trabajo con partners, recorrido a áreas de servicio, extensas juntas y administración de proyectos con proveedores internos y externos, on boarding plan una vez por semana."
bad,"Was a wonderful job for the first 26 years then went down drain after a particular new boss would yell at me in front of others, accuse me of ridiculous things, slam doors, have others in other management positions accuse me, meanwhile I did everything asked of me, my nerves where shot..  No matter which direction I took it was picked apart.  I am sure there are many wonderful management there, I just had a lemon."
bad,While working there I was so disappointed with pay hours and the supervisor is just rude disrespectful and lazy. I would NOT recommend working here what so evee.
bad,"I really don't have a positive or negative opinion here. Happy for my time and the opportunity, but not terribly impressed with the organization either. Worth accepting a job from but have realistic expectations"
bad,"Not much to say. This place has issues. Met some great people there who are willing to work, but they aren't being trained and managed very well."
bad,"- Good learning environment"
bad,"Busy environment, lots of multi taking as we offer a shared services environment."
bad,"only take on when bissey then lay off,work on production line"
bad,I was gaging scroll and then  I went on assembly line and help make air pressure
bad,"Poor Management"
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,"It was a very bad place to work, a lot of discrimination, and very bad environment, bad management, and bad co-workers, most of the workers they hired have criminal records, and many of them were smoking weed in the parking lot, it is a good thing that Closetmaid has bought it and took it to California."
bad,"Visual and gauge inspection of machined product. Use of graphs charts and multi gauges. repair of gauges if needed three lines of product with Spece every two hours on each line running non-conformance reports,"
bad,"You work on a conveyor belt packaging product for flimsy temporary furniture. The only thing I learned was the simplicity of how to assemble products in a box. The co-workers were okay but management was very vindictive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with very poor management (they would hire on temporary workers for a large production order needed to fill, didn't have the product to fill and would fire the temporary employess with no notice. they did this frequently). The most enjoyable part of this was...nothing."
bad,Altijd hard werken. Heb weinig geleerd omdat de werk eentonig is. De werksfeer is erg slecht en er word daar totaal niet aangewerkt. 
bad,The hardest part of the work was the people. Most of them were very difficult to get along with.
bad,"no, valoran la capacidad tecnica, ni a sus empleados. no dejan evolucionar, y solo les importa crecer economicamente a costa de lo que sea,"
bad,Generally an unhappy place to work for all staff including management team
bad,"I had a 60 day short term assignment (from a job service center) to work in a Closetmaid warehouse in Ocala, FL. High stress environment & co-worker driving wrecklessly& taking unnecessary risks on forklifts."
bad,Laid back work place . Very strict attendance rules. Learned Q.A. audit work . Packed units in timely manner.
bad,"Pay is way too low for the experience you bring to the company. Management is not willing to retain leaving employees. "
bad,"If you haven't worked there for 5 + years, you are NOT part of the ""family"".  You can't be smarter than the smartest woman in the company or you are OUT!  Don't even think about being athletically competitive for their pitiful volleyball league.  They cheat to win and the H/R manager will make sure HER team wins even if it's by intimidation and manipulation."
bad,"I worked there for over 15 years and was basically pushed out by the fabrication Supervisor.  Top management is blind to his lack of knowledge in the field, all the lies he tells the fabrication team and all the favoritism he shows to a select few. If you go to work there dont put your life into your job. If you dont care about how the place is run and you can simply be a tool and do your 8 hours you'll get buy..."
bad,"Difficult company to work for if you don't fit the ""mold"". Executive team all the way to the President looks down at anyone who doesn't have an M.B.A."
bad,Not a fun place to work with no extras. Management unhelpful. Extreme favoritism. Rules change on almost a daily basis. Breaks and lunch are cut short on a daily basis.
bad,If you don't know people in upper management you will not get any promotions. No matter how hard you work and how good of a job you do you will no advance.
bad,"Diversity = Not Even."
bad,I was hired in to take the place of someone who was on medical leave....pay was great for not having any experience in operating a lathe.  I learned alot then about a year down the road they got rid of that line and moved me to another plant doing the exact same thing but cut my pay in half.....what a joke this union is to allow them to do that.  The pay should be equal for the job......the union dues in this shop are ridiculous for what they do.  I was so happy that they laid me off.....
bad,The only thing keeping me there is I cant find another job that pays the same or more
bad,"I would not wish this place on my worst enemy. They ship jobs over to Manila, regularly. They are always trying to downsize. There is no room for advancement, unless you are a VP, which, are all white men- so if you're a woman or minority, you're pretty much screwed. Management is a complete joke. We had a manager who was finally moved out of our department, but only after someone threatened to sue to company because of his unethical, unprofessional and bizarre behavior. The whole department went to HR to complain and nothing was done. HR is another joke at this place; they only way you can get anything resolved is if you go to the corporate HR or above that, because the normal HR people are against the employees, always on the managers' sides even when unethical behavior is happening. Even if you're being harassed, nothing will be done unless someone threatens to sue to company. In that case, the harassing manager will be moved to another department to manage yet more people. There is also this attendance system, where you get a certain number of attendance points per year, and no matter what the circumstances, you will get a point for being late or absent, even being 15 seconds late. REGARDLESS of the circumstances, you could even be in a car wreck, and they wouldn't care, you would still get an attendance point and possible fired. The management also plays favorites and gives points to only those who they don't like.  No one listens to the employees' concerns, and all of the VPs have degrees that have absolutely nothing to do with their jobs, they resemble a ""good old boys"
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,"Management at ClosetMaid, (which was sold from Emerson to Griffon) was self-serving, slimey, game-playing, overbearing, manipulative, or absent, hyper-competitive, and disrespectful. It was akin to working in a snake pit. I was sorely disappointed, and I would never work there again—unless I were desperate for $$$ and could leave within a few sacrificial months for greener pastures. . Yes, it was THAT BAD."
bad,"Not for the employees,always threaten your job, expect for you to burn yourself out..wanna work you 7 days of week while they at home with their love one. always talking be safe, soon as you slow down cause of the heat, they want to write you up.. the more you do the more they want!! It’s never enough!!! It’s probably like working on a plantation.. I need to be more diversity in management... what you got now is chaos!!!"
bad,"Bransons location makes them desperate to hire people at times. While I was at Branson (an emerson company) they hired two ""recovering"" heroin addicts and one of them would do heroin while at work and the other would drink regularly while at work. These things were reported to management and no action was taken. I have a scar on my forehead thanks to one of these clowns they hired."
bad,"The issue is a revolving door of production people. The equipment is overly complicated for the application and the pay for the production workers is less than an individual  can earn at Walmart. The production floor is constant gogogo so the people leave within a few days of starting and the revolving door is continuous"
bad,Very poor management and unreasonable expectations. No strategy. The company as a whole has loads of potential but the culture is horrible and old school.
bad,Poor work place HR is very poor they expect to much for what they pay and have no ac in building only supervision has ac in there office and what about the employees
bad,"Full work day, never a dull moment"
bad,My experience here was very poor. The conditions of the factory were bad. the ability to move up in position was nearly non-existent. The culture of the facility was based around who you knew not what you knew. The only light in my time there was the benefits. Pay was too low.
bad,Was very unhappy with every aspect. This company has a huge tendency to take advantage of good employees. Also known for promising pay raises for hard working employees that never happen.
bad,"Licencié après 25 ans dans une entité absorbée par EMERSON, ou la casse a été le principal moteur de l'entité américaine ! mon refus de porté le polo de l'entité avec le logo dans l'atelier m'a été préjudiciable ! je n'avais jamais connu cette culture primaire . . . Facile de faire parti de l'encadrement, si vous êtes  ambitieux  et narcissique;  le paraître est très important chez Emerson."
bad,The Night-Shift supervisors were far more interested in maintaining a revolving door of lay-offs and hiring than optimizing their current team of assemblers. They would train all of their workers very poorly and expect near-perfection on the job and if you weren't perfect they would penalize you and often times expedite the write-up process.
bad,"After being employed for 4 weeks, I traveled to China, South Korea, Japan, India. I enjoyed meeting other people from those countries."
bad,"Great American company which acquired a European arm via acquisition (Chloride)."
bad,"My typical day at work is, just staying to myself most the time, or helping people who are behind on their schedules. I always work as much i can, to keep everything running. I've learned how to drive a forklift, what is safe and not safe about working in a factory. i love meeting new people, and getting to know them. "
bad,"Poor management, and unsafe working conditions. Management ignores policies on safety and quality when approaching end of period benchmarks. Staff reductions fall disproportionately on women and minorities."
bad,"If you want to work in an engineering department that does mostly reverse engineering of competitor products and is built on a culture of unfairness and backstabbing, this is the place for you."
bad,It was OK when it was Westinghouse. Since it became Emerson they only try to shut down development and replace previous Westinghouse products with Delta V.
bad,"The union sold out the workers here many years ago. The union is now divided into two tiers, with all new employees going to the second tier. First tier employees are very well protected by the union and will remind you of this at every opportunity. Second tier employees get to pay union dues and that's about the extent of what the union will do for new workers."
bad,"Sales are down and layoffs happen, but they only let go of worker bee positions, meanwhile they continue to hire more executives.  There is no one left to support customers, and the ones who are left are so overloaded that morale is at an all-time low & everyone is stressed to the max.  Management is so disconnected and inexperienced that they can't see this simple issue!"
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,I transferred from another EMERSON facility. I asked the plant manager during the interview about the bad reviews regarding excessive overtime. He assured he fixed all that. That was not true we worked 7 days all the time. They were unable to properly schedule or cancel overtime so that you could plan your life.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for this company especially on the subsection TopWorx. They have very poor EHS conditions on the shops. Also they would assign a non-manager employee to train you. I had to deal with a very poorly mannered mechanical designer who was supposed to train me and instead would set me up for failure all the time. They finally got me fired with no previous notice or an explanation. One day when leaving the workplace I received a phone call from Ahead human resources (Staffing agency) saying that my assignment had ended. That was it. Very unprofessional.
bad,"In the past 2 weeks, 3 people with 20 plus years have left. The work environment is toxic. If your not in a cliche  then you are targeted. To the point that you have high mental and physical issues. Team leader's are encouraged to target people, They harass team members to sign false statements against others.  If you have the courage to file a complaint with the HR department; They circle the wagons and YOU are the one that ends up being punished, harassed and ridiculed. Staff encourages the lower management to talk down, demean, and bully their employees in all areas."
bad,"too many changes In the business structure,  with a great loss of experience."
bad,"Specialists with high performance skill-sets are over-worked doing mundane repetitive tasks, The culture is 100% about upholding the status-quo. Ideas that challenge that status quo are met with scorn and a lack of mobility within the organization."
bad,"All of us employees were completely overworked. You got yelled at or even written up for just going to the bathroom. Completely dangerous and unsafe working conditions. People got injured every week and sometimes were denied medical treatment or the opportunity to leave work and go home. Management and HR continually set up, staged events and planned to fire people continuously. Minorities were treated like complete trash and were the first ones set up to be terminated. Minorities were only hired to fulfill contract obligations wit vendors and maintain a EOE status but were treated so poorly they had to quit if they were not unfairly terminated."
bad,"PROS:"
bad,"Your day starts at 7 and right away you're off to putting heavy boards in boxes, stapling boxes, unloading the boxes from the conveyor, etc."
bad,"Buena empresa en cuanto a salario, pero cero pedagógia de los supervisores para enseñar y aclarar dudas, capacitación deficienciente"
bad,"A lot of favoritism,management would prefer to sacrifice an inexperienced employee over the people that had been there for a longer time even though they always made mistakes"
bad,"Once i got the phone call i was excited to work at Emerson (process management), it was a fine place to work but only for someone looking for experience.  Its not a full career nor something to look into the future for.  How Emerson Process Management (STL) works is they have a few people that they have kept for a long time (15+ years) and everyone else is a temporary worker from a temp agency.  They have you work for 5-8 months then they get new temps and lay off all of the old ones (the temp contract lets them do this legally). Emerson does such for they can pay half of the workers a lower wage and not worry about benefits.  I cant speak for all Emerson locations, but this is the fact with the Saint Louis, MO (global headquarters) location."
bad,"1. Emerson does not care about their employees. They will lay you off in a second to save a dollar regardless of your time spent there. "
bad,"Very hostile. Friendships discouraged. No team building. "
bad,"You have meetings all the time, but somehow you end the day even more confused about the direction of the projects and your role.  There is no incentive to work hard because if you complete any of your numerous projects on time you are ""rewarded"" with an even heavier work load.  "
bad,"I wouldnt go near this company and the managent in the call center is terrible. My mother taught me if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say any. hated it"
bad,A large corporation run by great people below VP level.  Good programs and benefits.  Generated great products.  Led by CEO who apparently cared little about the rank anf file.
bad,I was hired on with Emerson - ERS as a field engineer.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,"Emerson acquired the small business I worked for previously, promising that nothing would change, and that this was going to be good for all of us."
bad,"Difficile d'évaluer car j'étais un des associé dans cette entreprise avec mon mari."
bad,"Challenging work. Very interesting."
bad,"Is there a typical day in HR :), enjoyed all aspects of the HR positions held.  Worked well with all levels within the organization.  Great co-workers, the hardest part of the job has been the past 2 years and the downsizing/layoff and conducting the exit interviews.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make a difference and explaining/answering questions employees may have. "
bad,"Overall it's a ok job. There are a few that take advantage of their positions and refuse change for the better. First job where one person told me to work on a problem area but another refused anything to be done and the first person knowing still pushes change. Constant battle to get anything done while you get blamed for nothing getting done. Most people agree on the main person causing problems yet the company just does nothing about it and leaves him in ""power""."
bad,"The first year I was expected to work 28 out of 30 days a month, you will end up working an off-shift as a machine operator in Elyria for 15 to 20 years before you can get on first shift from the looks of it. you do get plenty of vacation time but if you need to use it your supervisor will whine and complain. My supervisor on second shift very rarely worked a weekend, so when you needed something it was like pulling teeth. The coolant in the machines rot and even gave me dermatitis on my hand the whole plant smells really bad."
bad,Management speaks to employees very badly. Lie to get what they want. Make promises they have no intentions of keeping. Equipment stays broken down. Employees on incentive pay cant survive due to machine maintenance issues and going home early for lack of work.
bad,"Quitting soon due to all listed above. Terrible management, nobody wants to work and the same always complain about sinple tasks they are paid to do. Would not reccomend this place."
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be releasing about 30 to 40 workers. Working with Engineers, Order Managers and Buyers on product and customer request dates."
bad,"Small company of about only 15 people, one of which includes a full-time on site IT.  Yet there are issues with the database and other computer programs on a weekly basis.  Order are not prioritized because the warehouse guys would rather gossip.  For such a small company and working so close together nobody is entirely sure what anybody else is doing, what their job duties are etc."
bad,"Fabricion de roscas,no me gusto en lo personal el trabajo.Buen ambiente,buen compañerismo."
bad,Management doesn't know how difficult or how easy it is to get work done. The provide a small starting wage with small pay increases. They are not forgiving when making mistakes.
bad,"The pay and benefits are very good for the type of work....but it comes with a price.  Your time will be micromanaged to the minute....literally.  If at any hour during the day you do not meet rate you must explain TO THE MINUTE what you did that caused you to not meet rate.  You will have management constantly coming at you with the opening ""If you want to continue working here.....""    If your job is not done at the end of the shift you must stay and do it or face disciple and yet they will backtrack you punch out time to the scheduled time so you will spend time often cleaning  or something on your own time.   There are lead men that are supposed to be your union brothers that police the place all night and make threats.  It gets extremely hot in the summer.  Very dirty environment."
bad,"Es una buena empresa , el habiente es bueno solo que busco mayor ingreso."
bad,"Mal ambiente laboral, nepotismo por parte de algunos directivos, departamento de recursos humanos y gerentes de área incapaces de resolver problemáticas, comedor insalubre, no pagan horas extra a empleados administrativos. Nulas oportunidades de crecimiento en el área administrativa."
bad,"Assisted in bookkeeping duties of billing, account payable, account receivable, collections, and"
bad,"Run from this company unless you are desperate. "
bad,"If you want to go to work, and do your job and go home, you wont be able to. Constantly pulled between production lines, with the same people staying put, because they're all friends outside of work. So, they stay on the slower paced lines, and you get sent to the back breaking lines day after day."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,"Work load heavy,"
bad,"Good people and a great place to work. Always learning new skills and the location is great, mid-cities."
bad,"A very spiteful and disrespectful  group of snobs... I wasted 7 years of "
bad,"Esta empresa es un desastre, gente que no tiene conocimientos necesarios para ocupar las posiciones que ocupa, muy desorganizada, no hay posibilidades de crecimiento, los sueldos son una miseria, poco profesional, da verguenza que esto sea una ''multinacional''"
bad,"The job was fairly close to home, 40 hours while it lasted. Overall more the type of job that I had had in the past."
bad,"Management not transparent, won't provide training for senior people but will for college grads. Does not promote from within. Why is this important? this don't matter."
bad,"I interviewed for a specific job, however, I was performing tasks that was not a part of the job description or job offer.  There was no training, I had to follow old notes put together from a previous employee.  My boss was the worst boss I had ever worked for, never communicated to me, never showed me how to complete a task. Very unapproachable, and unfriendly (not a motivator at all). I really dreaded going to work everyday."
bad,"There is not really any advancement opportunities, and everything is based on seniority even if job would be better suited for someone else. Different rules for certain employees."
bad,Management is employee suppressive. The workplace culture is sporadic. Policy communication from management takes three attempts in efforts for them to decide the correct policy. Policy and procedures are modified daily depending upon the circumstance and employee. No direction of goals. All of these inconsistencies produce an environment of distrust and lack of motivation.
bad,With it being a factory job the work was very repetitive and very manual intensive. Job got old after a while and the pay wasn't the greatest but in need of a job it worked.
bad,"Overtime mandatory, 50 to 60 hour weeks, not enough support for workplace to accommodate workflow demands, juvenal culture on warehouse floor"
bad,"This company is behind the curve. Poor benefits, below market compensation, less flexible hours than similar industries. Leadership is weak."
bad,"Poor leadership makes Emerson a difficult place to work.  Emerson does not make resources available to facilitate employee's ability to complete assigned task.  "
bad,"Working in Emerson is a great experience as you will be trained to diversified cultures. You will learn to become flexible because you will be dealing with different countries or business units, as it is called. You will learn also a lot of patience because you will encounter lots of chasing as all matters are urgent. "
bad,big company no thought of employees under valued employees
bad,problemas de BOM mal estructurados y se hacen los reportes correspondientes demoran un dia para darle seguimiento dependiendo si la informacion le da seguimeiento el ingeniero a cargo. de acuerdo  a la respuesta se hacen el producto.
bad,Management only cares about driving the numbers for corperate. typical week would be 60 to 80 hours. difficult to get training.
bad,"Investors want to make more profit and CEO pays himself 15 million a year - they terminate 1000 employees to boost forecasted profits. No bonuses, no Xmas parties, not even a turkey for thanksgiving. They send you on the road for months and expect you to eat McDonalds to save money. They work you 65-80 hours a week and don't get 1.5x OT (only 1x) yet they charge for it."
bad,"If you've been working here for over a year you can easily get yourself a better job that pays way more. It might not be as confortable as this but you'll be making an actual living. For how much this company is worth you'd think they would pay their employees that work on the floor a reasonable wage, but no I'm over here rationing my food for every month i've been working with them. Plus they got me locked in a contract so I cannot leave until that contract ends. They knew exactly what they were doing. On top of all this the welding I do is extremly repetitive and boring. After about 3 months of working there I could do their work with my eyes closed. If you're a skilled welder look elsewhere, if you stay here your skills will dull."
bad,"Not a flexible place to work for working mother's. Not flexible for mother's who have children with ADHD. Always was working but, they frowned on working remotely even when you made meetings via conference call and never missed deadlines"
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,They push you past the point of  exhaustion and then push you even more. You get in trouble if you stop for anything even to go to the bathroom. They say the put safety before production but the dont.
bad,"Management needs improvement. Office politics is toxic. Job advancement needs a high performance review rating but all managers in the department will basically vote for your grade, making the entire performance review process subjective."
bad,This company was so great to work for when I started. They soon got bought out and need us to put in more hours to train our replacement.
bad,"Management doesn't care about the employees well being, they only care about themselves with no respect for the people that put the hard work in to make Fisher what it is today"
bad,I could have sensed long time ago that the company was gonna go bankrupt because of so much  changing of  policies and outsourcing to foreign countries with cheaper labor where product quality is compromised thereby contributing to the demise of its operations.  Formerly the company was a global leader in distribution of valve automation products and a major player in the Oil and Gas Industry.
bad,They hire workers off the streets because a family member also works there.all the while over looking experience and training that the egar temps have. It is basically a sweat shop with a high morale
bad,"It is a place where i have learnt a lot of value added program.A highly professional company with a good project management SW tools , Engineering tools, well managed , liverage to use knowledge, experience ."
bad,"The group I worked with were good people. No real cohesiveness with senior management at the division I worked at. I was thrown under the bus by my manager. Management speaks nice to everyone's faces, but behind the scenes, they have their own plan - and that plan is not shared with subordinates."
bad,The work was easy for the pay. Schedules were not desirable. Extremely long wait to be hired on from temp agency and ended up not being worth the time and effort put into the position.
bad,"Not the best place work environment. my company got acquired by Emerson and in a couple of months we all got laid off. Workwise, I had to stretch every other day."
bad,In my honest did not enjoy my employment at Alliance.  It’s more of a manipulative dictatorship. I would say that the best thing about it was the hrs.
bad,Working at Emerson was very stressful.  There is no one giving good directions.  My first two weeks there was very stressful due to the person that was part of the hiring process told me that he was leaving in two weeks.  This was just before the month end closing.  The system they are using is AS400 not Oracle.  There are so many files to keep track of and everything is manual this would include depreciation and CIP.  They do plan to go to Oracle but you will still be forced to maintain all the current files which is expected.  Working in an environment where you are expected to hit the ground running and you will be on your own.  Hope you are up for the task.
bad,"They were not open to new ideas, and required more than a 60 hour work schedule to keep product flowing.  The product drove the workers and quality of environment suffers.  Additionally, lack of personnel and lack to support current workers causes workers to have to make stuff up to produce parts and quality of product and process suffers"
bad,The management at Emerson is horrendous and very childish. The hardest part of the job is working so hard and presenting new ideas to only be shot down and receive low compensation.
bad,"Once your in, they trap you. Will not let you advance. Jobs are pretty much predetermined before they post them who will get them. Management is horrible. Too much of who you blow, instead of what you know"
bad,Was good work in the beginning then everything started going down hill. Started of getting overtime then went to 40 hours a week then went to not getting nothing but 2-3 days a week after that got laid off. The company is about to go out of business because of the lack of quality.
bad,Facing new challenges and coming up with unique solutions which will be beneficial to our customers and our internal clients on a sustainable long term basis. Meeting CXO level customers and presenting our unique customized solution catering to various needs of our customers.
bad,I would prefere not to persue a job here. Its always 10 hour days and weekends so you will never have time for your family and friends.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,I cant really say much.  It was not a user friendly environment nor were most of the staff easy to talk to or get to know.
bad,Learned a lot about working for public companies.
bad,Good job for those close to retirement.
bad,"The co-workers are nice but the management will stab you in the back. It seemed like the slackers could just skate by but the good, dependable workers got crapped on. The place is clean and climate controlled though. Might be good for an in between job but not long term."
bad,"Él sueldo diario de Maquinado y operador Cnc es bueno; mas no hay oportunidad de crecimiento, es estable, recomendable si no tienes aspiraciones; tiene transporte NO  cuenta con comedor subsidiado;el ahorro es de 3% no dan utilidades solo un bono pequeño, poco tiempo extra,"
bad,"The manager I worked under Bo, was old school. Was very stern and made sure you knew he was in charge the time I worked here I worked with a convict out of prison and couldn't get along with this person therefore explains my short period in staffing. Bo didn't seem to care about it and gave me a badspot"
bad,The schedule was good here. Monday-Friday sometimes on Saturday. The pay was not that good. Management was good sometimes but not always. Was very hot in the summer times and cold in the winters.
bad,"I was told I'd be paid $100 a week to aide in a summer art class with one other high school student per group for ten weeks. I did not receive a break, I was the only high school student assigned to my group and I was paid $80 a week instead of $100. I only worked for four in a half weeks before being told I, as well as the other interns would only work for 5 weeks rather than ten."
bad,"Expects loyalty from all employees but does not show any loyalty to any employee that has a different opinion from management, They also so preference to who they like over who gets the job done."
bad,"The job was easy to learn. Employees would always have safety equipment and gear ready before walking onto the cell units.  Employees load and reload parts to be sent down to packaging. Also, operate the machine controls and change tools when necessary. The staff were disrespectful and play favoritism. I was being harassed, and it took the CEO Manager to help me out after speaking to my Floor Management and HR several times in over 2 weeks. The work environment contained drama and lack of support"
bad,"Destaco por sobre todas las cosas la gente que alli colaboraba con mi unidad de negocios y lo que pude aprender de ellas durante mis años en la empresa. La voluntad para explicar y ayudar al otro, el trabajo en equipo."
bad,The benifits are great . They do not pay you no more for the skills you learn on the job your hired in at a rate and go up the pay skill and once yoir maxed out it doesnt matter what skills you have under your belt...you make the same as everyone else.
bad,"A few apprenticed trained individuals, especially within the Service Department with no knowledge of a University Education but with plenty of experience with Emerson products has turned this technology company into a sham!!  Very two faced and backstabbing culture so you feel scared to say anything to anyone. "
bad,una empresa sin un guia definido y que carecía de una linea definida
bad,"The work environment at Emerson is very toxic. Morale is extremely low and the issues the company has lead to multiple members of management and junior staff to quit in the past few weeks (and months). The positions posted for the Houston office at the time of writing this review are all because of these people quitting due to workplace conditions and not due to growth. The senior management is severly lacking."
bad,Standard corporation with standard benefits and lousy raises that are given blindly across the board. I would not recommend working in the Valve Automation division.
bad,good working environment . can have better job prospects . work culture is professional . value driven . growth for good candidate .
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,"was a temp employee. work was ok, got a long with my co-workers. Management need some work. learned about a new products."
bad,Not the best company to work for. Office politics is very prevalent and the compensation is not up to par with the work load.
bad,"learning how to cook that type of food such stuff shrimp ,cheesy grits and different types of sauces"
bad,The work atmosphere is dictated by revenue heavily. Day to day can be mundane. Growth is few and far between.
bad,Solid advanced control products and some good software.
bad,If your looking for work life balance don't look here. This company is all drama. HR complaints are out of control. They talk a good talk but they don't support it.
bad,"Very fast paced work(sheet metal), manufacturing new products daily."
bad,"Emerson is not the place you want to work if you can't handle favoritism. Although the pay is good and the vacation policy is nice, their attendance policy is strict! Again there is a lot of favoritism with certain people. If you're a good worker, you can have 15 points and still keep your job...no seriously! There is absolutely no room for advancement...NONE! If you do not have a college degree, forget about working in management! If you get hired and they give you an employee handbook?, Toss it out! They make up rules and policies with each day. It changes from day to day! The only nice thing is the pay and the hours! Sorry there is not a third shift for you night owls!     HINT: Key word in this review is FAVORITISM (Good luck if you applied, hey everyone needs a job right!)"
bad,"Gibberish, alternatively jibber, jabber, jibber-jabber, or gobbledygook, is speech that is nonsense. It may include speech sounds that are not actual words, or language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders"
bad,"Not flexible, lot of micro management culture. Benefits are average. Traveling onsi is less. Manufacturing culture at innovation center. Not good if looking long term."
bad,Management is a cluster. Work as a machinist is fairly good in the most part. All tooling is provided along with gauging. The lack of respect from anyone in management is more than degrading.
bad,Good company to working long standing more than 125 years old company. Matrix and multinational organization to work. Good Environment to work with different country people.
bad,"You are just a paycheck to the company. It is how many can you cut from your budget. It does not matter how long you have been with the company. "
bad,"It's an okay place to work. The work/life balance isn't bad, but there's nothing else very special going on. The office is old, and frequently it is too hot/too cold with cockroaches hanging out around the water cooler. The benefits are decent, but the pay seems stingy. My manager said that there is little to no negotiations on pay/raises. Whether that is true, who knows. The raises are based on performance reviews, but they never have clear measurements so it's very hard to exceed expectations to leverage yourself. It's not clear where you stand until the annual review."
bad,"Emerson has significantly changed over the years, significant mis management and focus on oil and gas.  Ultimately I feel their biggest problem is their brand is not strong enough to overcome the many businesses in which they own, its confusing inside and out."
bad,It is union so that helps a lot of people with keeping employment. Starting pay recently increased. Paid holidays off and no sick days. Easy to make 17/ hour after 90 daya
bad,Industrial company that has struggled to transform culturally.  Conceited upper management team that does not value modern methods or technology.  Stuck in the 1990's.  Very engineering focused/driven and traditional.
bad,"Emerson prides itself on innovation and putting the customer first.  If you enjoy creative problem-solving and having your work valued, then Emerson is the place for you."
bad,"Great people to work with from upper management down, friendly and team players. When you get into management you get into heavy politics that will eat up the organization in a long run. Value is not promoted if you are not on a certain ""like"" list."
bad,Not to bad of a company to work for. Hours are not always there to make and job security is not there right now. Was able to travel a good bit. Worked in paper mills and power plants.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,serving customers by taking there orders  and providing them with quick services causing them not to wait long for their food they have ordered
bad,"Average place to work, management and co-workers unfriendly.  Training and standards system..there is none its thrown together."
bad,"If you need a job it is an OK company to work for. The benefits are average. If you are in sales or marketing you will probably have a growth path. If you are in engineering you will be lucky to get a 2% increase annually, good performance or bad everyone gets the same %. I have been here 10 years and the only announced promotion in engineering was after the EE notified them he had another offer. The EE left anyway because recognized that is the Emerson game and he would not see another promotion."
bad,"Mein Praktikum war über :"
bad,"Took this job to allow me to go to school during the day.  Typical production work in an ISO 9001 environment.  Do the job, don't think about how to do it better, established procedures won't allow it."
bad,"Didnt work here long enough to get a good enough understanding of how the company was and whether it had good benefits, salary etc. However in the one week we worked regular hours which was easy enough to understand"
bad,"Leugens verteld bij afspraak."
bad,"Emerson used to buy other companies, so big challenge was to help integrate different cultures. Also, this brings a big learning opportunity regarding all HR subsistems."
bad,"The typical day at work started out with meetings or meetings you would set up with customers, PMs, or engineers on your own. The Emerson management was bigger on having someone else coming up with ideas and company business strategies rather than determining and implement strategies with instructions, or training programs to have a solid base to begin work with. "
bad,"I would not recommend Emerson to a single person that I consider a friend. There's very little structure and management is disgrace. They openly show favoritism and managers are placed in leadership roles with no idea of what they are doing. The entire management team, form the service centers, should be replaced completely."
bad,Le travail en usine n'est pas évident à vivre car très contraignant.
bad,"busy,fast pace and they pay attention to the environment and work safety."
bad,"A typical day at work ranged between eight to sometimes fourteen hours a day. I worked on process control valves for the oil industry. I learned what I could from other seasoned temporary contractors when they were employed with the company. I spent most of my time picking up and delivering valves to local oil plants in the Los "
bad,"Keep quiet, to yourself, keep your opinions to yourself and be careful because anything you say, or even infer will get you terminated or at least picked on. A lot crammed into a small place. A lot of automation showing up, and they have plants gearing up in China, Singapore that will start taking jobs as the U.S. continues to slow"
bad,I would work 8 to 9 hours making valves for heat pumps.I would braze the valves then put the charge in the bulb.We would hard the people I worked with were friends.
bad,"Normal working day: turning on machine, cycle warmup,  do a setup and run cycle... The work isn't as bad but if having management come out every other hour makes it more stressful and uncomfortable."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
bad,never worked for this company im not sure why indeed is asking me to post some review here which is a bit off maybe its an automated system where in users need to post more review about the companies they worked for
bad,always was first one there.  Treated very bad. They tried and did get me fired.  I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.  Run.  They watch you
bad,"Has closed the plant here"
bad,"Could be a good place to work if the Management was more team oriented. Minimal yearly raises, minimal training, minimal rewards. Promotions don't necessarily come with a raise and if there is a raise, it is minimal. Management shows lack of vision or guidance."
bad,"The job is great. However, I would say the only stressful part is that you have to constantly worry about being laid off. And this process happens twice a year."
bad,"Good benefits"
bad,"Dirty, usually too hot environment. Unsafe and dismal. Only 20 minutes for lunch, barely time to eat, bathroom, and don't be a minute late getting back to your station. Overtime was required almost every weekend, and holiday. Forget about family time...by the time you get home, you're too exhausted to bother doing much except showering and going to bed! I finally left, got tired of feeling like a caged hamster on a wheel."
bad,"I learned so much on actuators and how they are use,the components. The co-workers were amazing, hard working people who taught me a lot! This job required organization & great work ethic which was why I loved it so much. Unfortunately the company is going through a merger and the managment is not there because of it."
bad,"-Typical big business co"
bad,Not recommended to work there. It was very non relaxed and the majority of coworkers were rude and quite lazy. They refused to get along and work as a team.
bad,"All in all CT's was a half decent job with a lot of nice and interesting people. They were very strict on absence and do not make people permament as much as they should. You keep your job based and turning up everyday and doing everything that is asked of you, and is not based on how hard you work. The pay is okay, but does do justice on the skill set of employees."
bad,"Had the highest expectation to retire from this company. Went in early. Worked as hard as I could. Volunteered to do others work to help. Kept a positive attitude."
bad,"The upper Management is not trust worthy, and if you aren't in the ""good ol boy network"" you will pretty much be looked down upon. They make up performance issues that you are not told about."
bad,Work was fast paced and sometimes stressful depending on which department you were working in. We were kept in the dark a lot about what was really going on with the company.
bad,"Nasty,dirty,hard work,not enough pay,sometimes to hot to work,management needs to upgrade safety requirements in all departments."
bad,"People skills are needed for human resources and this company's human resource manager stinks!"
bad,"El ambiente laboral es algo pezado, el departamento de recursos humanos es algo cuadrado se encuentran mu cerrados ante las posibilidades de negociacion, el apoyo de las gerencias es muy poco asia el personal, la toma de decisiones es algo frustrante para el personal que se encuentra involucrado, ya queles da uno la solucion y no es tomada en cuenta,"
bad,"A day at closetmaid was generally easy it started off with a meeting on the work that was needed finished and the quota we need meet at the end of the week. management was very informative with any information we needed. I learned how to operate a banding and bore machine, and also the enviroment of working with many people at once."
good,Me brindó la posibilidad de desarrollarme en el área de Compliance
good,"Emerson acquired Avocent, the company i went to work for. there i was subjected to poor treatment by mgmt. and low compensation and poor quality of life. i left before emerson acquired Avocent, so i cannot speak to emerson proper, i can only hope that they made sweeping changes to the culture."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Empresa sem políticas claras e com pouco incentivo aos colaboradores.
good,"Most of the time you work overtime. its a typical days work, you have your good days and bad. we make the wood parts. from cutting, drilling and packing them."
good,falta de planeacion para crecimiento evolutivo de la empresa
good,"Hace unos años tenía un buen ambiente básicamente por la gente que trabajaba ahí. Luego implementaron políticas de reducción de personal que hizo que sea complicado desarrollar labor diaria de forma normal, los grandes iconos o fueron despedidos o hechados."
good,"Constantly reminding of competitors, always considers rate of parts made and will induce more and more overtime but no repayment for vacation hours for extra hours worked in overtime."
good,No work/life balance. Worked 6 day weeks for 6 months and counting. Corporate direction is completely lacking and they are not in tune with what the facilities go through on a daily basis.
good,"College, and degrees mean nothing in this place. It's a back rubbing, pick your friends wisely place. I learned a lot about the lean system, how manufacturing is not supposed to be ran etc. The upper management team has no clue what they're doing and running Grantsville Closetmaid into the ground. The supervisor staff is very friendly with only two guys that honestly know more than anyone else in the front office. I do not recommend working there if you're looking to advance. If you're looking to glide by then this is the place for you."
good,"Emerson has a culture of non seeing contractor as a member of the team. Example. Team building parking lot events contractors not invited in company email. T-shirts given out the day before left out. Project team building meetings left out. Christmas Party left out. Food in break room left out. It goes on and on. The people you work with my let you know whats going on. But I wont just show up to event uninvited."
good,"Answering multi phone lines, scheduling, helping clients with pet care needs. There is something new to learn everyday. Learning from the clients and new things that come out to help pets. The hardest part of the job is when we have to put pets down especially when it's clients that we are really close to."
good,"I want a new job, This place IS full of a buck of old fogies who think they know every thing, Its a revolving door of management"
good,"I worked many late hours, skipped plenty of lunches and breaks due to an extremely heavy work load. I felt like I dedicated a lot of myself to the company with little to no return."
good,"Necesita mejorar la cultura laboral, quisiera omitir mi opinión personal con respecto a mi experiencia de trabajo en esta compañia"
good,in the 5 years i worked for emerson i went from always willing to help and wanting to learn new things to advance to a quiet self oriented person that didn't help anyone or want to learn anything new.
good,Poor management and unwelcoming culture. Lack of diversity. Little to no opportunities for advancement. Training could use improvement. Very cut-throat in my department. People fired for personal reasons.
good,"Good But Job Security is the issue.  Management mood will change frequently and employees will be changed based on the mood.  Employees feelings/ Family/status will be buried under money power."
good,What I learned working there is how to read blue prints and put it to use. I also learned to build power generators. I picked skills like metal painting and use of different power tools and i learned house operate lasers and press brakes. I also learned leadership skills and would lead and help keep people on task.
good,"Alot of opportunity to learn if you are new to the field a lot of good training."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Management could definitely be improved. Quickly tap out as far as promotions and advancement. Performance is a criteria for advancement, believe it or not!"
good,Don't work here. They will work you an ungodly amount of hours and just discard you when they are ready to send the job to Mexico!
good,A good work environment and good hours. Biggest problem is willing to leave a person a temp indefinitely with no hope of ever being hired into Emerson. The entire workforce is divided 50/50 in most every department into 20+ year employees and temps that are considered immediately replaceable with no notice although doing jobs equal to or just as essential to the success of company.
good,"It is assembly work, long days, extreme amounts of overtime then laid off for months. My Team leader and FST are awesome, and co-workers are hard working. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when one of my co-worker has a birthday I get them a cake, balloon, and a card from everyone, even though I am the one paying for it for that day they feel special because they think everyone thought of them. As it is long hours and hard work you spend more time with them than with your own families, so there has to be a sense of a family in the workplace."
good,"Good company to work for, pay is alright, not a fan of some of the practices they have going on there. I've tried to get a few of them changed with no avail"
good,they are taking a lot away from us and being more about them. This company used to put us first but now it is all about numbers. They are getting rid of all of the high paying jobs and forcing people to do more work for less pay.
good,"No advancement unless you know the hiring team regardless of knowledge. You interview with a panel, HR, and immediate sypervisor for up to 3 hrs.  They make a lot of promises they dont keep. Got hurt on the job and was denied medical attention."
good,Started out great then they started cutting out benefits while marking record profits only to add more machines cut out more of the higher paying jobs and build a new corporate office. The work was not bad but the management was so so. Lots of hours including mandatory Saturdays which you could find out about as late as before the end of the shift Wednesday. Pay was good overall wasn’t too bad could have been better but well above what other jobs in the area were paying.
good,Company is very open and laid back but the people are not motivated. Benefits need to be more comprehensive as well as the pay. Work life balance is great.
good,Il est difficile de garder sa motivation dans une entreprise qui n’as pas une politique de faire évoluer ces employers et cela ce récent dans l’ambiance générale de l’entreprise et créai une lassitude du travail.
good,"Benefícios e salários pagos em dia. Estrutura física da empresa grande e que dá bastante conforto para o funcionário poder executar suas atividades."
good,Family owned business was bought out by a bigger conglomerate. Management didn't have a clue about this business and tried to grow too fast. Not sure where they are today.
good,decent job for the money but the supervisors and management made the job too complicated at times. I was able to move up in the company but it depends on which department you worked in. Lots of overtime
good,"•	Periodically reviewed status of projects; measured results of projects vs. goals, budgets and time schedule. Made necessary revisions as required to obtain timely and maximum results for resources expended."
good,We work in a climate controlled warehouse and have comfortable chairs to sit in during our breaks and lunch time. pay is on the lower end of the competitive compensation scale but having overtime helps offset the lower income. I have been working as a temp for this company for 10 months now. There seems to be no date in sight as to when they will hire me on as a full time employee despite all my hard work and resulting praise. I am as loyal as they come so i regret saying that i am looking for something secure. atmosphere created by coworkers is fun and keeps the days from getting stale. Management is good. I would say that management is great but there seems to be a lack of experience and ability to lead in the current management
good,"I worked for a business unit of Emerson Electric Co. for about 3.5 years.  The corporate staff was extremely friendly and helpful during the early stages after our company was acquired.  I met and worked under an individual who turned out to be the best boss I've ever had.  There were definitely some growing pains experienced due to the acquisition, but overall, it was OK."
good,Lots of stress and poor leadership. If you are not an engineer then you have no say in anything that is happening. The culture only respects engineers.
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Very demanding with very little positive feedback and appreciation for achievement.  Also very little compensation for the amount of overtime required to meet expectations.  General work day is 10 to 12 hours with weekend work.  No compensation until 50 hours worked in a week.  Also very few opportunities for promotions.
good,"Major appliances were the company's core product, so there was much risk in venturing into automotive. Management thought hiring one excellent / experienced Launch Manager would solve all the problems, but even with my exceptional work ethic and a lot of efficiently worked extra hours, the company lacked support."
good,"Learned to work across different domains."
good,"Used to be a great place to work, its more politics and a lot of red tape. But it is a job with no chance to advance. Seniority means nothing here."
good,"While the enviroment and people were great, the equipment was very outdated and did not provide the opportunity for associates to be sucessful.  Our schedules were everchanging which created somewhat of a moving target.  These constant changes made communications with associates on the floor difficult.  What we schedule today, will enevitably change tomorrow.  This created a sense of distrust in managment, which was out of our control.  This was the most diffucult part of the job.  The associates want to be successful, but we simply didn't have what we needed to do so."
good,It was a slow paced line job that didn't suit my ability's.  Overall a decent job but I didn't like working on a line day in and day out.
good,This role was a Maternity Contract so a short term role. This role was originally a Sales Admin role that was located out with the Sales Reps. They decided to move me out the front. Unfortunately this then isolated me from the team not a very productive solution. So I was by myself a lot with no company.
good,"Ho imparato la metodologia di lavoro del sistema tedesco, l'azienda non era ben gestita dal Direttore Commerciale."
good,Overall my satisfaction with the company is fine however they have experienced little progressive movement.
good,"Good company, been around for a long time.  Pay is way too low for the experience.  Management has favorites and if you arent one, you need to just leave. It doesnt matter how hard you work, if they dont like you, you have to go."
good,Best Learning curve of my career. I was the first lone legal person. The business in Malaysia needed more arms and legs. I managed upstream and downstream contracts and ventures. It was learning to manage it all. But O&G is a tough industry to break in for a legal person but if you can experience and learn from it. It is very enriching and satisfying.
good,"Pretty good pay for the area, but management micromanages everything and are only concerned with the upfront dollar.  Management also lies to the employees.  They play favorites, too.  Employees are expendable.  Very high turnover rate.  It is a clean shop.  And they are very safety focused, safety is almost as important as the upfront dollar."
good,Better places to work for.  I would not recommend.  Once you reach to pay no room for advancent or further opportunity for better pay.  Kinda just get stuck there after a while.
good,My many years of experience working here has been an up and down roller coaster. For the most part I enjoyed my job. Management sometimes would take you for granted and make you feel unappreciated. When employees called off they were rarely replaced making it stressful to pick up their duties as well as your own.
good,"Buena empresa en el ramo metal mecanico, practica al 100 por ciento en campo laboral."
good,Too large of a company for me. Felt job scope was too narrow. job consisted of preparing sales training materials and presenting to sales. Projects were very long with development times that lasted several years.
good,"The company is an amalgam  of conglomerations. Failure to fully integrate acquisitions led to an organization rife with inefficiencies. This rampant redundancy necessitated overly complex processes to accomplish even the simplest task. Large capital investments in improperly scaled systems further exacerbated the problem. Without a consistent, discernible vision, the company is devoid of any competitive agility."
good,"Was once a great organization however leadership (on all levels) has changed and the culture no longer puts the customer or employee in front of the bottom dollar. Ultimately the focus is in the stockholders and because of that, the work environment is stressful with little leadership."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"The management are not very good and there is no opportunity for career progression. Pay is low for the amount of work you are required to do. Only pro is that you are not required to work weekends or holidays,"
good,As much as that sound wrong. it was great when peace broke out. but being a defense contractor they did not have anything to fall back on at the time.
good,I operated a CNC machine. Very difficult machine to learn and operate. Had to write programs for it and operate the programs for the machine. I am not a machine programmer. Management was not the greatest people to work for.  I felt they really didnt want to teach on how to write programs and download into machine. Hardest part of my job was not to produce scrap. The most enjoyable part was leaving at 2:30.
good,"Management willfully ignores anything that will threaten their cushy standing in leadership.  They will therefore expel any challengers to their narratives, then hire yes-men to follow direct orders without any push-back."
good,I work in the scroll machining department machining scroll compressors for air conditioning units. I am willing to work any shift.
good,"No Comment."
good,this company expects that you will make them your life. they mandate overtime all the time and expect that you will just drop everything else in your life to work.... most of the people there are great though
good,many wonderful people there passionate about their work.. They make working there a pleasure. I have learned much about the corporation and how to work in a plant setting.
good,"Its a ok place to work, management dosent really know what they are doing. work often gets very slow, this is the perfect job for some one who is entry level."
good,Beaucoup d'autonomie et une vraie émulation qui ont renforcé mes compétences managériales et stratégiques pour pouvoir me lancer dans des missions plus complexes et avec un plus haut degré de responsabilité.
good,"Wielding parts together for the assembly line was fun but also boring doing the same thing ever day. Not willing to set a schedule for sifts at the time I was employed was wrong, I believe. "
good,"worked well with others, stayed busy, fast paced, move quickly to get parts out"
good,"Good salary and benefits, job insecurity, lack of knowledgeable people in key positions, commuting distance, lack of team spirit, competitive teams, no career progression."
good,"Working for this company was an enjoyable experience .the typical day consisted of round up materials, communication with tam members and panel assembly."
good,Culture of the organization has changed the last 10 years and accelerated recently with leaders that did not come from inside the business and push by activist investors.
good,"Empresa muito boa, bons amigos, ambiente stressante"
good,"If you need employment right away than this is the place, but as far as retiring from here, I woudn't recommend it, The people are fun to work with, but when it comes to management or HR looking out for you well that wont happen. You can be the best worker there and at the end of the day they will treat you just the same as if you were the worst worker there."
good,"A good company with a good name, there are problems with management, the possibility of changing locations and working profile, the problem with finding new contracts, uncertainty about the future"
good,"I do not prefer to give bad reviews however, let's just say that Emerson was not the problem.  Closetmaid was the issue and it's upper brass and planning or lack their of departments."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Emerson is the kind of place that you will either love or hate working there. The hours and rate of pay are great! The people you work with become like your second family.
good,"A very demanding position with high profile projects.  Only home about a total of 45 days per year.  did an excellent job with customers, younger engineers, Project Management."
good,they are about getting the parts out. they don't care bout how your body hurts ( not really). they push you to your limit and push for more. they will scare you when it comes to working at a factory .
good,"Emerson culture is a focused, secure and growing company. When I started I was amazed at  the longevity of its employees.  The benefits are average . They expect a lot from their employees with average to low pay."
good,"It was stressful job, had to work from 5:30 am and sometimes working over time was mandatory during weekend. Manager was very strict, he counted 10 sec as late."
good,"Emerson rosemount is one of the cleanest place I've worked in. They enphasize safety a lot! My only concern is the supervisors they bring in are straight garbage. Seems like they don't even care about the job, but just to get their feets in. Also 2nd shift management is poorly manage. They just don't want to hire more people but only depends on their to go guys to break their back by doing everything. If you want good vacations, this is not your place to go to. Although retirement benefits are excellent. All I can say now is all the hard and good workers are almost gone. Good people don't leave a good job. Blame it on all the favoritetism going on, and poor people management including bad supervisors."
good,"Job and culture are different. Also, before hiring me, i informed them, that I do't have experience with Refrigeration system or unit."
good,Emerson acquired Avocent shortly before I left.I left the company to take a more appealing role with CDW. Overall there were good people at Avocent however management was littered with appointees and politics played a big role in advancement...not merit.
good,"It's an old company. Many employees have been here 20+ years. It's hard to make change. Things move slow. "
good,Worked on problem solving which goes by really fast. Worked on Many interesting tasks. Going home at the end of the day was the fun part for me. Management needs to improve
good,"I was a contract tech writer for three years, even though for the last 18 months, I was the only TW in the building. I started on a 6-month contract that kept getting extended, even though I never signed another contract."
good,"Great place to start your career, but there is no planning for future opportunities. Compensation is below industry average. Enjoyed different stints with different functions."
good,"le management laisse a désirer."
good,"Emerson as a whole company is a solid organization with good leadership and great development programs for the employees. The only criticism I have is in large organizations like Emerson smaller company's like the one I worked for in East Granby, CT was under the radar and not performing to Emerson's high standards."
good,"Work closely with all business units to support Fisher North America and global business systems and applications.  "
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,assembly line production plant the hardest part of this job was not letting the rest of your team down by getting behind.
good,"The most part in my everyday routine in office is the chance to work with the best people especially in IT industry. Im learning a lot from them and i apply it so well. I was able to create automated reports and users were able to appreciate it. See, the feeling of being appreciated and welcomed to their world is something that is of value and money cant equal that."
good,"Geen dag is het zelfde, eerst begin je s morgens bij inkomende goederen."
good,Management follows procedures and policies but lacks essential critical thinks and decision making skills
good,"Working on marketing collateral, from conceptualizing, designing to creation, publishing and distribution. As I went through these exercise, thoughts to simplify to get message across to the audience also broadened my knowledge on the products and systems."
good,No growth opportunities.
good,Lifting 20-50 lbs
good,8-12 hr workdays
good,"start the day by getting job from forman, will be a repair or fab job. Ihave learned to weld with GTAW,SMAW,SAW, and GMAW. Management could be better,lot of favortism,miss communication and ability to get stuff rolling,lots of paper work onproducts. Co workers are great. Its hard to just go in and do your job. Best part of the job is when they leave you alone and i drop my hood."
good,a typical day involves answering tech question when not on a service call or in house hardest part of the job is the fact that i am gone out of town most of the time and it used to be the best part of the job traveling all over but now its all i do and have no time for family
good,Was a fast pace enjoyable job. Communication was great..  would have loved to stay on longer. My contract was up. Was able to work all 3 shifts.. enjoyed the continental the most as it allowed more time with my young babies at the time during the week.
good,Work is ok. its nice if they can have good salary structure. also they dont have any promotion for new person for almost 4-5 years. you need to work hard with old school style as lots of personal are on that mentality.
good,"The work at ClosetMaid (owned by Emerson) demands high-level efficiency and hard work when running smoothly. Although the work is simple, it is highly tiring and uninteresting. The hardest part of the job is offloading boxes while simultaneously doing paperwork on the outgoing pallets."
good,"Too many clicks too much politics. Middle management plays games and has their favorites, and most of the time has no idea what the department really doe.  If your up line doesn't know your job then how are they to mange a team and the projects at hand?"
good,"I work weekend shift which is 7:30 AM to 8 PM. I learn how to be a transmitter builder.the wok culture are scan and number based,because at end of the day they need from you hall group a to achieve a goal."
good,"Fast paced work environment.  As a supervisor one must multitask to get all tasks tied to the position done each week. Span of supervision and number of hours one must work to keep up equates to a low hourly wage. Large company culture is sterile, so at work relationships are strictly professional and always politically correct."
good,"periodically mandatory overtime 5-6 days a week, up to 53 hours a week including Saturdays. No paid lunches. Mandatory union participation which the union is not very cooperative with its members."
good,"Pay and benefits should be better, though this is true of a lot of companies in the area.  Wasn't very fond of the management decisions made during my employment, especially regarding their management of time.  Overall, however, it was a friendly working environment with safe and clean conditions."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Poor management resulted in a difficult and stressful environment.  The benefits and compensation were fine for the area but unwilling to compete compensation wise with USA parkway jobs.
good,Frequent restructuring.  No advancement opportunities.  Casual but fastpaced work environment.  Lots of reporting requirements and schedules to fill out monthly.
good,"The employees of Emerson are great to work with.  If you are in the right career path, you will do well with Emerson.  Benefits are good.  Paid days off are not generous."
good,"It was a very good job, great benefits, great hours. The company is growing, however, they closed a plant down and line transferred  to two different countries for cheaper labor."
good,"This is the only place that I've been told I work too fast. One minute, they're telling me I did a good job, and then turn around and tell me I'm doing it all wrong. It's hard to plan short-term. They will tell you on Wednesday if Saturday/Sunday is mandatory."
good,"Contract Temp employees don't participate in much of the company's communications, meetings, or receive compensation nor bonuses for production within the department."
good,"In terms of benefits for the employees, I must say, Emerson is quite good on it. However, with too much or job overloaded, sometimes you will think that you're not well compensated. But, regardless how much they pay me, that doesn't matter, since I love the job, what I'm doing and I gained peers that are very supportive and helpful. Also, I gained so much knowledge not just in one sort of field or task."
good,The daily work load is high. This is across all internal departments. This level of expectation is stressful but can also be rewarding. Career opportunities have been low in recent years despite growth targets.
good,"The people and laid back work environment are large bonuses.  Majority of engineering efforts are same as but different, to previous programs.  Some issues with opportunities for advancement."
good,Emerson offers a wide variety of career opportunities. Workload is a bit of a stretch but it gives us opportunities to learn the different areas of business that we can use for career advancement in the future.
good,"This job requires a lot of hard physical work. Although I really enjoyed the atmosphere, I personally didn't feel the pay compensated for how physically draining it is."
good,"A lot of hours, 50-70 hour weeks."
good,"good supervision, average benefits, chances for advancement, only reason i left was fear of lay-off and i had a very young family. looking back should of stayed ."
good,Colegas con predisposición al cambio. HC con poco expertise y con muchas oportunidades de mejora.
good,"personnel agréable"
good,"Great company to work for. Advancements from within. Great, supportive management team.  Alot of cross training and the ability to learn and grow personally."
good,"The items be place on the packer station to be pack. Once the packer receive the customer items. The packer have to make a box that fit all the customer orders in. Then place a protection shield to keep the customer items in place and safe in the box."
good,Learned a lot of Electronics-Mechanical advance technologies and development new fixture to accommodate  new product for testing and manufacture capabilities. The most enjoyable was new idea contributions.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Good Working environment,learned  lot of management skill with Smart working style, Enjoy with the team Co members to achieve the  target within time frame."
good,"In my department there is no management and the employees are expected to pick up the slack. There is very little capital invested into the department so we have the students learn on computers that are 10 years old. Moral here is low. Our motto: ""Don't do it right. Just do it."
good,"Fast paced work days. Held meetings with regards to work-load, scrap/rework reduction."
good,Multinationale avec un management à l'américaine. Nombreuses acquisitions d'entreprises mais difficultés à intégrer et à transmettre la culture d'entreprise aux nouveaux venus
good,"Clima bom para trabalhar"
good,"Fantastic people work at Emerson.  Unfortunately, the culture overall is very financially driven with little focus paid to building an engaging organization.  Solid product lines, and decent reputation in the market.  Very slow to adapt and change to market forces (especially in employment).  Solid 9-5 company.  Not ideal for someone who enjoys low bureaucracy and change."
good,"Okay place to work, too large of a company for anyone to know your worth.You have to verify monthly that you're an employer here."
good,"Good clean air condition and heat. Men and women worked hard at making electrical motors, 8 hours shift most weekends off."
good,"One can earn a decent salary from this job but at the expense of damage to your body due to the punishing hours and changes in shifts i.e. from morning shift to evening shift  in a span of a month. "
good,"Its your typical assembly work but more involved with using tools and machines depending on your area. I met a lot of good people there, mostly coworkers, but I never liked anyone from management. Supervisors had a do as I say not as I do mentality and only the really good ones ever helped you at all. They only cared about you when your area was getting good numbers every day and wouldn't think twice about firing you for poor performance. I saw that happen to a lot of good people often times because of poor training. The hardest part had to be standing all day and waking up at 3 am just to make it to the shift start at 4:30 am, but that was just morning shift. Some of the people would do anything to get you in trouble and there was too much drama at times. I don't miss it one bit."
good,Company is good but some time due to recission there will be pressure to reduce headcout without prior notice. Overall salary wise is good company but trnasfarable.
good,"Day to day work is okay, and I get to learn new things everyday. My co-workers are fun to be with."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting associates in other locations and our clients.
good,"Helpdesk functie, weinig eigen inbreng verwacht, voor mij weinig uitdaging. Meer loggen van calls, ik coördineer en plan goed, dit miste ik in het werk. Te weinig klantencontacten en regelfunctie. Verder is het goed georganiseerd bedrijf"
good,I liked the people over whom I supervised but I had too many departments to oversee and it was a extremely stressful.  I had the entire weekend crew.
good,checking for items for shipping filling orders for kanban checking emails handling all shipping procedures
good,The PMO group I worked with was a good group.  Management was supportive and Work was hard but good.  Great people to work with.
good,It's ok not too bad. long hours the pay is fine. ok benefits and great co-workers but the management could be better.
good,"This was a good job for learning about factory work.  While I was there for 6 years, they eventually closed their doors and moved operations elsewhere."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Good place to work until the company was acquired. After the acquisition, it became a difficult environment to work in. The private equity group acquired Avocent then closed the Seattle office."
good,Gigantic corporation spreading across numerous industries. I was in the Valve Automation group working with Bettis pneumatic and hydraulic actuators. The pay was not competitive for the numerous job requirements that were expected.
good,"Very fast paced and you are over worked. I tried to balance but it has been a challenge. I am a normally objective person, but management has to get better."
good,"Though we manufactured high quality products, our profit margins were too low to support the business. We took a Chance on our own line of TV entertainment centers, but ran out of funding before we made our 1st shipment."
good,3 shift operation 8 hours shifts 50 minute paid breaks can bump once per year if liked by management you may be able to advance low level management is hit or miss
good,"Belongs to an amazing team,"
good,"The most hardest part of job"
good,Emerson sold the company I worked for while I worked for them.  Prior to that there was a noticeable decline in the abilities and competency of the management.
good,"The overall job experience is great. It's really hard work, but it's rewarding work. The only thing I would complain about is the clear favoritism for certain employees. If you're friends with the manager, you're essentially set for life. If not, then expect to be out of the door soon."
good,Ambiente de trabajo agradable pero con mucho Trade Off diario. Colegas dispuestos a cambios y trabajo ambiguo
good,"The work days are wonderful, I learn new things in each department I've been in. As far management it's a couple of things that they have to work on but I will keep that confidential, other than that its a great environment."
good,Fast paced environment. Friendly employees. Benefits are good. Plenty of hours to work. Managers are very helpful and willing to help.
good,"It is indeed very exciting to send and receive emails from our internal and external customers regarding various issues like PO's, shipments, pricing and availability. I learned to be more flexible, patient, considerate and sensitive with all their needs and demands. Emerson is good in general. We can bring our phones on the floor, bring food and eat at our station, can listen to music and talk to colleagues anytime within the shift. hardest part of the job is when your kid gets sick and you need to be away from work but your ""leave"" credits will be deducted. So if you have several kids and they got sick one after the other, then you will be out of VL's. That means, no VL conversion at the end of the fiscal year which could also be a big help financially. But the most enjoyable part is that we had fixed weekends off, which means we have all Saturdays and Sundays to be with the family, go to church, go to parks, eat out or just stay at home and watch movies all day. Also, it is very advantageous to be off off from work during US Holidays especially during Holiday season. We normally do not go to work during Christmas until New Year."
good,"I enjoyed working at Fisher Controls because I was surrounded by individuals that took pride in their work and believed in the company's motto. Hard work was a minimum expectation and, through working hard, I learned a lot of value skills. Creativity is highly encouraged in problem solving."
good,"productive and less  tensed work place.Mgmt is decent"
good,It was a job and had good days and bad.  Some people were great others not so much.  Emerson is a huge company and they didn't always pay well and the their benefits were standard. Nothing special.
good,"productive and fun workplace typical day adjust or replace Keyence and Omron sensor, replace motor or motor controller ac or dc drives ,replace hydraulic lines"
good,"it's a very fast pace work environment, which I like cause I wont get bored. I have the learned the importance of knowing what's going on around you at all times to create a safer work environment. Most of the co workers are pleasant to be around, but I found that a few don't seem to like when new hires come in. They were not very polite and some even talk to you as if your stupid and beneath them. I don't believe that is exercising professional work ethics and it bothered me a lot. The hardest part of the job I would say is taking in others personalities and hang ups and dealing with a very demanding work schedule especially for those who are single parents and have to work around two schedules one for their child care and for the companies schedules. The most enjoyable part for me is knowing I created something and I was part of a team."
good,A typical day at work consist of nothing to much you can't handle but the most hardest time at work is when the machines break down and we have no production.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Generally a fast paced job involving the day to troubleshooting and problem solving. Safety being top priority is a plus. A close group and generally friendly atmosphere.
good,Company provides lot of opportunities for learning. Work culture is not very attractive. Best company for college pass outs.
good,"A empresa tem bom ambiente de trabalho, que e importante, mas nao e tudo. Falta planejamento interno. Chefia respeitosa e bem definida nos manuais de conduta."
good,It was a hot fast paced but it was good place to work. Co workers were very nice to work around. Set/Up operated centerless thrufeed  roll grind.  ran tight tolerance +- .0001. I liked the challenge.
good,fun people to work with depending on the shift you work.Work can get a little overwhelming during peak season and you work plenty of overtime
good,"Assembled products for client. Learned to use various tools (air guns,injection moulders, etc..). Co-workers were enjoyable. Management proved untrustworthy."
good,"Good Company but technical growth is less. Management can not provide good opportunity to employee."
good,I have learned how to receive in purchase orders and create purchase orders.  I issue out tools to the mechanics.  I get along with all my co-workers.  The hardest part is trying to get production to give up machines for pm's.  (preventive maintenance).  The best part of the job is being with a good group of people.
good,"There are so many problems with the management in this company that they loose sight of their and their groups potentials - a complete waste of synergy! Being a manufacturing environment, there leadership with operations experience is almost non-existant and is run by those with only sales experience - another miss of the bullseye."
good,Very culturally diverse and pleasant work atmosphere. I learned a lot out of my peers and supervisors. Tons of diversity in production.
good,"change is the main constant is current work environment."
good,"Lost status since few years"
good,Start at 5 am or 7 am. go to packline and pack boxes. mandatory overtime.
good,Late staying at office after office hour. less time for personal life. Career growth opportunity is less.
good,continous sroucing program for product cost down. Persue product transfers to meet lauch dead lines.
good,Upper management isn't very reliable. Coworkers and supervisors were great but the pay was lower than companies around us doing the same job.
good,Work culture is really good for people who like to balance work & personal life..
good,"Doing Work is not typical."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,When the work is there it is great but a lot of the time different departments are not on the same page with inventory issues so one single item will prevent an entire days worth of work.  Lot's of standing around and chit chatting with no supervision.
good,"The typical day as business administrator for all four offices involved daily communication with a wonderful Team in our Southeast Region - operations and sales staff working together to achieve goals for the region. My responsibilities involved invoicing customers, approving accounts payable invoices, assisting accounts receivables with invoice disputes, issuing purchase orders to vendors/suppliers and corresponding with customers and vendors to keep communication channels open.  I learned sales and operations can work together if we are all on the same page when we start our mission.  The hardest part of the position was closing at the end of each month for all four offices.  We were on a strict deadline with no room for error which meant long, hard hours the last few days each month.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with exceptional team members - sales and operations.  I had the pleasure of working with some of the best engineers I have worked with in the 17 years in this field, not only because of their knowledge of electrical engineering but their personalities brought a family feel to the Atlanta office where I was based. They were a great bunch to work with and I was proud to be a part of the Team."
good,"Los productos que se comercializan son de tecnología actual."
good,"During the summer months contract employee's are required to part a quarter mile away at a public bus garage and await a bus on site. The typical day is broken down into three rotations so everyone gets an opportunity to sit down at some positions and stand at others. My line produced Pressure transmitters, however when I asked what they are used for and in, the majority of my co-workers were not sure. A large buyer however are oil rigs as our product is used to measure pressure on the pipelines. I disliked that the systems in place for ordering parts required for our job, as it left us running out of components required to do our job on a daily basis, I did enjoy however that there was enough variety of product that we could set these parts aside and continue working."
good,"Easy work week, relaxed. Does not pay well however. Co-workers are fine nothing to bad."
good,It's a five day working organization. So after 5 days of hectic schedules & meetings get some good time for my personal things. It's a small company with typical Indian working culture & is revolving aroung few senior people.
good,"It's a union company, and I was low on the list. But I knew how to drive a forklift, but the hole time I was doing that job all I heard was I did not have the time in for that. I asked if any of them wanted to do it, the anser was no so the problem kept going until thay drummed up someone to do it. Then I was given a line job putting parts on a assembly line."
good,"I've only been here for 7 days you only see the good first. I feels like a good company to work for, everyone is nice an helpful. Will give an update a month from now"
good,They have a trade off system to help prevent burn out and fatigue so unlike most factories you're not doing the same job all day every day although that makes it difficult to get really good at your job.
good,Its a cool place to work but is also very competitive. Hard to meet production everyday simply because of the competitiveness but its not a bad place to work. It just takes forever to become full time.
good,I don't feel comfortable posting anonymous comments and don't have much to say. I don't want to put biases out there. People need to find out for themselves.
good,"it was ok but pay was low and getting lower.. no chance at all to advance."
good,Emerson is erg op Amerikaanse leest gestoeld. Dit komt niet altijd overeen met de in Nederland geldende gewoonten
good,The only company that I have worked that has planned training for all employees regardless of position or level. Performance based and no need to be in the office all the time.
good,Emerson runs lean which means everyone works very hard and often takes work home with them (salary employees).  Career advancement rests solely on the shoulders of the employee.  Good people work at this company but stress is high and rewards are low.  Salaries are not on par with other oil and gas companies. They evaluate their salary structure based on manufacturers.  Raises are not typically high and benefits are average.
good,"This was actually a decent place to work, with work that made the day go by pretty fast. Worked with a lot of nice people, most of which had worked there for 15+ years, which goes a long way to saying a lot about a company. Sadly they moved operations to Mexico to save money"
good,"Emerson is a place that will allow you to grow and become a good technician, aside from micro management this is a good place work.decent enviroment.."
good,"this job was a good place to work, had its pros and cons it also had perks as far as 401k etc. I would recommend working here as well it do give their employees chances to grow within the company"
good,The hardest part of the job was getting management to make changes.  The best part of the job was the people that I work with.  The management team had very little turn over and advancement was almost non existent.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Wipro was a great place to work. "
good,"The company had the interesting work place, as a production operator it was a previledge to about their business process."
good,"this is an ok place to work if you can make it through the first couple of years layoffs. The work is fast paced, and heavy at times. You can bid out on jobs if you have been there long enough."
good,Only worked at Emerson for a short period in way of acquisition. they acquired Avocent whom owned LANDESK at the time. I could really give a great point of reference either way for Emerson.
good,"the company is good for work but it doesn't pay much, and doesn't take care of injured workers, and needs safety improvement."
good,"Empresa muito agradável para se trabalhar. Possui algumas falhas de comunicação, mas nada fora do padrão."
good,"Weekly pay for salary is great. OT for salary available. Very diverse climate. Disconnect between off shift and 1st shift staff management at times, but overall decent place to work."
good,The people I worked with were fun to work with! We would always find a way to keep our energy moving. There were a lot of different jobs that I took part in.
good,Huge manufacturing company that used to have a family and small town feel.
good,"I do not know if company exist in Independence Kansas"
good,"I built pistons.  It was a fast paced job.  It got boring as the night went on, but the pay was decent, and the benefits were good.  For rhe most paet the company was fair to work for."
good,"The workspace is an office sandwiched between two large warehouse/factory areas. While the offices are nice, the floor is loud and filled with difficult people."
good,I believe they tend to slightly  micromanage their employees. which is not good as the employees feel uncomfortable and unmotivated. Some employees even feel unwanted.
good,"The team is very productive and awesome to work with. Of course there's bad apple everywhere but despite it, you will enjoy working there, only thing is that it needs to have better benefits."
good,Its a good platform for trainees who can gain knowledge in working.Free place to work.Environmentaly friendly place .But there is no chance for fresher's to work as an permanent.
good,Empresa estable pero que le falta ofrecer mas beneficios a los trabajadores.
good,"Totalmente increíble un nuevo sistema de producción, pero en si para ascender a un puesto o la atención al operador no es bueno."
good,"The reason I started working at Emerson was to get more money being paid. I liked it at first, but then things started to go downhill, like too much overtime and not having trustful HR or supervisors. They'll only be there for you if you're serious about staying."
good,"Since the beginning of working at this company there has been a high volume of employee turnover due to lack of employees skills, supervision and management."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Great place to learn about the controls industry in petrochemical, power and water controls, valves, etc. Leader in the controls industry who solves the most challenging issues to the customers."
good,The job scheduling was very tight with little time for extension or planning.
good,My shift started at 3pm and ended 11pm. I received stock daily and I would add it to store inventory. I helped maintenance find machine parts in stock for repairs. I enjoyed my coworkers the most. Good people that the day go faster.
good,"Travel was required to very dangerous areas of Mexico where we were required to cross the boarder each day, sometimes taking up to 4 hours. No hazard pay was provided. My manager didn't know how to manage people other than electrical engineers."
good,I enjoyed working at emerson. I was out their 9 years before I left. My time out there was every wourthwhile. I learned alot working their. I was a certified brazer. I went from brazing in the shell area to brazing on the slate line. I really enjoyed the people and the management. I also loved how they appreicated their employees.
good,bons horaires de travail. bon salaire. travail en équipe
good,It was my pleasure working with such talented Sales Reps and with Marketing with programs distribution and market research with targeted customers and contractors.
good,"Insinkerator is owned by Emerson. I believe that this company would be stronger if it had remained alone. It seems that the company is not as good as it was just a short 6 years ago. Overtime is basically eliminated, even for skilled trades that need the extra time to do the job most effectively. Profit sharing has dropped too."
good,"A typical day for me includes interacting with customers, fellow employees, and a management staff, usually hundreds of miles away. The day is enjoyable, unless you need support from your office personnel. Most times they will not answer phone calls, and do not call you back in a timely manner. They 'encourage"" you to make decisions, on your own, but they always disagree with what you do. Our current local management team seems afraid of helping you succeed."
good,Emerson n'était pas mon employeur mais un sous traitant
good,"Nice place to work, old school systems and management.  Unless you have an MBA, you won't move pass middle management. Lots of   bureauracy to deal with."
good,Emerson is an excellent company to work for! The work is very challenging.  However the work life balance and workplace culture are great.  Motivation to leave was bad management.
good,Good work life balance with the drawback of low compensation and poor benefits. Management is starting to change but the inertia is high and may take a long time before the company catches up.
good,"Overall good company to work with."
good,Good company and friendly coworkers and pay was also good. They also had good hours and work was not really difficult. Hours were also reasonable. Overall nice place.
good,The facility was very clean and the higher management was very reasonable and courteous. The staff are friendly and very helpful at points. Not much room to grow though

good,"It is a decent place to work at, but people are lazy and don't try to push themselves to do better they do just enough to get by. It's slow paced, making work very boring."
good,Management has gotten stuck in old ways of conducting business. Difficult for new people to come in and be accepted due to good ole boys way of doing things.
good,Productive place to work and good environment. Good people and lots of work to stay busy. Free lunch on occasion. Very busy work day makes it go by fast.
good,"Have been in Emerson for only a year.  So have not really explore much.  However, Emerson cannot really pay well.  That's one of the reason why i left the company after only 1 year."
good,It was OK but could have been better working conditions. Fellow employees will help you when needed. Safety is of great importance with this company at all times.
good,problem z rozbudową hali brak roboczego okrycia wierzchniego
good,"Work ethic is up to individuals. Most of management does not push too hard. Good for slackers. Work 40 hours per week. Patented some things while working there. Company kept laying off or not hiring new people and got strapped with added responsibility with minimal pay for an engineering role.  Coworkers are the best part. Direct supervisor was nice, but never wanted to stick his neck out too far for us because he had been working with the same people for 20+ years."
good,"I have learned to be more cautious and be keen on details when doing reports most specially for management review. Also, to be professional at all times when dealing with customers."
good,"Management is working to revise the overall market effectiveness corporate portfolio under revise economic conditions, it's a nice place to work but not terribly progressive."

good,Emerson was a great place to work at. Employees have room for advancement. I was able to gain years of  experience working with some wonderful people.
good,Very repetitive summer job for a high school student that didn't allow me to apply academic knowledge. Mainly was just a job to obtain some cash flow to make it through my first year of college.
good,"Une gamme de produits large et intéressante, avec maintien de l'innovation"
good,"Emerson has boldly transformed itself to create value for our customer and shareholders. With our newly energized focus on our two core business platforms - Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions - we can confront the challenges of an increasingly complex and unpredictable marketplace from a position of strength. This allows us to drive both near- and long-term value. And retain our single-trusted-partner status with the process, industrial, commercial and residential industries."
good,"this use to be a place of manufacturing, now is a warehouse. if it wasnt for the ressecion of 2009, i believe this company would still be  in the manufacturing sector"
good,My job was very secure. Hours were 7:00 - 3:30 with optional overtime Monday thru Friday.  There was a big of turnover of employees  so I was constantly training new employees.
good,"Transactional task. Handles and manage e-mails especially in addressing and resolving issues."
good,"Foi meu primeiro emprego, gostei muito de trabalhar."

good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Learned a lot on my own. Very technical position. Close to my house. Not a very clean environment. Not a lot of experience there.
good,"C'est une bonne entreprise mais mal gérée. Les primes, intéressements et participation sont très difficiles à obtenir. Le management n'est pas au rdv d'une aussi grande structure."
good,Great career development and product reliability. Diversified company and great environment. Most challenging  is to meet the monthly goal and communicating with Boss.
good,.Working atmosphere good. CSR good. Employee engagement activitiesgood. Lack professional Apprisal implementation.
good,The job itself and work environment are great.  Upper management demonstrates poor time management skills with little follow through on promises. Poor training. Little room for advancement.  Nearly impossible to attain wage increases.
good,Learned a lot about the manufacturing world but did not enjoy the super early hours for a long term job. I met a lot of different people and it was a good job just not what I want to do with the rest of my life. Not in the field that I would like to pursue but a good company with a top grade facility.
good,Great place to work. I enjoyed learning new things from my co workers. Also enjoyed the different discplines of work we did.
good,"You get to learn a lot about Ball valves, the related standards, different customer specification, various testing methods, calculations etc."
good,"I worked with a team that consisted of ten people. I had to put together the beginning part of an ac unit. After preparing this piece, then I would put through a tester to make sure it is ready for front line to assemble with the other part of the ac unit."
good,"Review bom's ECR, ECN, Research for blue prints and submit to engineering. Create BOM, ECR, and Drawing. Make changes and upgrade revisions based on ECR. This company had no software for blueprints storage. Blueprints were stored in file cabinets which cause lost time in finding prints. Management was ok. Co-workers were not friendly and used profanity on a daily basics. Working with engineers on making decisions on changes."
good,"work environment is good, special care is taken of employee safety, growth opportunities are average.The hardest but the most enjoyable part of the work is innovation."

good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Had been an exciting and enjoyable work environment with great promise, but the business group I was in eliminated operational excellence and business excellence to save expenses."
good,Easy to hangout with the employees. You do multi-tasking. You become more creative in your experience.
good,"There are a lot of job opportunities worldwide.  Only you limit yourself to the possibilities."
good,Good company to work for.  Great experience.  Salary not competitive with the market..
good,"In my current team, we are all senior and didn;t have any org review for the last 6 years, and now that we are in a different platform and with a definite job evaluation we are now adapting to a process that hopefully it would entail us to have a career development."
good,"Work is good. Working in a Warehouse. Download trucks, plant transfer."
good,"I was self sufficient and independently worked at my work station.  I worked my weekly cases with continuous internal and external email/phone communication of my assigned customers.  I was responsible for 20% of our accounts receivable for the major accounts. The hardest part for me was occasionally waiting for timely responses from slower paying customers.  Had to work a little harder at times and think outside the box to reach timely resolutions. I enjoyed these challenges and always worked hard and reached my monthly targets.  Was very successful, organized and detail oriented."
good,"Cresci na empresa ,contribui bastante para o crescimento da mesma."
good,"You had no room for improvement. I was taken from the manufacturing floor and placed in a procurement position with the promise of a title change and a raise. This didn't happen for 6 months, and then I had enough experience to take my skills else where. I did learn about the office setting and how to be a professional with emails, phone calls, and all interactions with the customer. I learned how to address my supervisors in meetings and turn in reports and critical information to assist us in our production build plan."
good,"Fun people, dedicated and hardworking. Few opportunities to advance career. Compensation is below average."
good,Fast paced industiral work place. Staying occupied is always key.

good,"Multiple jobs , Lots of opportunity for advancement. The company moved to Mexico for cheaper labor ."
good,Enjoyed learning new skills and working with people. Worked with international co-workers.
good,It is growing company but the benefit is not good. may be this is because the low margin.
good,"It was hard work, but what made it enjoyable was the co-workers and how everyone worked as a team"
good,When you first start working there it is pleasant. Then you learn of the constant changes of management's rules. Most of the co-workers were friendly but like in every place of business there are some that you cannot get along with! The hardest part when I was a plater was trying not to get chemicals on you when you work with chemicals quite a bit. As a smelter The hardest part was dealing with the extreme heat of the smelters (oven's) which were at least 2300 degrees. Also in a two year span I was laid off 15 times and that was another hard and frustrating part of working there The most enjoyable part of the job was of course payday and at one point there was a kings Island day for the employees including a picnic.  
good,"Overall good company to work for. A little ""top heavy"" with management and not very well managed from top to bottom. Emerson will do whatever means necessary to make Wall Street happy. They are a very reactive company and do not consider the long term consequences of their immediate decisions. Poor communication from management and HR. Great work atmosphere and very flexible work hours. Very good balance of work and family life. Average pay and good benefits."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"a typical day at work- Part Modeling, Assembly and Detailing Module, 2D Drafting."
good,Day starts with work and ends with work; get to learn a lot of technical things each hour of the day.
good,A typical day at work would sometimes be frustating due to the constant changes almost on a daily basis at times. I learned to not get ahead of yourself and to take it in stride and don't let things get to you so you can just do your best. As you get more comfortable with the job you learn how to manage your time more and more. Co-workers are nice and not so nice as in all work places. The hardest part becomes easy if you let it! The most enjoyable part of the job was the weekend and getting paid!
good,Enjoy the people I work with and the management. Lots of Team work.
good,There is Everyday work is challenging for us. I have learns lots of things. Management is very helpful. Co-Workers are also Helpful
good,"I had high hopes for this place, but things got very slow. They had to let quite a few good people go. I hope the people that remain can keep their jobs."
good,"employees were standing around talking, and not doing their required work. I was teminated for asking a man who was driving a forklift sitting and talking to another employee and on his cell phone to move so I could continue with my work."
good,"Depending on work load, will depend on a typical day. For the most part the pasting of info between management and employees is weak, and even worst between departments"
good,build and test bettis accuartors and built pnuematic powers and hydraulics.
good,"They were a good job at first but as time went on it became obvious that favoritism was played and shortly before departure, ethnic descrimination surfaced"
good,"Working at Emerson was, at the time, a fun place to be. They are a technology company that is looking to be on the cutting edge. The most enjoyable aspect of Emerson are the people. I worked in a company that was divested by Emerson and was disappointed to leave."
good,"working hard for a year and do not get hiring, with no vacation, and no benefits, no raise, you only receive promises, and they play with your dreams, one year later they just decide to shut down your area."
good,Great benefit but job is not stable. So many foreign employees.There is or centralized resource and information. US citizen should be closer consideration.
good,"Emerson seemed like a good company when I first started. The lack of training, lack of structure, lack of discipline within this company is CRAZY. "
good,"I hope that my next employer will appreciate me for being a hard working employee... Angrowing company , I don’t think they  truly value their employees... and at times seems alittle unfair.."
good,most employees seemed pretty happy about working there. usually worked 3 Saturdays out of the month but it is easy work depending on the job you receive
good,"Great work place and culture. Well below average salary for most positions. Hard to get large growth promotions. "
good,Relaxed atmosphere but no room for advancement and pay was poor.  This place is an alright place to work if you don't need much money. It's almost impossible to advance here and they put up job bids basically for formalities but have already picked the person they want to have the job so basically you are wasting your time bidding on the job. You don't get any sick days and you are not paid for your lunches. It takes several years to get to day shift so you have to work on off shifts for quite a long time. During the last half of the year there is a lot of layoffs so it's kind of like having a part time job half the year and a full time job for the other half of the year. It does have a family atmosphere and relaxed working conditions but that's about all it offers.
good,"nice and good training ground for fresh graduates, good benefits and supportive management..good environment.....nice training outside and inside....."
good,"People compete where they ought to cooperate at Emerson.  Some days (or weeks or months) you sit idle, some others you put in a lot of overtime.  Benefits are good.  Some people do well at Emerson.  You have to have the character for it."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Good company and very clean to work in ,in some areas good company manager and good work in crews  still have a lot of good friends that still works for them"
good,"Worked as a Contractor.  I interacted with several Project Managers, Division Heads, Vice Presidents and the President.  The industry had been good to them in the past, and they were riding the wave of 'this is the way we have done it', and I believe didn't realize how much things would change.  All said, this was about 15 years ago."
good,"ClosetMaid is a decent company, the operational culture is still very directional despite trying to change to a circular communications environment.  There have been challenges, but overcoming the challenges can be rewarding."
good,"Emerson had a good working place, they are neat and clean in their perspective working area. Making everyone is comfortable and happy in their own business."
good,"Average company to work with. Team was very supportive, learned a lot, had quite a good exposure. Its just that upper management works on favourism and nepotism."
good,"Cool product, reasonably interesting applications. Stagnant work culture, impersonal management style and lack of ownership culture. They're working on those issues but it's going to take a long time to change direction of such an entrenched culture. Good place to work close to retirement, not terribly dynamic for younger or more ambitious folks."
good,"Good people, all around me who are supportive at any cause and managers who are gentlemen and experts who treats me with respect- Emerson is the best place."
good,"Good work culture. Time flexibility, Good Manager. Challenging task."
good,"It's a company that was from a family that sold to the Emerson Group, and consists in foundry and manufacture. For being a small company, you have the opportunity to get your hands on the job, not just stay behind a computer, and for start learning it's very good experience."
good,"This division of Emerson concentrates in delivering projects only, limiting the work force to be creative and having career advancements. Good technical environment mixed with third world countries outsourcing support."
good,"Prospection jounraliére"
good,"Typical day at work would be answering any emails as required. Drafting drawings as needed. "
good,"At any time you may receive a call to go anywhere in Emerson's territory, which for me is anywhere in the US and parts of Canada.  If you're not on the road, you're expected to be working in the labs on the main product, Ovation.  That sounds great on paper until it comes time to log your hours for the week, when you'll file everything under the project you're working on then be told not to charge that project.  Or sometimes you work on tasks that have no charge number, and they'll tell you to use some random number, or worse, they'll send you on a wild goose chase to justify your activities.  There is a very unprofessional in-fighting which goes on between departments, and field engineers often get caught in the middle of that because we work on a variety of projects.  People that have been with the company for a long time will say ""Don't ever make plans"", which when translated means 'the job is your life'.  That won't bother you if you're a loner with few friends/family/relationship ties.  If you have a question in the field which requires more expert advice, prepare to deal with an angered expert for merely asking your question.  The office politics reflect badly on management, and that's only going to get worse given that a manager has just quit.  "
good,"Existe un buen ambiente laboral entre las distintas divisiones y la división en la que uno trabaja."
good,"Received good experience in working as Executive assistant to the Vice President. Arranged high level meetings and met deadlines. There was no fixed working hours for the job profile I had in the company, even had to work on weekends ."
good,"A pretty stable company with a great people to work with. A lot of technology innovators especially in process control systems field. "
good,"Not for me, I tend to have a sense of humor, that made it different for me in the accounting department.Would be okay for another personality."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,Is a very safe company and did not want the strain to affect the workers so they would have them do stretches and exercises before each shift.
good,Entreprise assez sympathique avec de bonnes relations de travail
good,Pay is well below average.  I got a 25% increase when I left.  Manager told me not to tell anyone so they could be kept in the dark about how low paying the company is.
good,"Typical office day. Everyday is a new day with all the targets to meet.   The most exciting part is that you'll encounter new things day after day. The leaders and supervisors are always looking for the best improvement possible and also activities that would maintain work and life balance for the employee. Co-workers are fun to work with, we always enjoy eating together especially when someone was recognized. There is nothing difficult when everyone in the team are working together to meet targets and goals, and that is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Great to work.Nice work culture, Handy management,Good Team work"
good,"good people to work with, but some much effort is spent on last minute tasks."
good,"Strong ethics, good management, friendly people. Technically strong, learnt lot of things technically."
good,"The job at this company is very stable, rarely would you need to worry about job security here."
good,Emerson is a great company to learn corporate skills in order to move to the next level. I've appreciated my time here and gained a lot of experience.
good,It was ok but there was not enogh young people to in the machine shop.  I found it difficult to try new stuff out like cutting tools.  They are set in there ways.
good,Travail et ambiance d'équipe agréable dans un grand groupe
good,"Positive experience until the Oil and Gas market affected the security of the position."
good,A typical day at work is fun to consider you're working with your good friends and colleagues and everyday is a  learning process of different things in life. The hardest part of the job is working at night shift which we follow the US timezone. and the most enjoyable part of it is when its weekend and we have lots of different activities.
good,"Empresa con importantes beneficios para los empleados (sueldo, extras, bonus, prepaga, gimnasio, etc.). Posibilidades de aprendizaje constante."
good,great job if work is there and stock market is good. down falls are that they do massive layoffs when numbers are low and that in return is terrible trait to have
good,Emerson was a good place to work until it was sold then they layed off a lot of there knowledge and have tried to replace them with temps and now the people that are left have to pay the price for the new ouners to make there money most are working 50-70 hrs a week and 7 days a week also
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Engaged as a student consultant engaged on one of their product strategy teams. Goals and targets were well established."
good,The building that I site that I worked at was centered around innovation and creativity. Because of that it was a very relaxed environment. Their were often free lunches (at least two times a week). A con however is that there would be long slow periods with little work to do.
good,"While at Emerson, I learned of many process of engineering from a mechanical perspective. I really like the hands on training and the time management took to explain projects."
good,"Great place to gain engineering experience in distributed control systems. Average corporate work environment, benefits and compensation with very professional colleagues, fairly low turnover rates (effected by market swings)"
good,"Certain management was great, other management were not attentive to the needs of their employees. I liked my department but there was no means of advancement in the near future."
good,La culture d'entreprise Leroy Somer est fortement présente ce qui rend le climat social agréable.
good,"Emerson is a successful company mostly due to experience in the market it operates.  The company has a strong engineering base and it leverages it to anticipate market needs and product requirements.  The company has been around for over 100 years so it has a strong foundation on processes that allows it to operate predictably and timely.  "
good,"Good company for employees in permanent pay rolls.For a EPC project , this company  have to take some decisions ignorer to survive in the market. Allowances for contractual/outsourced employees should be taken into consideration."
good,"Decent work life balance, not a very dynamic work culture"
good,Communication from Headquarters are not aligned with all departments. Direct supervisors and managers were helpful to guide the team to the direction that was presented from upper management but there was not a clear picture of the planning process that the company boasts about.
good,"A good place to work with opportunity, friendly people company seems good advancement. Employees work together pretty good with enough help and support."
good,"Slow seasons and layoffs are common, management is goof though and quality is very dependable .The company is an older type of traditional company . The company is transitioning over to lean processes ."
good,"Very large company, at the Fisher level there are great people within the organization.  Once above that, at the Emerson Level, they understand profits and loss and do not so much value the individuals that are employed there, nor do they see the value in the training that they've invested in the individuals."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Era llegar y tomarse un tiempo con los compañeros antes de iniciar el turno laboral. Ya durante el turno siempre había oportunidad de platicar con compañeros de celda y con nuestros supervisor o el jefe de grupo."
good,"They need a HR director, and alot of organization. The job was easy with very little training on my behalf. Lots of overtime and good money. Lots of drama being that it is a all men prodution and I was the only women"
good,"Good environment to work with."
good,IT Management came from failed AF Logistics program.  Totally incompetent.  I learned that transitioning from military to civilian sector a challenge.
good,"Good But Salary is not as per standard."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Fun atmosphere, less work load, repetitive tasks. coworkers are friendly."
good,Basically do what your supervisor tells you. Your job is different every day for the most part and some times after each break.
good,"This company has a lot of up and certainly same amount of downs. To name a few ups would include tons of opportunities for advancement, hands on training, good benefits, job security. To name a few downs would include, lack of leadership, sluggish people, poor management."
good,"Aprendi en este lugar a trabajar mediante mucha presion y sobre todo aprendi a adquirir responsabilidades sin desorganizarme pudiendo cumplir siempre con todos mis clientes internos dentro de la empresa, la parte mas dificil fue que en un ambiente donde lsa vacantes son muy pocas la competencia deshonesta es muy comun, compañeros hacen lo posible para desacreditarse enre ellos contal de conseguir el agrado de los jefes, no importandoles de que manrea puedan afectar a su compañero y a la empresa misma, en cuestion con los jefes, estos eran muy responsables y tomaban muy encuenta la opinion de los que trabajabamos directamente con el personal de piso, por que ellos sabian que los que conocian los problemas y necesidades del personal era el personal de operaciones"
good,"Learning at every step"
good,"Biggest and best energy company out there that encompasses unlimited technical areas applicable to modern day technology (power, oil and gas, chemical, water treatment, etc)  "
good,Emerson Electric provided a great work place for a young man fresh out of the Navy. I very much enjoyed working with the engineering department testing new technology. The technicians got along very well with the engineers. The hours were great: 7AM to 4PM for a young man. A marriage and children required me to move on.
good,Good company to work for overall. Not a reasonable pay in my opinion
good,Ok to start career. Immediate management and upper management dont care about employees despite record breaking year. Home work balance is great. Overtime when needed. Off at 4pm every day
good,"Idk it's easy work too easy "
good,"Es buena empresa, son malamente aplicados los reportes hay personas que no mantienen el nivel de inventario optimo es decir 1 mes de inventario en tornillos u otros componentes y ocasionan cambios de líneas muy frecuentes en proveedores y en la plata, esos componentes no son de gran valor y no debe bajarme mucho el inventario para metas de inventario. Se sale temprano de la empresa y me permite tener mi vida personal en balance reslice mucho trabajo en esa empresa junto con corporativo me gusta implementar sistemas de materiales es mi especialidad y trabajar con proveedores en mover bodegas cerca me gusta  el trabajo de Emerson"
good,Emerson is a great company to work depending on the department you work in. How ever the department I work for there  is no room for promotion or be off on the  weekends until someone leaves or retires.
good,"learned many thing at this place. learned how to work and be more motivated person."
good,"A good company to work in, but depends from place to place. Different entities have different job satisfaction. Work place culture is not that great. The work load is more during most of the times."
good,IT at Emerson can be a meat grinder depending on the Division.  In my case they would not stop adding scope to projects even when the business and project managers said they were over-loaded. IT Directors were willing to put the project at risk.
good,Productive and fun workplace with plenty of room for advancement within the company.excellent benefits but kind of pricey.
good,"I learned and I still learn a lot in Emerson, things I never encountered."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"nice relaxed pace of work with great colleagues.  but emerson - parent company, is budget conscious, tight wad culture that worries more about pleasing stock holders than customers.  with down turn in oil prices, we are working in constant fear of layoffs."
good,"One can judge the high number of average years of service to see that ECT provides a great place to work. Work-life balance is held as an important thing at ECT, yet there are many hard and dedicated workers too."
good,I ran a machine - Welding and then I was rotated every 2 hours and ran a crimping machine.  I learned what the company is about and what they make.  Management could be better.  I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers that didn't work as a team.
good,"Professional atmosphere, constant training, preparation and executing company policies of work instructions, ethics and safety standards.                                                                                             A.O.V (air operated valve) Diagnostic, new assembly/repair and Instrument and valve positioner calibrations.                                        Management was required to implement all Emerson/Fisher procedures and polices to all staff and personal. A culture of clarity and problem solving is the expected result.                                          A company that spans the globe has a very diverse work force. Employees are always professional dedicated and highly skilled.        With such a high demand for highly trained procession valve technicians a large amount of time is spent away from home and family life.                                                                                              Working for Emerson offered many opportunities to meet and learn from some of the brightest minds in the Control Valve industry.           A experience that has helped me achieve a higher standard."
good,"I really enjoyed working here at Emerson ., Sidney Ohio."
good,"I work there as a temp for close to 8 months. The facility was nice and easy to navigate. Both the supervisor and IB3s there were friendly and helpful though arrogant at times but they are very professional ppl and are always willing to lend a hand. They had me work on the line doing hipot and calibration as well as making tag and assembling parts to units. "
good,my typical work day was from 7am to 3pm . I really enjoyed working as part of a team to insure quality and accuracy in the product line . The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a team . The hardest part of my job was the repetitive nature of it .
good,"working in cnc,electrical, mechanical and contol devices and its very hard to learn but when i understand the work it is easy to learn and hard to work"
good,Typical fast past factory work place with good benefits and pay. Good equal opportunity for employees with advancement and good management of factory placement.

The company's goal and career opportunity is there but I have to stay in graveyard which is not healthy for long term.

good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"There are too many undertakings by management, leaving the staff at risk to complete any of them successfully. With too many cars on the road, it became a very stressful environment and there was no end in sight.

The work itself was very fulfilling."

good,"Typical day at work is fine"
good,"Management was a joke, they had their picks and wouldn't listen to the people working on the floor which made for a stressful  environment. Most of the co-workers were pretty good and everyone got along for the most part, everyone has their days. During the day I would setup and run my cnc turning machine, cnc hardener, robot, and also drove the tow motor getting and moving parts for the people in my department."

good,"My Company supports flexible hours, over the years I've learned the harder that you work, the more visible and invaluable you become in a company. My Co-workers have become my second family, we like to get together even away from the office. The hardest part of my job is communicating all the new processes just created to all who will be affected, internally and externally, in a timely manner when travel is not an option. The most enjoyable part of my job is a successful job completion with a satisfied customer."
good,"Typical Day - Arrived at work at least 60- 30 minutes before starting time to get my desk organized for the day. Reading emails, faxes & listening to phone messages that came in after working hours the day before."

good,It was a very enjoyable place to work with both management and fellow employees a joy to work with. Unfortunate for myself I found it hard to be standing up for almost the entire day especially as we were then required to do a mandatory 6 hours overtime a week the first week I began working there.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Really don't get paid as much as the job is worth when you work having all these responsibilities. You can never plan family adventures for weekends even 2 weeks in advance, due to each job having to be completed 100% before you could be off work on the weekends."

I had many opportunities to assist other departments with work.  The CEO & HR persons were such a joy to work with.  The corporate office chose to close the office, centralize some of the jobs in MO and send all the other jobs off shore.  The hardest part of my job was packing up items & shipping them to corporate.  Beyond that, I enjoyed everything I did."
good,"I worked as an admin assistant to one of the Managing Partners in a satellite office.  It was a very good, flexible job.  I learned mostly how to work with a demanding boss and do the things that she needed in a timely, efficient manner.  A typical day included running reports, making travel arrangements, answering phone calls, running to the stores to check inventory.  I did not work with many people and when my boss was traveling I was on my own."
good,"As a smaller entity, this company was a wonderful place in which to work.  After being bought out by a large company, things changed.  Security was implemented to the point where employees had to really struggle to get their jobs done.  Too much red tape and silos.  Too much work to be done by a small number of people.  More and more is being expected from fewer and fewer employees.  U.S. jobs are outsourced to India and other companies overseas."
good,"Equipe sempre unida e harmoniosa, aprendi muito sobre Instrumentação como calibração e configuração de diversos instrumentos da Emerson."
good,"The usual day is the processing of invoices for the sites that I am handling, During month end, you must pass some reports to the site as requirements. For the working environment, it is fine and you work hand in hand with your fellow co-worker cause they are also handling different sites. The hardest part of the job is the long working hours but the perks is having a high salary and you have to travel out of the country if needed."

good,"If there is work you will be busy, if you are only trained on some projects you have a high chance of getting laid off. Company does pay for all of your trips."
good,"Poco apoyo de mis superiores, se me daban muchas resposabilidades pero no se me dio el apoyo con el personal necesario para poder cubrir y cumplir con los requerimientos requeridos"
good,"I enjoyed working with most all the people in the company.  Good benefits, but tended toward job stagnation - not much opportunity for advancement or moving into other areas.

good,"This is a great place for anyone just starting on a career path in electrical manufacturing or engineering. Having been in the industry for a while it was tough for me to move up because they always want to see improvement to do so and there is only so much you can learn in the field. I had intentions on returning to school to gain an advancement, but the times of mandatory overtime would cause me to miss classes and prevent me from obtaining a degree."
good,"1.  Promotion Policy is bad"
good,"Excelente clima laboral, también cuenta con diversas actividades para el personal."
good,muy buena empresa se supera uno en muy poco tiempo
good,Good place to learn about the control valve world and to get ready for a plant job. Great environment and good coworkers. Could use better communication between management and the production floor.
good,"I would run the vinyl coater, position people and review the orders for the day. We ran about 1500 shelves a shift. The people were a little bit rough to manage but I took a troubled crew and working with the shift supervisor turned them around and was able to go on to another dept. I loved working on the manufacturing machines."
good,"I liked how I always had something to keep me busy, but was never overwhelmed. It never really got boring, as being a mill operator introduces you to new problems to solve every day."

good,Business has almost doubled in size in the last 5 years.  They are still trying to develop processes and procedures for the new business.
good,"The view of this company depends entirely on which location you are talking about.  Their location in Knoxville is pretty much OK, very focused on the bottom line / recent sales, and they are not hesitant to let people go if required.  But in general you could do much worse than work for them.  Atmosphere is fairly relaxed.  Benefits = average.  If interested, it's worth your time to at least interview with them."

good,Good internship experience. Interaction with upper level management. Projects that are meaningful and helpful for future career.
good,"A typical day consists of creating and posting journal entries, various excel reports, and reconciling a bank account. My co-workers and manager have brought me to the level of an accountant I am today. The down fall is that I do not work under a CPA. I am currently finishing classes and am looking to fulfill the work experience of the requirement."
good,Avocent was good to work with. They bought out our company called Soronti.  I enjoyed testing their technology.  The co-workers were great.  I learned a lot about project management.
good,Get to work and find out what you have to do for that day. Was involved with setting up a Work Order system and a parts database for all machines in plant. I enjoyed that and got involved with keeping all the machines running within print tolerances for each production line. Problem arose had to get machines back into specs. to run good parts.

good,I enjoyed Closetmaid you where left alone to do your job if you needed help it was usually easy to find.The hard part was getting your order pulled in time to get it loaded if it was large you had to hustle
good,A typical day is full of challenges. I have learned how to read engineering drawings and several things about process control valves. My co-workers are team oriented and pull together during hard times. The hardest part of the job is we sometimes have to work several days in a row of very long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers in need.
good,"A typical day involved coming in at 8 AM and meeting our managers who instructed about what we would be doing that day. After that, we were on our own and went to work preparing individual and corporate level tax returns. Whenever there was a question help was readily accessable from any of the tax preparers familiar with the client. Co-workers were very friendly and would come by to check on the interns and see how we were doing."
good,"sadly, the focus shifted from product to process. ""Domain Knowledge"" in the developer community stopped being an asset and was regarded as a liability."
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,I spent 24 yrs at this company.  It is a good place to work for.  A lot of pressure to work in the plant.  Safety is always the number one priority and Quality is a close second.

good,Easy job for anyone to do but it does require some physical ability from lifting stacks of shelving to moving pallets but overall its an easy job to do
good,Great place to learn and advance Friendly co-workers and environment. Management is a little inconsistent. Great safety program that offers certifications. Salary is a not the best. Great benefits. Strict attendance point system.
good,"It's a fast pace work environment with cross training. Straight 8 hour days, you get one 10 minute break and a 20 minute lunch. Some jobs you do work 7 day a week but not all."
good,"es una excelente empresa, tienen muy buen ambiente de trabajo, se cuecen habas como en muchos lugares"

good,I had a great co-op experience in the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Department. I had the opportunity to travel with the team to various plant locations and learn about the assembly line process.
good,"Emerson is a well managed company.  So well manged and planned that it gets in the way of innovation.  New ideas are questioned to death, senior management is talented but extremely risk averse.  There is little to no understanding of how New Product Development should be executed.  Investments in Organic Growth are limited to hampered by lack of cross-functional focus.  Strategic plans are not synchronized between different functions and KPIs for for one strategy often trample KPIs of another strategy."
good,"We had a great group of different ages and experiences that really got along well together.  More experienced people would definitely help bring newer employees up to speed on job responsibilities and newer employees would often times make suggestions that were out of the box and initiated conversation on how to make changes.  It was a face paced environment with different issue popping up everyday and it helped keep the day interesting.  Also working with good people made the day enjoyable.  The management team in customer service was great too, ready to lend a hand but never micro managing."
good,"A workplace where employees are always busy, fast pace environment that employees have been train to be safe and always follow instructions. Good place to work and grow professionally."
good,"Es una buena empresa, muy estable, chiquita, no hay muchas oportunidades de crecimiento, no se aprende mucho, pero en general es buena."

good,"I can't really rate the company as I was only there for 3 months on temporary assignment; however, the people I worked with were very personal and professional."
good,Emerson is a great place to work out of my job because Emerson is good at keeping employee welfare good for first-time experience because of work here We can learn especially in technical fields and can learn to work together well
good,"Good place to work, but can be quite hectic.  The business systems are outdated, which creates chaos.  The people are the best part.  The culture is improving to be more inclusive of women & minorities, but they still have a ways to go."
good,Emerson is a great place to work. There just is no job advancements within. The work is easy to catch on to and assemble. You will work as a team and have a team leader. Hardly have to talk to supervisor.
good,well it was a place too work and they gave me work and all the work they gave me was work i had too complete. and complete it i did and in so doing it was completed.
good,Great product line. Professional management style. Excellent global identity. Safe production work environment. Offers many continuing learning opportunities from within.
good,"RIF during the economic collapse of 2008. Given warning that 45,000 Emerson workers would be let go, and I was one. "
good,Work environment is challenging but there is a feeling of achievement. Peers are always ready to help you and are very collaborative. Diversity in the workplace is also encouraged.

The most enjoyable part of my job was coordinating with upper management, QA personnel and shop employees to make improvements to the quality system and lead the organization to achieve ISO 9001 certification."
good,"Empresa com grandes desafios, especialmente no segmento óleo & gás e com grandes mudanças organizações, devido a estrategia corporativa global."
good,"- good work culture i feel in all my professional life"
good,"Being an employee of Emerson was quite an experience.  I've learned a lot about different cultures since the company serves a number of clients all around the world.  As a Software Test Manager, I was given an opportunity to handle a group of software testers and provide them the tools and training they need to progress their career.   I also learned how to manage resources for large projects and provide project status to upper management.  Another responsibility I had was to make sure that the people under me gets evaluated for their annual performance, and make sure that the budget allotted to my team is adequate.  I had done a number of training classes about Emerson's products and about skills/competencies development."

good,"Empresa muito bem estruturada, com seus prós e contras"
good,"I held the assembler position while I worked at Emerson. It;s a fast paced job, but once you know how to work each of your positions it becomes easy almost and easy to keep up."
good,Stuck in a cubicle all day.  Working emails all day to help customers.  Which I enjoy!  I just don't get the chance to meet the customers face to face as much as I'd like.

good,"tres bonne organisation "
good,"None at this time."
good,"I really liked the schedule, a typical work day was 8 to 10 depending on OT. I was able to get hands on training, and really enjoyed it's longevity & relationships gains over the years. The only con was the job catering to one ethnic group vs another."
good,Bunch of hard working individuals. good old guys that will actually make you laugh and are fun to be around and learn from. good management and good training.
good,"The work/life balance is very good, but the management does not communicate effectively and the senior management appears to be so disconnected to the employees that they talk about ""shareholder value"" incessantly and nothing about any strategic direction.  They have their own PAC and send too many emails to the staff asking for contributions when their political agenda can't possibly match their employees.  Furthermore, the CEO was awarded 113% salary increase the year he divested the portion of the company that he acquired some years ago while no real profits are reinvested into the company's competitive advantage..."
good,Emerson/ Now Vertiv is a good company to work for. the benefits and pay are ok. They provide you with all the training you need to work here and provide you with all the tools and equipment you need to do the job.

good,"buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Good place to work, chances to advance of your willing to work, made some goods friends, management is pretty good too "
good,The reason why I resigned on this company is because of the salary. I am not receiving enough salary to support the studies of my younger sister. The management is good. There is a lot of works here but I enjoyed the environment.
good,Excelente empresa con un gran ambiente laboral. Se aprende bastante día con día.
good,Senior personnel are full of knowledge.Always helpful IF you are willing to learn how to do things the correct way. NO shortcuts allowed.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Like all jobs, there are good days and bad days.  Commuting into London is a necessary requirement, but once in the office, the atmosphere and my co-workers are what go towards making it an engaging and interesting place to work."
good,"Worked for Emerson Process Management, Remote Automation Solutions.   Not a bad place to work until the oil bust happened but they have severe problems with their software and hardware R&D being constantly behind, up to 3 years behind on projects. They are mainly into selling hardware and the software is an after thought."
good,"Works mostly in the office 8 hours a day providing technical support to DeltaV Automation Install base worldwide. Perform design and implementation to assign projects. Create Knowledge base articles for DeltaV issues, Prodecures, Technical information etc. "

good,"management of company is very good"
good,"I have learn more about how to handle a project with different customer."
good,"My personal general review about this company was somewhat great. Its a good company environment, every job duty was pretty easy to learn and pretty much self explanatory. The only thing that i did not like is our whole department was hired using a staffing agency so once you reached one year they would get rid of you no if's or but's. That was one of the only down sides. The work schedule was good and from time to time we would work over time which was great."
good,Shift starts with daily stretches followed by a quick meeting with shift supervisor. Then you go to your work area and see hat was done the shirt before and what needs to be done during your shift.
good,good place to work but getting laid off pretty soon the moral is very weak there right now because we are going to have to train people to take over our jobs
good,"I learned how to drive a forklift. Inventory control, cycle counting, material distribution. I worked with a lot of great people."
good,"O trabalho de maneira geral éra muito desafiador pois costumávamos trabalhar com projetos customizados onde se podia haver alterações completas dependendo do cliente e onde seria instalado, esse era um grande desafio, porem muito recompensador quando entregue depois de tantos problemas e aprendizados."
good,"My kind of work is toxic and stressful everyday. Aside from being short handed, a huge spike on requests and volume of calls come in during these season. We mainly support industrial type of business, which is well-know all over the world. Moreover, a lot of customers depend on us and expect excellent service, Given that situation, I am in great awe and in deep gratitude to my co-workers who have been very supportive and understanding, as they extend their time to help me with some of my requests to complete it in a timely manner. Aside from that, despite of the busy day, they find time loosen up and joke around, which lighten up my day and make me more productive. I consider my colleagues as my close friends and we actually treat each other as a family."
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar e aprendi muitas coisas neste periodo que fiquei nela."
good,"i spent almost 2 years there and thanks to my boss, who promoted me to material controller and assign more task to me. i had nice time there. i like busy life."
good,"As a team lead, no two workdays were the same. Sometimes my days were spent in training mode, others in strategy and product development sessions, others in taking care of administrative tasks and still others in putting out brush fires. Very few days offered actual product development opportunities, which I missed."
good,Fun place to work. Co-workers are outgoing. Laid back culture with certain degree of freedom. Compensation have potential to be a little better.

good,"Day goes with Lots of Meetings."
good,Overall it is a great place to work. It is however it can be a difficult work environment between shifts when having to worry about co-workers acting like high school kids telling on each other all the time.
good,Everyday was a learning experience. The most important thing I learnt from my manager is to work as a team and to stay together under any given circumstance.
good,CC Creations had a great employee mentality. Worked together as a team and supported everyone.
good,"A typical day would be when you're just doing what you have to do like calculations, screenings etc. in a fully air-conditioned place with a pleasant atmosphere conducive for work. Learning is an essential par of the job and you will be with a team that will support you with your tasks and will teach you the basics before letting you perform on your own."

I learned SharePoint, Oracle, and SQL from scratch. Boss and co-workers were always understanding and willing to help with anything I did not know or understand. My main complaint is that most of the time I had no tasks to perform and management was not good at delegating work."
good,"- Energetic"
good,"El trabajo era muy estresante, el ambiente de trabajo con relacion a los compañeros era muy aspera, mi jefe una excelente persona de la cual aprendi mucho en este puesto, el sueldo muy bajo para apersonal de confianza."

Had wonderful hard working people.3:00 IN THE MORNING was the hardest part of my job. Steady work..good people little parties for birthdays I would make the cake!"
good,Learned how to properly grind welding off parts. Management was willing to work with employees to a point. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of doing the job assigned was running out of materials to work with. what I enjoyed the most about working at Leroy Somer was the hours.
good,"Challenging place to work with, but that's exactly some people want as day to day business is never the same and it's quite exciting."
good,"I was a long term employee who decided to move on for a different career. I worked at Emerson for over 26 years at Emerson and  the money/raises weren't very good for the amount of time and experience that I had there. After moving on, I can say that the insurance benefits they offered the union employees is actually good coverage. You get what you pay for, so it was a higher premium each week, which may be hard for someone just starting there at 11.50 an hour. They need to pay better if they want to keep the good workers."
good,"The management team of this company ensures that all employees know and understand the vision.  Then, the management team ensures that every employee understands her/his contribution to that vision.  Last, the management team of this company allows for 360 degree feedback, which means that managers are held accountable for their performance (communicating the vision, providing necessary resources, giving direction, etc.)"
good,"Good place to work for. I worked 3rd shift, 3rd shift supervisor was a stand up guy. I worked in the Fabrication department as a setup cnc machinist. I got to share my experience with a lot of guys who had little experience, which I did enjoy. The only negative was that Saturday was mandatory at least 3/4 weekends a month."
good,"Work is usually low stress but can get busy at times. Management is pleasant but not always on top of things, which can get frustrating. Straight days.40 hour weeks."

good,I was in charge of all orders inbound? outbound. Mainly focused on our international orders which was a challenge with new tariffs and taxes being added on a regular basis. I recieved my Forklift and Haz Mat licenses there as I moved up from a machine operator to a shipping Coordinator.
good,"Management are good and care for the staff. Pension scheme good too and."
good,"Since i am a contract employee, i do not know about the benefits that the employees receive. "
good,"Great company, good people.  "
good,"First, I worked at a division within Emerson. It was a great place for me to get started.

good,"lavoro stimolante e mai monotono,sempre in trasferta in italia con auto aziendale."
good,"A great place to work 10 hours with breaks every 2 hours. Able to work up the ladder if interested to learn. Workplace is greatly diversified with no discrimination. Most enjoyable part and hardest, depending on your workstyle, is the lax environment. There are times where it feels too relaxed with nothing to encourage you to be better."
good,"Emerson has provided my family and I a very good living. I have gotten the opportunity to grow and move, travel and learn. Sometimes there are conflicting goals within groups and some ""silos"""

good,Emerson providesndustries best technologies with good work life balance to employees. Emerson is US based organisation having thier head quarter in Saint louis. In India they have capative centers in Mohali and Pune.
good,Emerson's executive team appears to have a clear grasp on industry trends and future technology when identifying new business opportunities. The company does risk losing margin control if they are unable to move downstream in several markets.
good,"Overall decent place to work. Give it all you got and they will go the extra mile for you. Decent pay for the area, but not for the job itself. The job is very demanding and hard on the body (repetitive motions over a long period of time).High demand of overtime in season, not enough time to let the body recoop. Very hard on the family when you work six days at 10 hours a day and only have one day (Sunday) off to enjoy your family. "
good,Projects and coworkers are always changing. so you don't get bored doing the same tasks.
good,"The work is steady and constant, with plenty of opportunity for overtime. The quality of management depends on the area and manager. Benefits start as soon as you start with the company. The hardest part is the standing all day, and constantly having to move back and forth. Very methodical and systematic work makes it easy to get into a rhythm that makes the day disappear. Four 10 hour shifts are the standard, so you have a three day weekend if you don't pick up any overtime. There is a large lunchroom with a good selection of food that tastes fairly good. Coworkers are easy to get along with, and managers are usually pretty easy going."
good,"I would go over work order forms. Program and machine prototypes and fixtures"
good,Everyone is friendly  and easy to work with. The pay for co-op level is very good. Definitely recommend to a business or engineering college student for a spring/summer/fall internship.

Usually when I had a heavy workload, I tried to managed my time and make sure that my work was done before meeting the said project deadline. If possible I always extended my time so I can balanced well the workload. I've  learned to be organised all the time and work hard. The hardest part of the job probably would be meeting the deadlines but by focusing on your work and by balancing it you will definitely sure you'll achieve your goals. The most enjoyable part was you have a freedom to showcase your design to the client which I really like and they loved it. Because as a designer you appreciate more your work when you can create a good design."

Our company has a good organizational structure and has four layers - Managerial, Supervisory, Line Leadership and Staff. I belong to the third level [Line Leadership] providing guidance to a group of 14 Engineers. The hardest part of the job would be finding ways to keep them motivated with their work. The stuff they are doing are somewhat repetitive. As a leader, you would want your people to become motivated so they would always look forward coming to the office everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job would be developing your people. You reward them on the things or tasks they successfully completed, help them on areas they need improvement."

There was a lot of work to do, but everyone worked together and that's how things were accomplished on time. Not long after Emerson had bought out Trumpeter Semflex, Work started to go down hill. The company soon shut down and closed their doors. Everyone lost their jobs, including me. I worked so hard to get where I was with Trumpeter Semflex, and then we were just out of work. Management did a very poor job. Everyone I had worked with, were gone. My co-workers were like family. I really miss what I did at work. I was always their to help anyone who needed help. There was no warning to any of my co-workers that the company was closing down. It would have been nice to let us know, so we could start looking for another job. That was not nice. Upper management did not care about anyone but themselves. After all the hard work I did for that company and this what I get. That hurt really bad."

good,"A small (100) branch of a global company that focuses mostly on manufacturing. The compensation is 'competitive' but the atmosphere is pretty friendly. The management tries hard to balance the needs of the customer, company, and employees. Flexibility as far as job description is wide because most positions require different hats at different times.

good,Most of things depend on your manager. flexible working hours. New product development and testing labs are grt advantage to work with Emerson. No work load.
good,Productive and fun workplace. The hardest part about the job is a lot of heavy lifting. Over all it's a great place to work. A typical day at work is getting the orders and pulling LTL loads.

good,Es un lugar que permite gozar de estabilidad laboral en caso que se desee laborar allí.
good,"This is the first company I worked for right after graduation and i can say that Emerson gives any individual a good foundation regarding his/her skill set and work ethics."
good,Emerson was a good company to work the only two issues that I left from the job was an unfair treatment for IBIIIs who are the leads of the job according to the job schedule and job training. They do not treat the same situation with the employees.
good,Work and life balance in the company is strictly followed. The company gives the employees the benefit of flexibility and conducts bi-monthly employee engagements to effectively promote camaraderie and improve employee relations.

good,Worked 19 years there overall a really good place to work sometimes worked a lot of over time hated to leave just wanted to try something different in my life
good,"You work ten hours a day and40 hours a week if not more. While the pay is okay for the job, I think the employees deserve more. Benefits are great. In a factory you're going to have goods and bars. However, it is a job and it pays more than most in the area.  If you have a family sometimes it is hard to manage. Hard to take off and be there for your kids when needed."
good,"Our quality team is great. My manager always cares about us and he wants us to be better inspectors every year. He gives us the trust and security to ask him any questions related to the job, mostly giving us an answer as assertive as it can be. I wouldn't be able to say the same for Human Resources."
good,"MRO Buyer/Processor"
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral"
good,This was a great place to work until the upper management decided to move the operation from Utah to Florida. Perhaps one person actually made that move.  The other 20 plus employees in the group I was in found other employment in Utah.
good,No hay oportunidades de crecimiento o desarrollo de nuevas habilidades para aspirar a otros puestos.
good,"Emerson(EEEC-Pune) is an excellent company to work with for a balanced professional and personal life. I really enjoyed and cherish my days spent in this company. I also learnt a lot about the jobs I was assigned in Emerson. And all the hard work done for the company always pays off. "
good,"Emerson is a very high integrity, professional company.  Very much a what you see is what you get place with very little game playing.  Emerson's strength is the operations and financial management rigor that they bring to companies, without interfering (too much) in what makes a particular business unit successful. I found a lot of autonomy in my role provided that I stayed within the rails and hit the metrics. They are true to their reputation of promoting from within. "
good,"Some overtime is offered. Work is fast paced. The building looks very nice. Has a weight room and large break room. Located off 290, write by all of the traffic."
good,"Here's my review:"

good,"Fun workplace and good place to build your career. Nice work environment, good people and very professional. Global exposure and diverse culture. Good training as well."
good,"Mistakes can hold up the line, and if you are responsable for holding up the line the people will let you know about it. They dont have time for mistakes and most people are hostile if they have to come and help complete a task. The managment team does a superb job if you know them personally, but make sure you establish that connection right off the bat before someone decides to let them know for you, which could be good or bad depending on who it's coming from."
good,"very flexible management"
good,I enjoyed working at Copeland Corp. because it kept you always busy and was hard physical work which I like. We worked as a team and I felt each job I was assigned to do each night that I did the best to my ability.
good,Emerson has great people to work with and opportunities for learning new things.  Emerson offers job stability but like many oil and gas companies demand a lot of their employees which can impact work life balance if you allow it. Pay is not on par with the pay scale in the area but it takes a lot for them to have lay off's. Lacking are clear career paths and mentorship.
good,"Good, innovative, solid company.  World leader in its industries served. Truly global company.  Always working on continuous improvement. Great management."
good,"Very personable, family-oriented company."
good,"Being part of Emerson family has a lot contribution with regards to my personal growth specifically boosting my intellectual capacity as a foreign language proofreader and translator, it's the shortest time being with the company as compared to all the companies I work with due to 6 months contract only.  It is a project-based account wherein I am given the task to proofread all documents written in Chinese, carefully analyze all product descriptions and write-ups, with this type of job, I'm not only enjoying and loving it but also had the chance to improve my skills & learning ability, I will definitely miss my not so many colleagues who were all too busy and less interaction with workmates because of  their complicated given projects to finish ahead of the stipulated time, so far it's our common dilemma having the most complicated products and finding solutions to promote it in the market, Emerson's management can be considered as great when it comes to new innovations and outstanding when it comes to new projects, I would love to get another free meal provided by the supervisors and head of the operations, I learned so much in my short stay at Emerson, talk about the not so strict breaks schedule as long as you've done your part reviewing, checking and proofreading your assigned files and papers."
good,"Worked as Materials Engineering Co-Op for Spring Semester. Great place to develop engineering skills, nice people, management listened to concerns and responded accordingly."

good,Soy puntual. Trabajadora. Tengo disponibilidad diaria. No soy problemática.soy respetuosa. Tengo buen trato con la gente. Fui portera en escuelas.
good,The only problem I have with Emerson is the salary is very low and they would not let you get anymore even if you tried. People who are seniors engineers think that you do not know anything and would not listen to you which is sad.
good,Its always a worthwhile working with Emerson for 4 yrs now. I had learn a lot from disciplines and hardwork to enjoying work life balance. Emerson provides training that will equip you to become the best employee that you can be.
good,"I had two work terms working with Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions. All of the engineers on both the refrigeration and manufacturing side of the company were very friendly and helpful towards me. All of the projects given to me felt like they had meaning, purpose, and and had aspects that made me apply things that I had learned in school. I would recommend working here as a co-op."
good,Very Professional and very Goal Driven company. Management at times cared more about training than it did about the actual job that needed to be done which is the reason for the 4 stars.

good,"Emerson Manila Shared Services is one of the most competitive companies to work for in the Manila area. This company has a great culture and is really committed to delivering superior service to customers. Everyone I worked with, in our various locations, were amazing. The management also takes time to help the community especially the elderly people which I think is awesome."
good,"Emerson was a place where you knew you had a job and could make money at. They have benefits, stocks, 401k that they match when other company didn't offer a dime. When this company closed they gave you pension and head ups long before they decided to closed the doors."

good,"The material handler process is something i learned while working at Emerson. Pick the product from either the narrow aisle on fork trucks or bin areas on foot. The pack process is loading all material into a loading box size varied in order to properly match the product. Being a team lead i learned to work more effectively with others to reach a common goal. The hardest part of any job that in a warehouse is safety first, and maintain proper hydration levels. Most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction between managers and employees close relationships that were mended to build and grow."

As an intern in the finance department, I've learned how to prepare payment to vendors of the company including Goods and Services Tax (GST) documentation. All my colleagues and seniors are very helpful and informative when I ask how to do things that I don't know. If I were given more time, I would definitely come back and work in Emerson again."

Les calculs sont modélisés sous le logiciel SolidWorks. Mon travail consistait à trouver la méthodologie pour les calculs parasismiques et construire un modèle standard avec cette méthodologie. Au cours de mon stage, j’ai suivi une formation personnelle sur le module simulation dans ce logiciel. Au cours de cette expérience, j’ai eu l’occasion de découvrir et bien connaitre le module simulation sous SolidWorks ainsi qu’approfondir mon niveau de conception.

I learned to become a fast worker with very little mistakes.  The management was okay, they give us a ton of work and would get upset with we asked for a little bit of help, which is why I avoided it as much as I can. Definitely just had to work hard.  My co-workers were pretty cool.  Wasn't too much time to talk because we'd be focused on our work.  The hardest part about the job was again, the ton of work they throw at you.

He would encourage the team to work hard with a positive energy. I have wonderful co-workers. Since I was the only out of town, they often asked me out to hang out. This allowed me to mix into the group comfortably. Other than having fun times, I also faced some challenges such as taking charge of project. No doubt it was tough but it allowed me to grow and experience responsibility and leadership. Last but not least, the most enjoyable of the job is waking up and going to work. It is because there is always new things and challenges that awaited me."

They are wonderful to work with, but the only possibility for advancement within Emerson is to be an already-employee seeking a promotion.

I personally think management in the work environmental is good for the workers. It keeps them working on staying at their job and not walking around talking or doing something they are not suppose to be doing. My co-workers and I had fun together. We would stick together and get our jobs done together. It was a teamwork thing and we enjoyed it. The hardest parts of my jobs was when I would have to do other people work because they would not do it. The most enjoyable part of my work days is getting my job done and feeling the accomplishment."
