rating,review
bad,"I was a scab working at Harley, they called me a casual worker, same thing. No benefits, no insurance, no time off, working next to people making $10.00 an hour more than me. Was treated horribly by coworkers and supervision. This was a bad idea!!"
bad,The frequent leadership changes and inexperience that came with that in the General Merchandise department was always concerning.  Coming from a retail and product development background it's a difficult environment as the leadership has no experience in apparel industry.  Every year I was there they had large layoffs and restructuring; not a stable environment.
bad,"GM and Owner could care less about the employees. Work you to death and do not appreciate anything that you do. Never know from one day to next if you have a job. GM can’t give you any answers because he is too stupid, himself, to know. Just a joke"
bad,"There had been hardly any communication. I ended up being a pawn that the marketing director could throw under a bus when I wouldn't lie for her. "
bad,"Wall street banker whom do not ride have ruined the motor co. Most of the parts are made in china and assembled by part time people. In 2010 harley laid off 1000s to give the big wigs more and boniness, the people whom helped turn the co. Around in the 90s got the shaft."
bad,"Unable to pay me on time. No scheduled breaks. No over time. Zero appreciation.  No incentives, empty promises, no room for advancement, harassment, 5 people quit this last month."
bad,"The place was a very hostile place to work, management did not care about quality nor the wellbeing of the employees. The place went downhill fast! The CEO's that came in cut our health benefits from Blue Cross to a horrible UnitedHealthCare and reduced our coverage and benefits!"
bad,"Unprofessional / Unethical Management, Blatant Discrimination, & Zero Management Training Support; if it is anything NOT computer based you're on your own. Complete waste of time for True Professional Sales People."
bad,"Nearly everyone in the building is a mean, insecure, vindictive, troglodyte. They are perpetually stuck in high-school bullying mentality. They think they are cool because they've been putting the same bolt in the same hole on the assembly line for the same 30 years. Most of them don't even ride a Harley, yet they think they are bikers. Everyone from top to bottom is an insecure sack of excrement who has found the perfect place to hide. If any of them acting the way they do inside that building on the street they would get their head caved in. The truth is they are all a bunch of sissies who will try to make your life miserable because they don't have one!"
bad,"if the boss doesnt like you they find false reason to fire you, "
bad,"Being a temp here is like being a Jew in 1943 Germany.  Don't do it unless you fit in to that type of culture.  Bullying is the number one skill that is their pride.  This is a rough neck company full of rough necks.  If you are a wimp, they will tear you apart like a pack of wolves.  It truly is a bad boy image company, and bad boys do bad things to little fish."
bad,My experience working at Harley Davidson was horrendous. I was abused physically and mentally in all my years of working in my life this place took the cake of the worst. Your paid only $9 and force you to do work outside of your job description. If another Porter comes in to get a job your 95% going to be terminated the next week or even day. Management is a joke There a new one every 4 months. The manager most likely never like you unless you know them personally. The only benefit is 5% off which everyone gets as a customer. They hate when you go on break and will try any possible way to fire you. This place is very abusive to its workers. Please STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone. To many mind games played. "
bad,"I would strongly recommend that anyone considering going to work for Harley-Davidson re-consider. The company's senior management is a mess and is doing anything possible to hang onto their positions. It's a battle they're losing and the casualties in the war are the people working under them. Don't get me wrong -- the BRAND is strong and iconic -- the current senior MANAGEMENT is a train wreck and will likely soon be ousted by shareholders. So if you like stability, this is NOT the place to be."
bad,"You can make more at Mcdonalds! New management, only cares about selling bikes. Will lie to you just to get you to buy a bike. Manager will fire you for something dumb and charge your card taking everything you have and send you out the door after working hard for them."
bad,"Awfully ran by the dealer principles, the female that owns it is a bimbo in a sense, works very part time and just shops in the clothing department all day. You honestly can’t take this company seriously. Terrible pay and only receive benefits after a year. Don’t be fooled by the rating on here. "
bad,"I volunteered as a seasonal employee in the funding department and learned the following:  If you do now own a Harley or plan on riding you will be an outcast with the rest of the staff.  Two supervisors over us and a two week course covering a lot of information, but if you ask them any questions via private message they were rude to you and told you that you should already know this.  Several times I asked when they were letting us go from this assignment and they lied and said they were keeping us another year.  A month later they let us all go.  If you do want to work for this company be prepared to stare at the computer and review documents over and over again for 13 hours straight with zero mistakes.  BORING and temps are treated badly."
bad,"When I began in Jan 2000, I LOVED going to work. You were praised by co-workers and management for good working practices, management left you alone to do your job, friendly atmosphere, company cared about quality and safety, the company CARED about employees, great benefits, company cared about relationship with employees, recognized employees on birthdays and work anniversaries, DESIRED keeping a good relationship with employees thru/with union, more open to working with employees when they had hardships or health conditions"
bad,"This company is going down. Not only are they inept at creating products that appeal to millennials, they treat their associates with little to zero respect."
bad,The work is physically demanding.The employees are underappreciated. Not recommended. Dead end job. Declining work environment. Large turnover in management.
bad,Harley Davidson has become focused on its bottom line only. They are outsourcing and shipping jobs over seas at an alarming rate. They sacrifice quality and safety for production.
bad,A typical day would be to interact with customers. Creating sales and repeat business. There is much to know about the product and it is always a pleasure getting a customer set up for their bike experience ….safely
bad,"Hammond Harley Davidson sucks.. management is poor,l. & communication is poor.. The technicians aren’t qualified for the work & sales is lack luster. Micro manage is poor & untrained due to over seers not doing their job"
bad,"Worst manager I've ever had the unfortunate luck to work for. Quite frankly, I would have gladly retired from there but the Sales Manager made it quite impossible. "
bad,"Disregard to human ethics and basis safety, on a daily basis they divided the workforce into two shifts and said we were both equal yet they always played favorite the the mornings. Management was always proving they knew someone and that's how they gained their job. Safety was the biggest issue several times a week someone would be injured due to disregarding basic issues such as fire escape signs being blocked by overstocked parts. What I learned in my year and a half of working at harley-davidson's ""Crush Zone"", was that no matter how hard I worked, how much I had excelled at that job, the positions that I would apply for were taken by someone who I had to train personally. But the most enjoyable part was making friends in the workforce, not the team leads or managers, but other grunt workers like myself. We always had each other's backs when worst came to worst and finished the work day together as a team."
bad,treat workers poorly over worked under paid no time off no benefits for temp worker no profit sharing even though the are making millions. corporate greed at its finest. mandated overtime ALL the time temps get half the pay. no insurance.
bad,"This is an absolutely terrible place to work, they personally do not care about you, you're just a number to them and if you break they'll just replace you."
bad,Easily one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They don't care at all about their employees and there is zero job security and terrible pay. Management has no idea how to treat and take care of employees.
bad,I worked as a detailer at Harley Davidson and did not enjoy working there. the pay was terrible for what the job required. i would not recommend it to a friend.
bad,"The worst...most underhanded place I've ever worked at... Perfect attendance and volunteering for overtime won't get you hired..."
bad,"Ride Now Powersports is buying up these dealerships and destroying the Harley brand with dispicable management practices, horrible insurance and employee programs."
bad,"No room for advancement of any kind. No raises. Managers will lie about promotions and raises for as long as they need you, then the offers dissappear. Require many 12 hour shifts, often without the option of a break. Commission pay is a joke, not real commission pay, and much lower than other dealerships I have experienced."
bad,"I was not paid for nearly a months worth of work, when addressing the issue with my boss, she told me she couldn't help me. HR lost my checks 5-7 times."
bad,"the entire staff will hate you, the job security sucks because although you pay union dues you have no rights and can basically be fired at any time. so good luck and cancel any plans you've got cause the overtime will try to kill you"
bad,This company has a very bad outlook on its employees. Its like every single day everyone gets screamed at and is threatened with termination or lay off.
bad,"Company had heavy turnover, owner know nothing about running a business.  Manager treated everyone like a number not a person. Worst dealership in the USA. Don't buy from or work for them."
bad,hated it after 3 weeks very unorganized not what I thought it would be for a Harley dealer only thing good was the paycheck every 2 weeks other then that hated it
bad,extreme employee turn-around; especially with management.  Owners/upper mgt. does not know how to properly treat or appreciate their employees.
bad,"Overworked and pressured "
bad,"Work place at Harley has significantly deteriorated in recent years, especially in marketing. Management is top-heavy and disorganized making the work environment very challenging. Also, very political and promotions based on favoritism, not skills & talent."
bad,"I got hired during Dillons ""grand opening"". A month later I was called into the office and told I was being ""laid off"". When I went to claim unemployment benefits the management at Dillons lied and said I was ""fired"" and attempted to claim that I was rude to customers and several other lies that they had no paper trail to back up. I was in shock at how awful they were."
bad,"Straight commission, with extra small bonuses if you hit your target.  If they end up paying to many bonuses, they cut them back the next month and make the goal unrealistic.  The hours are nuts for the amount of money you make.  Simple mathematics. If you have a family...RUN, if you want a life...RUN, if you want dependable and stable income...RUN"
bad,Motorcycle salesman don't try hard to communicate with customers. People in motorclothes run over people for commission.  New employees never have a chance unless you fit in to the click. New employees try really hard. Work hard. Sales girls in clothing department take every sale you get. Employees scream at each other on salesfloor. No one speaks to customers. Customers complain about buying a motorcycle and a few days later they have get stuff fixed. Service department gets lots of complaints. Motorcycles shouldn't need to have parts replaced or fixed soon after you purchase motorcycle. Also repeatedly having to bring back to have same parts continually fixed.  Overall- salesmen are lazy; management doesn't care about employees. Terrible place to shop or work. If your looking for employment- please look elsewhere.
bad,"Management was aggressive, sometimes prone to violent outburst, genuinely unconcerned with employees. Owner of the location I worked at treated all employees as if it was a mill and had no care, concern about the employees. There was no work/life balance as you were required to work every weekend, every holiday, and 10+ hours a day. Culture was be loud and obnoxious or get ran over."
bad,They use you. They have you do to many things at once. Very un safe. They are producing bikes that people dont have any skills to make a quality bike.
bad,"H-D was a difficult place to work because employees are pitted against each other, directions are inconsistent and the atmosphere is terrible.  The management treats employees as expendable and are not interested in you as a person."
bad,I deleted the review that I wrote about my company because I felt that it would jeopardize my employment. If I had positive things to say about my company I would not be leaving.
bad,This is the most cut throat place to work. The owner is the the most sadistic person I have ever met and the service manger is the same way. I worked hard for them and did extra things I wasn’t compensated for and then they fired me for not over charging hours on jobs. I had relocated my life and was blindsided by being fired. There was no logical reason for being fired other than being honest with how long the job took. If being honest gets you fired then you can read between the lines.
bad,"This place has high turnover both in sales and management. When hired I was told a sales person could make up to $70K a year. I'm sure no one is making even half of that. Had to spend 30 minutes every morning pulling motorcycles out rain or shine and longer in the evening because not all helped. "
bad,Free dental and vision. company is more focused on numbers and not people or quality. closing site down in kc to move to another site......................
bad,No clear procedures or policy. Managers did not know what owners wanted.
bad,Expensive benefits.
bad,There is not a lot of good to say working as an intern in engineering. Expect to get constantly put down and or used as the stereotypical intern and apply 0 education.
bad,"Hired in September because they didn’t have enough employees to cover shifts    "
bad,"Find a real job with benefits and know you can have longevity instead of just getting by knowing you are doing the same job as the actual employees while they play on their phones and you do the work for less than half the pay. If you make it 4 years or so where you can be considerrd for hire or if you are hired you will then get bumped and lose your benefits,pay increase and told if you want to continue working you can go back"
bad,"This company, while still profitable, is a complete disaster. Terrible, (borderline schizophrenic) senior management has created a horrible culture where continued mistakes and poor decisions are paid for by front line staff. They've done 4 or 5 ""restructurings"" in the past few years. It's only a matter of time until the shareholders oust the current CEO and his inept leadership team. Riding on the coattails of previous regimes and a reputation that, in reality, no longer exists -- this company is a total horror show to work for. They may dangle a decent salary in front of you -- but don't take the bait -- you'll absolutely regret it."
bad,The management was horrible. My manager told me to watch what I do and say to my co-workers due to my ethnicity. I left the company two weeks later. It was hurtful and by far the worst experience of my life.
bad,"poor communication skills, poor management, expectations were too high for the work they ask of you. Give you too many tasks to complete in one shift also expect you to know all tasks even if you weren't taught or shown how to do them the way they want it done."
bad,"The plant closing was announced on a day to coincide with the announcemant at the stock holders call.  It should tell you a lot that no one was allowed in to the plant after the announcemnet was made.  Unfortunately there are a lot of hard feelings here, most of the employees are ready to find a new job."
bad,"Wasn't a good fit for me. This place hires and fires people all day long. If you don't make it into the ""it"" crowd, they will make sure you fail miserably to find a way to fire you, or fire you before you've reached 90 days as an employee. This is a great place if you're the customer, however I can't say to much as a previous employee because I didn't last very long until I was fired."
bad,"For the rebel company they portray they are the most PC unorganized, wasteful company I have ever worked for. If they don't change their ways HD will not be in years to come."
bad,"If you are into Harley's for their motorcycles this is the job for you, if not I don't recommend it. Each dealership is different but the Lima turnover rate is really high since they have a hard time letting new people into their click. The customer's are really awesome and understanding when you are new. That was definitely my favorite part of working their."
bad,"small parts area, poor management, really far away. They have good Saturday events. need more signage, and marketing. Good group of sales people and service advisors"
bad,"uncomunicative manager / unreliable product / lack of support / old systems & too many systems. 90% of co workers good guys."
bad,"Mandatory overtime up to 12 hours per day 7 days a week. No respect for workers or their personal life. Hiring many ""temps"" to replace full-time workers. Temps do not have benefits and must work 7 days a week with no vacation or sick time allowed."
bad,The work schedules are horrible and they do not care about employees needing personal lives.
bad,dont be surprised when they move out of york. they are trying to make it as miserable as possible to work there till the contract is over.
bad,"There were two paths Harley took while I was there. In the past, they espoused caring and respect for the people on the floor. They tried at times to erase the distance between the senior leadership and the people who made the product. The last few years Harley has taken labor relations all the way back. I learned more in the first 15 years there about gaining trust and developing consistency with management. I learned the company's side of the business and believe they began to understand and respect the average employee. Overall, the hourly employees are hard working, dedicated to the customers. Now there is a dark pall over the shop floor full of distrust and angst. The hardest part of the job over the years was dealing with people who ignore the whole and only focus on the ""me"". That and the management persons who felt they had to step on someone to gain career advancement. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was developing the lasting friendships that came out of years of doing whatever it takes to get the job done."
bad,Only upper management make money  an the employee turnover rate is crazy   People always quitting cause they just don’t pay anything an never give raises  is terrible for someone trying to make a living at something they love and are great at!!  It’s a shame they don’t care enough about great hard working employees that make them alot of money an just get taken advantage of!!
bad,"I’m still asking myself, because I honestly don’t know and the managers can’t even come up with a reason. Your either in with the cool kids or they get rid of you."
bad,Terrible management. Don’t know how to communicate effectively. Everyone thinks they are in charge. No respect for employees. Unsafe work environments at times.
bad,"Poor work atmosphere. Long mandated overtime hours. Worked there three years with ""a carrot"" dangled over my head to be hired on, and that never happened. Company has no regard for employees well being or family life."
bad,"I worked at HD for 12 years. In the last 2 years of employment, the uncertainty of whether I would maintain my job was a daily concern. They played cut throat games of layoffs and relocation threats. Replaced full-time employees with casual workers. It was once a place of job security and feeling of appreciation. It slowly disintegrated into a place of low morale, poor quality and numbers only. The stress of uncertainty caused me to take a severance and leave. I do not recommend working there after all of their recent changes and now the sudden closing of Kansas City. You will never have peace of mind and you will only be a number."
bad,"Only the very top people at each store a paid a decent wage."
bad,constant fight between bullish manger and workers  Very stressful and no relax and no help support to learn.  Workers were slow and did not care and got away with anything.  Lots of theft.
bad,"Good HR work force"
bad,"If you speak up about a matter that needs to be addressed immediately you will be punished by reducing your pay. This company will clock you out for an hour for lunch remotely even if you only work 7 hours. General manager admitted he is a sexiest and he consistently harasses me. An undisclosed amount of Pay was taken from my check without my formal consent. I could go on, but you get the point. Good luck."
bad,Very aggressive and competitive culture. Coworkers were extremely rude and unprofessional. Objectives were unattainable. Constant criticism. Absolutely no work life balance.
bad,They treat workers like a number they don't care about their employees they overwork their employees til death and expect them to do the work even though the employees are tiered
bad,As a lower level manager most of the responsibilities get shifted to you.  Their needs always come before yours.  Nothing you ever do is good enough and they don't appreciate anything you do for them.  Upper management would much rather leave you alone while enjoying their funtime and then take away your earned time off.  If you are looking for an ounce of respect you sure wont get it here.
bad,Mean spirited owners with no interest in providing great customer service or professional workplace. Team members unhappy and extremely high turnover.
bad,"Management is a bunch of cut throats trying to make a name for themselves, company has it out for long time employees to get them out of there any way they can so they can hire lower paid workers, family obligations don't matter-can force you to stay late or suffer infractions, SOME of union reps help-others don't care, casual workers are lazy and company doesn't care - expects full time workers to ""pick up the slack"", claim they are a ""world class company"" but workers are forced to use broken equipment half fixed to work and cheap fixes, upper management only cares about the money they can stuff in their pockets before they leave/retire or are replaced"
bad,"HD has been an Icon in the US for 100+ years! The ""LEADERSHIP"" team is going to destroy what's left of the company. "
bad,The managers over work you they don't care about what you have to bring to the table and dont treat others fairly i loved the work just not the manger that was there at the time and got cussed out for putting in a two week notice and then when i came to work to finish my time i was treated very bad left work crying and didn't finish the two weeks
bad,This place is as cut throat as they come... There is no respect no honesty and someone is always trying to stab you in the back... As a Harley Davidson Owning person I would never recommend this place to anyone what so ever...
bad,"most days were fine, but if you could be blamed for something, you were. if there is an issue, they never speak with you about it, they just hold it against you"
bad,"Very busy work place, fun place to work always productive"
bad,"Management is constantly looking over and gets upset when you don’t make your goal. When riding season is over, the store slows down and there isn’t much you can do to make the goal. It’s unfortunate the owner is unappreciative and only comments on negative things. It makes for a very hostile and negative work environment. High turnover due to bad pay and management. It could be an amazing place to work."
bad,"No one “owns it” when they are wrong, managers act like they run the place and disregard any good creative feedback for development. The department is run in silos with little to group communication out side of these 10-20 minute meetings. Everyone pretends the place is great until your there over a month and realize people are miserable. Save yourself from thinking this is going to be great and go work in a place you will be valued."
bad,The management does not get along between service/sales and it causes a lot of problems in the work place. When I was working here I felt as if I were under an ammence amount of unneeded stress.
bad,The pay was great and I would've stayed but they kept messing up on my pay stubs. Worked a couple over time hours and it took them 2+ to fix the problem. So that was a big turn off and the hours for surge are terrible.
bad,"I was told in my interview for Service Writer that I could easily make the 48k a year I had asked for and that that was without even trying. Then when I finally shook hands with reality I learned that the store barely had enough business for their two existing service writers let alone a group of us. You can guess who was last."
bad,"They use to be a great company to work for, not anymore. They are driven by profits and keeping shareholders happy. They are sending many American jobs overseas."
bad,Horrible management from the top down. Out-sourcing or in-sourcing  everything. If you like the idea of working with ex-convicts then this is the place for you.
bad,The company is being run by poor marketing and management if this trend continues Harley’s future looks pretty bleak to say the least . This use to be a great company to work for under old management
bad,"Pros - You get to experience a brand like no other, The customers and employees are fanatics, Get to go to rallies and see the excitement first-hand, Riding and seeing riders on the road is very rewarding,  Cool Products, Quality, cosmetics and overall product appeal is unlike any other company, Your friends and family will be impressed that you work there,  The pay is about 10% better than other companies in the area, Benefits are good. However, raises are small,  CEO - Very smart and personable younger guy, knows how to command a room."
bad,Was sadly disappointed with the fact that they decided to take away a 1000 jobs gave little to no help with helping anybody find new employment would not recommend to anyone
bad,From the moment the new owners took over you could tell they had no clue what they were doing.  Now the what was great place to work is filled with despair and negativity.
bad,"A well paying job;however, our representation for the union was almost.nonexistent.   we had a meeting where they announced lay off dates and afterwards our supervisor notified those who would be affected from the lay off and they would have two weeks until it became effective.  Then three weeks later with no notice I was informed that I was working my last day and.I would.be laid off.and replaced by those who were already laid off"
bad,"Stressful place, long days, They do not care about the workers, Just the bottom line. When I first started it was a fun place to work, You work but it was fun place to work."
bad,Was a great place when I started every one was able to co-exist with no issues. Was a great team of people helping people. Then Harley managers started hiring the worst of the worst people and that little building went down really fast. I have seen so many people come and go. You are threatened yearly with possible lay off which is scary. People was taking off due to stress. The bonus structure changed and people and some was not bonus eligible. QA call was being graded at a record low for some people. The accounts was harder and harder to collect. There's a lot of bickering amongst the collectors. Promotions was at a record low and if you was one of the lucky ones to get promoted that was due to the mangers hand picking there FAV!!! Run do not stop at this place for a job you will regret it!!!!!
bad,Harley was a good place to work at first but the last 8 years was very poorly managed and moved operations overseas they still operate in York but no chance to relocate to that plant
bad,"New employees were making 18 an hour and I had 18 years making 32 an hour. And I STILL QUIT . No notice of overtime and they is way too much mandatory O.T. Chinese fire drill. Machinists can't keep up with the assembly line because machines are from the Korean War. Maintenance is in no hurry to fix your machine either so another 12 hour day. No family life. Revolving door of contract supervisors. Union USW is useless. Run away to GE if u can"
bad,Once you finally learn your job they move you to some other area where nobody wants to train you because they are afraid you will take their job. Horrible training. The smell in the plant is putrid. Takes 6 months to get used to. All big corporations are going to casual workers. Revolving door.
bad,Was a great place to work until new mgmt took over and sterted treating people terribly. Employees used to be self guided and we ran our groups. After 2011 management changed and they took over the day to day operations with no regard to input. Morale went down
bad,Four 10 hour work days with a large amount of shift continuation and several weekends. Quality of the product is compromised when issues arise in the assembly process. A lot of good people but as anywhere there are some with less ethics.
bad,"I worked there for over a year. Poor benefits, no vacation no raise no discount on parts I left to find a company that would at least appreciate my work"
bad,A fast-paced well-maintained work environment. A team environment was encouraged. Fellow employees were friendly and cooperative. The company took care of their employees very well.
bad,"After a year and a half of employment I walked away with extensive knowledge in the day to day use of the Micros Computer System and Microsoft Excel. Shipping and receiving from multiple vendors as well as stockroom managment and daily procurement. I performed daily and weekly manifest management and accounts receivable. Handled all cash and customer relations. "
bad,"   Weakest union I have ever worked for. Seniority based system leaves more than 50 % of the workforce ineffective. "
bad,"The job is a good place to work at, There are good people there to work with but the management and human resources are horrible, they do everything by “seniority” and I feel as though sometimes that can be misused, that privilege is abused by the people who have worked there longer than others."
bad,Very high pressure sales.  Policies and procedures overlooked and ran very out of control.  Turn of rate very high. No loyalty.  They will try and pay you the least as possible.  There is no annual review.  No one gets a raise unless you threaten to quick and they really need you.
bad,"While I greatly enjoyed meeting and working with the customers,  the overall management was severely lacking.  I did not feel appreciated from general manager or owner."
bad,Owners are running the business into the ground. I was promoted then told I was not allowed to manage my employees because they were sleeping with the owners family.
bad,"Unorganized and lacking demand for the brand.  Excellent product, very costly, small niche market, marketing is minimal and ineffective.  Great team that is going broke doing a job they love"
bad,Management does not care about the employees. Holding meets for the purpose of blaming the employee for the lack of business. Low morale. broken processes in every department. Long hours with little pay.
bad,"The supervisor i wokred under did not train me, she left the training up to a temp, when I made one mistake, she fired me.  II would not recommend anyone work there."
bad,"Odd environment, childish management and really sad well  below average pay. Perhaps I would have overlooked all this if I cared , even a little, about motorcycles. Really, the best part aboput working there was the coffee and ice-maker.."
bad,"High turnover due to poor management and underpaid employee's."
bad,A day at work was long. learned how to assemble certain parts on a motorcycle. management was ok. Work culture was prett ok. Hardest part of the job was the little breaks between a 10hr shift and not have seats for us to sit down if the line went down. Most enjoyable part was the Fitness center they provided for employees
bad,"Working conditions were busy and hot!"
bad,"I worked in sales and the money wasn't worth it. Management sucked, finance manager was a jerk. family ran and they all hated each other. Don't care about employees. It was all about how much money you could make for them. Glad to have left, and if you do anything they didn't like they question your integrity."
bad,Such a high turnover its hard to get the proper training to do the job correct. Since being under new ownership the quality of this company has gone down hill.
bad,"It can be chaotic sometimes between two shifts.  People are not working together as it should.  It's a union shop so there are challenges to overcome.  There were no on time communications in from management between area to area.  Always last minute decision trying to figure out what to do. Even though it has lot of challenges to overcome, I learned that you have to be on your toe, be flexible, and ready to make changes on the moment of notice. As difficult as it is, we met or exceeded the productions or requirements that make us a team by the end of shift no matter what other shift does or does not do.  We only worry about our shift working as a team."
bad,I was in sales in the apparel department apparel department and also did the displays in the showroom area. The company was okay to work for however I was only able to get part time hours and there was no room to advance with the company.
bad,If you are looking for advancement this is not the company for you .
bad,Sales of new and pre owned motorcycles
bad,"Nobody cares about anything, I found a major problem fixed it and my manager got a promotion for it!!!!!!!   I got fired for not showing up during a state of emergency.  They retracted and hired me back soon quit."
bad,"long hard hours , the union workers hate the temps coming in, they don't like training the temps, management doesn't care about you period just put good work or go home"
bad,"We fulfill dreams through the experiences of motorcycling, by providing to motorcyclists and to the general public an expanding line of motorcycles and branded products and services in selected market segments."
bad,work for the company for 4 years never considered for a raise or a company vechicle even though person worked with had one couldn't properly carry out job duties.
bad,"Suppose to start @ 7:30pm, but constantly extends shift to start @ 6:00pm, shift ends @ 6:00am. Full time regular workers don't want you there. Will start to accept you after you been there for awhile, but not fully. It's a place where the body of employment is divided. "
bad,"most of good management leaving,diffrent values in hourly and salery"
bad,I did not like the Management because I found it lacked work ethics that I am accustomed to.
bad,"The daily tasks and requirements continuously change and evolve depending on project progress. "
bad,very childish managers. they do not follow policy when reprimanding hourly employees. Lets personal feelings dictate the treatment of hourly employees.
bad,The product was interesting to work on and be associated with. As an employee you are stuck in one department. It would be nice to be able to change portion of bike design at some time.
bad,"Upper management treated employees bad, cursing, threatening, and belittling people on a daily basis. Corporate looked past it when a formal complaint was field because management produced sales and employees are expendable."
bad,"I had a sadistic manager who engineered my dismissal from the company.then HD sued me for $ 45,000 of rellocATION MONEY THEY CONFISCATED MY PAY CHECKS, MY VACATION PAY AND BONUS"
bad,"A typical day consists of making sure merchandise looks good on the floor, helping with inventory and moving new products. Customers are amazing!  Super competitive, and not for the faint of heart. Some sales experience makes a whole world of difference. Monthly individual sales goals must be met, as well as sales goals as a department."
bad,"The employee made my day when arriving to work.  We all worked as a family. And as a team."
bad,"HDKC was once a great place to work when they were still an HPWO work environment. Then the union and company worked more together and the employees felt they were part of the decision making process and had ownership in daily production and profits."
bad,"I went into my first interview and I waited over 45 minutes to speak to a manager just for him to tell me after waiting for 45 minutes that he would like to do my interview tomorrow morning and that he was just too busy even though I had three to four times I could have talked to him for more than a few minutes at a time. Their customers are more valued than their employees and a sell is always more important than you are.  "
bad,"A stressful work environment, upper management constantly micro managing employees and scrutinizing every move constantly. Upper management not actually knowing procedure in departments and causing headaches and low moral amongst the crew. The most difficult part of the job is not keeping customers happy, but rather keeping management happy."
bad,"Although I truly enjoyed the clients and the staff at Harley Davidson, the goals of Motorcycle Sales is truly unrealistic. When competing dealerships consistently undercut pricing, its hard to compete with that. Not to mention, sales managers who fail to make the customer happy results in you not making any money. Fun Job, but income is no where near consistent."
bad,Poor managers who didn't even acknowledge you even when you greeted them. Break neck work speed and very stressful environment. Only acknowledgement you got from supervisors was when you made a mistake.
bad,"Worked at Harley for over a year. Very high stress environment and without overtime, but work load would increase. Often times would work extra hours to compensate. No benefits and no communication with temporary staff and major layoffs over the holiday season."
bad,"Very fasted paced, I love waiting on customers and talking to them and making them feel welcomed at our dealership. The hardest part of the job is the walkinfg for 9 hours and going up and down stairs at least 35 times a day. Management takes sales away from some of us girls and gives them to other girls, we work for commission so it doesn't go overr to well. Causes alot of bad feeling between all of us."
bad,"Like many companies this one lost the connection between people and employees. They let finance and CEO steer decisions focused on the shareholders with little regard of how it affects employees, brand quality and loyal customers. Assembly plants and product/component purchases are rising everywhere in the world except the USA. This is no longer an American Made product that this company has floated on its entire existence. This is only sad to me because I have seen what this company once was and where they are now/going."
bad,"fix motorcycle , how to fix cycles. manager was abusive . fear of manager . dealing with manager lack of respect  for his techs. customers smiles when bike is completed"
bad,"partnering between union membership and company is non-existent and communication needs improvement. "
bad,"I worked for a month and got laid off, hired direct through the comapny, no temp bs, and legit got canned, the company is run by greedy corporate fools who do not care about their workers, or other peoples lives"
bad,"I don't have a lot of good things to say about a place that lays you off and replaces you with a ""casual worker""."
bad,"A hostile work environment almost from day one. Coworkers and management yell at some employees or give them the silent treatment. Commission is given to other employees for some sales by management and by cashiers. The cut throat nature is encouraged and made a part of the work culture.My manager called one employee""SAS-hole"" every day as if it were a term of endearment.  "
bad,Negative energy flows more often than not. Casuals and long timers continuously battle indirectly rather than working as a team. We all love motorcycles but diversity is not accepted in every area of the company.
bad,"From the outside Harley-Davidson seems like an awesome opportunity for a young engineer recently out of school. Unfortunately the management and union environment make it a pretty miserable place to work. Working 55+ hrs a week for months on end as a salaried, over time exempt employee is pretty tiring especially when some of that time is over weekends and there is no comp time. Benefits are good but that’s not enough to keep anyone there long term."
bad,"Great pay and benefits but extremely political and can not trust anyone. Go in knowing you will work hard but not change the world, follow orders and you will be set."
bad,HD was very stressful and extremely toxic. A lot of people there in the Tomahawk plant disliked the plant and the hours. They had no work life balance.
bad,The good old boys network and incompetent management have run this company into the ground. Its a shame because it could be a nice place to work. Most people that have come to work here find themselves extremely disappointed.
bad,"Harley is in a downward spiral which comes from poor leadership at the top. They continue to seek leadership from outside, but fail to bring in quality persons. The core employees of the company believe in what they do and the product they build. Continued development for employees inside the organization is not good. The company continues to cut internal benefits like college funding and medical benefit. H-D uses excuses of the how other companies provide benefits for these reductions, but the current employees believe it is to make up for losses on the bottom line."
bad,Harley Davidson was a dealership with a can do attitude. I worked doing service maintenience and custom jobs. I got the opportunity to renew my certifications.
bad,"I enjoy working for this company in regards to helping our customers with whatever their needs are and to go above and beyond what is expected of me. "
bad,"Was owned by the same people for 50 years. When they owned it, it was a wonderful place to work. Once the new owner came in everything went downhill.."
bad,"Those days of great union jobs are gone. Harley has No more benefits, no raises, no bonuses, no full time, now it's contract or temporary. for six months then you're gone and no guarantee you'll get it back. They even dropped their employee wages by 70%"
bad,"Harley-Davidson is not stuck in the past when it comes to vision or product. But, the day-to-day execution and corporate culture remains mired in old ways of thinking. Systems are beyond outdated. Management structures are rigid. Processes are not clear. And advancement seems to be based on who you know, not what you know or how you perform."
bad,"There are different class of workers at Harley Davidson, the regular hired workers, the casual hired workers & casual temporary workers."
bad,Everyone will be nice to your face and then be against you when you'r not around. Some people were so great to be around but management will not help you with anything. The pay is horrible for the work you have to do.
bad,Harley Davidson uses a temp agency (crane freight) to hire and pay all drivers. My estimation is they just don't want any future problems with unions. Overall environment is pretty safe and clean. I had to work there a while before I could be just another number. I wasn't considered worthy to be just another number at first. I had to work my way up to number status.You must be ever vigilant in the pursuit of cattle status. Near impossible to have a family life or to be healthy.
bad,"Work day starts very early but provides a discount from the power company.  Most of the people there are kind and compassionate.  There is too much focus on providing shareholders with a profitable return instead of understanding the shop floor process and improving on it."
bad,"Too many layoff, no genuine care for workers, two unions within company walls too scared to make waves in order to retain their own  jobs...pitiful company, would never go back!"
bad,The co workers are great. Hardest part of the job is not having enough time in the day to complete all tasks.
bad,"Harley Davidson - Keeping it American made... yet they treat their Casual employees like second class citizens, without any rights or room for any advancement. Truly the American Dream."
bad,"Harley-Davidson is a well known and iconic brand with 116 years of history. Unfortunately, the company has not kept up with the changing consumer preferences and is now in a very difficult business environment. The current executive team of the organization does not seem to be effectively leading through these challenges, The result is that many talented employees are leaving or are too afraid for their jobs to take risks and create change. The current culture is fear based and very negative."
bad,Extremely high pressure on front line leaders to meet all goals and expectations in short time. Co-workers are great but union environment can be hard to deal with at times.
bad,Harley Davidson was a great employer until they decided to close the Kansas City plant.  This was not known by the employees until 1 year before plant closed.  Started losing perks and benefits 3 years before closure.  I was in assembly.  Management was fair until they started bringing temporary leads from the outside that knew nothing about our product.  That was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with
bad,"Now it is ran and managed by inexperienced individuals that have either risen to their position by having been there for longer than others, or by people who new management brought in to ""fix"" the issues. For example, the new president brought in an instagram influencer to help us understand how to better do our jobs. This ""influencer"" never went to college, does not work in the industry and has no experience what-so-ever, yet they are going to make everything perfect. This mentality is going to destroy the brand and send the already sinking company into bankruptcy. Having been there over 10 years, I have seen these people come and go, but in today's economy and environment, HD is poised to fade away sooner than later."
bad,"Employee for 20+ years, and then put out on the street because upper management decided that they couldn't justify having two manufacturing facilities open.  They sent part of the product to PA,  and the rest to Thailand,  India, and Vietnam."
bad,"Got hired as a porter, I was told there were opportunities for advancement. After I was hired I asked around and they were planning on keeping me in the same position for a long time. I asked about eventually becoming a tech and they said it is 40,000 out of pocket to go to school at MMI, no thank you."
bad,Harley Davidson is struggling. If you don't sell bikes technicians have no bikes to wrench on. Cause you bank on the service plans for easy hours and up selling when they come back
bad,"I didn't benefit from here. Some coworkers are nice, others not as much. I did not get good hours or pay. I was not a fan of the way the store was ran. Some things were just too unorganized."
bad,Been at Harley was a good experience for me I provided good work but also being a Harley casual if anything happened I was the first to go home I was the first to be laid off and at the end that's what it was me being laid off
bad,"inspection of motorcycles "
bad,A very stressfull work enviroment and that dosent even envolve the customers. The owner make it impossible to do their jobs including family being in management even thow they have no qualifications to be their. Watch all profits get spent outside of the business and then be blamed for profis being down.
bad,you needed to meet company guide line all ways making sure that the share holders were happy. Paying union dues with no benefits. lots of gossip with co workers. 1000 workers being laid off every year.
bad,"Harley Davidson is a great company per the brand name.  There is no leniency for illnesses or being late regardless of the circumstance.  Certain managers that are in leadership roles should not be in that position to have authority.  They lack people skills, and abuse their power.  There is a lot of underhand things going on that the employees will not bring up to executives or HR for fear of their jobs, or nothing being done to change the environment.  The collection floor was very quiet and had no energy.  There weren't many African Americans in authority positions.  This could be counted on 1 hand, and your opportunity to advance in the company reaches a ceiling.  However, the hours were decent."
bad,As an employee I was in a cut throat and competitive environment.  Management was not present and as a middle manager I was often given tasks to complete in an unorganized time frame.
bad,The told temp workers they would go uniun and they uniun pulled back it was not good pay for the work we were doing and it was a fare drive and mandary over time and all management was new
bad,The company continues to go through a lot of change in a tough and competitive market place.  They're trying to find their place and struggling with what's next.  It's filled with great people who truly love the brand.  They need leadership to use those great people to do what they do best and support them.  Stronger leadership and delivering affordable products has to be their top priority.
bad,"A lot of mixed feelings about the job. Not much to say. I worked alone. Little staff. Small work area, a lot of tasks to do with little to no help."
bad,"Micro Management and Lack of Professionalism"
bad,"To get promoted will probably come once every blue moon. The discounts are tolerable. What makes this job fun is the bikers that visit the store. There are always a few ""regulars"" that brighten your working days. Coworkers are always fun too!"
bad,Harley has adapted a casual work program which allows them to lay off employees as they see fit due to production needs but makes it hard for casual employees to move forward within the company
bad,"This company is one of the most prominent companies in Milwaukee and the US.  Unfortunately you will be a contractor for years and given promises for full time employment, however it may never come true. "
bad,Productive while attempting to focus on safety.  Continually improving processes while focusing on quality.
bad,"no benifits for causual workers, no paid holidays or paid vacations,resentment from regular workers"
bad,"Harley Davidson was a great place to work until the restructuring begin. Everyone thought once you started there, you would stay until you could retire. Where else do the employees wear the company logo by choice daily and have the company name tatooed on their body? Now, the employees are miserable and can not wait leave. Many have taken the voluntary layoff."
bad,co-workers were good to work with. I will decline commenting on management
bad,Harley is a great company to work for but the store in which I worked was all about popularity contests. If the manager was in a bad mood they took it out on the employees and set sales goals way to high for new employees. Workers would drink on the job and not be reprimanded for it yet new employees wouldn't sell enough and get fired. The turn over is crazy there and it's not due to employees not working their hardest.
bad,They will hire you on and pay interns well but nobody will have time to train you to do anything. Your day will consist of data entry and organizing PPAPs and other random paperwork.
bad,"The building is very old and they have no desire to move into a more modern facility. They are a very old school type of company, refusing to adapt to the changing industry."
bad,"I will always feel honored to have worked for a legendary brand like Harley-Davidson, but am extremely concerned about the overall direction and future of the company"
bad,"This company needs to leave Kansas City. They say that the jobs are moving to York PA. But with the recent construction of a plant in Taiwan, I hardly doubt this to be the case."
bad,"Harley Davidson was a great place to work.  That is until you figure out their game.  They use the promise of being hired on permanently, to get people to work  their 'surge'.  A  6 month long period, where they do an increase of motorcycles and need to hire 100's of people who are willing to sign up for a temporary job.  That's how they get you in the door."
bad,"Not impressed with this company, they hire mostly contact workers and give no benefits and no vacation time. The pay is good, the people here are good to work with. I don't see management hardly ever."
bad,"I would not work for a Harley Davidson dealership again. The work is very seasonal and its a revolving door. I ride a Harley daily but did get a chance to do much except the back and forth to work while I was here. There is no salary in sales, commission only. Hard to eat when its cold outside and nobody is riding."
bad,"Collections is not fun to begin with, but this place doesnt value its employees which only makes it worse. The people are great, the management is horrid. Glad to be out of there."
bad,"Good work/life balance but new employees are expected to work years without any benefits, despite full time hours and union dues."
bad,A typical day at work would be to monitor the production floor and support the engineers with the SAP system. Me and my team performed database maintenance on all systems.
bad,"SO much drama and he said she said. From the get go I was accused of so much. The company is ""at will"" hire and fire, meaning if they simply didn't like you - you're gone. Boss was scared of confrontation, meaning he/she never came to you about anything instead complained to other Employees. Very unprofessional, very flexible. If you're a college student looking for a nice relaxed part time job, awesome. If you're looking for a career or a long term stay, don't bother. Orlando, Harley, is a horrible Franchise."
bad,The management would never be on work on time they never keep promises as of raises. There are no health benefits. Tho I learned much of the process of shipping and receiving and parts to service. I had to learn this on my own no hands on training ever ( I was lucky that I went to MMI and got first hand training in this)
bad,"Harley has long benefitted from the aura of the brand. Maybe too long."
bad,"It appears as if you weren't apart of the team unless your relatives worked there prior. A click if you will, can determine who stays or goes. Had no opportunity to further employment at the company"
bad,"Meh. Blah blah blah, you piece of shot, sell more. I remember when I was a drill sgt, WTF is your problem!!? Have you made 12 targeted calls/texts/emails/annoyances?"
bad,"Management is constantly trying to squeeze every dollar out of the operation. Very little collaboration between management and the union. I’m not surprised KC closed. "
bad,"Culture varies from department to department, but overall a great experience.  Common spaces take hierarchy and management levels  away from the discussion."
bad,If it was not being consolidated into another facility i would recommend anyone looking for good pay and endless hours to apply and work here. The job is competitive and challenging but not back breaking.
bad,It has its ups and downs like any place > do your job and dont get wrapped up in sillineness . its great meeting customers and the discount is reallu good
bad,"not very secure job, management seems to not know what they are doing. work over all is pretty ease, depending on which department you are in. also if you want to get in as the work force, expect to be stuck as a temp for 3 plus years."
bad,management not experienced to deal with people (engineers in management positions) leads to one track thinking and mistakes that effect quality and production
bad,"Answering phones"
bad,"working in sales among other co-workers was very busy, always having to stay on the look out for new clients and sales. I learned that you have to be fair and know your product. My co-workers were all fun and we were all on the same page when it came to fairness. The hardest part about working there was not having the size or the product for the client, but reassuring them that we could get it. Overall it was a great place to work if you can handle pressure of a sales goal."
bad,"The people and the job were great, but The casual program was a total lie!"
bad,"Working at the H-D Motorcycle production facility offers multiple opportunities to learn and grow daily from professionals who understand how to operate an manufacturing facility efficiently, while maintaining safety standards and executing continuous improvement initiatives. This can be observed across multiple departments within H-D"
bad,"Once upon a time I would have given H.D. a 5 star review, however it's not the same H.D. it once was. They used to pay their employees an excellent wage and treat them wonderful, not the case anymore. They cut the pay a good bit for new hires...creating some animosity between co-workers on the floor. They also cut quit a few of the benefits they once had. They had extensive layoffs claiming they had to reduce the workforce, all the while bringing a casual in to replace every full time employee they laid off. They used threats of moving to get employees to sign union contracts. Its a shame upper management ruined what was a great company."
bad,The type of culture and management style varies greatly depending on location. It's great to work with an interesting product with a loyal customer base.
bad,"Explained the benifits of Harley ownership to customers. Educated customer on the products. Responsible for finding appropriate financing of vehicle as well as the prep and delivery of the motorcycle to customer."
bad,I come in and start working on my queue. I enjoy working with the customers. I love the Harley-Davidson brand and Bar and Shield.
bad,"I loved working for Harley, but the owners wouldn't pay what one is worth. The customers were amazing and so welcoming. The coworkers were great too, but when you can't pay your bills, you have to move on."
bad,I enjoyed my time at HDMC. There were many fun times but it is not as fun as it once was. The company is struggling. The best part of the job is the people.
bad,Harley Davidson of Wausau is a great place to work. There are pros such as the hours available and cons such as the lack of communication and support towards new employees.
bad,"it is a very competitive work environment, everything was very messy due to new owners, it was fast paced and constantly busy due to running events. I would not suggest it to someone else."
bad,"Unprofessionalism at its finest, Utter disrespect. The HR is unworthy, funny business. Worst job in my whole 27 years in the workforce, a lot of nonsense."
bad,the people you work with are great.  The manager doesn't know what he is doing and all the techs will tell you that.  He only looks at numbers and thats it.  in that occupation you need to realize problems come up and time is needed.
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work, but the current general manager manages by fear. He likes to swear and pound fists to get what he wants. A totally toxic environment that I’m glad to be out of. "
bad,"Gran empresa en su origen, va perdiendo esa cultura que la hizo tan potente durante años. Falta de visión a largo plazo actua.mente."
bad,"The benefits and salary are good,  The morale and the environment did not work well for me.  I am an individual who is able to work well independently as well as in a group environment.  My mental and physical health is important to me and my family."
bad,Showing up to work wondering if the doors are open goes through your mind everyday.  Sometimes wonder how the place is still running with the management there
bad,"I was repeatedly told by my manager that physical objectification and harassment were part of the job as a woman, and that I shouldn't have expected anything different working here. Heard the owner of the company withheld an unfair amount of money from some salespeople's paychecks."
bad,Harley is very casual and laid back. The management style is hands off. Employees have all bought into the Harley Life Styles.
bad,Its a great place to easily work your way up because the company is small and it is great for meeting people from across the world.
bad,I loved working on Harley but everything has to do with HR and HR messing everything up one week your paycheck was normal the next it wasn't he never told you when you were working overtime I love the people I work with I wish I could work there the rest of my life but unfortunately they're closing the doors I love to work with the forklift because I feel like I can be left alone once I know what I'm doing I just do it and I go you don't have to watch me I'm a very hard worker the best thing about me is I come to work every day I'm one of those perfect attendance cash and so since school so if you want to get hard worker pick me because I'll come to work every day no matter if it's bad weather or not I'm your guy
good,"great company to work for but the employees i have worked with make it impossible to be happy to work in the company I love the most."
good,They use and abuse people they bring you in as a casual and under pay you to do the same work the regulars do.They work you like crazy then lay you off for 6months .No paid vacation and insurance is bad .they make you wait 5yrs beforfe they consider to hire you on....Terrible experinece
good,The actual job is very fast paced. The work is fun. Upper management and HR have no idea what everyone thinks about the company. They constantly use all of the employees to a point where it is totally sickining to the stomach. They offer no benefits to the casual workforce and penalize you for having a life outside of Harley.
good,"Would not recommend  this company as a place to work at this time. Lack of leadership, union/management relations poor. Very degrading culture. Company very unstable. Have laid off employees for 8 years straight. It’s a joke that every Oct. they announce a reorganization. Because they don’t manage budgets well, budgets are froze to be able to meet the budget at Year end."
good,"The pay rate is good, but the management and orginization not so good. it has been many layoffs within the last year, many employees dont feel the stability that they once felt."
good,benefits suck. multiple layoffs in past 2 years. large workload for those who retain positions. often hires contract employees who don't get benefits or vacation time and lose their jobs after a period of time.  steer clear if possible!
good,Management culture change after the 100th Anniversary.  Enjoyed the goal focus to reach the 100th anniversary milestone.
good,"There are some good people there, but most leadership, especially in marketing, is arrogant, condescending and does not live up to the company values or brand legend."
good,"I do not feel that I was judged fairly at how I did my job and some of the co-workers were child like when it came to certain things, also I felt that I was being watched like a hawk."
good,"I was a project designer. I learned valuable people skills both inside and outside the company. The culture has changed reflecting market values, The hardest part of the jobs was working towards non-stated expectations. I enjoyed being able to overcome these situations an still to deliver quality to product timelines,"
good,"Culture at Harley-Davidson has become deplorable. Lack of advancement opportunities, poor management, little to no benefits make it impossible to stay around long term."
good,"Culture was very stressful, limited time away from work area to compensate for stress in job."
good,"Good job for someone that isn't looking for year round employment with benefits. Union dues will be collected as a casual Harley employee, but without the same representation or pay scale as full time employee."
good,It's a sales job. I loved the product and met some nice people.
good,"The work was challenging some days. But, overall it was rewarding. I could feel some accomplishment at the end of the day. I saved the company $1000's by reworking parts and returning them to the line. Management usually did a great job taking care of problems that arose. Like, low in parts inventory, breaks, etc. I'd say the hardest part of the job was having to leave it after almost 10 years of service...due to company downgrading and hiring temps. Very disappointing. The best part of the job; I made a lot of new friends and I always love Harley's since I was a small child. So, it was a pleasure to work there."
good,It was a good place to work until they closed the facility due to a bad business decision in my opinion. but they did what they did and put over 1000 people out of jobs
good,"Very interesting workplace, get the opportunity to meet new groups of people and get to help with the special events which offer perks to employees."
good,"Good management,funny workplace culture, more knowledge to get from this company, very good environment, knowledge of TPM, FPY, CPH, PPS and CIS system in production"
good,"Time to get back to real world. Like it but pay isnt great.  Its cool,get cool clothes and stuff pretty cheap insurance is good byt pay is too low.  Back to reality"
good,"Any department except for the accounting department has fun. The accounting department is all women, they talk amongst themselves and rarely include anyone else in any social conversation. Only work, no fun."
good,"Held service adviser,parts,rentals and some times bike pick ups and delivery. For same pay no more pay just more jobs added to your list to do, during summer time worked two weeks back to back with one day off, on the flip side during winter time worked about 20 hrs a week."
good,Good for young workers. Wages and benefits were horrible. The shifts were bad because it didn't allow u to have a life. The management treated you poorly.
good,Great second job or primary job if you have financial freedom. Slow advancement and low salary ceiling. Challenging riding environment but will greatly expand your riding confidence and offers a new challenge every day. Great place to work overall but just a few draw backs that can really be deal breakers.
good,"i was not employed by harley davidson, my father works for them and at functions, openings ect i would attend the functions to assist the staff in waitressing and customer service."
good,"I started my day with looking reports, making sure everythingwas done from the day before, I would do my title work and funding first, then move on to back up Finance."
good,"Hard work. hard on joints and muscles. Co workers hard to deal with at times. Management not very good, and corporate don't care about workers."
good,the currently have a casual program that offers no placement for full time or a benefit package.
good,the work was not hard but steady. if you work on the assembly line you were busy other than that the paint shop and fab areas weren't bad
good,"I prefer to use my creative talents in an environment where it is encouraged.  All dealerships are the same, a lot of warranty work, too many techs, not enough work"
good,"Did not give a good review,due to the fact"
good,Helped many customers everyday with many issues. Very fun business with lots of activities.
good,"The decline started about 5 years ago. It's hard to believe that a person who has pursued a Master's degree and has taken advantage of internal training in CI and PM, would not be placed in a position after a departmental transformation. When management at the company realizes the paycheck is not the motivation, but pride for working for an iconic brand, they will then realize what the sign at the power train plant meant by employees being the most valued asset. However margins and stock price has become more important and leadership has turned into job protection."
good,"Decent pay, benefits are below average and getting worse year after year."
good,Just a normal manufacturig work day that sometimes very hectic and chaotic and confusion due to inability of management figuring out what to do.  I leaned invaluable experience working with supervisor with leadership responsibility day to day operations of production.
good,The powers to be at Harley do not listen to operators on the floor until it because a massive issue and snow balls production. Employees are expected to work 12 hrs a day and mandated weekends regardless of family plans.
good,"Very stressful job. Repetitive type of work, long hours. High turn around. Np work-life balance. Management aiming to achieve goals no matter cost of workers."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. I am constantly helping the motor clothes sales team put out new inventory, restock, and bin locate all of the merchandise. While also trying to cashier out customers, and answer other customers questions about merchandise on the floor. I usually end up clocking in early because the girls always need my help with tasks. If I am not on the floor I am at the front desk answering phone calls and greeting customers. This is usually the break I take in the day, beside a lunch, to catch my bearings. It lasts a total of maybe 10 minutes a day. I also am in charge of change in the cash drawers so I make sure that change is restocked in the morning and counted at night."
good,"it was an honor to work for HD, and the education that is available is priceless if motorcycles are your life. My service manager was the best boss I have ever had and loved %99 of the entire staff."
good,I worked in buffing most of the time which I really enjoyed.  My position was a casual so there were no benefits or vacation to earn. The pay was descent and people were good work with. The company as a whole doesn't care about their employees and their needs.  I was laid off from my position via phone not in person.
good,"Harley Davidson used to care about the employees and families, but now it is all about $$ like most businesses. They used to offer great things but now only give the minimum. It used to be a place you could bank on retiring from, but now you never know when you will get laid off or the facility will move."
good,I have no review to add about the company I am currently employed with.It is a typical manufacturing environment. I work 10 plus hours a day four days a week.
good,"I was pleased to have had the opportunity to work and sell something that I was very passionate about at that time in my life. Motorcycles had always been a passion of mine from an early age and have loved having one for relaxation. The hardest part of my job was getting someone to purchase a luxury item. Not everyone needs a motorcycle, but lots of people want one. The most enjoyable part of my job was selling someone that has the same passion as you and sharing that experience by having them make a purchase. I loved watching their excitement as they rode off."
good,"A typical day at work starts with making sure you are at work before 7:30 so that you can get all of the paper work ready for the customers before thy book there motorcycle in to the workshop @8:00"
good,"Not very interesting for me.  Did not stay busy at all. "
good,"Looking to better myself, experience and knowledge. The only thing enjoyable about this facility is the co-worker."
good,My experience had positive experiences. I learned a lot and made some life time friends. The company put value on products over employees. The companies focus became its profit.
good,"For the most part, the paint lines at Somo were a blast to work on the people were great and some were fun to be with.  The people were very helpful when you had a question about something."
good,"Good pay, good benefits."
good,"Used to be a great company to work for. In 2011 the company decided to not participate in a HPWO anymore. Management wanted to be in control of all operations where, during the HPWO years, the union members ran their respective groups. Planner, continuous improvement, safety, quality, accountability and new products were the roles we ran in conjunction with salary personnel. We we're highly successful as a plant prior to 2011 and since productivity and quality has been on a downward trend."
good,"I like the business casual environment. I enjoyed motivating, supporting, and encouraging associates to succeed and grow within the company. Learned to be a manager."
good,"There was no team effort at this company.  No cross training and the working conditions were hostile with a number of employees at anyone given time."
good,Harley Davidson is a great company because of its stability and history. Hi-Paced and great benefits. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement though.
good,"I consider my occupation at Harley Davidson to be your basic ordinary speed is a need paced, ""let's push the line to get parts out"" manufacturing job."
good,Great brand. Lots of internal politics and high employee turnover.  Yearly reorg is the norm but the same people stay on top. no employee retention or growth opportunities
good,"The location and employees were great to be associated with. Management and owners at Clare's Harley Davidson are horrible people to deal with. They treat employees as their private possessions. "
good,"No leadership at the top of the house. The company doesn't meet targets and employees are let go. No changes at the top and the company continues to not meet goals. Until big changes are made at the top, I would not consider employment here."
good,"Working for Harley-Davidson, the brand, is amazing! Working at Desperado Harley-Davidson is hard, management is extremely unprofessional and constantly losing great customers because of the general manager. Being there for years I've gone through 3 different owners and 5 different General Managers. Store is sadly going through a downward spiral slowly."
good,"Typical day is 9 hours worked and additional hours upon request by management or business needs. Peers were enjoyable and personable, management appears to be struggling in these economic times."
good,"Overall, a fairly good place to work, but the culture is shifting to be more cut-throat and competitive.  Management pushes hard, but doesn't take care of their employees anymore.  Long hours are the norm.  The more hours you work, the more that becomes the expectation."
good,"Management is very self centered and constantly looking to ""climb the corporate ladder"" using any one to achieve their personal goals. Co-workers gossip on a regular basis and there are many in-shop affairs between co-workers. The hardest part of the job is being forced to work with people that think they know what they are doing when in reality they really have no true machining skills. There is a lot of stress and there is little to nothing about the job that is enjoyable."
good,"I found that being a service technician is both rewarding and fun. You can play DR fix it and then take the bikes out for a test ride. On a negative note,there really isn't any job stability. I have seen a lot of people come and go. this is definitely a dog eat dog industry."
good,• Handle all accounts with customers to avoid charge off accounts
good,I liked this job because I always had something to do. The management was not very friendly. They would not allow more hours.
good,"If you are a full time employee, Longterm casual, H-D casual, or temp. Don’t even think about missing a day. You acquire more points then aloud. Expect termination. You can not excuse the absence with a doctors note, or even an ER note. The only way your absence is being excused is if your admitted fully into the hospital. You better be dying to miss a day of work at Harley Davidson. That being said , if you have young children do not expect Harley Davidson to accommodated you."
good,When I started it was ok until they hired than laid off just to use you for 6 months of the year. Now they took away pensions from the new hires. Money good but the rest is gone. Corporate greed. I enjoyed working for them till the workers were just a number
good,H-D does not know how to balance work and life. Production trumps all else. The executive leadership team grossly over estimates the power of the brand vs providing a superior product.
good,"H-D used to be a top-notch employer. The current Leadership has lost focus on the people who make things happen in manufacturing. Without manufacturing having support, everything else erodes will with it."
good,working at this company was very fulfilling. the people worked as a team to get work done. management allowed input and took into consideration. overtime was excessive at times but i grew accustomed to it. hardest part was seeing the company close kc locaion.
good,"No clear defined expectations for salary and support staff, hourly entry level jobs very lucrative and easy.  Job culture was very negative and union members did not want to accept the movement of the company, bringing any projects to a standstill."
good,Gros roulement de personel. Le patron est trop sévère et contrôlant.
good,Plant is closing in 9 months so I do not recommend trying to start a career.  Unless you are looking for a salary position and are willing to relocate.
good,"Most of the employees make if fun, and relaxed, it's fun working around bikes. The down side is poor management,  the only manager that cared about employees is the one that hired me, other than that, the rest of management made it stressful,  and the pay is not very good, unless your management."
good,I love helping my customers and getting what they want or need for their ride. Going above and beyond the job to make sure they have a best customer service. Over the years here my customers have turned into family members.
good,"As long as you are looking for part-time work, this is a great environment to be in. Expect very long days and little to no time off. Management styles vary within the different departments. Some managers are great and productive while others like to pass all of their work onto others. Very little recognition and a lot of hard work."
good,"* Great Atmosphere"
good,"fun place to work, learned how to build a motorcycle. and Certified Forklift operator and instructor.  Warehouse work and receiving materials."
good,Your experience is completely dependent upon the group and manager within Harley-Davidson. Corporate culture is much better in some areas than others.  I suggest networking and asking internal employees about their experiences as opposed to judging as an entire entity.
good,high volume restaurant on the las vegas strip allowed me to meet a variety of people from around the world.  my co-workers were all pleasant to work with.  management was stern and knowledgable in the service industry.
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting customers and taking personal information to process credit applications. Obtaining any stipulations needed for funding, and processing DMV and financial paperwork to finalze loans."
good,"There really isn't a typical day at Harley Davidson they make sure to switch your job up daily to avoid burning out which is enjoyable."
good,"strong management leadership, new to SAP HANA and deployment solutions."
good,"Seasonal employee so let go in the fall. Really needed permanent employment."
good,"You are not working for the Corporation when you work at a dealership.  They are a franchise and therefore work environment subject to change depending on management.  In my experience unfortunately, it was not quality of workmanship or knowledge but billable hours."
good,I enjoyed working with everyone there and it definitely set up my mindset on what I need to give my employer for a good relationship and I hope to find that in a better fitting job for my schedule.
good,"when i worked here, the management was awful. they are under new management now and have many new employees and managers, i believe things have improved."
good,"Some times it could be intense due to problems  that would stop the line but, overall it was a good place to work and the pay was descent. I looked forward to the work because it was exciting to build the motorcycles."
good,A normal day at Harley was a monotonous parts job that didn’t hold my attention very well. Looking for a challenge in my career and it wasn’t able to supply that.
good,"environment is busy and fast pace"
good,There's a pride of working at HDMC and it's very noticeable and helps with the environment. If the pride wasn't there it would be more rough to work there. It's rough when people ask for help and you can't get done what you need done because people don't want to listen to others ideas.
good,"It was a fun job to work at, with all the events they had. Down fall is, they did not offer enough hours. Couldn't even live off one single pay check."
good,fast paced I liked it but did not want to give raises that they said when time came for them to give. so I had to get two jobs good thing they where my second job.
good,"I can get along well with the other staff since i have been working with them for quite sometime. "
good,harley davidson is a world all in its self. pay is good. be prepared for lots of conflict. lay offs are almost a definete . benifits are decent but expect to work weekends.
good,"I enjoyed my time at HDFS, however, my role became overwhelming with the amount of work expected due to leadership demands and regulatory mandates.  I learned of my strong work ethic and that corporate culture can be great but sometimes too expansive to dive deep into your interests unless you plan on investing time into growing within the company.  I enjoyed the opportunities for learning there and the company events.  I felt almost everyone there was overworked and generally stressed (at least in my department)."
good,"Great place to work if you're high on the seniority list.  If not, you might go thru a layoff process. The upside to working there, is the competitive pay."
good,Fun to work there. Great coworkers. Great atmosphere. Fast pace work a lot of paperwork and cold calls.  Not much work for everyone. Events dident bring in to much bisness
good,harley davidson is a great name brand currently they are going through some problems laying off employees you can never predicte your future there working at harley davidson
good,"Loved my time at Harley, but I was relying on the idea that management would try to hire me direct, It wasn't until I put in my notice to leave that they asked me why I had not applied!!! My response was, ""why didn't you suggest this before I went and found another job?"" The place is always going thru some sort of growth or reorganization in the last few years, but still... Try to hire those contractors who you want to keep!!!"
good,"as with any big comp[any greed got y=the best of them and if the are still in business in 5 years it will be a wonder, they have hired unskilled workers to produce their products and layed off all of the skilled labor."
good,"Since starting with the company, they've eliminated or reduced:"
good,Environment with ever changing business needs; need leadership able to devise long term strategy rather than micromanage.  Lack of consistency in expectations; need to be able to adapt and be flexible dealing with ambiguous environment.
good,Great employee's and for the most part good management but upper level management is very aggressive at letting employees go without HR following their own rules.
good,I am a security officer with Universal Protection Services.  This company is horrible to work for.  They are unorganized and there isn't much room for advancement.
good,"I am currently a final vehicle mechanic. My typical day includes repairing vehicles, coordinating schedules for my 12 team members, scheduling training, evaluating tools and replacement parts. Harley  has almost 115 years of production history. When I first started at Harley Kansas City functioned as an HPWO. We were a functioning HPWO for 12 years (I held a number of leadership roles at the work group level through plant leadership). I was a Non-traditional for six years, my roles involved developing new products, materials replenishment, creating and maintaining work instructions. Additionally, I was also responsible for training NWG employees for all new model content and process improvements. The past five years Harley has functioned as a traditional work place, and I have been a team lead for the past three years."
good,Was a great company with past ownership. New ownership is destroying what was a wonderful work place and great customer care!
good,Very corporate driven.  Not allowing a lot of individuality.  Lack of trust between union and management.  Employees concerns not always addressed.
good,"Dealership no longer in business."
good,Poorly managed dealership. No room for career/financial growth.
good,"Assemble motorcycles "
good,"I am responsible for completing motocycle inspections and deliver motorcycles to customers. Responsibilities include picking up bikes that have broken down on the highway, businesses, or at customer residence. Transport customers when they have been stranded due to breakdown and deliver new bike purchases. I work with sales, mechanics, and parts department sales. The hardest part of my job is loading heavy motorcycles into the bed of pickup trucks and the most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers and building relationships. I enjoy driving the truck around the metroplex and picking up different types of bikes to bring in for service."
good,"HD has great benefits and above average compensation.  The work hours are flexible.  These great benefits come at a high price:  internal integrity issues, in-fighting, lack of job security and a non inclusive combative culture."
good,Learned every end of company by moving around positions helping every Department good experience to learn ins and outs of a dealership environment. Nice job for younger generation
good,"Great company.  Owner changed.  Enjoyed working there.  Great customer service skills. Previous coworker was coming off maternity leave,  so I moved to to cutting hair."
good,gretchen was literally the most evil women i have ever encountered. I would have stayed there for life it wasnt for her. The rest of my expiernce there was great shes the only problem.
good,Started as a great company.  Over the years and the company decision to off-shore work ruined the atmosphere and feeling of security.  Best thing about the company was some lifelong friends I made.
good,Great experience working with motorcycles that I love on a daily basis. Not fun to work every weekend and several late evenings. Very competitive among other sales people.
good,I am not a fan of corporate leadership. they are closing down our factory here in Kansas City and laying us off. this was the better running plant but politics doomed our plant
good,Great place to work but management decided to close the plant and move all production to York Pennsylvania and foreign countries.  Outsourcing and changes in their philosophy I think caused the plant to be less competitive.
good,"As a Co-op/intern at the Tomahawk facility I had an I opening experience into what American manufacturing looks like and it was an awesome learning experience as a student. However the days were very long (50+ hour work weeks) and the days start early. Direct supervisors were either extremely helpful or almost entirely absent. Work environment was entirely dependent on your attitude, It was great for myself but I saw coworkers have a less then pleasant time with operators."
good,Super fun and upbeat environmental work space. I love working with the customers on a daily basis to satisfy their needs and to get to know them as an individual.
good,"Good people but alot of cutthroat. Management seemed confused on the daily and HR didn't take alot of interest in people's interest. Seen alot of people get fired for he say, she say. There's a favoritism to certain people that are closer to the higher ups."
good,"When things are good, H-D is a great place.  When things are not going well, it is a very intense and all encompassing of your life.  The company is trying to appeal to the next gen. rider, but still not clearly hitting it."
good,the job was a good place to work but people seems to be rude almost knowing that you could be replace at anytime with another employee. As for career advancement it went by seniority. no matter how much you work harder then the next you still had the wait the years as you enter their work force for a job.
good,"Long hours. Decent pay. Staff was once highly motivated but due to decreasing sales and options, plant is closing and workers are leaving. Management tries to take care of team members but hampered by demand from corporate to meet ever changing deadlines."
good,this was a job that required a lot of hours with very little pay. this was a job that you worked off commission and yet when you sold a bike you didn't get paid fairly.
good,Harley Davidson is a fun and relaxed working environment. I enjoyed my overall employment with the company for 11yrs. I had a great relationship with my immediate manager and team members. Unfortunately my employment came to an end in August of 2017 due to downsizing in the originations department.
good,"Laid off to frequently. You will never be guaranteed a spot in the facility do to the bikes not getting the demand. No demand means they do not need to produce more, meaning no jobs."
good,"HD is a fun place to work, however that being said its a sales job so you are putting in the hours. The financing for motorcycles is much harder than cars, and with them being classed at toys like with boats and RV's so prospects are fewer."
good,Job security is okay. Staff is wonderful. Managers are way too micro management type. Too many family members involved in working there. Not enough communication.
good,"H-D is a storied Brand with a storied history that will be intoxicating to anyone that gets emotionally driven by Americana, freedom and personalization... and of course motorcycling. The customers are wonderful, the dealers are wonderful."
good,Consumer desires not met.  Current and future products have very little advancements.  Engineering challenges not met because current practices for engineers also include excessive administrative duties and extensive knowledge of business operations that requires too much time therefore limiting the time actually spent engineering the product and advancing the performance.
good,This is a very hard working group and they expect a lot. It moves quickly and you are expected to jump in and learn with very little onboarding. Be creative and jump in and get ready to work with a prestigious brand.
good,"Il Lavoro mi piaceva tanto, peccato che l'azienda abbia cessato le attività."
good,"Great place to learn new trades and skill sets. Not a good place for job stability due to the amount of layoffs, and union seniority processes."
good,"Not a fun job, big turn over in employees."
good,Used to be a great place to work now its just job with less and less benifits.unfortunately outsourcing has has become an issue
good,Culture changed drastically as it became run by accountants.  Lost a lot of good people.  Some great managers there but they are outnumbered by bad managers.
good,"La mia giornata partiva con il controllo dell'e-mail, dalle immatricolazioni/trapassi di motocicli, dagli ordini merce da creare, dalla pulizia generale del negozio e moto esposte e mettere in ordine l'esposizione dell'abbigliamento, e sopratutto accogliere il cliente appena entrava in concessionaria; ho imparato a lavorare a contatto con il pubblico, ad organizzarmi il lavoro giorno per giorno; non ho trovato parti difficili nel mio lavoro ma tante mansioni da svolgere contemporaneamente, i miei colleghi erano come una famiglia,lavoravamo tutti con passione, il mio lavoro era molto bello perchè eri sempre a contatto con la gente."
good,This has been a great place for me to hone my MarComm skills from a client-side perspective.
good,company struggling poor work/life balance no room for advancement high turn over of employees random layoffs. company is losing market shares and is changing direction.
good,"Working at Harley Davidson is a cool and easy job but having worked there for over 3 years and haven't received a raise(no one has, they go off an employee tier system) makes the job seem pointless and any incentive to work or grow. Its a simple job that is perfect for anyone coming out of high school but unless you want to make a difference in the company it might not be a job to stay interested in. Overall i'm glad I have the opportunity to work at such an establishment as Harley, I just know given my position I want more in life."
good,"The job was great from a learning perspective; my job responsibilities taught me several usefill skills during my time. However, hours would be inconsistent at times due to temporary layoffs for a few months at a time."
good,I liked working with the people working with me and under me. Great paint facilities along with expert state of the art systems in automotive paint and mold injections.
good,"I worked at Harley , Not an actual employee of Harley. I have to keep writing to finish this thing. The people working there seemed happy but, I think the way the use temp helpers is a bit crude."
good,"No job security no seniority, to many job position changes in management, Great company, but owners and management made it hard for employee’s to do and keep there jobs"
good,"Challenging but very productive. Working here has brought me a "
good,"The company brings in a bunch of high school age kids to work for the two weeks of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, with it just being two weeks the students got to really pick when they came in. Very informal but it worked well, the job got very boring after noon and management had little work for the students to do after the lot filled."
good,"I enjoyed working here but he pay is not enough to live off regardless of how much you sell or hit your goals, but the environment is fun and laid back."
good,Harley-Davidson is all about their customers but not their employees. When it comes to women working there it more based on looks. Very much a boys club for sure.
good,"You can put your heart and soul into this job and it is not recognized by upper management. They do not try to help you improve on your job abilities with coaching or training sessions. They do not investigate any issues or hear two sides of a story, just what was heard first. They are more of a ""do as I say, not do as I do"" company."
good,Nothing to say about Harley-Davidson just did my job and left and got paid and took care of my family thank you pictures of the family about a job within my life and go along with whatever it is I'm going on with thank you very much
good,"Thunder Bay Harley Davidson isn't a bad place to work or a really great place to work. Expected to work everyday possible for minimum wage. Management was overbearing, not a fun place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Motor Company, but I believe the experiences of the employee will depend on the dealership for which he chooses to work.  There was a great deal of training and education, which added to the ability to know the products and gave a comfort zone to the employee to interact with the customers.  When I helped in departments other than the one to which I was assigned, I was thanked by my fellow workers but was eventually reprimanded by management!  Huh?  "
good,"Selling Harley's was a experience as customers would come in and would be fulfilling a life dream ."
good,the company show me how to work on bikes and how to repair them also learn how to work with people in a fast paste environment working as a team to meet the company goal.
good,"Working at HDBG is fun because there are some good people and the product, the motorcycle and accessories are the best in the industry.  The problem is the stress in meeting the demands of many tough customers and the need to meet financial targets in a business suffering by aging demographics."
good,"The continual reorgs put so much uncertainty into the work environment, it is like you feel wary just coming to work.  I'm on contract but it could end any day.  I hope they figure out a bold strategy to revitalize the business."
good,"It was fun meeting all the new people that came in the store, As time went by I developed relationships with my customers, new each other on a first name basis."
good,"I work 8 hours a day; 7 days a week"
good,"When I first started at Harley, work was challenging but the people I worked with and the culture made the work enjoyable. As the financials of the company started to decline, so did the fun culture. Employee lunches and holiday parties were cut out, people became more on edge because of constant wondering about job security, and there were questionable decisions made by management."
good,"•	Led the deployment of Retail and Securitization planning and forecasting portfolios that enabled to deliver efficient financial and decision support services globally across 35 countries."
good,"I enjoyed when I got the chance to answer calls, to much down time and not much to do. Management could not keep you busy.  I like to be busy.  Long quiet days."
good,"Très bon travail d'équipe"
good,Unfortunately contract employees were very much treated differently from HD employees and it was brought to our attention numerous times.  I felt the environment was too much for me.
good,"The company used to be the best place to work!!  Hard work, fun and great culture were the norm but H-D has struggled in recent years after all of the layoffs and downsizing, employees are overworked and feeling unsure of their job security."
good,Enjoyed working in the environment that customers were excited to come in to see new product. I liked helping the new riders learn about proper riding gear and selecting the items that best fit their needs.
good,"plant was a good place to work , great people there . all losing our jobs due to plant closure . company decided to reduce the plants to only 1 in another city"
good,My Immediate manager was one of the best managers I have ever had. Upper management was not great. made an almost hostile work environment and would favor certain departments.
good,"plant is being shut down"
good,"With a great brand and hordes of rabid fans H-D should be the best place to work in the world. But, bad management led to year over year of declining sales and multiple layoffs have decimated the salaried workforce leaving them nervous. The board has left senior management to fester for way too long."
good,I love working for Harley-Davidson like the environment like the people that was there it was a very laid-back place but now I'm up here looking for better and new opportunities with a new better job that hopefully won't lay me off
good,"Very nice and laid back place to work, I love the culture and what they represent and stand by. The benefits are good but I believe they lack diversity."
good,There is good and bad to every job. The clientele that comes in are amazing. The turnover rate at this store makes it difficult to have any sort of routine though.
good,I was honored to work at Harley for the short time I was there. it is a worldwide known company and I'm proud to say I worked there. however it was a temporary position and I knew that but was still interested to work there.
good,Fun atmosphere.  Good people. Decent wage.  Has a cafeteria and a small museum for tours. New contract messed everything up. Lost  benefits and pay. Lost  intetest.  One if the best paying jobs I've  ever had.
good,"it was slow paced job, pay sucked. Managers would just sit in the back. no sales would come in. forget about a raise you will never get it. absoluty boring"
good,"it was ok we would come in have a meeting first thing every morning, then learn where we would be working, and after every two hours we would shift to the next slot, there was great team work, the environment was great, people were great, some management was good others were better, the hardest part about this job was only about if the mandatory overtime, that if you had to come in early then have to stay late if they told you to. I think they should of just asked around the plant who wanted to work overtime instead of making people who didn't want it."
good,Provided employees with a well equipped fully staffed fitness center. Also many wellness programs and activities. I had the opportunity to train and work temporarily in the weld/ fabrication area further expanding my work experience.
good,"I was hired as a co-op and worked in the paint section of the plant. there wasn't much to do, I was given tasks I had no experience or guidance. I did my best but the work was mind numbing and boring. I helped my other colleague with the his work he got the fun projects. I would recommend Harley Davidson to anyone looking to get into a factory environment."
good,Had been with the company for many years.  The culture and appreciation of employees had gotten worse over the last few years especially since the new CEO took over.  It used to be a fun and laid back culture and isn't so anymore.
good,- Routed all incoming phone calls using a multi-line phone system.                                         	- Provided customer service to current and new clients.                                                                   	- Helped in the sales department and the service department.                                                   	- Organized all the files and parts that came in.
good,Personal conflict is the game 60% of the day. Time wasted with unreasonable union employees who understand the union contract better than they understand their job was why I left.
good,"HARLEY DAVIDSON was what i thought was my dream job,being a harley rider most my adult life, my wife had some very serious medical problemIs which caused me to miss alot of work time. I tried to work days missed out with HR and FMLA and i was still able to work as much as possible, I was still high on the point system but i was getting close to have some of my points dropped, and my step daughter was killed on a jet ski accident, Ididn't call in the next day,forgot and that put me over for a no call no show. I was fired for not calling in. Thats why i give Harley such low ratings."
good,Not the best corporation to work for......... Management was very disorganised................ Would not recommend this place to anyone. Happy to be working elsewhere.
good,It is a fascinating place to work.  Its amazing to see from the start to finish of building the well known muscle bike.  I have had a great experience so far with those I have and still work with.
good,"a typical work day concist of taken out trash, cleaning bathrooms, and moveing things around. mangement was all was around and welling to help out if needed."
good,"Harley Davison is Large Motor Company located in Milwaukee Wisconsin. As a part of the release one of the projects includes, lots of redesigning work, merging different rider’s edge data and later part of the project is to give production support and transition to support team."
good,Harley-Davidson's brand is one of the strongest in the world and the teams are dedicated to growing the brand.  Lots of camaraderie internally and very casual work environment.  Planning approach needs to be nimble to respond to market conditions.
good,Well organized and managed. Pay is good but no benefits. Great dock to work on. People are very helpful in warehouse. I found it easy to fit in and learn
good,"I liked my job responsibilities, which included installing engines, wiring, clutches, regulators and much more. I stayed busy and just a cool process watching the bikes be made"
good,"Very tough environment. If you don't have grit, give it hard and long thought before joining the team. Many aspect of the job are rewarding but the day is always challenging. You will learn how a lean company really works and CI is a contsant concern"
good,"4 day 10 hr weekly schedule with 2nd shift recently added "
good,"Otima empresa, só porem fui roubado dentro dela e nada foi feito"
good,"Nice place to work. Sweet co workers. Owner not very nice. Day to day answering phones, greeting customers, answering emails."
good,"Absolutely loved the colleagues. Found it hard to advance. You will meet people from all walks of life and have an opportunity to impact them with a large purchase (perhaps a new Harley, or some cool chaps)."
good,Great place to work under the right management.  There is a tremendous amount of competition for advancing your career.
good,overall a stable company that has been around for a long time. Good job for entry level into the auto finance business. Company should offer more training
good,"While working for Harley Davidson, I learned a lot about motorcycles, and how to tell a Dyna from a Softail. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell and only attracting people with bad credit. The Most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to ride motorcycles. How cool is that?"
good,Over my career I have never had a problem moving on from a job when it was time to do so until I had to leave H-D Fujairah. As an enthusiast for the brand leaving was the hardest career decision I have ever made.
good,"Every day is something different. In the motorcycle industry there are many variables. Depending on the season, weather, economy, and other factors can determine the day at Mile High Harley-Davidson. Daily, we have customers who come in for a cup of coffee or to see what's new. Very much family/friendly business."
good,Good job with nice benefits.  Upper management does not really understand the motorcycle business culture on the Harley-Davidson side.
good,Good experience in supporting the manufacture of heavy weight motorcycles for a leading manufacturer of Harley-Davidson products.
good,lots of hours no hourly npay poor benefits poor management lack of care for employees well being solely concentrated on selling motor cycles
good,"day to day management "
good,"Input Loan Document into a Oracle database from incoming dealerships from all over the world."
good,"An average day would start off as so, 100 bikes and out is pronounced by supervisor, which our count of bike until we leave.also we switch stations to lower injury risk."
good,"answer calls and direct them to proper department"
good,"My time here was limited, but for the short amount of time I spent here, it was enjoyable."
good,As a production tech operator for Harley I learned many jobs in the little time I was there. I considered myself a hard worker and am sure my co-workers would agree. In six months I ve learned how to run various spot weld machines and soldering machines in the fabrication dept. After learning most jobs in that dept. they sent me to the frame dept to utilize my skills there. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the metatarsal shoes that were required and I guess the let down when they didnt keep me on full time due to not having a welding degree or certificate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the respect I have received from the full time employees and their awesome training values they instilled in me.
good,"It's a wonderful place to work; ten hour shifts, good pay, and great people. Getting in is the most difficult part of working there."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of multitasking, from meeting and greeting customers, setting up and breaking down wall displays, taking inventory, replenishing stock, answering multiple phone lines, tracking merchandise from different locations and cashiering."
good,"I left due to a personal family circumstance. I enjoyed working there, but had to make a tough decision."
good,"2 hour station rotation."
good,Nice and helpful people.  Ok place to work.  Very comfortable atmosphere.
good,always enjoyed all the teamwork at my last job.sometimes it was challenging to try and get the number of frames for harley.my coworkers are a great bunch of people
good,The management could be better. To me they show to much favortism. My co-workers are fun to be around.I like the pay.The work is very easy just have to be able to stand for 8-10 hours.
good,H-D is a resource rich company with some great and not so great leaders.  The politics are tough at the mid-management level which takes away from the great parts of the job which include interacting with dealers and customers.  Be sure you understand the leadership situation in your area before joining.  
good,"The money and benefits are good, especially for management, but the work is very hard. Projects are under-resourced. Global Information Services were recently outsourced to an off-shore firm, resulting in much confusion and lack of clarity."
good,"Unless you are in a leadership role (management or supervisor) or are in a union position H-D will not hire you directly. Over 2/3 of employees are contract labor and they also outsource IT, janitorial, marketing, museum and retail staff, admin, and security personnel, as well. Unfortunately, this means no benefits for contract personnel. I suppose in a lousy economy this is a good business measure to keep investors happy and watch the bottom line. However, when the company is exceeding profit goals it would be nice to see them invest in the employees that help the company grow and create those profits. Milwaukee is still experiencing a depressed employment rate and H-D could go a long way to remedy that and do the right thing."
good,Plain and simple. Owner is a terrible person. He's a spoiled rich kid that bought a dealership and if he decides one day to get rid of you he will. Has happened numerous times.
good,Good place to work if you can put up with the long-term union employees thinking they are gods gift to Harley!  It was always amazing how much they would complain about when they stand around the majority of their shifts.  My immediate supervisor never gave me any feedback in my 8 month contracted position (even when I asked him directly) and then I was not hired on and still didn’t receive feedback.  Just a thank you and good luck.    Other supervisors will do anything to make you look bad to management.  Harley is very “cut throat”.  But other than all that! Good job security and plenty of OT most of the year!
good,Very relaxed and easy to get the hang of. Plenty of kind hearted people of whom I loved to spend everyday with. Everyday is a breeze if we all do our parts
good,Work days are long. They will train you on the jobs in your work group. Lots of six day work weeks. Most of the employees are nice people willing to help one another.
good,"When I started at Harley-Davidson the employees and management worked together to produce a good work environment. In the past years Harley-Davidson has gone to a traditional work environment where management made all the decisions, not allowing any input from employees. I feel that the company has over saturated the market causing my plant to shut down."
good,"It is easy to own my role and be self motivating.  My boss does not "
good,I love to work at Harley but I need to get better pay for my bills and also the hours so fit my schedule I am more of a morning person and like to have some daylight
good,Great collaborative work environment.  Biggest drawback is a deficiency in communications between the manufacturing workforce and upper management.  Tension exists between Union workforce and Salary non-union workforce.
good,It's good for buying the harley.and you have all the models. But the service and small parts are very expensive.and they don't have a service center close to this shop.its 21km far away from this place
good,The work place was safe and the people was friendly. I learned alot from there and got a lot of skills.I enjoyed the hours and the pay of course.Over all it was what i needed
good,The staff is awesome and everyday is a blast. You need to understand that it is a high speed environment though and that being commision based with a draw can be hectic.
good,"Good Company, fun people, hard to move up. Benefits aren't great. A lot of re-orgs so it's hard to figure out were you fit."
good,The owners are trouble here. It not just one its a group of investors. Bible belt so no fun at events. Bad service management. Poor customer ratings. Good sales team and parts team.
good,Manufacturing has its ups and downs with the economy.  Harley-Davidson produces a luxury item and so it goes with all luxury items.  Sometimes you can charge more and sometimes you can't get anyone to buy your product in an economical downturn.
good,To many lay offs and overtime with little reward and recognition. You have to get on early and build sonority quick to make it at this company.
good,"A typical day was a lot of cleaning, helping customers and making sometimes hard decisions. Management and sometimes never saw eye to eye but other then that we got along. the hardest part was trying to stay busy when a lot of us were working. The most enjoyable part was working with the mechanics and the motorcycles."
good,"A typical day at work was very fun and outgoing, just alot of time on your feet. The management at Harley Davidson was very poor, and very unorganized. Co-Workers, were by far the best co-workers I have ever had!"
good,"Its a great place to work in this organisation.Learned great things like working of a automobile industry,pressure handling,team work,project handling etc."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting all different kinds of customers as well as enjoying the dynamic role of being a supervisor here.
good,"Commitment to making change, however too many talented people were in the shake up and Harley lost out on some very accomplished dedicated employees."
good,"Great benefits after 90 day probationary period but they start you out at a very fair price. Once 90 days is up, they give you a raise along with insurance options and great discounts. The customers were great to work with and it was very laid back. Most tasks involved busy work until a customer came in needing help. Responsible for clothing for motorcyclists as well as helmet sizing"
good,I heard they were shutting down everywhere to move over seas. They used to be American made....something to be proud of. I don't feel that way anymore
good,"It's a alright place, but they are strict when it comes to attendance you have to literally be on the urge of dieing. People think Harley-Davidson is a great place maybe not when it comes down to you they dont care what your going through...if it's not beneficial to them, they'll throw your problems in your face and tell you to handle them."
good,"I can not review all Harley dealerships in one package."
good,"Good job till they started outsourcing jobs and parts, Last couple of years job seemed less and less stable and eventually told that Plant was closing down and consolidating with another ."
good,A very competitive staff with no structure to incoming sales guest. First come first serve sale.
good,"We work together as one like we had to solve our problems in our on group. It was 8 people in our group and we rotate every 2 hours. Some one make the schedule, one safety, one went to meeting it was like we was running our own group. It was nothing to hard for me cause I was a fast learner. I enjoyed working with the different people."
good,this place is not great for a real-time job. I think its a great experience for an intern or a co-op so they can decide what they want out of their career.
good,"Cool office space in Vaughan, ON. The kitchen space is open concept with a ping pong table, foosball table and a great nexspresso coffee machine. The people are committed, hard working and professional."
good,they have good events at Harley Davidson and you usually get to eat for free. Low wages and lots of overtime. Lay offs during the winter season. Good Morale overall in dealerships.
good,Being recently laid off I can't say much about the job security. The surge casual program is great for someone looking for seasonal work with good pay.
good,It was great to be part of such an iconic american brand. Best part of the job was being able to set much of my own schedule. Working rallies with customers was an added bonus.
good,"I enjoyed working with 95% of the people ,  was told it was an 18 month contract, and very disappointed that it lasted only 3 months"
good,Overall fun place to work with good people. I really enjoyed working with our various IT Suppliers like SAP and Microsoft. H-D is very much customer focused and quality driven to lead market. I learned a lot about riding and the sport of motorcycles. Had a ton of fun working Bike Week in Daytona and enjoyed the many social events built around Harley.
good,"Great place to work, the owner was awesome, his management team was good as well. I got laid off from this job, broke my heart, I love Harley's great product. far from home that was the only draw back."
good,i enjoyed the day to day at the dealership however at the time of my employment the parts department was understaffed making busy times very stressful.
good,"The workers knew the product well as many owned the product themselves. Their philosophy was  "" I would not accept these conditions on my bike"". This created an internal quality focus by all personnel. The hardest part of the job was to obtain buy-in for any changes I recommended. The most enjoyable part was training new inspectors and calibration personnel the most efficient methods."
good,You get to play with motorcycles all day. The customers are cool and the staff is great.The only downside is poor benefits.
good,"Great Development Platform"
good,"I started at the company when it was starting up in Brazil. The brand was taking over the representation from the former representative. When I started we were in 12 people. Last month, we were in about 60. "
good,"A very fast paced, hardworking environment. Getting product out on a timely manner with the utmost quality in mind."
good,"Overall I was satisfied with the job and miss the atmosphere. Although management seemed uncertain of potential company actions regarding employment status, I enjoyed the job and pay with every weekend off."
good,I enjoyed my time at this company. just sad it was a fixed term contract. The structure is of a solid foundation and management was great and well informed.
good,Working at harley was good. It taught me alot about how u create a motorcycle and what creative idea goes to making one and the process of creating one
good,Really enjoy working at the Kansas City factory and sad that it will be closing in July 2019.  Sr. leadership at the factory is friendly and approachable.
good,My primary job was to sell Harley Davidson Motorcycles. I was commissioned. Living in Sierra Vista was hard selling motorcycles. Some times it would take two month's to sell a motorcycle.
good,Great bosses. They are all helpful if you are having hard time. But not enough progressing and training.  Salaries are not high enough . After graduating MMI I was expecting more  for working for a dealership.
good,A fun and positive attitude place for the growing region of Latin America. We were able to do our work in a relaxed environment without constant micromanaging. Staying engaged and excited about the work came from the environment kept by coworkers and colleagues and maintained a harmonious environment with flexibility of work/life balance.
good,Tem todos os beneficios Nescessarios.
good,"Great industry to work in very enjoyable. I have expanded my knowledge in the areas of Marketing, Merchandise display and market anaylsis."
good,Harley Davidson was a fun place to work. They always had events going on and the customers were fun to help. It was very fast paced and you learn a lot about the motorcycles. Working in the clothing department is a good foot in the door if you'd like to move up to management or bike sales.
good,I learned good working skills and how to build things with my hands.it's a great work place nice and friendly people great to get along with. Clean work place.
good,"IT had big involvement with Infosys contract which helped the bottom line in the short term, but reports of support issues persist.  Company needs to ""insource"" some more technical talent to maintain continuity through provider changes."
good,"Over all the employer cares about the staff just as much as they do the customers. They do all kinds of employee activities , just to thank them for their service to the company. Such activities include things such as free lunches, breakfast, games prizes and activities, as well as free merchandise."
good,Cut throat enviroment great pay poor management but overall the people and customers make it worth working there.  There wasn't any room for growth in this job
good,"Awesome company , all about continuous improvement. Only downfall is the bonus structure and hows it calculated on basis points. No one in upper management can break down how to calculate it or how it relates to individual reps accountability or production. If that can be rectified it would have a 5 star rating. Promotions are appointed as intermittent positions and perception is their reality so be careful with how u present yourself. Basic call center politics its not what u know its who u know that gets most people ahead. There are some dedicated Managers that attempt to work against the call center politics but get sucked in by being overpowered my upper management. It can be stressful at time but for the most part a cool company to work for."
good,"I worked closely with management, sales persons and customers to insure timely and accurate responses to internet leads and customer follow-up."
good,"A marca harley-davidson, sempre fora do brasil perteceu a grupo , em minha gestão ao grupo izzo."
good,"they offered a pay plan, that didn't take effect until the goal was met for monthly sales, which never happened.  So compensation was never given for sold products"
good,"Fun place to work but that’s about it. It’s an amazing brand to work for and if you’re into Harley Davidson’s you get a good staff discount the people there are amazing to work with, but you don’t get paid well for what you have to do and how hard you have to work."
good,"No advancement options. No paid time off or sick time pay. No paid lunches, only get 30 minutes for a 7 hour shift, too. Not minimum wage but not enough to live on your own. This is a good job to get straight out of high school."
good,A empresa propõe muitos desafios que contribuem para engrandecimento profissional.
good,not a very nice place to work. don't get treated very fairly. management isn't very fair and the union doesn't represent you like they should. decent place to work only because of the money
good,"I will clock in a couple minutes after 7pm. go to my work group and start to setup everything the morning crew was supposed to setup when they left. (screws bolts and other materials). wait for supervisor to tell where everyone will start in the rotation. work one job either fairings, gas tanks, headlights, AC covers or ECM installations. Complete each job within a minute and 22 seconds. and repeat till lunch time."
good,"Learned alot about building motorcycles.Everything was fine until they downsized, then laid alot of people off."
good,"Decent if looking for temporary work, Well maintained factory. Most employees around are pretty solid workers that work well with other people. Good Pay."
good,Good job to start just the tasks became repetitive and slow. Pushed for a ton of teamwork but not a lot was given at time but others were all about helping.
good,"I really enjoyed my first year here. I didn't make much at first but progressed quickly. I feel once I got into the department I am currently in things got stagnant, my managers are inept, the 2 locations are never aligned (probably because of my leaders, not theirs) and my director is not present with the team like my last one was. Over the years the benefits have dwindled. We no longer have tuition reimbursement, my managers no longer accommodate your school schedules and the medical benefits (if you can call them that) get worse and worse each year. Don't get me wrong, they are competitive with wages, but to not have opportunity to move up is really making it difficult to stay there."
good,"I love working for this company! It is a very laid back and enjoyable place to work, but I have been here almost two years and still have not recieved a raise. I make 8.50 an hr. I train new employes I travel up to 45 min distances to other locations as needed. (almost five days a week.) And still no raise."
good,"Worked there 17 years and have seen many changes. Welding frames by hand has been replaced by robots and a lot of people that never hand welded in their life now are weld center operators. all the CNC machine centers have been done away with and the work out sourced to other company's, now  Harley Davidson is basically an assembly plant, they no longer build their motorcycles, all they do is put the parts together and assemble the bike. Quality has suffered as a result. Proof of this is in their sales, that is why I am seeking employment else where."
good,The money is great. Most of the people are awesome. Hours suck.
good,Start up Meeting run machine inspection oil ccoolant leaks inspect parts load machine do set up if needed
good,"Love Harley Davidson but could have better pay. More time off would be nice but the environment is great. Love motorcycles and eat, sleep and breathe it? It's a place for you"
good,"The atmosphere is always exciting and full of energy! How could one not get enthusiastic when surrounded by chrome, metal and rocking music! The people you meet in this dealership are welcoming and soon become friends."
good,I was a HD Casual so basically I did the same thing that the guy standing next to me did and they got paid 18 more an hour than me. I paid the bills thought.
good,"It use to be a wonderful place to work until the family stepped down and new management stepped in. You use to feel like part of the family, and I can't believe how it's all gone downhill."
good,"I liked working for Harley Davidson, but after 12 years there was no more advancement opportunities.  I became bored with what i was doing, and just needed a life change."
good,"The work can vary from slow to fast paced if equipment goes down and can be very dirty environment like a paint booth or water pit. "
good,"-Overall good company to work for. I enjoyed my time there."
good,Learned product development and licensing. Employees are hard workers and dedicated to their jobs. There were frequent reorganization of jobs so there was lots of change
good,"4 ten hours days"
good,"I attended ""Supervisor Training"" daily for the first week and then went to Assembly to run the last 2 legs of a 5 leg assembly production line. My mentor or trainer resigned so I have picked up the H-D way of manufacturing quickly. It is a lot of help chain, continuous improvement, and lean manufacturing put into practice. I enjoy working with the long term employees and being a level of support for them. It is difficult to find all of the root causes for negatively impacting occurences."
good,"Working with the paint line to solving daily production issues that may come up. Program robots to paint many different parts types, all plastic."
good,"Harley-Davidson is one of the oldest American companies, and offers man job advancements."
good,I loved the bikes and everything that went along with working at Harley just never felt I was ever going to be able to try any other position or advance in any way
good,"Harley has a rich history and is a staple in the community. It is currently faced with a major opportunity for innovation and market domination, given effective business operations and management."
good,"People  were  great  to work  with, management  changed  all the  time. Work  wasn't  bad,  or over loaded.  Great place to learn new trades.haf alot of fun with alot of people."
good,"This job is amazingly fun, fast-paced, and you get to meet new people all the time. They have customer appreciation days, vendor events, etc. The work is relatively straight-forward and you can generally ask any question and get a response. The environment is filled with nice individuals. You also get training for every area, and if it isn't the manager (which it usually is not), another team member is there to help if you need it. However, if for some reason the other team members feel you have an ""attitude"" on an off day or otherwise, they will report it to the manager and it becomes very dramatic. It also can result in you losing hours. Other than that, it's a great place to work."
good,"Harley-Davidson is going through a transition. We are integrating the Kansas City plant into the York plant. There's a lot of construction, and staff changes. A lot of new tooling to be made and modified."
good,Started out as a great company to work for when I was hired but with all the changes and layoffs the job stability just quit being there. Company is not as concerned with the employees now than they used to be and all focus in on the money they make.
good,I had fun for 20 years until it was no longer fun. I wish H-D the best. I'll always be a fan.The Leadership at Juneau and York HAS to change if Harley is going to survive.
good,"As team lead look see what was done by previous shift, then see what the need for the currant shift. At this time plan out the production day, and who works where to accomplish the work need."
good,"A normal day includes working with customers face to face or over the phone to solve problems and answer questions about motorcycle maintenance."
good,"Used to be very employee focused, but that seems to have dissipated since 2014, when short-sighted marketing decisions put the brand and company at risk, as seen by ongoing decreases in sales."
good,"A typical day at Harley-Davidson consist of arriving at 6;00 am and greeting everyone in the locker as we begin to change clothes, then doing a quick full inspection and maintenance check on your machines and robots, and once that's complete the day begins. the culture is described as ""Scientific Management"" as we have chairs to sit in if needed, very bright lights as well as windows to gaze out of, controlled temperature on a average it's about 72 degrees year long and we have all the proper ""Personal Protection Equipment"" that's needed for any job or position performed."
good,"The minute you clock in you are working. You learn a vast knowledge of different types of motorcycles. Management is okay, however they play favorites. A majority of the employees are Caucasian and racist. If you are any shade of brown, good luck trying to get a raise or any kind of advancement. You meet people from all over the country, that is interesting."
good,Really cool job but by the time I got off I never wanted to touch my bike. Long hours and if there is an off session be ready for layoffs.
good,"It can be chaotic sometimes between two shifts. People are not working together as it should. It's a union shop so there are challenges to overcome. There were no on time communications in from management between area to area. Always last minute decision trying to figure out what to do. Even though it has lot of challenges to overcome, I learned that you have to be on your toe, be flexible, and ready to make changes on the moment of notice. As difficult as it is, we met or exceeded the productions or requirements that make us a team by the end of shift no matter what other shift does or does not do. We only worry about our shift working as a team."
good,"The bike culture at Harley-Davidson of Calgary was fun. I learnt lots about bikes. My co-workers were probably the best I have had, though the management were less than par. Its a great seasonal job!"
good,All in all working here was a good experience. I cannot much complain about the skills that I have learned and the training I received. I am personally just looking for something a bit different.
good,The state of Wisconsin decertified the Union workers and they brought in guys like me who were disliked because many local people were retired.  This made job more difficult
good,"A typical day at Harley Davidson would be coming in to your work area and getting prepared for the job you would be doing all day. 10 hour work days. on your feet all day doing very fast pace and physical work."
good,Entering info for bike manufacture for upcoming year.
good,"The majority of my days are spent supporting production on the assembly line, while also working on projects to increase production, safety, quality and ergonomics."
good,Due to the motorcycle market being at its lowest in over five years the company has leaned out through multiple layoffs over that timeframe. This has caused a lowering of morale due to the increased workloads that people face.
good,"I enjoyed working there, the people were the best part. They were dedicated and well educated.  I was involved in a lot of project work, providing a lot of variety."
good,The job was challenging and kept my mind going . We were always figuring something out. Breaking down motorcycles and putting them back together. I learned a lot about mechanics.
good,it was a great and dependable job until it closed. typical day with coworkers was fun. Harley- Davidson really disappointed a lot of employees in the past years
good,"Most of the staff that I worked with was friendly and helpful. In my role I was able to learn quickly and understand the importance of my role when it comes to safety of others and felt appreciated."
good,I enjoyed working contracts at Harley-Davidson Motor Company.  I would recommend this company to others interested in positions there. Ride free and keep the rubber side down!
good,"Was a great job for 20+ years.  Factory closed at the Kansas City location.  Enjoyed my job, but it was a very toxic environment, with less than satisfactory communication."
good,"i enjoyed learning about the harleys and helping customers find the right bike for them, i like dealing with people in general and at harley that what you do on a daily basis"
good,Harley was a great place to work until they started to introduce temp workers and contract workers to avoid paying benefits. after that the moral and quality suffered.
good,Fast paced.  Job rotation kept things interesting.  Great traing for the jobs.  Safety very important in every job.  Well organized business.  Plant is in the process of closing.  many good people will be displaced.  Very sad.
good,Not muxh i can say towards Harley Davidson but working there really did help me communicate one-on-one with customers and being able to help them better
good,"Very fast paced job , made time go buy quickly, some days it was a real tough job to keep up, or if someone up the line missed  a step it was even harder to straighten out."
good,I had a chance to achieve a license to operate more industrial powered vehicles at Harley. Although I was a casual worker at this company I really enjoyed working there. I liked telling everyone in the community that I worked for Harley Davidson.
good,"Its a good job if you need to get back on your feet with something, but there really is no room to go in the company at all or can't make decision that you feel would help the company out on."
good,"Learned how to use job specific programs, fast paced environment, utilized teamwork as well as solo projects, the atmosphere is the most enjoyable part of the job, gained knowledge of various products and dealerships"
good,"Maui Harley Davidson is a good job to be working at especially if you want to be able to learn about motorcycles and anything on two wheels , this job also gives you many opportunities to work in different areas in your field option."
good,It was the best job in terms of content because it was something I'm passionate about and it was always fun. It was a hobby and a job combined into one and the experience of it was amazing. Meeting people and customizing their bikes was something that made me really happy.
good,"Love the work, but after going to school getting certified, it surely doesn't pay what was expected. $10 an hour to be a Harley Technician after schooling is ludicrous. I can't take care of a family with this pay."
good,I was a Senior Tech. The people and fellow techs I worked with made the job manageable. Fantastic job for a Harley tech that doesn't care about how much money they make.
good,"Although here for such a short time, everyone was friendly. Unfortunately, I was laid off just a few months in and all hires are done through an agency."
good,There was a lot of great professional development opportunities here. Great place to get some great experience and also go to school with their tuition reimbursement.
good,This place was a fun environment to work in. The peers worked well together for the most part. It is not fair that the temps get paid way less than the full time workers.
good,Enjoyed my job.  Met many awesome customers and people.  Money was okay. Management changed many times while i was st the compsny.  New building. And area for the dealership.
good,Harley for me was awesome since I worked in Press and Fabrication. I got great experience worked with employees who have been there for years. Only thing I can complain with Harley being a casual has no benefits at all except they will call you ever year for the surge.
good,"I LOVE Harleys, I love selling the bikes, but the hours are brutally long, and work/life balance, in my oponion is not worth the price of admission.I want a life, which is almost impossible to have with so many hours required by work."
good,I think Harley Davidson is a great company I learned a lot of different skills there and met a lot of great people but with the decline in motorcycle sells the workforce has been reduced and jobs have become more unstable
good,Union stewards there are irresponsible & cowardly. Too much gossip. Spend more time with these people than your own near & dear family. With all the benefits and pay employees STILL complain. Unreal.
good,I had a good time working at Harley and would like to work there again if they need next year.  I know they needed people bad but they should try and make sure that the people they were bringing in had some experience.
good,I like that teams i worked with and the fast paced assembly lines. The line managers were great and if needed any help they were on top of it. I would return if possible.
good,"I enjoyed working at Harley-Davidson because of the awesome, smart, and hard-working people. I was always encouraged to grow as an employee and as a person."
good,"Learned a large berth of information regarding the motorcycle production industry, more specifically about power trains. Also gained a lot of information about the maintenance of the machinery required for production of parts."
good,It's as if you have to believe in the sport of riding and ride yourself or you cant fit in.  You can work on projects and excel in a specific field but you have to work through layers and layers of management and red tape.
good,"Busy place with lots of bikes and lots of work. Great staff in the service department; extremely talented. Client focus, great events for the clients and involves the staff."
good,A typical day consist of assembling motorcycles according to the job specifications. Perform quality assurance checks to make sure the product is being produced according to company requirements.
good,Great environment to work in and amazing co workers. Downside is there is not much room for growth and advancement. willing to spend time on employees and help them in different aspects.
good,Currently working on a paint line with a very knowledeable team.  There are numerous departments which provides a great option to train in if opportunities arise.  The hardest part of the job is that I am  working as a casual employee which only allows for full time hours during their surge season.
good,I loved Harly.The people were nice.The pay was good.Strict on rules and made sure we produce safe and good looking bikes.
good,"A very busy work place. If you sustain your job, you work 8 hours non stop - that I like it. Wages are not high. If you are not very well experienced , its hard to progress . If you love motorcycles you can not understand how time passes. You can get good discounts for the parts you need for your motorcycle ."
good,"It was varied day-to-day.  There were different duties each day.  Learned more about finances and keeping inventory.  My boss was approachable and easy to talk to.  My co-workers were fun to work with, and were always able to answer my questions.  The least enjoyable part of the job was the off-season.  The most enjoyable part was my co-workers, and utilizing my attention to detail."
good,"Nice place to work. Casual work environment. Wonderful, friendly people. Great food in the cafeteria and very reasonable."
good,"des produits fabuleux"
good,"I loved working for Harley-Davidson in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The one down in Sierra Vista, Arizona needs some improvement as far as managment and up. Usually we would start the day by cleaning the building and setting up everything for the daily work."
good,Great place to work if you want to live there.  Great benefits which you will need when you have health issues from the stress of these positions.  They own you while you work there.
good,The people at the company really make it worth it there. The teamwork is amazing and it makes it fun to come to work everyday. Really unique opportunities to work with a Global brand doing business in so many different countries.
good,The company is clearly a life style. everyone works long hours and does not seem to mind. the culture is one that was filled with pride. this has faded as the outsourcing and job reductions continue. I have enjoyed my time there but it is now time to move on
good,Harley is a good company to work for but it was much better ten years ago.  Lately the culture is not as employee friendly as it could be.  Overall company leadership is excellent and the strategic direction seems sound.
good,Great company with lots of interesting work...lot of exciting areas to work in and can't beat working for an exciting legendary global brand.
good,The staff area very educated and perform at the highest level to ensure that the customer is taken care of to the highest level

good,It was so long ago I worked here that I don't have much to say.  I was an intern and I remember all the people being really friendly.
good,"I enjoyed my work and co-workers. I do think management could use some work, they seem disengaged."
good,"If there was a job opening I would return."
good,"Great people to work with. Not as stressful , Work at your pace"
good,Enjoyed working with with company and the people were great.  Pay was very good and so was benefits. Room for advancement.  The only bad thing is every few years they go through and clean out people.  I got downsized.
good,You can grow as the company grows. Great interaction with co-workers
good,"Had a lot of fun working there, employees were great and learned alot"
good,6-4:30 mon -thur with a fri sometimes. I have learned some good organazational skills. We have area supervisors and team leads for every group. They are pretty easy going for the most part. As long as you are performing you job duties they are good. The most challenging part of the job is having to get up so early to make it to work on time. It makes for a long day. The most enjoyable part is seeing the finished product.
good,It would be unfair to evaluate I was there a very short time. Most employees seemed happy
good,Good very helpful will go back if opportunity opens up.......... well ran company with some good people there great company but some people cab make it hard for others
good,This job was a lot of fun. This is definitely a place that you could make a career.  I would be more than happy to refer a friend to work here and promote this place all the time.
good,"Overall, Harley Davidson is an excellent company to work for! They provide a challenging fast paced environment with a great on going training program."
good,Harley Davidson is a very a huge industry to work on it needs dedication able to work under pressure.I have learned that it is important to work as team
good,"In a place where everyone is each others friend, special treatment is regular among managers towards favored employees. The culture of Harley Davidson is extremely apparent as soon as you walk into the building and everyone cares about each other on more than simply a ""co-worker"" level."
good,"Harley-Davidson used to be one of the best companies to work for and recent management is doing their best to change that.  The wrong people were put in charge for the wrong reasons, and have too much power over the employees."
good,not sure what I can say further about the working at hardly .I met a few people there who I am still friends with. I can say that I grew as a person and was respected for my skill. Company pride was also a big factor in me enjoying worki.
good,Harley Davidson is a very exciting company to work for filled with many opportunities that will help you to flourish with your career and in your life.
good,Upper leadership want to make changes that could help the line but union reps get in the way of progress and slow projects down which then get the leader of the project in trouble. This place is emotionally driven not logically driven.
good,This place was a great place to work before recent announcements.  Now the moral is so low it is rough to get through some days.  Of course it had typical work environmental issues.
good,"I have enjoyed my time working at HDMC, I’ve learned a lot of different skills. My co-workers , supervisors and the Human Resources have good to work with. It saddens me to leave but the Plant is closing."
good,To start the day with moving employees around to compensate for the high absenteeism. Spend most of the day chasing quality and andon calls. The biggest part of your day consists of troubleshooting continual manpower issues. HR is not helpful.
good,"Challenging and inspired, but fairly conservative. Very US orientated which needs to be challenged. "
good,"I have learned a lot of things here about bikes and other technical related stuff and yearn to keep learning in the future, whilst provide my knowledge and technical skills for growth of an esteemed organization and myself."
good,"If you can get in to Harley, hold on to the job. It gets to be second nature after a few weeks, and the pay is good. Unfortunately those who come from Temp agencies for the ""surge"" program. All get let go once Harley is done with them in a few months. Making it tough to really get your foot in the door long term."
good,"Job security is less than what I expected.  With the re-orgs and changes in management, the atmosphere is stressful.  Many employees are very in-experienced and have management positions.  Multiple projects going on at a time causes technical delays in processing on time commitments."
good,"It was very nice and absolutely fine place to work and i enjoyed when i was working there, i wish i can join them back again if i got the chance."
good,Economy is affecting HD's ability to push forward as the emphasis for now is to grow the market and stabilize the supply and demand. Aside from the hiccups currently taking place HD will regroup and move along to the next 100+ yrs to come
good,You won't get rich but you will have fun and meet interesting people and see new and old technology. You might go places fast and loud of you could just get burnt out on the noise and pollution.
good,Knoxville Harley Davidson is an excellent workplace environment. The most interesting part is meeting diverse groups of people and learning the culture.
good,"Great place to work for benefits and pay. Lots of training and opportunity for education for job advancement inside and outside of company. Typical work day consist of constant work in a production or lean manufacturing environment. What I've learned while working at HD, is to take advantage of your opportunities to learn how the operations work between salary and hourly and use what you have learned to your betterment and experience. Supervisors are usually easy to work. Most jobs are easy but consistent work."
good,"i was the service manager of the only Harley davidson dealership on bogota Colombia , so it was always crawled of new motorcycles used motorcycles , club people, customers bikes for services,etc , it was hard work but i really enjoy work with any motorcycle so it was a great experience"
good,"problem solving, inventory, training,"
good,Being customer-led and carefully managing the brand are at the forefront of H-D every day.
good,"Its a great opportunity to work in this brand."
good,A lot of fun at work with a great bunch of guys. Just have to make hay while the sun shines.
good,"Stellar health benefits, bonus programs, decent pay for Carson City.  Great people to work with for the most part."
good,"This job was fairly simple, but there was a lot of down time. The location was near a lot of bars so drunk people would come in and make a mess. But over all it was a sufficient job. "
good,"A typical day involves working with my team as they build the world's most sought after motorcyclces. My daily duties include; filling in for bio breaks, writing and maintaining the standard work, logging downtime and defect tracking, making repairs online, and maintaining a healthy work environment. Along the way I have learned various aspects of how the company runs, and what it takes to build a motorcycle. Management and my co-workers are a diverse group of people, and the different personalities they bring to the workplace. The hardest part of my job is having to handle numerous challenges all under two minutes, but it is also the most enjoyable part of my job in that I am able to fix numerous problems and still do my regular job."
good,"Working for Harley has been wonderful. They encourage much personal development there, but the motorcycle work was just not for me. It is difficult to be passionate about the work. The pay was under-par. There were times I was overpromised and underdelivered."
good,"fun work place, no salesman up system, sales work on commission and draw system. like most sales its slower during summer time. being fluent in Harley knowledge helps"
good,"Nice place ..steady work, offers nice perks like working rallies where you go around the United States and try and garner attention for harley,s to potential customers."
good,I've enjoyed my time with the company. I believe I was well compensated for the time I spent with them. The only problem was they took their focus from the customer to the stock holder.
good,"Not only was it an honor to work for such and Iconic brand, but the team involved on a day to day basis was top notch. I spent many hours designing mixed with travel and meetings with clients and vendors."
good,"Overall a great place to work for the people. Opportunity to travel, go to events, and live the culture. Doesn't matter if you ride motorcycles or not, everyone is included. "
good,"While there is a lot of overtime required during the surge period, employees are well compensated.  I rate Harley-Davidson as one of the top jobs in my career for leadership development and cross training."
good,A fun workplace with an onsite gym for healthy employees. Departments vary from small to large with lots of opportunity.  Diversity is welcomed.  Opportunity for growing your education if desired.
good,"Great learning opportunities with onsite class in communication, planning and project management.  Very strict policies but not up to date technology."
good,I work as a assembler for the rear fenders on the motorcycles. I work night shifts so it does get a little stressful because im there for so long. Sometimes there mandatory overtime which makes it even more hard.
good,Extremely precise record keeping and computer skills required for this position. Lots of team help when needed and motivation; work was just not there to keep full time.
good,good work atmosphere.but favoritism is constant in some work groups some can do what others are not allowed.other than this good people for the most part
good,Harley was one of the safest places I have ever worked. Not to mention the benefits were outstanding. but they lay off. job security is a very scary thing with them
good,Fast pace environment with goos people. Management is ok and changes often. Job advancement is slow with minimal pay increases. Benefits is good. Overtime is there if person is interested dependenting on area.
good,"A typical day of work consists of servicing and diagnosing Harley Davidson Motorcycles.  It's kind of a fast pace environment.  Technicians often get paid ""flat rate"" or bookrate per job so the more efficient you are the more money you will make.  Dealerships also offer paid training in which you go away to further expand your knowledge a couple of times a year.  The training classes usually are about 3 days."
good,"There's really not much to say about Harley Davidson that hasn't been said already, it's truly a world class Company with great pay and good a benefits package. Not a bad place to work."
good,"Harley has been a great place to work overall. Each Harley is individually owned, which means management can differ depending on where you're applying. Personally, I've had a good experience. It's a cool, fun job, and you get to meet a lot of awesome people."
good,The inner sanctum of HD is an excellent place to work and hone Manufacturing Engineering skills.  The combination of automation and assembly processes keeps it interesting
good,"During bike season(February-October), I would review over 150 applications a day while handling 100+ phone calls a day with dealers and Finance Insurances officers"
good,Great place to work. but not a secure place in the winter. They lay off in the winter time for the techs. Management is great in the service department.
good,"Harley davidson is superb in costumer service. I want to work with same company if possible,  in other cities I leared how to give proper service to them"
good,Find workplace easy work good money great with customers completed maintenance and janitorial work on three buildings and help out with anything else as needed
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for. However, both years I was employed at Harley-Davidson they made huge cuts. Despite telling their employees this wasn't going to happen again. It is pretty infuriating when a company with over 50% market share in a market that isn't growing decides to cut people despite profiting millions of dollars. Did their growth stay stagnate, yes, but why would it grow and how would it grow? It's frustrating that a profitable company cuts its employees and just treats them as human capital instead of actual people. Can it be necessary to cut costs and restructure...yes but when you are a billion dollar company who is profiting but not growing, because, well, there is no room to grow then no. No you shouldn't cut workers that are putting in value added work. Other than that they are a great company who pays well, a lot of holidays off, 8 hour shifts, benefits, and good people/culture. They could do more towards helping reduce their carbon footprint though. Like look into alternative vehicles. Most of my issues are with top level management and corporate greed rather than the everyday office environment."
good,"The pay is good, and people are good to work with. Very tough for contract employees the be promoted to full time."
good,"great place to work but difficult to get hired to become a in house full time worker. If the way the hiring process could be changed, Harley would be an overall good place to work at"
good,"Harley-Davidson heeft een herkenbare lifestyle om hun merk gebouwd dat een sterke toegevoegde waarde heeft voor zowel de klant, de dealer als de Motor Company zelf."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers and meeting all kinds of customers from every different state and all walks of life.
good,"fun days at work"
good,"I entered Harley as a temporary employee due to the need to work a non-traditional schedule in order to provide a different level of care for my daughter.  I found a work culture like no other.  While no job can be labeled 'perfect', the level of support I find from the management team and my fellow employees is a breath of fresh air.  The hardest part of the job is being physically and mentally engaged for 10 hour shifts overnight.  The most enjoyable part of the job is I have a good part of the daylight hours available at home where I am needed."
good,"I started in 1993.  I worked at Cap dr mostly.  I started in the assembly area, the old 914 dept for you old guys.  Three lines of assembly...XL, Transmission, FL.  I worked all three lines.  I was then moved to the dock area.  Worked with some really good old timers and most truck drivers.  Then I was moved to Juneau ave, the original plant.  Worked up on the sixth floor, Harleys only paint dept at the time.  I still remember how the line would jam up sometimes and shake the parts off the hooks...bang,bang.  Then Capitol dr rebuild the old maintenance dept into the new powder coat facility."
good,"Working as a contractor for Harley-Davidson definitely had its perks. I got to travel, work overtime, ride motorcycles, and most importantly, be part of a positive, collaborative work environment."
good,"Typical day was between 10 and 12 hours, in that time SAP and CI skills were developed and employed  to control inventory. Management  has a strong culture in moving ahead through CI , employing the 5S of Kaizen, fellow employs pulled together as a team to drive quality. Hardest part was frantic pace to assure hourly reports were as up to date as possible, but that was also the most fulfilling point of the day."
good,É uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar até por ser uma das maiores e melhores fabricas de motocicletas do mundo.
good,"Would not send a friend to work there.  I liked their attitude regarding continuous improvement, but my department didn't have time to practice this philosophy.  Company pays well, self insured health insurance package."
good,I liked the job in general but I did not like that I wouldn't receive any benefits.
good,I traveled throughout the United States from January 2001 to December 2010 at different Harley-Davidson dealerships weekly.  The dealership installed new DMS system and I helped with the conversion plus training of the software to the employees also streamlining day to day operations for efficiency purposes.
good,"Harley is a wonderful organization and has a very balanced micromanagement structure, setting daily objectives concerning system logistics and exceptions that need corrected or adjusted daily using SAP/GUI.  Split duties with operations, scheduling daily build with supply chain and floor operations according to sales forecast and schedule."
good,Our pride in Harley-Davidson drives our competitive advantage our work strengthens the brand and builds our future. We fulfill customer expectations and make the worlds sought after motorcycles. Our 100% commitment to the H-D continuous improvement system produces sustainable world class results. We communicate openly in real time and pro-actively solve problems together. Together we create the future!
good,"I was responsible for supporting both internal and external diversity guidelines set by both HD and the government.  I maintained relationships with outside vendors, coordinated both internal and external events.  This was a great opportunity to learn about corporate culture and time management."
good,"I enjoyed my time at HD. Sometimes the customers could be difficult but i never let a single person ruin my day. I was doing what I loved to do. I loved helping people build, fix and customize their motorcycles. "
good,"great place to work, termnated after I was injured. worked assembly, paint and engine test"
good,"There is a variety if different positions here. The people are nice, the employee events are fun and the work is not too difficult. There are good benefits."
good,"While I didn’t have the best manager, the people I worked with were amazing and greatly made up for that.  In addition the culture was hard to beat and people were all striving for the same goal!"
good,They pay well and have good benifets. Their management needs a lot of work. They don't prioritize well and that causes failure throughout the entire company.
good,The company moved out of Kansas City so i dont recommend working for them . They displaced at least 800 workers here in the Kansas City area . The people I met there was the best thing i got from Harley
good,"I knew the owner of the dealership. I knew he was planning on selling and that's why I left. New owners usually bring in there own management staff, I didn't want to be out of work."
good,It’s a good place to work. Sometimes it’s very fast paced which I like.  I liked it better years ago.  Better management and with this came happier customers.
good,"It is sort of tough job and need fast reaction physical abilities. The facility and work environment are great, well organized to help you get in job safely and healthy."
good,Harley Davidson was a pleasure to work for because of all of the motorcycle they teach u how to ride the was light and wonderful if you like motorcycle
good,"Predictable schedule, great hourly pay and benefits, secure location, culture is relaxed. Show up to work everyday and on time and you shouldn't have a problem."
good,I was lucky enough to be a vested pension employee. It’s still a good place to work even though employment practices and compensation - benefit policies have been lowered. It’s a completely different environment than it was during my early years of employment. Whether that’s good or bad is up to individual interpretation.
good,Good place to work but I was just an intern until they outsourced to Infosys. The internship was a great way to get my foot in the door and I would have liked to work for HD but that was not the way things worked out.
good,"We work alot of hours, but well worth it!The company is driven to take care of the customer, and that is what they do! it is our goal to make sure everyone is safe and having a blast on their motorcycles!"
good,Enjoyed working here.  People really buy into the culture.  Casual dress code is nice. Company cares about maintaining sense of history and offers a unique work environment.
good,"Not great training. I had 3 days training as the store manager I would have expected a little more. You get a lot of the ""Run around"", no one can very give you a straight answer. The customers are the best !!"
good,"I loved working for this company. It was a lot of fun got to go to buying shows all over the USA to purchase all general merchandise for the store. I was trained in all departments from shipping receiving/sales/service and parts. I mainly took care of Motorclothes which was great, had an amazing customers and I love people so It was perfect fit."
good,"Pros: Very well compensated; great family life/work balance; lunch room"
good,Good salary and benefits for the area. Strong brand recognition and travel and work from home opportunities exist. Leadership is supportive. Discounts are available
good,"I'm happy working here. I have a great management team. They make me feel important and give me challenging work."
good,"Machine and assemble motorcycle engines."
good,It is a little cut throat on sales because of 4-5 sales. Over all a fun place to work and the manager Brian was a great guy. The co workers are easy to get a long with and are generally fun.
good,Typical day included dealing with Harley Davidson service. I learned about Harley Davidson Motorcycles. The most enjoyable part of the job was Being around Motorcycles and customers.
good,long hours very slow days pay is good but not worth being bored 75% of the time. The customer traffic is not consistant and many days you wont even get the opportunity to deal with a prospective buyer especially as the summer is winding down
good,"Great place to work. Company is very engaged in honoring the heritage of the brand. Workplace is very user friendly, casual environment, but with strong work ethic and drive for results."
good,"- Daily you are multi-tasking on various items to help drive metric improvements"
good,"My typical workday includes unloading delivery trucks, organizing boxes between clothing and parts departments, physically checking in product, pricing items for the sales floor, and verifying invoices match what is received in the computer. I am responsible for properly packaging and creating a label for items that need to be shipped out. I also create purchase orders for various vendors, call customers to inform them their special order is in, and complete other tasks as assigned."
good,I learned how to balance between work & time.My colleagues are very helpful to each other.The workshop has a good working environment.
good,"Great company, too bad they went out of business. They taught me how to be a team player and to work well with others. Helped set up their shipping and receiving departments in 2 locations, also helped set up their IT networking infrastructure"
good,"Working in Harley Davidson is always busy but happy. I have learned so much things in my experiences in this Company. The Management and my co-workers are friendly and they will support you most of the time."
good,"Just working at Harley-Davidson gives you a sense of pride to be part of an American legend."
good,Great place to work. The culture has changed over the years but still an excellent company.  They could do a better job of mentoring and defining what it takes to move up or over in the company.
good,"Daily challenges encountered that were manageable or could be overcome with the support of coworkers, engineering and mgt."
good,"I was hired during the most recent hiring ""surge"" through one of the multiple temp agencies that supplied bodies for their mass hire. It became evident from the start that the members of the two unions that are present at the plant were biased against the temp workers. Through their ""surges"" there's three levels of employee status: temp, hd-casual, and hd-fulltime. Two months in as a temp I was offered an HD-casual position wherein I was forced to join one of the unions and had to pay an initiation fee of $75 and a reoccurring monthly fee of just under $60 (these fees are non-negotiable... you have to pay them even if you elect not to be a member of the union). I was not a happy union member... I basically felt like I had to pay for an over-priced T-shirt with a monthly subscription fee. Near the end of my employment, I overheard one of the union stewards on my shift discussing the placement of Casual and Fulltime union member employees stating exactly ""The fulltime members have precedence over the casuals."" Now... I'm not one to complain often (nor brag for that matter)... but I worked harder to keep my job than some of the full-timers did. Namely the ones who would unload a truck, then disappear for hours on end as they'd sit at their desk and play on their phone or go play hooky with their boyfriend in a different department. I paid the same monthly dues as they did, and I'm hearing that my role doesn't matter as much as theirs because they've been there longer... even though I worked harder? Not disgruntled... but very disgusted."
good,"Learned the manufacturing business, but was not fully trained.  Company utilizes project management teams for all projects and they have their own company PMP Methodology.  Learned process mapping using Visio, worked with all departments and all levels of management in order to accomplish company goals."
good,Harley was a nice company to work for. Most management was helpful in helping me advance and also very personable. I would recommend.
good,"Came in as entry level tech doing (PDI) Pre Delivery Inspection on all new & used motorcycles. Give them all a good safety inspection, change all fluids and replace anything unsafe. From tires, brakes, cables. Diagnose electrical problem & correct them."
good,"fun place to work no gaurntee of a job, they dont are much about ur home life i was an auditor so i had it pretty easy but hearing how they treated other employees wasnt right"
good,Very customer oriented Dealership. The Owners and manager are very eager to hire me since I am a veteran. The most enjoyable part of working here is seeing classic bikes from the 50s thru 70s come to life and see the faces of joy from the motorcycle owners. Hardest part of my job is that we are under staffed
good,"I work between 6 and 7 day a week. I come in at 8.30 am and stay till 6.30 to 7.00pm. I love engaging with the employees and the customers from all over. I feel I have one of the best jobs in the world. Being in the Operation Directors spot I can’t get to close to the employees, which I don’t get to know them on a personal level. The hardest part of this job is being the middle man between corporate and the customers and employees. With Harley-Davidson you can’t only be managing the store you also have to be a event coordinator, entertainer, concierge. But all this is what makes this job so rewarding."
good,Working for this company gave me an insight how this company works and what are their priorities. I had a chance to learn about their products and I am very glad that I could successfully contribute to HD dealership in Zagreb with my skills and knowledge.
good,"H-D manufacturing is on the journey toward world class, and all the employees who currently work there will benefit in the long run. The transformation is challenging but rewarding."
good,"Work day would be 8 hours with 1 hour lunch break. I worked either 9-5 or 11-7."
good,Great job to work for if you like to work with motorcycles day in and day out
good,Learned a lot in machining.  Worked on the roll-out of CTR and transition to Lean Manufacturing.
good,It was a fast paced workplace.
good,"A day in the office started with reviewing exchanges in communication between priorities, schedules, and patrons. I learned to manage time and workflows to meet deadlines and learned not to commit to ambiguity, yet to be able to work openly within the uncertainty. My most enjoyable part of the work place was the creativity that was allowed to develop innovative products and services to such a great customer base."
good,"Interviewers were very impressed and wanted me immediately. I left for about 2 years to go back home to Denver. Wanted to come back in May 2016, went to Emerald City's web site and they wanted me back ASAP. Came back and worked there until November 2019."
good,"My typical day a work was putting parts together for the line."
good,"enjoyed the time spent there,gained a lot of knowledge to use in the future. helped me reach a lot of my goals in life,prepared me for the future job ahead"
good,Buddy Stubbs HD allowed for growth of personal management skills and academy skills. CEO's allowed self paced classes and recruitment of potential students and  sales.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I was given options to go to conventions as well as classes to advance, learn and grow. The benefits were great too. My direct supervisor created a personal mess for me so I had to go, but I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a fun, challenging and nurturing career path."
good,Enjoyed the challenge and employees. Each day provided a challenge and when you’re in an environment with a take time the focus is of utmost importance. Teamwork is key in this fast pace environment.
good,"This place stood out unlike any other job I have chosen. They teach you, and give you the tools you need to be successful, overall it was a fantastic place with some fantastic people."
good,"My assignment was to improve suppliers quality, delivery, warranty or cost issues.  I also developed a Six Sigma Yellow, Green and Black Belt program for the suppliers."
good,"A typical day at work is comprised of rotating every two hours through 4 different stations; each station assembling an number of parts to the powertrain. I enjoy learning different stations and teaching others how to do each task. I like the workplace and the employees that work there but I feel like the hiring process is too long and drawn out for new employees. It takes about 2-4 years for a temp to become a full time regular employee and during those 2-4 years, they have no idea where they stand in terms of the hiring process."
good,Harley is a company currently in restructure.  They have a laid back work enviorment but need to improve there customer interests.  Management is decent.  Workplace is very relaxed.  Typical day is multiple meetings with some trying to get things done.
good,It's a great place to work however lack of career advancement opportunities due to constant reorganizations and layoffs. The people that do the work are very talented.
good,"I was a contract engineer at Harley.  I enjoyed working there, but with layoffs and a permanent engineer there to take my place I wasn't able to get in as a regular employee.  I was responsible for the Transmission machining area.  I learned about robot assisted machining and a Automated Guided Vehicles used in the cells."
good,Good organization but the plant is low product capacity ( make the customer demand).Less opportunity . Good working culture and invironment.High product Quality.
good,Harley Davidson Credit was a great place to work. I was always learning something new. I started as Customer Service transferred to repossession and ended up in the Legal Department. I was always learning something new.
good,"I started working in Motorcycle sales with only a background in the automotive industry-vehicle parts(mechanical). I had a background in customer relations and service, but that was the extent of it. Got to work, did my job, went home, repeat. "
good,Harley-Davidson is an excellent place to learn the ropes of manufacturing. The company is extremely dynamic and always changing. The fast-paced workplace allows for hard workers to show what they are truly made of.
good,Atmosphere is one of a kind. Harley-Davidson is one of the world’s strongest brands with a long history of building great motorcycles. It’s more than just a business. H-D lives it's purpose every day- delivering dreams of personal freedom – and do it like nobody else.
good,Fun place to work but slow advancement and not much money to be made. I enjoyed working with something I am passionate about though and can be perfect for the right person.
good,A typical day at HDFS is a fast paced. You want to make sure your queue (accounts) have been skipped. You want to make sure to average 130 to 175 calls daily
good,"Harley Davidson is an interactive place and fun to be with. Customer service is the first priority. The place is so inviting with some sport activity inside the shop. snooker, table tennis and dart. People are so friendly including the regular customer who owned a bike."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for Perth Harley Davidson, they are great bunch of people to work for. They are very professional yet easy going. I have also learnt a lot since i started there."
good,Great people that work there but not sure about job security. Pay is good and health benefits are good as well. Pay is $17 and hour which is fair for the work that is done. Overpriced lunches.
good,Loved working here. Only left because i just moved to Knoxville on April 8th 2017. Worked there for three years. The culture was comfortable and pleasant.
good,"I had the opportunity to work in an environment that supported my own leisure sport as well as meet amazing people."
good,Harley Davidson has very good benefits and has the typical work life balance for an IT organization.  Being in IT you have to anticipate some after hours work to deliver applications into production.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Harley Davidson motorcycles because my manager would make us laugh in the mornings and made me feel very welcomed. While on our brake we had free Irish coffee, hot chocolate, tea etc. along with a Billards table and friendly competitions."
good,"A company that allows creativity and flexibility when developing solutions to solving problems and meeting customer satisfaction."
good,"é uma empresa boa de trabalhar, tem varios beneficios."
good,"I learned how a bike was put together from molding the parts, then painting and to assembly. A typical day at work was painting parts to go out to other lines for the next steps. The management was great to work with along with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would have been learning all the jobs and doing them to the standards with no errors. I loved doing the water slides on the bikes."
good,New management/ owners are a great group of people that make things happen with a positive vibe. Most of the  people that work there blend well with others they work with. Its a family type feel.
good,"My experience with Harley-Davidson was good overall. Work was not repetitive, and the pay was nice. Management was very strict and professional, and took safety very seriously. I enjoyed working with my hands and seeing the results of my hard work. The only thing I didn't like was the work schedule, which was prone to change often."
good,"Joined as a Surge contractor and have learned so much about a new field. My teammates have made everything interesting, engaging, and fun. The Harley I work at now is not the Harley I grew up near - and that's a great thing. Coworkers who greet you when you walk past, strangers on the line or in the professional area who crack jokes with you, and a sense of family and team from day one. Even if I don't have an opportunity to last because of the seasonality of my hire, I'm overjoyed that I had a chance to be reminded of what a great workplace is really like."
good,spent most of the day on the computer entering data. some time filing papers. also some time preparing things for mailing. I learned how to work w/ a team and how to achieve a good work ethic. management was nice and friendly at first but when we had changes in the company management became kind of too bossy and really over shadowed too much. Co-workers were friendly and easy to talk to but sometimes you would have to watch what you say. the hardest part of the job was staying focused on what you were doing because it got repetitive and boring. plus when the management became the over shadowing type it got hard to focus when you got that feeling of constantly being watched. the best part of the job is they would really appreciate any little above and beyond effort you would put in. they would always acknowledge the littlest thing you would do. I really did like working there. its a good place to start if your just beginning in the job force.
good,Management is focused on long-term growth and strategy. Great work culture. Management encourages future learning and supports developmental growth.
good,This was a completely new experience to me. Through this opportunity I was fortunate enough to learn more sales techniques as well as more about motorcycles in general.
good,"It is a terrific place to work at, with a great culture and a great atmosphere.  People are very friendly and helpful. It is a superb place, one of the best I have ever worked for.  I was a contract employee there, and I only wish that I was direct, so I could work there for the rest of my life."
good,"A typical day at the Harley shop consisted of helping in all departments, including Parts, Motor Clothes, and Warehouse. Working mainly as a receptionist from open to close, the responsibilities included answering phones, transfering calls, helping customers in store also."
good,"HDFS is a good place to work, team oriented, frequent free lunch, frequent meetings and training. No tolorence for being a minute late"
good,Lots to do. The office is really cool and laid back. Wear jeans every day and embrace the Harley culture.
good,"Empresa muito boa e tranquila de se trabalhar, benefícios justos."
good,Good place to work and learn  about the motorcycle industry and warehouse work. You constantly busy and time goes by fast and learn new things every day
good,"Fun place, very busy during certain times. Great people. Good work environment. Great interaction with the dealers. Fun on site events for the employees."
good,I worked as a motor clothes representative here during popular riding seasons. It was fun to interact with customers through witty banter and get to know them on a personal level.
good,H-D has a lot going for it in terms of future vision.  There's a lot of opportunity for internal transfers and there are a lot of contingent (contract) employees which leads to a lot of personnel changes during engineering projects.
good,"provided me with plenty of opportunities."
good,"It is laid back and you have your own accounts, work at your own pace, talk to repo agents, skip trace and have supportive managers that are willing to help."
good,"Information is from years ago - it would not be relevant to anyone seeking or considering employment with Harley-Davidson today. Therefore, your surveys need to only be collected if the employment  at the company occurred less than a year or so."
good,very professional surroundings. Great staff to work with. The atmosphere is very comprehensive and understandable.  I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"Nice job, good working environment, good menegment, good polacy, nice to talk to everyone in company, always good to work in Harley Davidson, good facilities"
good,this company doesn't always keep track of its employees. this company has weak and poor mnagment who don not care about the store or the sales. it is a crocked system
good,"was customer care and the ability to help each customer and follow through each call"
good,"Assisted in the design and implementation of a new facility machine layout for upcoming model change. In addition, performed cost analysis of work-in-process inventory, to help reduce production cost."
good,I enjoyed the time I had at Harley Davidson plant. I was building the gas tanks for the Harley-Davidson bikes. The job was fast pace and we where limited to how many bikes and parts we needed to get done before the day was over with but it’s a good hands on job.
good,"Great company to work for, love the people, customers, and overall atmosphere. Would recommend to a friend or family member. They work with you every step of the way."
good,I have learned a lot working for H-D.  They are a great company to work for.  I love the environment and the culture and they offer a lot of room for advancement and learning.
good,Motorcycles are my passion and Harley-Davidson is my favorite brand and it's my dream bike also. So having the opportunity to work with them was not only a privilege but an honor. Sadly I left them for family and personal reason.
good,"I enjoyed working at Harley, It was a fast pace job but, I did enjoy it.  I was there as a temp but sitll on the payroll.  I get a call every year to come back during their busy season."
good,I learned a lot about product design and project management. Friendly atmosphere. Amazing brand and product. Good benefits and PTO. Nice facilities and on-site gym.
good,the company itself is a great place to get your career started if you never worked for a big company before. im looking more for a second home and to advance to a higher level of success.
good,I enjoyed my time at Harley but the night shift was not something that I was able to adapt to. I wouldn't mind returning but if to come across something I would take advantage
good,"Although the environment is fast-paced and competitive, HDFS really cares for it's employees. There is a lot of camaraderie there. Management is very supportive and they do many special events for the employees."
good,"Worked in a department requiring consumer analysis and input based on customer feedback. Enjoyed the experience, and was treated well in this very laid-back, collaborative environment."
good,Something different happening everyday. 4 day work week plus getting paid every week was nice. Friendly atmosphere and chances for opportunity to move around.
good,An exciting position as I daily determined or assisted in the decisions that affected the profitability and operations of the assembly line by either determining the quality was within spec or not and to make a determination of how extensive a particular repair is need for a unit in order to ship the unit.
good,"it was a great company to work for if i could i would work for them again. It was a fast past, laid back and relaxing work environment. very caring and understanding."
good,"Great place to work, the people are nice and the building is beautiful. Great teamwork skills from all staff and a wonderful learning experience. Big thumbs up."

good,Harley was a friendly environment with lots of support from co-workers and lots of opportunities for training and for advancement. Relaxed environment.

good,"Great place to work and the team here has a real bonding. Though its a small team, customers and the employees are like a family. words are not enough to praise the working environment here. The most important asset of this company is a crystal clear communication from the top to bottom every one can be reached with out any breach / protocol's if necessary."
good,The owner was the greatest I ever worked for.  I was an honor to work for the oldest Harley dealer run by the original owner.  She opened in 1946 and sold in 2008
good,"You're surrounded by motorcycles all day....what could be better!?!?! "
good,"A typical day at Harley Davidson Motor Company involves a lot of teamwork, interactive problem solving, goal setting, personal assessment and development, rigorous work pace, high quality minded decision-making, sustainability metrics, DMAIC problem solving techniques, continuous improvement metrics, cost reduction plans, and process improvements."

good,A great company to work for with very kind co-workers. The company is also very focused on great customer service. This was a very nice work environment.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Harley-Davidson. I learned the art of the sale as well as gained much of my customer service skills that I still use today.
good,When you work for a family they treat you like one of their own.  The motorcycle world does that as well.  It was an enjoyable experience that I wish I could have continued.
good,"Company is not a top down management culture, the structure of the company is all about inclusiveness which drives communication and teamwork."
good,Great business. Very happy about the time i spent with company. Great people and management. i would recommend the company to many.
good,This was a fun place to work...however it just wasn't the place for me.  You will work every weekend no matter how long you have been at the company. For someone that doesn't mind that then it would be a very enjoyable job for you.  I loved the people I worked with and the atmosphere.  It just wasn't the right fit for me at this time in my life.
good,"it is like one big family."
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers time they walk in the door. Helping with merchandise. Most of your money comes with commission on this job at Harley Davidson, but I like the fact that you can see the customers face to face"
good,I looked forward to working with the team everyday at harley davidson. We treated each other with respect. I grew alot as a professional and a person working at harley davidson. A place i look back on and smile. Great managers and a great staff.
good,"I had a great time at this job. The people were outstanding and the two managers I had were the best I had ever encountered.The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely my co-workers and the way that management treated employees. Parties were always being thrown to show employee appreciation and even to celebrate employees' birthdays. A great environment to work in. The pay could've been better, but it was adequate for what was expected I think. The most difficult part of the job I think, was trying to always make a customer happy. It's doesn't always happen, but it's just part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed this job. Most of the people were friendly. A typical work day would be on the assembly line, rotating every hour to different jobs on the line."
good,"I worked with some of the best people at this job. The salary and benefits were more than generous. The opportunity to learn new skills was always available. The hardest part of the job was the constant repetition of doing the same things every day. Overall, I loved this job and enjoyed going to work every day."

good,I enjoyed my whole experience at warrs Harley Davidson from the staff to the customers. The staff taught me a lot and i will be for ever grateful for that.
good,"It’s an amazing place to work, it’s just the drama the motor clothes crew creates is beyond annoying. Hopefully they grow up from these childish actions, your work place is not the place for drama."
good,Great place to work. They just wanted the job done correctly. They never pressured me to get it done in a time frame. They understood that speed would eventually come when i learned the job. It appeared that they really appreciated their employees.
good,"Harley Davidson is extremely fast paced and at times involves high stress situations. The job as a cashier was so much more than just checking people out it was answering the phones and transferring them to the right person to help them, I was also the one who counted the money and handled the deposit at the end of a work day, and i also was the one who did the markdowns on the clothing."
good,You can’t really say much about a manufacturing legend. Great company overall but they have a ways to go as far as industry standards...just some fine tuning.

good,Harley Davidson Borie est une entreprise qui possède un univers de travail unique et une équipe qui se soutient dans toutes situations.
good,"The hardest part about the Harley Davidson festival was working long hours in the heat with only 30 minute breaks."
good,"A great place to work, the people are very friendly and helpful. Management keeps employees informed of events on a daily basis and will hold assemblies to inform employees of major events. It is not unusual to meet people with 20 or more years of experience so there is a high degree of employee dedication and very little turn-over. The company provides a very clean and efficient environment and communication with supervision or management is never difficult; problems are usually resolved the very same day. Communication takes on a very high priority. Most employees will stay at Harley Davidson until retirement; they are very proud of the company and it's product."
good,"Excellent company to work for, learn and grow. Great work life balance, benefits and compensation. Excellent team, passion for the brand and the product."

good,"Working for Harley Davidson has been a very rewarding experience. Starts off very early and is not a job for the lazy. I have had the opportunity to help build a very diverse range of motorcycles and engines. Something that was totally new to me. Management encouraged me at every turn. Co workers were very friendly in a highly competitive industry and environment. The hardest part of the job was learning so many facets in a short time, but that in its self was the most rewarding part as well."
good,"Job was contracted through Modern Solutions.  Head of facility was my second favorite boss ever.  Technicians, Engineers and Mechanics all participated in activities not related to work, regardless of status as a contracted employee or permanent hire."
good,"A typical day at Harley Davidson is very productive; putting out new stock, assisting customers, maintaining a clean work environment, etc."
good,Have learned many skills involving lean manufacturing working with a diverse workforce. Great environment to work in.
good,Start off with a morning with the team  to go over  the following day and to have a  plan for personel job duties and responsabilities for that day.Just to go over the  agenda for the day.
good,"special order parts and provide customer service.everyday is a new experience new model bikes, new parts make each customer his or her own specific challenge"
good,"I usually hit the ground running with early morning meetings as we are a multi-shift facility and support cross shift teams. Participating in  team projects is common as well as delivering training in JSA's and incident investigations. I am frequently called upon to respond to issues that arise as well as assist in root cause investigations. When new equipment is purchased I participate in the review and safety sign offs. Ergonomic assessments and evaluations are also regularly performed. Recommending safe solutions as well as safety products is a daily part of my work. Delivery of safety meetings,messages, and recordable rate information / injury data is typical within a given week. "
good,This job is still one of my favorites I have ever worked for. The people and customers were great. The people with in the company were like a family. the Ownership is still one of the best.
good,"It is a great company to work for. Though, the pay could be a bit better. Have a strong love for motorcycles. There is a unique process for everything, its the tmc way. They thoroughly will train you but the pay is a draw plus commission. The draw is sufficient but you must pay it back in commission."
good,Wish I could work full time not contract. Mfg process is first class. Management is involved and promotes employee involvement. Technicians are very knowledgeable. Great teamwork on production floor.
good,I loved the clientele and the product.  A lot of fun people to work around and awesome bikes.  The GM was very helpful in any way possible. I would recommend working at a Harley Davidson dealership.  Great opportunity.
good,Usually 10-12 hours per day.  I learned both power plant operations and was sent to school for robotics programming.  The culture at Harley was fast paced during my robotics programming position and the power plant position required independence as far as decision making along with meeting company goals with production.  The hardest part of this position was cleaning the boilers and the best part was the comradery and the great benefits.
good,"As an engineer, I am valued for my brain rather than what I wear to work. Telecommuting is allowed. Your experience may vary based on who your manager is. Some have required hours, some don't care when you work as long as your work gets done. Due to the constant release of product, workload is always high."
good,"I enjoyed working at Harley Davidson, I worked part time, 4 days per week.   I worked directly with engineering, project management team to understand the financial impact of new product development plans for the product lifecycle plan.  It was very flexible and afforded work life balance."
good,"1. Good work culture "
good,Working for Harley Davidson was an interesting experience. I enjoyed the Cafeteria and Workout Facility that was inside the plant in Menomonee Falls. A GREAT company to work for if you like to make money.
good,"A typical day at work would be: Grab a coffee with other employees first thing in the morning, top up the coffee machine for customers than will be coming in.

good,"I'm  also preparatory of motor engines, as costumizer  too ect.,..."
good,"Enjoyed going to work everyday, friendly group of people who were very good friends outside of work too."

good,"Wonderful owner, lots learned, long days, fun environment, laid-back but intense work days, freedom as long as the job is completed, amazing customers."

good,"Always something new to learn, from products to new machines to new bikes and merchandise. Alot of room for expansion and promotion, the owner where i worked would always have a Saturday that he would serve real beef hot dogs sausages and hamburgers for free as a way to give back to the customers and employees. Rolling thunder is the biggest event year round! All the people and bikes from all over the globe, one year over 250,000 people and bikers showed up just for the event."
good,Harley Davidson offers the opportunity to advance within your career or earn another degree or skills geared towards business and the betterment of your portfolio. Next year I plan on going back to school to achieve my masters in Human Resources so that I may assist others in life changing opportunities as Harley Davidson has done for me.
good,Great work Environment . The management team Always made it fun and was always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the new products that came out every few months.

good,Empresa busca grande interação com o cliente. Ambiente agradável.
good,"I learned a lot of new things while working with the Harley Davidson. I also used to work hard in the company. Coming to management, my manager always supports doing new things."

good,"Excellent place to work I worked there for 11 years and it was enjoyable, upper management was competent and fair generally speaking they pay a little less than the industry average"
good,"Typical work day  we would start with a meeting with are group.plan out the day within the group make our decisions share our decisions    with other groups so they would know what to expect from us as we would expect from them with any changes made so we could get it on paper to be put in work instructions.this was fun for all of us because we made the decisions ans stuck with them,sometimes it would get be hard to problem solve because we are dealing with a great diversity of people but it all worked out in the end. we had no supervision to make our decisions for us"
good,"A great place to work!"
good,"On a typical day, I underwrite up to 40 applications and take up to 40 phone calls while delivering exceptional customer service to our dealers. I also participate in several commitees and assist in multiple projects. My job also requires me to review and process loan contingencies and clear them via company policy in order to underwrite the best loans possible."
good,"I learned new skills while working at Harley Davidson that i didn't know before. I learned more about software and computers services, i also learned how to have good customer service and how to properly treat people in the work field and how to do it professionally."
good,"I enjoy my job working for Harley, I like the camaraderie I share w/my co-workers... We get to enjoy munch Mondays where a snack is provided and sometimes when we hit or surpass a goal free lunches are offered.  It is a relaxed atmosphere in the way where if you need help or have a question all you have to do is ask....My operations manager has an open door policy and is always willing to assist if a specific schedule adjustment is needed for special occasions and my team lead is energetic and informative.."
good,Working with harley davidson was just amazing. Everyone was helpul and i gained a life changing experience. The job culture is very positive. I will love to join this Company again.

good,I would work there again they're really nice people to be working with and they're very understanding to people situations if any occur I would definitely recommend this job to a friend
good,"This place used to be fun to work at. It’s a big corporation now, that is taking all the fun and the true roots out of the brand itself.  They don’t pay you what you earn they take your money out of your paycheck without you even knowing. The management team is lazy and they are not willing to help out when needed."
good,A typical day at work involves opening the showroom and moving the motorcycles out to the front. Also calling customers and selling to customers. Management is sub par. Workplace culture is great. Hardest part of the job is standing up for ten hours straight. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I come home at night.
good,Constant lay offs benifits suck plan on getting hired now plan on only working 3 months in the summer then being laid off also you get no benifits get paid half of what full time employees get.
good,"This review is not a reflection of the harley-davidson motor company, only the specific dealer that this employee is currently employed by.  Please be advised"
good,Don't hold your breath. They don't give raises especially after your 90 days. The team works very hard and superior don't notice to give anyone raises.
good,It was definitely an adventure being able to be thrown into the lifestyle because that's what it is not just a job it's a lifestyle I worked for a individual shop that sold aftermarket parts and motorcycles was not an actual Harley-Davidson dealership
good,Enjoyed working for the company because of the people. Friendly hard working and knowledgeable. Clean environment good work station location. Interesting work and challenging. I was a contractor worker so I can't comment on there benefits for there employees but there employees seemed to be happy with the company.
good,I really enjoy working with this company. It's very gapping place.  Its is exciting seeing all new Bikes and meeting people from all walks of life. I have enjoyed this place.
good,"Harley Davidson New York can be fast paced when it comes to the retail department but none the less a fun environment to work at. A Typical day at work was never typical, the moment you hit the floor it all begins very quickly. The hardest part about the job is having to learn everything on the fly because no one is really there to train you, its a learn as you go kinda place."
good,"loved the people i worked with, skills were awesome but we were over worked daily.Management was ok most days but a high volume work place is an under statement."
good,"It was a fun workplace, however in bad economic conditions making a sale can be quite stressful. The management was very communicative and the staff were very helpful!"
good,I loved this job the pay was good and it was filled with great coworkers and management. i learned alot about simple interest loans that helped with everyday life situations.
good,i always arrived early to get prepared for the morning rush of customers. i learned a lot about the different motorcycles. management was a joke. co-workers in the begining were awesome. after about 11 years new people were hired and i was training them at 7.50 per hour while they were getting 15.00 per hour? not right no it wasnt! i felt very used i put my heart and soul into this busniess only to be degraded in the end. i dont hate harley or even yamaha they were not the cause ownerwas and hie so called friend i trained where are they now

good,"Great products and really professional work environment. "
good,"During my time at H-D, I had many opportunities to learn and grow. I was able to travel to numerous countries and experience what our customers loved about the product first hand. The organization always challenged employees to think outside the box and be creative. "
good,"Hundred years of culture and wildly changing markets and merchandise. You learn a lot working here. I give them a lot of credit for making it this long, if only they weren't hampered by confusing (maybe confused) management and policies.I had some of my very best experiences and some of the worst. I often had wonderful engaged supervisors and occasionally those that were crass and fundamentally confounded. Which were the reason I left. I'd work there again, for the right person,but would learn to look back as much as I went forward."
good,"Bank Deposits, Funding"
good,Wow my Dream job what a amazing experience i have learned so much from the company and i fell inlove with the job. I have no complaints about the company at all. Sadly my contract ended with them.
