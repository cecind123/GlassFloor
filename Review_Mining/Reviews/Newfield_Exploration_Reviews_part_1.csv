bad,"I would get up and get on the boat and go out in the field to check on all the platforms that I was responsible for. If the monthly BSEE testing was due I would do it. I learned a lot about monthly BSEE testing and well testing. I had good management at this job with communication. I liked all the guys that I rode the boat with and did all the monthly BSEE testing. The hardest part was getting to the platforms in the winter because of no helicopter, we had to boat and it would get rough."
bad,"your just a number, they don't recognize you for anything positive, just only the negatives. They only promote friends and family to management positions."
bad,"This company was goring thru growing pains the 3 years I worked there.  I worked as a Revenue accountant and we had 3 supervisors in 3 years.  For such a small office, the atmosphere was almost hostile.  I worked hard and got bonuese every year and I drove 1.5 hour each way to work 5 days a week.  It wasn't worth it."
good,"Get in with the right people and you will do well.  Politics plays a big role here.  Lots of young technical staff, and a lack of experienced personnel to mentor.  A constant state of turnover has lead to under qualified people in leadership/management roles."
good,Management doesn't get involved with the employees and they are only concerned with their bonus. Management did a major layoff so they could get their bonuses. Management overall is not concerned with the employee just public opinion.
good,great place to work.just to political.it was more about who u know rather than what u know.when every manager retired or moved up in position.they hired awful people to try to manage the company because who they were buddy's with rather than give the jobs to the people that had earned them and deserved the positions.
good,Reviewed and analyzed contracts acquired by Newfield from TXCO and entered contracts into ORACLE land system.
good,"Nice, smart colleagues"
good,"Nice place to work. Management is very knowledgable and human relations is very responsive to employee needs. Overall, a very nice working environment."
good,"Enjoyed the company, and was grateful for the opportunities that were presented to me.The industry presented challenges for newfield and left the commercial side of the business short handed."
good,"Organizationally, wonderful atmosphere, culture, team environment and willingness to train individual to succeed."
good,"Senior management very hands-on. Capital spending program changes frequently as result of desire to optimize company performance and profitability, which leads to stress on the organization as teams must start/stop and redirect focus frequently."
good,The employees there were nice to work with. Everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs for the short time I was there. Working there was a good experience and the work-life balance was very perfect compared to some other companies.
good,"The job is basic Drafting and Design, however the product is a very intriguing design."
good,"Very conservative oil and gas company.  Very diversified in it's approach to human resources within its culture. The oil and gas industry and changed considerably over the last 10 years.  The company is no longer part of the baby boomer era, which made it. It belongs to millenials and is relevant for its own time."
good,This company has an objective to succeed. They are determined to find what ever it takes to make sure that the company and the investors are successful.
good,"Unfortunately , I had 20 years more experience than my supervisor for this contract position. It seems these days if you do a better job, it causes problems for all the geniuses. The hardest part of the job was making the top progress reports for 7 months and not having been given credit. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck or conversing with farmland owners to acquire right of way across property for a gas pipeline."
good,"Newfield is fast paced sometimes a little too fast paced. The one thing that you could count on is that you planned for something and it never went that way. It's hard to get people to understand this both inside and outside of the company. People are sometimes clueless to this even after the fact that they have been there, they would rather focus on the next job not on the job that they currently have and could do and be better at"
good,"Local management was poor."
good,"Newfield had excellent benefits, and many perks to take advantage of.  There was always a company functions that went above and beyond any other company of this size."
good,"While there I always had the tools I needed to get the job done. Worked an 8&6 schedule so had plenty of days off. Bonuses for company stock going up 4% and annual bonus/raise based on performance. Pay was above average. But the cost is that you are disposable, they have a history of big layoffs."
good,"Oil and Gas company extremely focused on its core business but IMHO had some problems putting the right people in the right places outside of those core focus areas, specifically in the management of the Information Technology department. Outside of that internal issue I believe it is a very solid company. I know the CEO personally. Have a lot of respect for him and he is a GREAT business leader. I would go back to work at Newfield if given the opportunity in the future but would want the opportunity to make some needed organizational changes in my particular focus area. Great co-workers, extremely smart and skilled staff."

They have great benefits and work to develop there employees with their realm of expertise to prepare them for other opportunities when possible.

The job was very rewarding because it allowed me to interact with so many different people in different departments of the company, from executives to HR to Treasury to IT. As a member of the support team, I interacted with everyone to see to their needs. I enjoyed working for the management group at Newfield. They're leading the company in the right direction and I've always been impressed by how open and approachable they are. My co-workers were the best that I ever had. In our own way, through our own departments, we were all striving to make Newfield the best it can be. You always felt a sense of team spirit while working there. The hardest part of my job was saying goodbye to it. The most enjoyable part was, without a doubt, the co-workers and the camaraderie I shared with them.
