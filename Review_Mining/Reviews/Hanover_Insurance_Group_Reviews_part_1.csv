rating,review
bad,It was a horrible place to work  pier manacles and poor employees relations with Human Resources being a high part of the problem and no room for advancement
bad,"Awful company to work for. They don't care about you at all. Management plays favorites. Work you to death. No opportunity for growth or advancement. Attempts to leave the company are torpedoed by management. They get wind you're looking and they shoot it down when they get a call. The managers are so stupid, they don't even know anything about insurance."
bad,no room for advancement  not recommended to people - you have to know someone in order to move up in the company. The systems are very old and take forever in order to be trained on how to use them and I am so glad I do not work for Hanover anymore.
bad,I don't recommend working here.  Very high employee turnover.  Has layoffs on a regular basis.  High stress environment with low pay compared to other companies.  Get a year or 2 experience and look elsewhere.
bad,If you are looking for a call center job this is the place for you. The company is making a lot of changes that do not necessarily benefit their employees.
bad,I did not enjoy working at this company. Lack of opportunities for advancement and uninteresting work were a major problem for me.
bad,"Not only is the management in this company terrible the pay is ridiculous, They ask too much do not give any employees any acknowledge of their performance. Worst job I ever had...."
bad,"The local management was horrible and very two faced. Every one in the auto claims office hated their job but were scared to leave. They expect 12 hour work days for little pay. Do not work for this company in Richmond unless you want to be around depressed people all day. It could likely be very different in the other offices. Training is also beyond sub-par and management does not take feedback well. The local office also denies to many claims so you will get stuck with old rental bills for claimants when the subrogation dept overturns local liability decisions as they do not handle rental for claimants if they paid out of pocket. Evan though I put that I approve of the CEO is being pushed out by the board for someone more ""wallstreet"" friendly"
bad,Please do your research before accepting employment with this company. If you want a career...look elsewhere. If you simply want a job with no chances for advancement...this is the place for you.
bad,"The manager was useless and did not listen. Noone trusted anyone else and managers would listen to phone calls and then question what you were doing. Everyone was afraid to speak up or would be retaliated against. If you made a mistake, no one discussed it with you or tried to help -- most folks just got fired. Very sneaky environment -- if you didn't drink the kool aid then you were canned. No one welcomed new ideas or differnt opions - it was like a very bad dysfuncitional family. The most awlful place I ever worked. It still gives me a stomach ache to think about it. Seriously!"
bad,"Incompetent upper management, high employee turnover and no raises are the norm at this company. Worked there 6 years and only received one cost of living raise..also, not a lot of minorities..."
bad,"Career opportunities not based on skills, experience or education but on likeability. The staff was the enjoyable part of the role since engagement was daily and the interest level was high.  Flow of information was very limited and often times not evenly shared among the managers"
bad,"Disorganized operation. In Atlanta, no leadership from underwriting management, it is management by intimidation and threats. High turnover among all departments particularly Middle Market underwriting. Underwriters are treated poorly and disrespected, not treated like the professionals they are."
bad,Spent all day on ancient phones using technology that was developed in the 90's (i'm not kidding) The customers weren't bad and the job wasn't awful but management sent me home one day for no reason and terminated me (wouldn't tell me why and did it over the phone when they could have easily told me to my face).
bad,"I would pass on working here as opposed to other area insurance companies. I now have been working for another company for a year that treats their employees significantly better! Turnover is absolutely unbelievable in the Senior Claims environment. Management is very disorganized. One of the managers only had a year of adjusting experience and no personal skills either! The claim volume is also terrible, you are constantly inheriting another pending in addition to your own due to the turnover issues. Total claim pending for PIP is usually around 150+. The annual salary sounds great but the benefits are very expensive so your income is significantly reduced from what you are told you will be earning at time of hire. The Senior Adjusters are responsible for all training of new employees so training is dependent on which adjuster is assigned to you and what their workload is like at the time. There is no actual trainer that does not have a pending. Co-workers are great because they are basically the only people in your life that understand what it is like to deal with such incompetent managers and to be so overloaded with work. The best part of the job was the flexible scheduling , new employees get to work from home up to 4 days per week depending on how the manager feels about you. Be prepared to be micromanaged when working from home though! You will get several calls and emails per day from your manager to check on you but at least you do not have to deal with the volatile office environment as often so it does actually help a little (adjusters regularly walking out with no"
bad,"There is no communication from upper management.  The Howell, MI office is treated like red headed stepchildren by the corporate headquarters in Worcester, MA.  If you are a woman age 40 or over you have no future with the company. Rarely does the company hire anyone over the age of 40.  They outsource the processing, accounting, claims and underwriting functions to India but won't share that fact with the policy holders or the independent agents that sell their insurance.  Employees are explicitly warned not to share that information with agents or customers."
bad,"Management appears to justify their existence by micromanaging highly trained and paid professionals.  Even in instances where there are zero complaints, and in fact, high praise from all involved, management looks for problems in every corner.  Management appears to want you to spend more time justifying every single decision you make in case as opposed to actually representing your clients and the company zealously and efficiently."
bad,"Management doesn't care about employees! Everything one-sided!!"
bad,"I worked at Aix Group, which is a division of Hanover Insurance. Although, perhaps, I could have asked more questions during my interview, the job was not at all what I had expected. More specifically, it is an internal T.P.A. with a very disorganized hierarchy. Despite their knowing my background and experience, I was expected to handle types of claims which I had never handled (e.g. products liabiltiy claims, environmental claims, large property damage claims, and construction defect claims) and was given absolutely no training and/or resources with respect to same. The position also involved complex and time-consuming coverage issues on nearly every case because the company had many policy forms and endorsements which were unique to the company."
bad,After requesting a meeting with H.R. you may be terminated the following day without cause!
bad,"The work environment was at best tolerable and at the worst, toxic. Management is terrible and it must trickle down from the top.  Mircomanagement of every decision, even of highly paid and trained professionals.  Management looks for mistakes, even creates mistakes, in order to justify their positions with the company.  Hard-working and highly qualified people are never rewarded for accomplishments and often criticized. "
bad,"Poor management, and intimidation techniques used by management to force change. Training is poor, the internal applications / tools to do your job are of poor quality or otherwise outdated. Too many manual processes. "
bad,great co-workers but systems were antiquated and manual workaround processes are the normal. Co-workers very helpful. Management out of touch with employees workload and expectations. Very sneaky environment. Managers expectations most times are way to high for the amount of work.
bad,High turnover. Management do very little to help you succeed. They often talk a big game but at the end of the day they really do nothing. Most people leave and are successful in other places.
bad,"I loved Hanover Insurance, the work management and employee benefits but I was lied to and what I thought was training future employees was job loss due to INDIA"
bad,"it is a good place to work if you can work with  no one being in the office.  Most work from home making it harder to get help when you need it."
bad,Company wrote Personal lines for both auto insurance and homeowners insurance along with many types of commercial lines business insurance.
bad,"Unethical and abusive management: Managers within the CSC-PL have no concern for the employees; you don’t work “with” you work “for” your managers, there is no support or work-life balance."
bad,This company is not a good company! I started from the bottom passed tests to get my P&C License and they let me go 3 weeks after offering me a permanent position because there background team could not verify a part time job I had put on my resume!! And don’t forget I passed a background check to get the job initially!!!
bad,"Once you get put into a normal workload you are always overworked And forced to do OT at home for free to keep up. Raises are little to none.  The staff morale is low due to being understaffed. The office environment is friendly, but everyone is too busy to get to know one another. Management does not offer any real help or solutions."
bad,Job is stressful and there is not enough help to make your job a success.  When I was there I handled 5 states and my manager was not very helpful.  I requested help many times but to no results.  My contacts said she left 4 months after she let me go.
bad,Very difficult place to work and can not recommend it in it current state. Worked here several years and always major morale problems on the floor. Bad systems & poor support makes getting mundane processing a major time suck.
bad,"I worked for The Hanover Insurance Group for 2 years. I reported to about 6 different managers w/in the 2 years ( all while I was in the same position), never recieved any feedback on my work or an end of year review. Worked 40+ hrs during the week/weekends with no praise. Was not promised what I was told when I was hired out of college looking for a company to start a career and grow. They are not big on education. The company is trying to grow while it is understaffed."
bad,"This position was very stressfull with time constraints, requiring long hours to complete assignments in timely manner. Much windshield time to cover the territory given."
bad,"I worked there for five years. "
bad,Was a nice place to work in earlier times. The company has become way too focused on profits. CEO brags about commitment to the local community while jobs are outsourced to India.
bad,"I had to train my replacements in order to  collect my severance, very  demeaning!  Good companies don't do things like this, I would not recommend Hanover as a company that cares about people regardless of what they claim.  I was replaced by off shore resources."
bad,"Arrived daily about 8 AM, and left about 5:30 PM...  Did some work at home on laptop, and occasionally in the Office on a SaturdayThey are not kind to older, more experienced workers."
bad,"Mid management is afraid to admit mistakes & correct them for fear of incurring wrath of their supervisors. Pay & benefits are pretty good, growth potential is eh."
bad,Very serious place to work ... it seems that if you were there for 10 or more years that is a fab place to work but coming in as a new hire not a nice place at all.
bad,Decent organization but needs to jump into the 21st century.  Seems like the 80's are alive and thriving at Hanover some days. OId leadership was trying to turn it into a real player; not sure about current leadership.;
good,In the area of the business that I worked in there was no daily coordination held.  I was given the latitude to institute this as a new procedure.  I was also a given the latitude to organize regulatory filing information in to a new file structure format that stood the test of a mock regulatory audit conducted by a independent specialist.  The audit passed first time right without comment.
good,At first the nice benefits package and decent compensation lure you in. The training is rigorous and so much is crammed in at once. The work load you have to endure everyday is taxing. Eventually you start to wear down. Would be a decent job if company was more organized and there was more assistance to the employees. If you can deal with high stress and micromanagement then this job is for you.
good,What senior leaders say and do are not aligned. Not easy to navigate the politics without being one of the inner circle boys.  Too much turnover at the top levels of the organization.
good,"For the most part Hanover has been great. I work with some amazing people, but the managers are pretty terrible from my vantage point. There’s almost no room for advancement! No matter what they say."
good,"Lure you in with promises for room for advancement but once your there you realize that not only is there no room for advancement, but you are over loaded with an unrealistic workload and set for failure."
good,there was a 50% turnover rate in my department in one year (weekly emails stating that so and so no longer worked there (Fired)) not very good on the job security spirits
good,"I love the company and the people I work with but Mismanagement is the biggest issue among this company. The pay and benefits are amazing, couldn't wish for more."
good,Expectations regarding amount of work to be done by one person were not realistic.  One person doing the work and functions of multiple people/job classifications.  Co-workers were great. Hardest part of my job was the amount of clerical work that needed to be done on top of my own position even though we had a clerical person however one clerical person for 8 adjusters was no where near enough.
good,Great co-workers  but more work than employees and also pay was well below average compared to other companies. Also the bonuses were not given to the employees instead they did after work drinks and food.
good,"The environment really depends on which department you are in. I started in Accounts Receivable and the department was very uptight, management has you keep track of everything you do to make sure you don't take more than half an hour of personal time (which includes using the restroom). When I moved to accounting it was much more laid back and allowed you the freedom to learn new skills. I had friends in human resources and marketing that got to go home early all the time, something I rarely experienced. For the most part management was very approachable and willing to help you get where you wanted professionally. Bottom line; it's a good company but raises are horrible and do not keep up with cost of living. The largest raise you can get is 2% and you need to go way above and beyond to get there, I typically got 1-1.5% but I know a lot of people who got less or nothing at all for years."
good,"Has its ups and downs, very political and resistant to change and being proactive.  Upper management does not practice what they preach.  The culture if very dysfunctional."
good,"The position is very fast paced position. The position does have a high turn over in employees. The people are great to work with but if your not young and are able to work fast, this isn't the position for you."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I was lucky enough to work with and get to know."
good,The company could do a better job marketing to the demographic the office in Atlanta currently serves. The employees in the Atlanta office feel slighted and the moral is suffering. Any attempt to better the moral will yield ill treatment to the employee attempting to make the change.
good,"Gather and analyzes rating data assigned by reviewing per guidelines with recommendations to Under Writer."
good,"The amount of claim volume per day is un manageable. You get 10 hours of work but only have 7.5hrs to do it in. "
good,Great place in building personal portfolio for retirement offer low cost health insurance for individuals and families. Offer great wellness program competitive salaries
good,"Birmingham, AL	09/1994 - 02/1996"
good,This company offers great benefits and does a good job of Work/Life balance.  The job culture changes with the management which recently changed in 2016 at times can be overwhelming.
good,"Decent place to work, decent pay, great employees, good benefits, great time off package, set schedule changes every 6 months"
good,"Been with the company for 7 years and have held 5 positions. "
good,"Good company, good products and services. Regular business hours."
good,"Inflexible, all management oriented rather than employee focused. They make changes in policy and procedure and THEN think about the ramifications to employees and customer service."
good,Great place to work if your bar is low...If you are looking for a good job to have straight out of college for the first job experience this company is the perfect place to work.  If you’re looking for something more and you hope to have a growing career this is not going to be the right fit for you.  Extremely limited growth opportunities.
good,With change of CEO Hanover has become more corporate. Company rapidly grew and now there is pressure to meet unrealistic goals. Hard pushing for results.
good,"Hanover has seen a lot of change over the past 3 years.  Some very positive and some negative.  The size and scope of the company both help and hurt the organization.  Under new management, and the direction is unclear."
good,"I loved working for Hanover for the first 6 months. "
good,It is a great place to work if you are either statified with a comfortable job and great job security. But it is not the place to be if you are seeking advancement because most of the hiring is done externally.
good,"In general, a decent place to work.  Really just another claims job.  PTO is nice but pretty standard for the industry.  Pay seems slightly lower than average, be sure to negotiate salary.  Management is good but they have metrics too meet as well, so if your not doing well, you'll know about it.  They say two days work from home after six months, but I see a lot of people only working one day from home.  Not sure if that's by choice or management decision.  Hanover should have designated trainers, but most of the training will be self taught and you will do e learning modules."
good,The claim manager is a great guy. He is easy going but firm and brings out the best in you. The workload is a little higher and the coworkers are the best.
good,Stressful but local management is supportive. Sr management not as much.  Worcester campus is very nice with lots of amenities.  Workload is generally balanced.
good,Processed work from an online task list within the online file system. Monitored other Raters work loads and distributed work as needed to ensure work was processed in a timely manner. Performed qualify reviews on Raters. Trained new Raters. Trained current raters on any system and procedure changes. Doing reviews on others is not a strong point for me I did not like doing that part of the job. Sometimes it got negative. I like to be a worker bee not in a management type position.
good,"Strong training"
good,"Management had the choice to drive performance through talent, process, product (information management), and it chose talent. This means there was  constant churn and burn of people. It felt like it was a consulting company, and that's probably because the CEO was former McKinsey"
good,"""Its insurance"" was always the excuse for how poorly projects were run. Basically, The Hanover is a good job if you live in the area and can tolerate the mediocrity. The bar is low here and executives are very disconnected. I hear you can wear jeans now, so thats a break. The benefits are excellent, however the time off was not great."
good,This job is not what i had been doing for 10 years prior. This was a temporary job until i found a job i would enjoy. I need a job that is a challenge and will drive me to build my knowledge. I already had knowledge of Insurance so learning anything new was not offered to me. The culture is very diverse all walks of life. The hardest part of my job is not always having the tools needed to do the best job possible. The most enjoyable part of my day is the end when i track my work and i see how much i have accomplished.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of handling homeowners claims in the state of Massachusetts as well as being deployed to other states for long periods of time to handle catastrophes."
good,"A good work environment where employees takes good care of their customers. They offer a wide range of insurance options yet they don't create a hype of it. "
good,This is a sales driven environment -  fast pace underwriting with hard to achieve goals given the lack of tools and system challenges.  The most enjoyable part of this job are the co-workers
good,"Good company, focused on top line. Management was fair- not micromanagers. Work/life balance was fair as was compensation."
good,"Not the worst company, your normal office politic stuff. Claims system is out dated. Ability to work remote a few days per week."
good,"Love people I work with"
good,"A Great Company in Worcester, MA, I enjoyed the company and would certainty continue working there."
good,"The pay was adequate, and I enjoyed the social and planned events that the office allowed us to engage in, which made an extremely stressed work environment, a little less stressful.  However, going from working at a big insurance company to a much smaller one, was definitely noticeable when staffing became an issue."
good,"It is an okay place to work.  Work was not very hard to do, but had to be done timely.  Management was okay, but played some favoritism.  Some co-workers were awesome, and some were not as friendly.  I learned how to get jobs done timely and efficiently the best of my ability.  The most enjoyable part was being close friends with the Cafeteria Manager, Chef, and Catering people."
good,"I had the ability to learn and grow while I with this company."
good,Good work environment for those who want flexible hours and have a focus on family
good,I was able to learn a great deal about the insurance industry through hands on margin driven initiatives.
good,It’s a good place to work with ample benefits and flexible work options. My main complaints are that managers are nearly impossible to find since they’re always in meetings and the building needs a cosmetic update - the carpets and cube walls are antiques and full of dust and germs.
good,"I am grateful for the learning opportunities Hanover had to offer me. However the support and growth potential was not there, nor did I feel that compensation was available to continue my career path with them."
good,I enjoyed my time at Hanover it was originally a small company that was acquired by Hanover.  There were changes some good and some not so good.  I enjoyed the staff that worked with in the Accounting Department in Buffalo office.
good,"The Hanover provided a very good working environment overall. Benefits were very good and the company is very supportive of employees volunteer activities in the community, which it encourages with grants issued on a quarterly basis. The campus is immaculate and headquarters building in Worcester includes many amenities that make it a comfortable workplace, including onsite fitness center, wellness clinic, convenience store, ATMs, and large cafeteria. As a large company (No. 514 on the Fortune 1000) it is financially sound; however, also as a large company, it can feel somewhat impersonal. I found it to be a very good place to work, though others may prefer a smaller, more intimate sized company."
good,You are constantly evaluated on ambiguous and obscure opinions. Management makes up reasons to fail a claim file so your already being pushed out the door before you even walk in.
good,"The Hanover Insurance Group is a big enough company that many have heard of it yet small enough where upper management knows your name. It is these little things that makes it an overall nice place to work. With being a smaller company it has the typical smaller company issues(management, workload). They have a really nice campus in MA, which is a nice clean place to work and there are plenty of perks that the local office staff receive. Co-workers are great and typically follow the team motto and will help you in need."
good,It was a very fast paced job. Everything has a time set to the task at hand. A lot of multitasking. Every task was inventoried per day to get a production score on a monthly basis.  I enjoyed my job very much. I like to be very busy. My co- workers were a great group to work with. We were all team players.
good,Hanover is one of the larger companies in the Worcester insurance industry.  It has flexibility and good benefits. I had a few great managers.  Bonuses were nice.
good,"Enjoyed the school certification because I specialized in this area.  my job was eliminated, very unhappy and so were my agents."
good,I knew exactly what was expected of me and enjoyed my time there.  Very different from many other work environments I have experienced.
good,"Learned a great many things about Compliance. "
good,great company to work for as far as work life balance. My main criticism is the lack of diversity in management. Not enough females or people of color. Any color- pretty much non existent.
good,Hanover is a great company with excellent employee benefits.
good,Learned about insurance industry and how to provide good customer service.
good,My typical day was fast paced and mostly managed on my own.  There is a lot going on at all times in this company.  The team that I was a part of is one of the more high profile teams because of the type of business that we handled.  It was nice having that team recognition throughout the company.
good,"Overall Rating is due to the benefits, the salary is decent, and I love my management team."
good,"The office environment is great. However, the company is tight with money. More work for the same pay, they hold their employees to high standards but do not compensate them for the work they put in."
good,"I respect The Hanover Insurance Company as it has been my first experience into the insurance industry.  Now after 15 years and maturing through various roles within the organization I have been able to get a glimpse of how our lack of innovation through technology will come to bite us.  I am the first to step up to the plate and help change that, however management around here wants nothing to do with change.  Decision point leaders have been slow to realize the power and efficiency that technology can offer.  A wait and see approach is the motto and hopefully it is not too late to turn that around.  "
good,"Decent company, workload at current job is insane but is not standard. There is a lot of shake ups going on right now from a management stand point, still would recommend."
good,Trying to act like a big company while staying small and with specific demographics and programs. The upper management is making good decisions but seem more focused on diversity than who is actually qualified.
good,"The need to rethink how they reward the people that put in extra effort and are being told they are wanted by the company, but the company's actions don't always support that. Overall, things moving in the right direction, albeit slowly - and it's still a great place to work."
good,"It was a good job, enjoyed going to work every day Sometimes allowed to work from home. Unfortunately our entire department was outsourced and most of us were laid off permanently."
good,"Worked there more than twenty years ago. I enjoyed working there at that time in my career. Benefits were good, people were good to work with. Left there a long time ago so can't comment present day."
good,"Good benefits, opportunity to move around different departments. Most entry level jobs are in call centers which you burn you out quickly because they are so understaffed."
good,The small marketing group that worked on 1035 exchanges was challenging and fulfilling.  Marketing for financial seminars and business to business insurance less so.
good,"Everyone is very friendly and willing to help whenever you need it. There is a lot of opportunities for development after you have put your time in and a lot of potential departments to move around in, as well."
good,"it was a fantastic place to work and i really enjoyed it. the office was casual and fun. everyone was friendly and i liked working there. parking was easy, they took good care of the offices."
good,Great Environment has been a pleasure working for the company. Company provides great benefits and many opportunites for growth. Very friendly management style.
good,Outgoing CEO had a dynamic personality and really drove people.  Compensation based on results but little life balance.
good,The Hanover Group is a growing property and casualty insurance carrier with offices across the country.  A leading competitive company that treats their employees fairly.
good,I worked in the liability dept and it was great. The manager was very understanding and kind. My co worker were great and we split the work right down the middle. Every now and then they would feed us and reward us for our hard work.Also we got to work from home when the weather was bad. Not a tough job at all. Would work here again for sure.
good,The Hanover Group had outstanding benefits.  Management was great. I only left because I needed to relocate at the time due to family matters.
good,Constantly busy and ever changing environment.  I was never bored! The challenge enabled employees to thrive.
good,Working at the Worcester Club was the pinnacle of my culinary career.
good,"Unfortunately, it was too long ago to give a good review. I worked there from 82 to 86. They shut down the CT Office and moved everything to their corporate headquarters in Massachusetts."
good,I was a stay at home mom and contracted this job on my own. They only needed temp. help to catch up.
good,"Never worked in a call center.  The calls are never ending. Metric seems impossible to meet. However, they offer coaching and after completing training you are allowed to work from home."
good,To succeed you need to be able to multi-task at all times. You need to work consistently from beginning to end of day. There is enough time for breaks and lunch to avoid burnout.
good,"A typical day at work: "
good,"The company is in a transition period that feel uneasy. It's unclear to see how life at the Hanover with change. Currently the company offers very competitive benefits but is know to pay below industry average for salary. However, they are willing to take a chance on someone who may be under qualified if it means paying them less that standard."
good,"There is a really good group of underwriters that work together.  There is a sense that everyone is always willing to help each other out.  Whenever someone is in need everyone will step up to the plate and help each other out.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with agents that can be difficult which can occur in any position.  A typical day at work would include looking at emails/sending emails, quoting accounts, binding accounts, processing endorsements, reviewing claim information, dealing with agents/brokers, and working side by side with other underwriters."
good,"Overall, this is a great company. Leadership doesn't play the rank game and greet all employees with a smile. There can be limited upward mobility in certain departments."
good,I was hired and worked for a terrific claim manager and then was transferred to an adjuster promoted to Supervisor who had zero people skills and who really needed a management course of mentoring.
good,The Hanover Insurance Group is a good company to work for. They offer a substantial amount of PTO and good benefits. Some positions also offer work from home and casual dress code.
good,"Working on improving there system platforms for ease of use when quoting policies. Friendly work environment, good benefits. Helped agents  with correcting  errors on quotes reviewed quotes for eligibility."
good,"Hanover Insurance is a great place to work. There is a great deal of opportunity to advance in your career, plus they pay for your schooling. My manager was extremely knowledgeable and feel fortunate that he agreed to mentor me."
good,"A typical day consisted of checking emails in Lotus Notes, and then logging into the PeopleSoft accounting system as well as the Fasttax accounting system to prepare Federal, State, Sales and Use, Excise tax returns for the states and companies under the Hanover Insurance umbrella."
good,"This was a very good job with excellent benefits. Had to be bonded for dealing with payroll checks and learned all about quarterly mailings, which was when there would be overtime."
good,"No opportunity for advancement outside your area of expertise even though they claim otherwise. They usually go with external candidates. "
good,Laid back and flexible work environment. Allows for time to tend to family needs while allowing to work from home on occasions as long as deadlines are met on time.
good,"After 9/11 and the stock market crash Allmerica was dissolved and became Hanover Insurance which is strictly a Property & Casualty insurance company.  "
good,I was a contractor going into Hanover and was well received by the people there.  I really enjoyed my job and was offered a permanent position there.  They could not meet my salary requirements.
good,"The Hanover allows the workday schedule to be flexible based upon your needs. More recently, Hanover has become more open to working from home which is extremely helpful for those with longer commutes. Work/Life balance is very good."
good,"The company has been fun for the last 10 years. High growth and a very free atmosphere to drive results. Things are being reined in a bit now as they strive to increase profit while continuing trajectory. Expense cuts are likely coming which are casting a shadow on employees right now. Once the reset is over, I think it'll be a great place again, as they are striving to modernizing the workplace and workforce. The people are great. At times the old guard can rear it's head and clamp down on change, but generally it's a positive environment."
good,"great work environment, positive and productive. Upper management was visible and approachable. The hardest part of the job was their rating systems."
good,This company was a relaxed work environment that focused on productivity and efficiency to complete stated goals by management and the training team.
good,"Work days were an average 8 hours.  On the rare occasion I was asked to work additional hours."
good,Reston VA location is Regional Commercial Liability hub and sales office for Healthcare division. Massachusetts is main office.
good,Opportunities for advancement.
good,"First job I had when leaving college .Flexable hours, great staff, small office."
good,"A good company that would take care of their employees, but wish their training was a bit more extensive and would like for fairness within the work place."
good,"Busy every day. "
good,The job and position is wonderful. The management is very poor. I would suggest looking into other positions until changes are made within the department.
good,"Nice working atmosphere, but the pay leaves something to be desired.  The management team is solid, and they are typically flexible with schedule changes that might need to be made here and there.  There have been some overall changes to the company's direction in the past couple of years, and I feel like they have devoted an increasing proportion of their resources to expanding their business, which has therefore lowered their ability to pay their employees more."
good,If you're in the right department you have the opportunity for advancement. I am not in one of those departments.  Still is a good place to work though.
good,"Hanover great place to work. Culture open and inviting. Great benefits, pension, 401K, room for growth, training, continued education benefits, helpful management."
good,Looking for a position where I can utilize my college degrees and analytical skills on a diality basis.  I enjoy working on mulitple projects to improve processes within the company.
good,"As a collective whole, The Hanover truly is a wonderful place to work, with an ambitious executive team and a vibrant atmosphere. I believe that if I were in another position or had more opportunities for career advancement, that I would be more opt to look within the company and not seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Led a team of 7-10 QA testers and managed the QA operations for assigned projects within the property/casualty, BOP and personal (auto, home and boat) insurance lines"
good,"The Hanover is a very local Central Mass company with the vast majority of employees living and working within 25 miles of the office. It has had outstanding leadership over the last 17 years . "
good,"It's been almost 10 years since I was downsized out of Hanover Insurance so I don't know the current climate.  At the time that I was let go, the lay offs had been a yearly process for 9 years straight."
good,"The employee's at the Hanover are experienced employees."

good,"Hanover is an excellent company to work for. Perhaps one of the best assets to working for the organization is the excellent atmosphere and revolving open door policy. I began working with Hanover as an Auto Adjuster with no experience. Since then, my management team has helped me grow as an adjuster and a professional insurance associate. After three years working with the organization, I've been promoted twice and now assist new employees with training and development. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of the organization...it's claims. People are typically upset, and angry. Providing insurdes/claimants with excellent customer service in times of hardship is the number one aspect of our jobs. Having a cohesive group of employees who have the,"" we are all in this together attitude"" helps everyone come together and do whatever it takes to get the job done quickly and successfully."

good,"Great Company with substantial benefits and growth opportunities. Must be driven and obtain a license within 45-60 days of employment (or three test maximum) to keep employment. Awesome employee staff and superb commercial lines management for SA's, Matt Monahan in the Worcester headquarter location.  Wonderful and energetic work place.

good,"My responsibilities in this role include marketing campaign assessments, developing online tools for capturing key customer data, creating market size & share analytical tools, and training new analysts. It is a heavily analytical role that I enjoy as it provides a good opportunity to learn both marketing analysts techniques and the industry."

Loved working there, but moved on after 5 years. Benefits were wonderful as well."

good,"Allows a healthy work/life balance"
good,Pretty relaxed and they have programs for you to advance your career. Management is nice and will work with you to achieve goals. As far as carriers go there are probably few that are better to work for then Hanover. The negatives are the office is a standard cubicle environment (think office space) and no free coffee..
good,Hanover Insurance over the past 7 to 8 years offered great work experience and challenges and many opportunities and headed in right direction with system upgrades.

good,"The atmosphere was great at Hanover.  There is a lot of support to help further develop your knowledge and advancement is encouraged depending on what you want to do.  The co-workers are friendly.  The only drawback is some of the management is still stuck in old ways of supervising where ""perception is reality.""  This led to conversations where the supervisors assumed one thing that was not true at all."
good,You always have work to do (which makes the day go by quick) but can be very stressful at times. Management is great but workload is crazy at times.  Currently understaffed to match workflow.
good,"Hanover has a great environment with more diversity than I have seen in any previous company that I have worked for. They offer great benefits to include paid time off and they encourage flexible work arrangements, which is a huge plus. Job security and advancement opportunities depend on the line of business, but they're there for the most part. Management is okay, it seems as if many struggle with change and accepting the new work mindset and lifestyle of millennial and Gen Z. Overall Hanover has a great culture and I'm more than happy to work for them. I would recommend to a friend or family member."
good,Great place to work. Great atmosphere and all were willing to help. Open door policy with management. Collaborative team environment. Easy to maintain a work-life balance. Hardest part of the job was managing high volume workload.

good,"I came on and was pushed to pass my exam within two weeks, at that point my group looked at our offer letters and saw we had 45 days which almost seemed to surprise management. In my interview I was told we would rake a week long licensing class, which actually was us reading in a hot room for a week. Then taking a class that regurgitated the book at you. The systems are so outdated, and were always crashing. You could get calls and not even be logged in to your system, and still have to take them. I felt there was a huge disconnect between the upper management's idea of how the CSC should be run and how that was implemented."
good,An excellent place to work especially when first graduating from college. The work is self motivated and challenging. I have been working for this company for the past 2 and a half years and have enjoyed learning and developing. I would love to relocate my position if it were available in the state of Georgia.

Responsible for filing arbitrations, small claims litigation and maintaining a high level of productivity, confidentiality and customer service."
good,The company culture is great but the Salem office does not always seem to reflect the company culture as a whole.  I learned a lot about corporate politics and that management often has a double sided tongue.  The people are the most enjoyable part of the job but oftentimes they are also the hardest part of the job.

I was involved in the Servicing Carrier (TPA) portion of Hanover's contract with the State of NJ Assigned Auto Market experiment called the JUA. From 1984 until @ 1992, Hanover grew from @ 100 to over 1800 employees. This created challenges and opportunities. Many, including myself, thrived in this growth market. In the years I was there, I was consistently recognized and promoted.
