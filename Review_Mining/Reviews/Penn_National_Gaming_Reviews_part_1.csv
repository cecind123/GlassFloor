bad,This company and atomspher is fine for some but not all.  I will not tell you it's a bad or good company everyone has there own opinions and there own experience.
bad,"They lie to you right at the door. You will be sexually harassed and will go to HR, the union. By the time everything seem to be handled. Your tried of the everything and leave but they will not take you back but will keep the person who has done all of this on camera. If your into that type of stuff this is the place to be"
bad,"This place is the epitome of what should be used in an HR training video as to what SHOULD NOT be allowed in the workplace.  "
bad,Pay is horrible with no increase. Very little advancement opportunities. Management acts like they care and then keeps you from advancing. Worked there for 4 years never got any chance to move up.
bad,Worst management I've ever seen in my life. They cared very little about their employees and after working there for years I was still never given the opportunity to advance.
bad,"Penn is a bad company to work for. Working for their Jamul Casino was a nightmare! Upper management and management for the security department are lousy! No communication between management and officers. They do not back up their employees. They like to play god. Their attitude behind closed doors towards the tribal members was astounding! The suits wouldn't have those cushy jobs if not for the tribe."
bad,"They promised training for my job, I received none. Management are the only people that get to go to any sort of training and when they return they tell you nothing except stories about partying with other managers. Other departments get to work from home, but my department isn't one of them. Not enough work to do, the day is extremely boring. Management takes holidays off, but other employees are not allowed to. The only thing management is worried about is making sure they receive their next bonus. No chance for advancement here. I kick myself everyday for leaving a good job and coming to work with these liars. The Back Of House is disgusting and filthy. No way you want to eat here!"
bad,I choose to leave due to negative environment.  Those that do the hiring will lie to your face to suck you in and then at every turn the powers that be will try to beat you down to be a mindless drone.  If you can think for yourself or have a personality you will not fit in at Penn National.  There are clear double standards and favoritism that runs rampant at my former property.  Management will do nothing to stop bad behavior because they are bad leaders.  Those that are in a management role do not deserve to hold any leadership role.  Run as far and fast from these people as possible.
bad,"Management is not experienced.  Quite honestly, the parent company, Penn National Gaming, has approximately 30 casinos and runs Hollywood Columbus as if it were their first."
bad,My dept is highly competitive and your stuck in a cold dark room with basically a bunch of adults acting like high schoolers. The manager is ok but he is basically powerless and can't do anything to improve conditions or the staff or pay. It is non union and therefore we are the ONLY dept who doesn't get holiday pay!!!! Which is total and conplete bull! The fact the casino cannot run without us and we get screwed this way is beyond me. Penn also loves to promote the WORST people. They will go after & fire all the hardest workers they possibly can while every single snake in the grass gets promotions and recognitions. Its unbelievable! All the lying backstabbers are in control while good prople suffer. You cannot imagine how terrible it is to have to watch. This conpany is horiffic like so many today are. Beware of what your signing up for!
bad,"The opinion is mine only. It is up each person to make their own opinion."
bad,"Penn National shows little to no respect or support for their employees. Management is a collection of individuals who are looking out solely for their own job security, and they constantly cut services and reduce resources while asking their employees to bear the grunt of the negative feedback from their customers and guests."
bad,Poor Management. Under-educated management. Hard workers are worked harder to cover for the poor workers. Day shift vs Night sift issues are a daily occurrence.
bad,Over-worked and Under-paid. Easily the worst management experience I have ever dealt with. Unable to grasp simple concepts to keep their employees even remotely happy due to uncompromising arrogance.
bad,"No direct information is given to employees regarding pay"
bad,"*Upper management is overpaid and doesn't reward hard word, unless you are friends with them"
bad,"Low pay, hard work!! Benefits are pretty good with medical. The point system is a little demeaning but it is what it is. High expectations on quantity of work."
bad,Hourly employees are poorly treated and the management team focuses on destroying their employees self esteem. Favortism runs rampant at the property and business ethics do not exist.
bad,The company lacks structure   there is really no oversite in how the company is run . Every property does what it wants and creates an inconsistent exoerience as you move through properties . Their main focus is profit only as there are no perks for the employees or managers . You get a lot of lip service from the executive committee but no action. To back it up .I found at this property the executive team all had different agendas and all back stabbed each other which flowed down to the team.  They put no real effort In going above and beyond in recruiting and reflects on how short staffed the property is .not a good place to work or a good company culture .
bad,Did not like the Casino at Hollywood gaming it was ran like a circus. I came in on the ground floor and the manager was not ready for the project at all.
bad,"work alone for a two-man job for a year and lied to about who they were going to hire."
bad,"After 2 buyouts, things have gotten pretty bad. It has been a steady decline over the past 10 years ever since the founder of Ameristar died. Can't recommend."
bad,People are not treated fairly and justly.
bad,"Fun atmosphere, generally a caring family of employees. Hours are very long and often unappreciated. Senior management turns over every couple of years which makes it difficult to have a solid vision. Very little flexibility and gaming restrictions make it difficult to stay employed more than a couple of years. Typical casino hierarchy. You will learn a ton but you will give up your family and freedom to get that knowledge. Senior management are pack wolves--they protect and follow each other from one casino to another. Employees are the ones who suffer from this. If you are trying to learn, this would be a good option. If you are seasoned, skip and move to another opportunity. Corporate Penn doesn't have a clue what really goes on at this casino."
bad,They work you so hard with little pay.Management stands around and watches you work.Even if you need help they are to busy talking to security.They donâ€™t care about employees
bad,"As a surveillance agent working for Penn National gaming you be tasked with protecting company assets while monitoring cameras and staying in direct contact with the security team, table games supervisors, and other  departments located on site. You will review table games play, incidents on the floor, and routine tasks involving money on the floor to ensure employees and patrons are in compliance with company policies as well as state and federal law. On occasion you will be required to save footage for the company or an outside law enforcement agency.  Overall the job itself is enjoyable but that's where my satisfaction with being a surveillance agent at HC in Charles Town WV began and ended. "
bad,Made 20$ off a 8hour night. Tips suck sometimes but that comes with being a beverage server. If youre willing to stick with the bad days for better than this is the job for you.
bad,Working at this company is sometimes difficult; however it's a good company to work for.  This company needs to take a look at some of the supervisors and managers that are hired.  They also need to learn to work as a team.
bad,I work right next to my staff. I managed locations that have 3 shifts 6 days week operations
bad,"You work 12 hour shifts on your feet, with 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute break to sit down. You are required to walk your assigned area (which could be quite large) every 10 minutes. You are not allow to talk to co workers on the floor. If seen talking to them you will be reprimanded. The eyes in the sky are more concerned with you doing your job than watching out for criminal activity. You must pass an extensive background check through the state to gain employment. This is something You are required to pay for. $400. They take so much per pay out of your check. You have a union, that was brought in by Penn National. It is clear that they have Penn National's interests above yours, yet you must pay $200 entrance fee and $13 per pay to them, which is also subtracted from your check. You are told that you will make very good tips at this job, from high rollers who hit jackpots. These tips are placed in a box and split between every slot ambassador who works that day, whether or not they had anything to do with the transaction. You may make $100 one day and $3 the next. It depends on how heavily they have staffed the day. So it doesn't matter whether these extra people are needed, you must split your tips with them."
bad,You get your assigned table you go though the opening procedure then you have to shuffle 8 decks of cards then go ahead and play 8 hours of blackjack or whatever you was assigned with a break after 1:20 mins..Coworkers were great..Hardest part was standing on your feet the most enjoyable part was the people
good,"Forced to subsidize for lack of management.  Will have to work more hours and take pay cut as asst. management before being able to acquire full time dealing position.  Room is efficient, but micromanaged to the point that there is no fun in it anymore...and this is a poker game!"
good,"My job was basically an easy job. And the trend with these types of easy jobs,is the people you are forced to work with,make it very difficult. Warehouse was your typical set up of stocking items from pallets to freezers/coolers. Rotation of stock. Filling req's/orders in a timely fashion,on one side of the dock,and data entry/computer skills on the other. With the delivery of mail and packages to various departments. I got certified for being able to operate an electric pallet jack! (whoo-hoo). The workplace culture as a whole was ""Okay"". With the EXCEPTION to one individual was a definite a ""problem child"" from the get go. This person would constantly be complaining about everyone else,had a bad attitude,thought they were better and a basic mr. know it all type of nasty,caustic,overly sarcastic attitude.. Obviously H.R,my co-workers,other departments as well as the outside people knew this. And nothing was done. Sad when this happens because you loose so many good potential workers. The most enjoyable part of the job were the many other good people in/outside my department I liked working with. The hardest part was reaching the end of my rope and leaving."
good,"Working at Hollywood Casino can be quite stressful, if you want to have a good work/life balance, this is probably not the job for you. It takes a special type of person to work in that atmosphere and to handle the rude and unruly guests that come in there."
good,"Everyone is very nice, cooperative and accommodating. Unfortunately, there is a lack of skill set throughout the company. The corporate departments are located in a small Pennsylvania town and most corporate employees are under qualified. The policies, procedures and new programs being implemented don't reflect industry best practices."
good,If you need to get by its ok. Liked most of my co-workers and my bosses. They really should pay more considering the amount of responsibility you have and Money you handle on a daily basis.
good,10hr days and 5-7 day weks were part of the normal schedule. Some weeks we would work anywhere from 60-80hr weeks. I gaoined more of an understanding on how the management side of a business interacts with employees. The hardest part of the job was the instability of rule application at the facility as well as the extremely long days.
good,"Penn is growing, so there may be opportunities available.  It is a fast-paced environment that can support growth opportunities.  Most of the people are tremendous to work with."
good,I really enjoy the different types of people that I meet on a daily basis. Most of them are very friendly when I greet them with a simile and welcome them to the casino and wish them good luck and also give them a great farewell when they are leaving.
good,"id rather not say"
good,"im a kind of worker that is very dedicated to my work, once i started i intend to finish it with pride and dedication to my co-workers and supervisors, best of all to the co. that im working wth. unfortunately management are not treating us fearly, they seems to practice still a silent prejodicesm. towards non- american workers especially from asia.     very sad.     iam a very hardworker, and i take pride of my works. further more iam a very reliabe worker."
good,Never a dull moment.  Always something going on and most days with new faces.  On site cafeteria.  Lots of customer interaction on the games and off.  Specialize in constant change.  Management usually available to discuss any issues and provide direction when needed.
good,"First off it all depends on which property you choose to work for, but each property has their good moments and their bad moments.  Its a roller coaster based on the upper management.  It seems that no matter what property you are at - the managemet rotates in and out and that changes the time you are in.  Each manager/ director/ GM comes in with a different perspective and ultimatly changes the mood of the property.  Love the good times - fear the bad times."
good,Good company to work for with growing opportunities across the country.
good,"On a typical day I was required to clean seven ice wells on the salad bar in the Epic Buffet during the graveyard shift. That included chipping the ice in the wells, taking a bucket and dumping the ice into two 55 gallon trash cans and rolling them to the kitchen. After that I would wipe down the counter tops, cabinets, glass, and floors. I learned that you can clean anything as long as you have HOT water. My supervisor was ok but could have been better at communicating with his employees. The hardest part of the job is chipping the ice from the wells. The enjoyable part of the job is I could take my time and complete the task and I LOVED my shift."
good,". Assist customers with gaming equipment, cash jackpots, promotions and sales, troubleshoot and identify mechanics of machines, . Hardest part of the job are the always changing and night hours. Management is open door policy, Co workers are a team spirit. Most enjoyable part of the job is when someone wins a big pot. LOVE IT!"
good,"The pay and vacation is great considering the cost of living. However, you will make more money in Las Vegas after you gain enough experience. The standards in all areas are a lot higher than Las Vegas but the higher standards will help you excel in Las Vegas."
good,"No matter how 'anonymous' a review may be, it still bears the mark of the individual that wrote it. This places former employees in the precarious position of detailing publicly the potentially dirty laundry of those whose recommendation can determine the former employee's future."
good,"Easy to get fired, even for mistakes (partially due to state/federal law liability). Pay was ok and benefits weren't bad. Lots of paid time off. Lots of employee appreciation stuff. Company culture isn't bad if you enjoy the hospitality industry. Your enjoyment of the job will heavily depend on what department you work for. Management is hit or miss."
good,The culture of the workplace was pretty upbeat and the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to put a smile on customers faces. I learned a lot about how to keep your customers happy and just how to provide the best service I can.
good,This specific location was terrible upper management wise.  The immediate supervisors were the only ones that had real knowledge of the needs of the associates the upper mismanagement could have cared less
good,Growing company with vast opportunity for growth.  PNG also recruited decent talent from other gaming companies; however the company is still in its infancy compared to other gaming well-established companies.
good,"Penn National Gaming seems to be a prestigious company at the senior level. However, at smaller branches, for first-line workers, it is less than. The branch I work for, Hollywood Casino Gulf Coast has had issues with management for the better part of this current decade. The management here would rather see the company maintain their current evaporating clientele, than reach out to market to a wider customer-base. This has led to cutbacks for the employees and less than satisfied guests. The casino has an exciting past, but recent events have left it in shambles."
good,"I loved the department I worked in and the coworkers that I worked with, but management was often questionable. We were often understaffed for important events such as concert nights when we would be most busy and that was due to scheduling errors on our supervisors part. They were getting better towards the end of my employment trying to balance the staff that we had. I commend that they really make their employees a priority and have appreciation events every month as well as excellent above minimum wage for staff and drawings as well."
good,Thankful for the opportunity to learn and grow in the Human Resources Department.
good,"The Slot Department Team was an excellent group to work with."
good,Great experiences while working here. great employees to work with. great benefits and salary package. If your looking for a fun job this is it.
good,Depending on which property you are at the experience will be extremely different.  There are a lot of politics involved if you want to move up the corporate ladder.
good,"Each day I file state taxes on the Ohio Business Gateway; check bank balances, determine cash status, work with accounts payable and various department heads.  I manage 3 staff accountants and approve all manual g/l entries.  I also review their balance sheet reconciliations to make sure we are following both company policy and compliance as well as Ohio Casino Control Commission policy and SOX compliance."
good,The company is a good place for someone young who is just looking for experience in security especially in learning how to deal with people and stressful situations.
good,"You will do a lot of things you do not condone as far as a security role. Only people who take their job way too seriously and aspire to be the police who will give you a hard time is ideal for this role."
good,"I loved working there and the people I worked with but we were paid the least out of all the departments.  Had to work mostly weekends and holidays and that got old.  If they would pay more it would have been worth staying.  Also, the management team were pretty good to us and flexible."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of performing various monetary transactions, balancing cashier windows, monitoring & maintaining ATM machines, and providing temporary banks to all departments of the casino."
good,A typical day open venue prepare work areas for the day. Make sure all scheduled employyes are present. Close venue. workplace culture fun & friendly opportunistic.
good,"I enjoyed working there because of the other employees... very friendly and sociable. It was close to my home, so that was a big plus. The company took a chance on me as a graphic designer, because I was right out of school. And although I am very appreciative for that, their pay scale for my position was very low."
good,Good Company overall corporate structure is not the same a local property level.
good,Had to get a gaming license which the company paid for. Extensive background check. Lots of OT (too much)- short notice mandate for 4 hours of OT any given day to come in early next day or stay late on current day.
good,"I was responsible for either opening or closing the gift shop. I would get a bank from the cage cashiers on the boat. I would perform transactions with patrons. I was required to talk a ""Red Carpet"" class every year to enhance my customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers when I was working alone. The best part of the job was the lasting friendship between my coworkers and the overall atmosphere of the night-life."
good,"During my time working for PNG, Hollywood Casino Toledo, I learned a lot about cooking from the chefs I worked with. They do many different activities, some that also involve the family of the employees that work there. Coworkers were really great to work with there. Ended up leaving due to not being able to use PTO, and some other problems. They offer healthcare, dental, vision, 401k."
good,"Was a very fun job, was kinda like working at an airport..  Got to meet lots of different people from all walks of life. Really enjoyed working there for the time I did."
good,"The employee website does not work when needed. As a current employee, I find looking for other openings within the company on the website could be much easier to navigate. (The job postings in HR aren't always up to date.)"
good,"This was a great job for what I needed at the time. Management was very flexible and the culture was generally very positive."
good,"Fun working at a casino!  I enjoy celebrating wins with the players.  I do not like taking player's money, I like giving away money.  I tell players that the casino only pays us $5.00 per hour, so I want to be able to payout as much of their money as I can."
good,As the Advertising and Events Specialist at Hollywood Casino Columbus I would overall rate employment here as four stars. Hollywood Casino Columbus has a great team and offers a fast pace environment.
good,"Typical shift begins with a brief, then eight hours of patrol.  Some nights an officer will be on a stationary door position and others an officer may roam around conducting security checks and escorts.  The management staff and fellow officers are all good people and make the shifts run smoothly.  The most difficult section of the job job could be described as standing for eight hours at a door post when the average guest count is as low as 8-12 guests per hour.  As th job was very uneventful, the closeness of the officers makes the shift bearable.  My main reason for leaving was the lack of advancement and the too low of pay for my needs."
good,"Hours were irregular but dictated by customer need.  It was a long "
good,Hollywood Casino Toledo strives to take care of their team members on a daily basis.
good,It is a good to work at. My Co-workers are all very friendly. The supervisors are helpful. our customers are friendly. working here I have learned to have better customer service.
good,"If you are looking for a place to start out dealing, Hollywood is the place to go. They hire frequently and train and license anyone that can pass a background check."
good,"I learned a lot about wagering"
good,"The environment in a casino is high energy and fast paced.  The team that works at the Hollywood Casino are very friendly.  The compensation is fair, for the most part.  The pay scale for a couple of departments is lacking."
good,"honestly it could be worse. their understaffed, most of management don't communicate with each other, and bad employees slip in all the time. but if you don't let that get to you, one can progress in the company in many different ways."
good,"Working for a casino is something nobody can mentally prepare you for. Its a 24/7 operation and working holiday's and weekends. I've learned how to handle guests in a high stressed environment, providing answers to questions about offers and events. Also to be flexible with scheduling as you may be required to work early hours in the morning to later hours in the evening."
good,"Penn National Gaming has great core values they try to instill in employees. They offer great benefits such as insurance, dental, and PTO."
good,"Policy Compliance officer, red carpet customer service; reports, schedules, continuing education."
good,"I have learned a good amount of corporate knowledge working at the Hollywood Casino. They give managers a large amount of responsibility, which is good for growth, but a lot of hours come with that responsibility. Managers have a lot of flexibility, but it takes a long time to get this done because of all the checks and balances that come with every decision. Big or small."
good,Penn National is a great corporation to work for.  Even working in smaller areas we get access to awesome benefits due to the total number of employees.  Make sure that you are willing to work hard and you will be rewarded.
good,"i work  very hard, but i just don't feel like the employees get the credit they deserve. a typical day would be busy cause i work in the buffet area. i have learned prep and dishwasher skills. i feel management isn't fair. its is a lot of different cultures in the workplace. the hardest part is to know that all of your hard work may not pay off. the most enjoyable are the employees."
good,"I enjoyed my job and met many interesting people. It was a fun place to work, and provided many opportunities to learn new skills. I was also able to complete a degree using the tuition assistance offered by the company."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. They rewarded for good preformance, and the pay was excellent w/tips. People were friendly and management had your back."
good,"If you have a conscience, dealing in a casino can feel wrong most days. The shift work, customers, lack of time off (no holidays or weekends), and mental math can lead to burn out."
good,"Work was rewarding, the challenge was the location. Hobbs is in the middle of nowhere. Work life balance is tough as to the fact there is almost nothing to do in that area."
good,"The people are nice and helpful. Most jobs require standing or walking for 6 hours per day on average. Some positions receive good tips too. "
good,"I really liked my coworkers and my managers. I would have stayed if full-time work was an option. I didn't get any benefits so had to look elsewhere, but it was a fun place to make a little money while I was searching. Each department is different, but mine was laid-back and had a fun team. I would come back if there are any openings that can work with my schedule now that I am working full-time somewhere else."
good,"While working at Penn has been an overall good experience, there is not much room for advancement or promotions within the IT group.  The overall work environment and culture is fine and the work experience is enjoyable.  The best part of the job is working with very talented people and on interesting projects.  The hardest part of the job is knowing that there is not much room for advancement."
good,"Offer great benefits for the employees, culture of the company is to ensure employees are working in a positive environment. There is room to grow with the company. Plenty of hours available."
good,This was by far my favorite job. The environment was good and the people were usually friendly. the job itself was quite easy it just took a watchful eye. Unless you were on the gaming floor your time consisted of standing in one spot and saying hello and goodbye to guests.
good,"The Casino Industry can be very exciting. Lights, bells, whistles, flashy promotions, and the occasional celebrity. It comes at a price as the hours and schedule can be difficult. Very few positions have M-F 9-5 schedules. If you can adapt to this the industry offers a lot of opportunity. "
good,Good place to work. People help one another. Supervisors really care about the employees and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and appreciated.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Penn National, even though it was fairly short lived.  Resources were plentiful and management really knew their stuff.  It was a great experience overall."
good,It was a great place to work. The people you work with keeps things very loose and very enjoyable. The best part is getting to serve your loyal customers on a weekly basis.
good,Nice place to work.......coworkers were great. I learned how to pay out jackpots to customers....how to relate to different people...management great.
good,"Clock in, go to assigned table,open table if needed, be happy and courteous to customers and co-workers. Made the day as productive as possible."
good,"This company is solely about customer service. So much that you sometimes believe that they are more concerned with the customer rather than the welfare of the employee. Not a terrible place to work, but needs to remember that everyone has a bad day sometimes."
good,great work environment loved the people i worked with really felt like a family away from family.loved getting to me meet new people from across the country and the world. overall one of the greatest places ive ever gotten to work for
good,Penn National offers great benefits and competitive salary. There is room for advancement. Management team is easy to work with and has a great understanding of everyday challenges.
good,"Penn National Gaming is a great company to work for.  They had great potential for advancement,  They had  a great management staff.  It was seriously the best company I have ever worked for"
good,"An old time track surviving through the years. Actually the business is growing enough to look at expanding. Solid MGT team that has been in the business for lifetimes. HR is very strict on policies/procedures. Great food and drink specials that offer a good time even for people who don't have a lot to spend.  VIP room is a great location for ""high rollers"" to enjoy a quiet meal while watching the races."
good,"When I started it was Pinnacle Entertainment. Penn National took over. The people are great to work with and it's the casino business so it's an exciting work environment. I did get promoted rather quickly. Benefits are great! The only problem with Penn National is that they cut back on everything, for example, Pinnacle used to have free hot meals for employees. Not Penn. It is fast paced but fun. So if you are interested in the casino business, Penn National is not the worst to work for, considering some of the other stories I used to hear about the other gaming companies."
good,"A typical day at work as an employee for Penn National Gaming would include running the card tables in the poker room by encouraging game play, facilitating multiple transactions oftentimes involving large amounts of currency, while executing and adhering to ""fair play"" gaming policies according to casino regulations."
good,"It was a fun experience, I enjoyed working for my short stint there and I would always recommend anyway that needed a job I would consider working for this company."
good,"Penn National Gaming is a great, and up and coming company. They recently acquired Pinnacle and have been implementing some of Pinnacle's best practices."
good,"At Hollywood, my day consist of working with the marketing department making sure that the customers get the best experience when they come into the casino. Since I have started working I have learned how to present myself in a professional manner at all times, learning how to deal with customers who may have some complaints and being able to solve the issue fast and in the best way possible.  My managers are very concerned with how things go. They are always around and asking how we are doing and what they can do to make our job easier. My co-workers are very self motivated and responsible. They are amazing to work with. The hardest part about my job is when a guest is not happy with the casino and there is nothing I can do to fix it. The most enjoyable part is when we are giving away prizes, such as cars or money, and people are so excited when they win. The expression on their face is amazing!"
good,friendly team members
good,Penn has a lot to offer. they have companies allover the United states. I would like to see them open a Casino in Arkansas one day. I have learned a lot from them.
good,"Great place to work for . People who work hard get promoted, great co-workers !!! No work life balance. High pay. Gym onsite, other than work picnic, there is no family oriented atmosphere... Quarterly bonus if customer service goals were met !"
good,"Love this company. It is a great place to work my department has very little room for advancement. The culture is not as upbeat as I prefer and there seems to be a glut of people there that no one likes but they are not getting rid of, a little frustrating."
good,"Worked here as an intern through college and they really try to promote from within and take care of their own, they moved to property and was no longer an option for me"
good,"i enjoyed my time with the company. I was happy until my hours were cut, and that only made me what to better myself . I have a degree in criminal justice and it is time to start a career."
good,"Exciting place of work. The Casino is a different type of place. The hours can be never ending. The money is great. But, the job can certainly be overwhelming and stressful. People expect alot of out you."
good,"Work culture is good, Being a start up i learned other things than my role. Being aws developer my role was not limited to few tasks. It was good and hard to do the task."
good,"Excellent customer service oriented, Promotes within. Provides excellent support of staff. Salary based on experience. Excellent medical benefits and retirement.Earn 3 weeks of paid time off the first year."
good,"Penn National Gaming seeks to address every aspect that an employer should.  It's just that it is a difficult job, dealing with people who are losing money, but trying to have a fun time doing so.  It's almost impossible unless the client is filthy rich."
good,"need to change, being working so long with horses  and now i decided to move on ,  i need better benefits and a more confortable place to work .i hope i get hire in this position"
good,"Penn National is a great company to work for! They strive to promote from within, have a 3% 401k match and management listens to their employees and works to make everyone happy."
good,"Penn Gaming was a solid company to work for. They had a strong balance between property self-management and the need for corporate oversight."
good,This is a good place to work. Everyone is more like a family then co workers. They treat everyone fairly across the board. Always a chance to change it up if you want.
good,My experience at Penn has been positive from the beginning.  I enjoy working with my management team and co-workers alike.
good,It is a very friendly environment. The worker are very helpful especially when you are asking them questions. There are always opportunities to advance your career in the company
good,"I worked at HCPN since December 2012. I started as a server in Mountainview, and advanced to a food runner and finally to a server. It is a part-time, weekend job, so it fitted perfectly with my school schedule while college was in session. "
good,"Dealing in a casino is a great job.  You get to play a game, make a good wage, and meet new people every single day.  Hollywood Casino and Raceway belives in emplyee appreciation and being a good neighbor.  I recommend working there."
