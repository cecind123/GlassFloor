bad,"Horrible to the enth degree. This place was traumutizing with little to no help from corporate. They let this company run amok. Hopefully, Discovery will shape her up."
bad,"there are 100 other places to work. "
bad,"The board allowed political ""leadership"" or better said, ""political people to hold LEADERSHIP positions"" that had far more concern for themselves than the company. My experience was disappointing..."
bad,"Processing and sorting and delivering mail and printer,fax and copier maintenance."
bad,"There are no career advancement opportunities.  None.  The company will pay for you to further your education, and get certifications and additional skills and you can work your tail off - but you will get more responsibility and never a promotion."
good,"I have learned about digital asset management."
good,"A typical day at work consist of waking up at 3 in the morning, and arriving at the station at 4 am. At this point, sometimes we have breaking news, sometimes there are the normal newscasts and interviews. We have to constantly be on our toes just in case. "
good,Generally good work environment.  Some dis-function in top management due to lack of management experience and poor planning skills.
good,"Administrative Assistant provided support to Executive Vice-President of Research and the Brand Research team. Later promoted to Research Coordinator and executed importing schedules, forecasted and reconciled budgets, served as the contract administrator, and assisted director on consumer insight projects for Home and Garden Television, Do-It-Yourself Network, Great American County, Food Network, and Travel Channel."
good,"I enjoy working at Scripps Networks International. "
good,"A Scripps atua num área interessante de mídia, bastante dinâmica e ativa."
good,"A great company with a great brand, Scripps sets the standard for integrity and employee satisfaction. Responsive sales team and good management, good work life balance"
good,Leadership and management style - keeping all members informed as they work collaboratively on a goal to succeed.
good,"The culture is great, but people love working here so much that there is no room for growth.  A typical day is responding to emails for client needs.  I have learned how to put together a media plan to satisfy our clients.  The hardest part of the job is knowing that it's a support role.  The part I enjoy is the content."
good,"A typical day includes 2 meetings (google hangout) with off-shore teams.  Most of my work was done in C# until a year ago when it was decided that there would be no more .NET development. Migrated over to Java originally implementing TIBCO and mule but moving to JBOSS."
good,Very strong sales organization to be part of. Great place to learn more about sales and the industry.  Hard to move up in the company as many (especially upper level) employees do not leave.
good,"Decent amount of politics and red tape that is expected at most companies.  Great brands to support and get behind.  could do more to help support growth for middle management, but sure that's the same as most large companies."
good,Great company benefits and very good work/life balance. 401k package combined with employee stock purchase program are good options.
good,This is great company with wonderful brands. People are very nice and like to succeed.
good,Great location - Chelsea Market NYC. 9-6PM hours spent with dynamic people.
good,"At Scripps, I was exposed to the inner workings of the media industry, i.e. Food Network, HGTV, DiY, Cooking.com, Travel Channel, GAC). The company culture there is conducive to a happy work day and professional growth."
good,"I interned at Food Network in Summer 2011 in the consumer marketing department. While it was only a summer internship, I learned so much about the food industry and marketing in general and everything that goes into promoting a brand and product and the campaigns and strategic planning that goes along with it."
good,Days are always busy and there's always something to be done. The people that work in my department are wonderful and a pleasure to work with/for.
good,"Recently bought by Discovery, Food Network is a cable channel. Room for advancement, nice people, bonuses in good years. Good benefits including health benefits"
good,"Pretty fair with pay, hard to advance to new job titles. Everyone who works there is amazing haven't met one bad person at the Food Network yet! I just wish there was more work to go around."
good,Not applicable. I do not wish to disclose a review. I currently work here and would prefer not to share. Scripps is a fantastic company with a great culture.
good,"Because the diversity of the broadcast networks that SNI puts on the air, the challenges were constantly changing. You rarely ran into the same situation twice in a row."
good,Scripps was great before discovery bought them. discovery changed the culture and not in a good way. Scripps was very structured and that no longer exists.
good,"Great company but the senior folks never leave so you have no opportunity to move up in your department. New jobs aren't added very often, even if they are greatly needed."
good,"Powerful lifestyle brands that have protected the traditional Ad Sales business.  Well run company, cares about its employees."
good,"When I started working at Scripps, it was a medium sized company (less than 1000 employees) and had built a very nice culture that included a great work/life balance.   As the company grew, it started to experience issues that are not uncommon with small companies that are trying to become larger and compete with their larger competitors.    Some levels of management that were promoted from within did not, and in my opinion still do not, have the basic management skills needed for the positions that they are in.   The company is also split in multiple sectors that do not appear to work well together.  There is also the appearance of both a 'good ole boy' and a 'good ole girl' network within some of the sectors.  This is not good for the overall success of the company."
good,I love the work life balance here. I not often stressed and I enjoy what I do. They management style is very laid back however everyone gets their work done. For the most part a good place to work. If you want to move up the latter that's hard because everyone stays in their positions forever so its hard to do so.
good,"I love most of the people that I work with, but often find myself bored and with currently not much room for advancement.  Overall the company is good, but not great."
good,"I enjoyed the programming that was produced and being able to be a part of it, even from Accounting point of view.  The difficulties came in the transition period and some workplace culture changes."
good,"Scripps Networks was a wonderful place to work even though they were not the best at promoting from within."
good,"The best part about the internship was getting paid $800 per work and living in New York City, beside that the internship program was dull, I had to constantly beg for an assignment on a daily."
good,"- Love my boss"
good,Great working culture.Everyone is nice and easy to connect with. You can get very comfortable at this Network. The work/life balance is good.
good,"There are a lot of learning opportunities at Food Network. With a growing number of viewers and brand extensions, there are constantly new initiatives that will allow employees to utilize their skills at all levels."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the content we produce.  I find myself surrounded by like-minded people who inspire me.  Health benefits and vacation time are very good.
good,Scripps is an excellent company with top of the line products in the industry.   Scripps was just acquired by Discovery Communications and the merger is estimated to be complete by mid March.  I enjoy selling the products but I believe that the competitive atmosphere between departments can (at times) be counterproductive to the sales process.  I think that the upper management is excellent at Scripps and the people running the company are very smart.
good,I had fantastic co-workers and managers at Scripps Networks Interactive.  It was a challenging and fast-paced environment.
good,"I have worked for Food Network for over 10 years.  The job is demanding, fast paced and very detailed orientated.  It's a great company to work for and I have worked with the same team members and manager for those 10+ years."
good,"A typical day includes a wealth of diversity in job responsibilities.  Reception, mail distribution, data base management, correspondence, ordering supplies, office space and vendor management."
good,"Felt confident in my work as well as co workers support, strong communication on a daily basis is/was very important. Problem solving was a group effort and I never felt like I couldn't handle everyday tasks or issues that would arise. The hours were long but the work was straightforward and attainable."
good,"I really enjoyed my week at Scripps learning what they do from receiving footage, editing it thoroughly to scheduling it to go on air. The area I most enjoyed was Editing as you got to see how everyone's individual workpieces got put together and finalized before on air."
good,Sales department has poor management. Company culture overall is great. Senior leadership ensures benefits and work-life balance are always above par.
good,"Good culture, the management has been adequate, it really depends on who your direct report is, and the teams tend to get along well together"
good,This is a good place to work. You can learn a lot at a fast pace. Advancement is super slow and positions aren't backfilled quickly.
good,I worked at Scripps Networks for over 10 years. It was a great place to work and the people I worked with were outstanding. Scripps was a growing company and recently was acquired by Discovery Communications.
good,"Very creative environment, supportive team, and diverse content. The company produces client-facing and interactive content and I love being involved in the process!"

good,Enjoyed working at Scripps. Enjoy the independence. Grew very tired of 7 nights per week. Lots of perks as far as being on your own. Bosses were very complimentary.
good,"A day of work that I was responsible for was to complete a daily promotional log. The daily promo consisted of 3 day parts that were crucial to the ratings for on-air. I had to make sure that advertising commitments were scheduled in there correct time periods, which included how many a day and the week and give a monthly report to show the number os spots."

It is an honor to have participated in the creation of a what has become a collection of very powerful cable programming brands. The same can be said for many other employees. The reasons so many people love working here is the leadership and culture.
